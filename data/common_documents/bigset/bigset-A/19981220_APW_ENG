 &UR; Bruins 4, Red Wings 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Boston, Ray Bourque had three assists to move past Gordie
Howe into third place on the all-time list with 1,052 as the Boston
Bruins beat the Detroit Red Wings.
	   The defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings suffered their
second straight defeat. They have three losses in their last four
games.
	   The win was the first for the Bruins at home over the Red Wings
since 1991, breaking a five-game losing streak.
	   Bourque helped set up goals by Sergei Samsonov in the second
period and then Darren Van Impe and Anson Carter in the third.
 &UR; Penguins 3, Capitals 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Tom Barrasso stopped 24 shots for his second
shutout of the season as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the slumping
Washington Capitals.
	   Barrasso got his 32nd career shutout and 19th with Pittsburgh as
the Penguins stretched the Capitals' skid to 2-8-0. The Penguins
have had four shutouts in 28 games this season with three different
goalies.
	   Jaromir Jagr, Alexei Morozov and Stu Barnes scored for
Pittsburgh.
 &UR; Panthers 3, Oilers 1
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Rob Niedermayer's goal snapped a 1-1 tie
and Sean Burke had 29 saves as the Florida Panthers defeated the
slumping Edmonton Oilers in the teams' only meeting of the season.
	   The Panthers (11-11-6) reached .500 for the first time since
they were 6-6-5 on Nov. 21.
	   Edmonton, which started the night in first place in the
Northwest Division, finished a seven-game road trip at 1-4-2 and
has won once in its last nine games.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 7, Rangers 4
	   In Toronto, the Maple Leafs beat the New York Rangers for the
first time in 10 games and spoiled Wayne Gretzky's final appearance
at Maple Leaf Gardens.
	   Derek King had two goals for the Maple Leafs while Alyn McCauley
had a four-point night, including a goal. Gretzky had two assists
on power plays to give him 77 points in 30 games at the fabled
arena and eight points in his last three games.
	   The Maple Leafs, 0-9-1 in their last 10 meetings with the
Rangers, will play their final game at the Gardens on Feb. 13 and
then open their new Air Canada Centre on Feb. 20.
 &UR; Devils 1, Canadiens 1
	   In Montreal, Turner Stevenson's goal late in the third period
lifted the struggling Montreal Canadiens to a tie with the New
Jersey Devils.
	   The Canadiens, who were coming off a 4-2 loss to Buffalo on
Friday night, are winless in their last nine games (0-5-4).
	   Stevenson salvaged the point for Montreal when he took a feed in
the slot from Patrick Poulin and fired a shot high past a screened
Martin Brodeur. The Devils took the lead on Vadim Sharifijanov's
second goal of the season midway through the second period.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Sabres 2
	   In Buffalo, New York, Trevor Kidd made 38 saves to help the
Carolina Hurricanes beat Buffalo and snap the Sabres' eight-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Ron Francis, Keith Primeau and Kevin Dineen each scored for
Carolina, which remained seven points ahead of second-place Florida
in the Southeast Division.
	   Miroslav Satan and Curtis Brown scored for Buffalo.
	   In losing for the first time in 11 home games, the Sabres were
victimized for more than two goals at home for the first time since
Boston won 5-4 on April 3.
 &UR; Blues 5, Kings 2
	   In St. Louis, Pavol Demitra had a goal and an assist and Craig
Conroy had three assists as the St. Louis Blues extended the road
woes of the Los Angeles Kings.
	   The Kings have dropped eight straight road games since beating
Vancouver 4-3 on Nov. 24. Los Angeles is 2-8 overall in its last 10
games.
	   With the Blues clinging to a one-goal lead, Demitra swatted home
the rebound of Todd Gill's shot 3:16 into the third period to make
it 3-1. Just 18 seconds later, Scott Young slapped a one-timer past
Los Angeles goalie Jamie Storr to put the game out of reach.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian soldiers on Sunday briefly
pointed their guns at separatist protesters as a United Nations
envoy left Indonesian-controlled East Timor after talks with local
leaders.
	   U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker said his discussions served as
groundwork ahead of a new round of peace talks early next year in
New York between Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former
colonial master.
	   ``We hope we can continue and advance this process,'' said
Marker, whose weekend visit was marked by noisy but peaceful
protests by about 2,000 activists, some of whom waved separatist
rebel flags.
	   There were a few tense moments when Marker climbed aboard an
army helicopter and Indonesian soldiers leveled their guns at
protesters who had gathered for his departure at the airport in
Dili, East Timor's seaside capital.
	   Activists also tore down part of an airport fence, but protest
organizers calmed the crowd. In a rare conciliatory gesture,
demonstrators who had shouted their contempt for the Indonesian
military later shook hands and prayed with the soldiers.
	   Marker's trip had heightened fears that rallies timed for his
arrival could trigger violence and jeopardize the negotiations.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.
	   Marker met Sunday morning with East Timor's Nobel laureate,
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, who had appealed in vain to
protesters to get off the streets to avoid the possibility of
clashes with Indonesian troops.
	   Marker, who last visited the half-island territory of 800,000
people in July, said he was satisfied with his meetings with pro-
and anti-independence figures. Belo did not comment.
	   Peace talks chaired by Marker were revitalized earlier this year
after Jakarta offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange
for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Jakarta's authority in
East Timor, which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a
year later.
	   Talks gained momentum after the ouster in May of authoritarian
President Suharto, who took a hard line on separatist movements in
the nation of 200 million people. His successor and onetime
protege, President B.J. Habibie, has promised nationwide political
reforms and has adopted a more conciliatory approach to East Timor.
	   However, sporadic fighting between guerrillas and the Indonesian
military persists. Many independence activists want a total
withdrawal of Indonesian troops, who have been accused of
widespread human rights abuses over the years.
	   Marker was scheduled to meet on Monday in Jakarta with Habibie
and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.

Finally, some pro basketball as players stage exhibition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Pro basketball was back on the
court and back on television, but the audience was limited even if
the effort sometimes wasn't.
	   In typical exhibition game style, it was more about showmanship
and razzle-dazzle than defense and teamwork. But it also was about
having fun, with locked out players finally getting a chance
Saturday night to expend some pent-up energy and perform before a
live crowd.
	   Tim Hardaway did his part, making five of his seven 3-pointers
and scoring 19 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to lead the
Red team back from a 17-point deficit as they beat the younger
White team 125-119.
	   Hardaway picked up MVP honors in voting conducted on-line
through a sponsor's website. Alonzo Mourning added 25 points.
	   ``If I had to play tomorrow, I'm ready,'' Hardaway said. ``It
was great, beautiful, getting the juices going before a crowd.''
	   More than half the seats were filled in the 12,000-seat Atlantic
City Convention Center, although many in the crowd seemed to have
found a way to score free or reduced-price tickets. A spokesman for
the convention center said 9,500 tickets had been sold and 500
given away.
	   ``It's a respectable crowd,'' agent David Falk said about 10
minutes before tipoff. ``I don't know if all the people who bought
tickets have shown up yet. The important thing is to raise plenty
of money for charity. That's what this game is all about.''
	   Falk was the main organizer for ``The Game on Showtime,'' which
was being scrutinized by some observers as an indication of whether
a new league would be viable. More exhibition games are likely if
the lockout forces the cancellation of the entire NBA season.
	   Playing in the cavernous, 70-year-old building that regularly
plays host to the Miss America pageant, the game had sort of a
minor-league feel to it despite the presence of so many superstar
players.
	   The players, 16 current and former All-Stars, received a decent
ovation when they took the court. Announcers for the Showtime cable
TV station and the public address announcer were prohibited from
saying their teams' nicknames or the letters ``NBA.''
	   The fans, like any pro basketball crowd, were most impressed by
the flashiest of plays, from Mourning swatting away a shot by
Dominique Wilkins to Wilkins coming back with an alley-oop dunk, or
Penny Hardaway feeding Mourning with a razzle-dazzle pass for an
emphatic slam, or Chris Webber executing a 360-degree spin for a
dunk, capping it with an open-handed slap of the backboard.
	   The players kept the mood light, too, especially the older
``red'' team as it was entertained by its coach, the humorous
Charles Barkley, during timeouts.
	   Barkley came up with plenty, too.
	   ``I don't want anybody to die here'' as he substituted for his
profusely perspiring players.
	   He also told one of the minor-league referees, who was sporting
a crew cut: ``Nice haircut. It'll come back into style one day.''
	   Shawn Kemp looked to be in the worst shape of the players,
carrying around what appeared to be an extra 15 pounds (6.75
kilos). Both he and Mitch Richmond sweated profusely after coming
off the layup line.
	   There were rusty touches on the court, too, such as Malone
fumbling the ball on his way to a fast-break slam and losing it out
of bounds, and Kemp shooting an airball on a foul shot.
	   ``It looks like they're a little out of shape, but their hearts
are in it,'' said Alan Postell, a 33-year-old fan from Baltimore.
``It reminds me of pickup ball.''
	   The crowd made up mostly of teen-agers did not seem to be overly
transfixed, with many of them wandering the aisles and jumping from
seat to seat more so than would be seen during a regular season NBA
game.

	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Swing bowler Simon Doull has been
included in a 13-man New Zealand cricket squad for the second test
against India starting at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Dec.
26.

China sends jailed dissident into exile ahead of other's trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with family confirming release, comments
from human rights group, report that Liu may have boarded a
Canadian Air flight; no pickup; ADDS byline
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China released an ailing labor rights campaigner
from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile
in the United States, family members said.
	   Although happy for Liu Nianchun's freedom, human rights groups
decried the Chinese government's decision as cynical. The most
prominent dissident left in China, Xu Wenli, goes on trial for
subversion Monday amid a three-week crackdown that has seen 30
people arrested or questioned for trying to set up an opposition
political party.
	   ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government for
this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, director of New
York-based Human Rights in China.
	   Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of
Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on an airplane,
ultimately bound for New York, his parents-in-law and brother said.
	   Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their
10-year-old daughter, the family said.
	   It was not immediately known which flight the family took. A
Hong Kong-based rights group said they flew on Northwest Airlines
for Detroit. His brother, the influential exiled democracy
campaigner Liu Qing, said the family may have taken Canadian Air.
	   Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used in
freeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997
and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released Liu on medical parole,
six months before the end of his prison term, provided he go into
exile, Liu Qing said.
	   Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.
In an exam authorities finally relented to providing last month,
doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels,
Liu Qing said.
	   Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Western
governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese leaders have
been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s,
finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidents
at home.
	   ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending
people directly from prison into exile is a type of human rights
violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in a telephone interview
from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.
	   Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the
fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2
years in prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way
China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.
	   Liu was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years. His last
arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights in
May 1995. Liu was never put on trial. Fourteen months passed before
his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his fate and whereabouts: a
three-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, far northeast.
	   His term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects
without trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence
by a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed was
fabricated.
	   Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to
protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle prods and confined
to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only
sit or stand.
	   His wife fearlessly endured police harassment, beatings and
detentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away and
hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N.
human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in
September.

Mayweather scores second-round TKO over Manfredy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Floyd Mayweather had little trouble Saturday night
in successfully defending his WBC super-featherweight title with a
second-round TKO over Angel Manfredy.
	   Mayweather's speed and power proved too difficult for Manfredy
to sustain in the scheduled 12-round bout at Miccosukee Indian
Gaming.
	   Midway through the second, Mayweather (19-0, 14 KOs) stunned
Manfredy with a right to the head. The punch enabled Mayweather to
unload with a serious of unanswered shots along the ropes.
	   As a defenseless Manfredy failed to counter any of Mayweather's
punches, referee Frank Santore stopped the bout at 2:47 of the
round.
	   ``I took my time and stayed focused,'' Mayweather said. ``It was
a good fight. If he wants to do it again, it's fine with me.''
	   Manfredy (24-3-1) protested Santore's decision, claiming none of
Mayweather's flurry of punches fazed him.
	   ``I wasn't hurt, it shouldn't have been stopped,'' said
Manfredy. ``Out of all those punches, he didn't even hit me once.''
	   The bout was Mayweather's first defense of the 130-pound
(58.5-kilo) title he won from Genaro Hernandez on Oct. 3.
	   Mayweather and Manfredy both weighed the super-featherweight
limit of 130 pounds (58.5 kilos) for Saturday's bout.
	   In another bout, David Tua rallied to score a stunning
10th-round technical knockout over previously unbeaten Hassim
Rahman of Baltimore to win the IBF Intercontinental and USBA
heavyweight titles.
	   Tua (33-1, 28 KOs) trailed on all three scorecards, 89-82
(twice) and 87-84 when he staggered Rahman with a left hook to the
chin at the bell to end the ninth round.
	   Tua, of Samoa, and now living in Totowa, New Jersey, continued
his assault early in the 10th, buckling Rahman's knees with
combinations to the head.
	   Rahman (29-1 ) tried to defend himself off the ropes with
desperate combinations, but referee Telis Assimenios felt Rahman
had absorbed too much punishment and stopped the bout at 35 seconds
of the round.
	   Rahman and his corner vehemently protested Assimenios' decision
and will file for a rematch with the International Boxing
Federation, which supervised the scheduled 12-round bout.

North Carolina 20, San Diego State 13

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ With strong winds grounding the passing game,
North Carolina got a spark from the feet of freshman quarterback
Ronald Curry to beat San Diego State 20-13 Saturday in the first
major college bowl game of the season.
	   Curry's 48-yard run for a touchdown on the last play of the
first quarter put the Tar Heels ahead for good in the Las Vegas
Bowl, and North Carolina overcame a late fumble by Anthony Saunders
to win a bowl game for the fourth straight season.
	   Keith Newman's interception of a pass tipped by Brandon Spoon on
the goal line with 59 seconds left in the game sealed the win for
the Tar Heels, who didn't score the entire second half.
	   Winds gusting to 48 mph (77 kph) raked Sam Boyd Stadium from the
opening kickoff, turning any attempt to pass the football into an
adventure.
	   North Carolina gained only 196 total yards and completed only
four passes, but used Curry's run followed by a punt block for a
touchdown to finish a season that began with three straight losses
on a winning note.
	   After a flurry of early scoring, the game settled into a
defensive struggle in the second half, with the Aztecs scoring the
only points of the half on a field goal by Nate Tandberg with 3:51
left in the game.
	   North Carolina (7-5) got the ball back and appeared to have the
game in hand when Saunders fumbled the ball on a carry up the
middle and Joseph Tuipala picked the ball up and ran it to the
North Carolina 22 with 1:29 left.
	   But, after getting a first down at the 11, Brian Russell threw a
pass across the middle that was tipped up in the air by Spoon and
into Newman's waiting hands.
	   Curry played only a total of four offensive series, but
accounted for North Carolina's only offensive touchdown and put the
team in position for one of its two field goals.
	   North Carolina's only other score came on a blocked punt by
Quinton Savage that David Bomar fell on in the end zone early in
the second quarter. The two-point conversion on a pass to Kory
Bailey in the corner of the end zone with 12:41 left in the second
quarter was the last score of the game by the Tar Heels.
	   Curry, a backup to senior Oscar Davenport, was the leading
rusher in the game, running 10 times for 93 yards.
	   Curry and Davenport combined to complete only four passes for 33
yards in the game, while Russell completed 10 of 22 but only for a
total of 99 yards.
	   San Diego State gambled after winning the opening coin flip,
electing to go into the wind with the hopes that having the wind at
their backs in the fourth quarter might be the deciding factor.
	   The gamble appeared to work after the Aztecs fumbled on the
second play of the game, only to have wide receiver Lonny Mitchell
pick up the loose ball and run 60 yards for a score.
	   But the Aztecs, playing in their first bowl game since 1991,
could manage only two field goals the remainder of the game as
North Carolina's defense and the wind combined to shut down the
passing game.
	   The game between the two unranked teams gave them identical 7-5
records after both began the season 0-3 and appeared unlikely to
make postseason play.

Cambodian mob riots over waste dumped from Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodians enraged over the
dumping of suspected toxic waste from Taiwan, unleashed their wrath
against officials and businessmen they believe are responsible by
stoning government offices and trashing a hotel on Sunday.
	   One port worker has died after cleaning the hold of the ship
which transported the waste, a port official said on Sunday.
Another villager is ill after rummaging through the waste looking
for empty sacks to store rice, his relatives said.
	   The Taiwanese company that sent the waste has said it is not
toxic, while admitting it contains traces of the chemical mercury.
Mercury can be highly poisonous in large amounts.
	   Cambodia's Prime Minister has said a way must be found to send
the waste back to Taiwan. His government has consistently refused
contracts to accept waste from other countries.
	   A mob of more than 300 people, demanding that the waste be
returned, marched on the port at Sihanoukville, 185 kilometers (115
miles) southwest of Phnom Penh, on Sunday morning.
	   They collected stones and hurled them at the customs and port
offices, shattering windows as they shouted epithets at government
officials they say are corrupt and allegedly accepted bribes to
allow the material to be imported.
	   Their fury unsated, they then moved on to the Camsap Hotel.
	   Although the hotel bears the same name as the company that
imported the waste, it's not clear if it's owned by the same
people.
	   Nonetheless, the mob stormed the building, breaking into rooms
and pitching televisions, refrigerators, tables, beds and
mattresses out the windows of the upper floors.
	   Protesters in front of the hotel set fire to the mattresses,
prompting a city fire brigade to rush to the scene. One
demonstrator was taken to a hospital after he was hit by a table
thrown from an upper floor.
	   Dozens of military police were present, but took no action
except to try and talk to mob leaders and convince them not to do
any more damage.
	   The mob was not soothed by government ministers from Phnom Penh
who have vowed to punish whoever was involved in bringing the waste
to Cambodia.
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng and the ministers of the environment
and finance were meeting with protest leaders in the early
afternoon, but the hotel was still occupied by members of the mob,
and others were marching back to the port.
	   ``The port and customs officials are corrupt. They took the
money, they took the bribe, and let the thing kill the people
here,'' said Phat Kim Huot, a 23-year-old demonstrator.
	   ``If anyone dies from it, they will be the first to die. Take
this waste out of here immediately,'' he said.
	   Main Men, chief engineer at Sihanoukville port, said someone
already had died.
	   Hospital officials said that a port worker named Pith Sovan had
died mysteriously from shock earlier this week and they could not
determine the cause.
	   Main Men said Pith Sovan had cleaned the hold of the ship that
contained the waste after it was removed.
	   The waste was dumped behind a police station about 10 kilometers
north of town, but only 100 meters (333 feet) from a cluster of
homes for 30 families.
	   On Sunday, city workers were using bulldozers and other heavy
equipment to build a cement dike around the bricks of dirt-colored
waste.

Australia supports halt of air strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government said Sunday
it supports the halt of air strikes by United States and British
forces against Iraq.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the government
was pleased that both the United States and British governments
believed that they had achieved their objective.
	   Downer said although the attacks were regrettable they were
necessary in preventing Iraq potentially creating weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We hope in the future Saddam Hussein and the government of
Iraq will adhere to international legal obligation and continue
with the dismantling of any weapons of mass destruction,'' Downer
said.

After Iran wins gold medal, Asia shifts eyes to World Cup
</HEADLINE>
controversy &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After awarding Iran the Asian Games
gold medal, the continent's top soccer officials returned their
focus Sunday to wresting more places for Asia in the next World Cup
and suggested a playoff with Africa for an extra spot.
	   Sheik Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, the powerful head of the Olympic
Council of Asia and the Kuwaiti soccer federation, said that one of
the five World Cup spots awarded to Africa could instead be played
off between Asia and Africa, with the winner qualifying.
	   ``We are ready to play Africa for their extra place to
qualify,'' the sheik said.
	   The sheik has been instrumental in rallying the Asian Football
Confederation to threaten an Asian boycott of the 2002 World Cup.
The confederation is demanding that the sport's world governing
authority, FIFA, increase the Asian-designated slots.
	   South Korea and Japan will automatically qualify as co-hosts,
the first time two nations have joined in staging soccer's most
prestigious tournament and taken up two reserved berths. FIFA is
leaving two more slots for Asia's 40-odd sides to compete for.
	   The Asians insist that their participation is being reduced. The
continent had three full places plus a half-spot, determined in a
playoff against Oceania, for this year's World Cup in France. They
say the reserved places given Japan and South Korea should not
count against the other Asian sides in 2002.
	   Iran, South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia played in this year's
World Cup. Africa had five sides. None of the African or Asian
teams reached the second round and critics say the level of their
soccer doesn't merit more places.
	   The Asian confederation is demanding a meeting with FIFA
President Sepp Blatter for early February to demand that Asia get
its half-space back. If unsuccessful, Asia is threatening to
boycott the Cup, though South Korea and Japan would still be
allowed to play as hosts.
	   Peter Velappan, general secretary of the confederation, said
that FIFA had never made technical skill a qualification criteria
in expanding the Cup to less represented zones.
	   ``I wish some FIFA technical people were here to watch these
games,'' Velappan said after Saturday's bruising Asian Cup final
between Iran and Kuwait. ``They would see how well Asian teams can
compete.''
	   Iran, which sent a side filled with World Cup players including
star striker Ali Daei, who had eight Asian Games goals, won its
second title in the regional Olympic-style event off a pair of
unanswered goals by Ahmed Karimi and Cup veteran Karim Bagheri.
	   The Kuwaitis were hindered by injuries that kept striker Jasem
al-Huwaidi on the bench and were unable to take advantage of a red
card handed to Iran's defender, Mehdi Madhavikia, late in the
match.
	   Madhavikia, raising his boot high during a running interception,
collided with midfielder Ahmad al-Mutairi. The Kuwaiti's arm was
broken but he was treated and able to fly home with his teammates
late Saturday, Kuwaiti sports officials said.
	   The soccer played by the original 23 teams during three weeks
was not always pretty. Lopsided scores of 15-0 and 11-0 were
recorded in the opening round before the weaker sides like Maldives
and Mongolia were weeded out.
	   But Velappan thought that the eight quarterfinalists _ Iran,
Kuwait, China, South Korea, Qatar, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and
host Thailand _ were all strong sides and could merit a World Cup
place.
	   Except for Iran and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, most of
the stronger nations sent youngish squads to gain international
experience for the 2000 Olympics, which will be limited to
under-23s.
	   Velappan said that the punishing Asian Games schedule _ eight
matches in 20 days for the finalists _ was ``not healthy'' for the
players and should be changed.

For Asian Games founder India, Bangkok seems resurrection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For Asian Games founder India, the
world's second most populous nation, the Bangkok games were
something of a resurrection.
	   Athletes from the nation of 980 million people are taking home
seven gold, 11 silver and 17 bronze medals _ and perhaps most
importantly India's first gold in men's field hockey in 32 years.
	   It was a significant improvement from India's 1994 performance
of four gold, three silver and 15 bronze, making it eighth in the
medal tally.
	   On the other hand, the Bangkok collection is smaller than that
of smaller countries like North Korea, 7-17-41; Taiwan, 19-17-41;
Kazakstan, 24-26-40, and host Thailand, 24-26-40.
	   China headed the standings with 129-78-67.
	   ``No doubt we can do better. Maybe we lack confidence and
conviction,'' said Gurdayal Singh Mander, head of India's
delegation to the games. ``But our performance here is surely an
improvement and this may give us chance to do better in future
games.''
	   The stars of India's modest achievement were the hockey team,
which beat defending champion South Korea 4-2 in a penalty shootout
for its first Asian Games field hockey gold since 1966.
	   But India's women's field hockey team lost to South Korea 2-1
and settled for a silver.
	   Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, a 29-year-old railroad official from the
eastern city of Calcutta, outsprinted China's Wang Qingfen to win
the women's 1,500. Sikdar added the women's 800 title to her gold
haul, finishing well ahead of teammate Rosa Kutty.
	   Dingko Singh, a 20-year-old navy officer who almost was left off
India's Asian Games boxing team because of squabbling among
officials, won his nation's first boxing gold since Kohhar Singh
took one in the 1982 games in New Delhi.
	   India won two golds in billiards. Ashok Shandilya, a railroad
officer from Bombay, beat world No. 2 and countryman Geet Sethi in
English billiards. Sethi and Shandilya also won a gold in billiards
doubles.
	   India's gold medal hope in women's weightlifting, Malleswari
Karnam, had to settle for a silver in the 63-kilogram division,
where China's Lei Li broke records for both the snatch and total
lift and finished 2.5 kilograms ahead of her.
	   India's performance in soccer was lackluster. Though it advanced
from the original field of 23 to the last 16, it lost to Uzbekistan
2-0.
	   India maintained its dominance in kabaddi, beating traditional
rival Pakistan 17-9 and ending with a perfect 6-0 record.
	   India was instrumental in organizing the first Asian Games, for
which it was host in 1951. That inaugural year it was second in the
medal tally _ after perennial high performer Japan _ with 15 gold,
18 silver and 19 bronze.
	   India has participated in every Asian Games since, one of only a
half-dozen nations to have done so. But its performance faltered as
more and more countries joined, bringing athletes from world, not
just regional powers.
	   India's showing at Hiroshima was also an improvement over 1990
in Beijing, when India was 11th in the medal tally with just one
gold, eight silver and 14 bronze.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Winners and losers at the 13th Asian
Games, which ended Sunday:
 &UR; WINNERS &QC; 
	   CHINA _ Although it slipped from 1994 in both overall gold
medals and percentage of medals won, China is still Asia's top
sports power. Even with declines in swimming and track, the Chinese
are becoming powers in other sports, like rowing and beach
volleyball. After some of its 1994 medals were drug-tainted, the
Chinese said they carried out extensive testing before these games
so prevent any repeat.
	   NAOKO TAKAHASHI, JAPAN _ The Japanese marathoner opened the
competition with probably the top performance of the games, the
fifth fastest women's marathon ever, winning by more than 13
minutes in Thailand's tropical heat.
	   SOUTH KOREAN FANS _ In every sport, they enlivened the stands
with organized cheering, flag-waving and drum-beating to support
their teams.
	   THAWATCHAI DAMRONG-ONGTRAKUL, THAILAND _ His golden goal in
sudden death extra time against South Korea made Thailand forget
about all its economic difficulties for two days until the team was
routed 3-0 in the semifinal by Kuwait.
	   KOJI ITO, JAPAN _ His 10.00 seconds for the 100 meters would be
respectable in an Olympic 100 final. He also won gold in the 200
and 4 x 100 relay, and was named the games' most valuable player.
	   THE OPENING PARADE OF ATHLETES _ A wide variety of uniforms,
fashions and cultures in which Sri Lanka's athletes, accompanied by

 &UR; LOSERS &QC; 
	   China _ No many how many medals it wins, it still has to fend
off questions about drug cases that have tainted its performances
as recently as the swimming World Champions in January 1998.
	   SUSANTIKA JAYASINGHE, SRI LANKA _ After coming in second in the
world championship 200, she arrived with great hopes for her
country. Her sudden withdrawal from the 100 final and quick return
home, citing injury, opened criticism that she was afraid of losing
to Chinese runners _ a suggestion she denied.
	   ANY FIGHTER AGAINST SAMLUCK KAMSING _ The Thai Olympic gold
medalist boxer had a whole nation cheering against his foes.
	   MALLESWARI KARNAM, INDIA _ She equaled two weightlifting world
records in the women's 63-kilogram division but lost to China's Lei
Li, who broke the world records for snatch and total lift. Chinese
women bettered world marks in every division.
	   SOUTH KOREAN THIRD-PLACERS _ South Koreans who finished third in
some bowling, archery and equestrian events were denied bronze
medals under a games rule that limits one country's medals in any
event to two. Organizers said the rule was intended to promote
harmony at the games. The Koreans protested that they wanted all
three medals in those events.

	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA (AP) _ Jesse Evans spotted it first
through the scope of his dad's Winchester rifle. Something small,
red, about 100 yards (meters) down the bear trail. A dead fox,
maybe.
	   Jesse and his best friend, George Conners, crept through the
black spruce forest for a closer look. In the moss, beside bear paw
prints, lay a neoprene mitten, teeth gouges on the cuff.
	   Jesse picked it up. It felt heavy. With his hunting knife, he
slit an ``X'' across the palm and peeled the mitten open.
	   Out tumbled sand _ and five fingers. A shiver ran up Jesse's
back.
	   ``There's ... there's a dead body around here somewhere,''
George stammered.
	   On Shuyak Island? The northernmost isle of Alaska's Kodiak
archipelago was inhabited by bears, deer, wolves and varmints. Not
humans. As far as the boys remembered, Jesse said later, there
hadn't been any storms or reports of overboard fishermen in these
waters all summer.
	   Where had this mitten come from?
	   Jesse poked inside it with his knife. He removed a thumbnail and
three dime-sized bits of skin, dropping each one inside an empty
tobacco tin.
	   Jesse, 17, and George, 16, had always dreamed of becoming
detectives. Now, on this August hunting trip, they had stumbled
onto a clue to a baffling, six-month mystery in the Gulf of Alaska.
It was the last piece to a tale of danger and struggle, of
desperation and courage, of great heroics in the face of nature's
remorseless power.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The seas are twice as high as the ship. They rise in huge gray
walls, their faces nearly vertical, their crests sheared off and
slung for miles (kilometers) by wicked gusts.
	   The ship labors up the waves, teeters at the top and plunges
down the backsides. On the steeper swells, when she can't get her
bow up in time, she plunges straight through the crests, launching
out the far side, water shooting out her scuppers.
	   The average windspeed is 60 knots (110 kph), spiking to twice
that. Visibility is 50 feet (15 meters) in blowing snow and sleet.
The wind-chill factor is 18 degrees Fahrenheit (-28 C) below zero;
spray freezes the moment it's airborne. The barometric pressure is
plunging a millibar an hour.
	   The air is so highly charged with electricity that radios and
navigational equipment are useless.
	   It is 6 p.m., Jan. 30, 1998, on the Fairweather Grounds in the
Gulf of Alaska. For the skipper and four-man crew of the La Conte,
a fishing vessel, it's the maw of meteorological hell.
	   All afternoon, the La Conte has pounded into headwinds and
building seas trying to make the nearest land, 80 miles (130
kilometers) eastward. In six hours, crew members will remember
later, she manages 3 miles (5 kilometers).
	   And the ship is leaking. Every hour, 2,200 gallons (8,330
liters) are pumped from her bilge, but the water keeps rising,
sloshing now just below the engine.
	   In the wheelhouse, Mark Morley, a burly skipper who is supposed
to celebrate his 36th birthday in 11 days, wrestles the spoked helm
and fights to keep his feet on the heaving deck. Every few minutes,
he leans forward to peer out at the storm gods through half-inch
(one-centimeter) Lexan windows caking with ice.
	   Wind is screaming through the wire stays. Hail hammers the
decks. Geysers of spray explode off the bow, coating the mast and
rigging a ghostly white.
	   Morley can't see them, but rogue waves are prowling out there,
merging, pulling apart, piling up on themselves. Some are as high
as 10-story buildings.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   In fishermen's lingo, the La Conte is a soft-chinned, western
rig. That means she has a rounded stern, a wide cross section and a
wheelhouse at the front of a raised midships section.
	   Built in 1919, she's 77 feet (23.4 meters) long and weighs 66
tons. Her hull is double-planked oak. In her belly sits a
365-horsepower diesel engine, which gives the La Conte speeds up to
12 knots (22 kph).
	   Her wheelhouse is outfitted with state-of-the-art electronics: a
Loran plotter, Global Positioning System for navigation, radar,
VHF-FM short-range radio, and float switches that sound when the
lower deck takes on too much water.
	   For emergencies she's equipped with five neoprene survival
suits, seven lifejackets and an Emergency Position Indicating Radio
Beacon _ EPIRB. About the size of a bowling pin, the EPIRB sits in
a plastic holster on the foredeck. It has a water-sensitive switch
that sends out a radio signal if the ship goes down. EPIRB signals
are automatically relayed by satellite to the U.S. Mission Control
Center in Suitland, Maryland.
	   The La Conte is also equipped with the best electric bilge
pumps, Morley told the crew a week earlier as they set sail from
Sitka for the 150-mile (240-kilometer) trip north to the
Fairweather Grounds. That's why the skipper didn't pay much mind to
the loose plank on the stern's hull, close to the water line, that
rattled to the touch of a mallet. The pumps can handle a slow leak
just fine.
	   The La Conte arrived at the grounds shortly after 3 a.m. on
Sunday, Jan. 25. Beneath an icy sky and aurora borealis, the crew _
Robert Doyle, William Mork, Mike Decapua and David Hanlon _ lowered
their longlines and got to work.

IN THE GULF OF ALASKA: to work.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   They'd pulled up only a few hundred pounds (kilograms) of
yelloweye when the seas began to build and the wind sheared
ominously in the rigging. At noon Monday, Morley decided to leave
the fishing gear in the water and make for Graves Harbor, 80 miles
(130 kilometers) southeast.
	   Safe in port, the crew spent two days cleaning the engine and
overhauling the bilge pumps as Morley, the captain, fussed about
the abandoned gear, the unused space in the fish holds, and his
fiancee, Tamara Westcott, at home in Sitka expecting a baby in
seven months.
	   He needed to put money away, not lose it on lousy fishing trips,
he told the crew. With two or three good sets, he could break even.
	   By late Wednesday afternoon, the winds eased a bit, but the seas
were still coughing up 10-foot (3-meter) swells. A low-pressure
system was cranking up all the way down Alaska's southeastern tail.
The forecast: 40-knot (74-kph) winds and 30-foot (9-meter) breakers
on the Fairweather Grounds within 24 hours.
	   Morley told the crew they were going back out to retrieve their
gear. With luck, he said, they might get some more fishing in.
	   The crew appeared nonchalant _ except for Hanlon, who had spent
34 years on the ocean and steered fishing vessels before he could
drive.
	   Hanlon was quiet, self-assured, slow to judge. The sea had kept
him simple. He let his sandy hair and mustache grow long, and he
stuck to jeans, sweatshirts and XtraTufs rubber boots. He'd had a
few girlfriends, never any kids. He had no car, no land address,
not even a post-office box.
	   One thing he held tight was a deep respect for the sea. ``She
demands attention,'' he once told his older brother, John. ``She's
not judgmental, but she has no forgiveness in her either.''
	   In commercial fishing, one of the most dangerous of professions,
it's not uncommon for mariners to leave ship suddenly after getting
a bad feeling about the sea, a vessel, the storm gods.
	   On Wednesday evening, Jan. 28, hours before the La Conte left
Graves Harbor, Hanlon got one of those premonitions and rang up his
brother, John, in Juneau. He wasn't home, but a nephew, James
Hudson Jr., answered.
	   ``She's not safe, Jimmy,'' Hudson remembers Hanlon saying. ``I
don't like her. This is going to be the last time I sail the La
Conte.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Now it's 6:15 Friday evening, and Morley is staring into the
teeth of the storm gods. So far, so good. The high-water alarm
below decks hasn't flashed.
	   Then one of those rogue waves hits.
	   It avalanches over them, burying the decks under tons of
flashing white broth. The ship hesitates; then slowly, heavily, the
La Conte rears out of the water like a submarine surfacing.
	   ``Skipper!''
	   Morley pulls himself up off the no-skids and focuses. The
battery-powered emergency lights flicker. Someone's standing in the
doorway, panting, dripping. It's Decapua, his deckhand.
	   ``We got jeopardy,'' Decapua says. Water is rising fast in the
engine room.
	   ``Pumps?''
	   ``Both out.''
	   Below decks, Robert Doyle is up to his shins in bone-numbing
water. Both electric bilge pumps have shorted out. The backup
gas-powered pump is too wet to start. Half the engine is
underwater. Doyle hears it gag, gurgle, cough.
	   The ship is losing her center of gravity and rocking wildly,
crew members will say later. Doyle gets tossed about and slammed
against a bulkhead.
	   Decapua bangs down the stairs, takes one look at the dead
engine, the water showering through the seams of the deck, then
sees Doyle, dazed, sitting in the water.
	   ``Bobby, get up! We gotta bail!''
	   Mork and Hanlon arrive and the four of them start a bucket
brigade. It comes in faster than they can bail. Within minutes it's
up to their thighs, then their chests. It's sloshing around their
necks when Morley appears in the hatch.
	   Wild-eyed.
	   ``Get outta there! We're going down!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``MAYDAY! MAYDAY!''
	   Morley huddles on the floor of the bridge, now a dark igloo. His
ship is powerless and drifting in the dark, taking huge seas over
her decks in the center of a powerful arctic storm. Below him, in
the galley, the crew is pulling on survival suits, preparing to
abandon ship.
	   Morley clutches the microphone, searching for a signal, a voice,
anything but the static coming over the VHF speaker.
	   ``MAYDAY! MAYDAY! This the F-V La Conte!''
	   Static.
	   His only link to the world is the EPIRB, the transmitter that
emits a satellite signal. Morley scrambles out on deck and shoves
it inside his suit.
	   Just then, a mountain of water rises over the stern. It hangs
there, then folds forward and crashes against the wheelhouse,
blowing out windows with the booms of shotguns.
	   In the galley, dishes, coffee mugs and spoons fly. Canned food
rockets across counters. The refrigerator rips out of the wall and
skids across the floor. The men go tumbling.
	   Doyle rolls over and sees whitewater bursting through the split
doors like a blast from a firehose.

<TEXT>
	   ``Up to the deck! Up to the deck!''
	   But how? The walls have become the floor; the ceiling is now a
wall. The La Conte is on her side, mast in the water.
	   Another lurch. The floor leaps up and everything is in free-fall
again, somersaulting end over end. The La Conte is righting
herself, lifting out of the sea like a prizefighter after a
knockdown.
	   ``Move! Move! Move!''
	   The men crawl along the floor, pelted by plates and cans. They
climb to the foredeck. The ship is lurching, listing hard to
starboard. Deck planks are buckling and flying off. The mast is
flailing wildly.
	   The boat keels on a swell and they throw themselves on the deck
to keep the wind from yanking them off. Spray rakes them like
grapeshot. Out of the blackness, Morley staggers over.
	   ``No life raft!'' he yells.
	   With all the high-tech equipment on board, the one thing they
need most isn't there. They look at each other.
	   Morley hands out pieces of rope. There's no time to panic or
complain. If they don't jump ship now, they'll be sucked down by
the vacuum of a 66-ton tomb making for the deep.
	   They wrap the 3-4 -inch (2-centimeter) rope around their waists,
make a loop at the belt. A separate rope is fed through each loop.
They're a human chain now; their fates are tied. Doyle attaches two
buoy floats, then the EPIRB, to the ends.
	   Like crabs, they claw up the icy, tilting deck to the gunwale on
the port bow. Each man throws a leg over the railing, takes a deep
breath ... and hesitates.
	   Below them is an ocean so dark that they can't tell the
difference between a wave and a trough.
	   ``WE GO IN TOGETHER!'' Morley shouts. ``ON THREE!''
	   They could fall 15 feet (5 meters) or 100 (30 meters).
	   ``ONE!''
	   They could jump in front of a breaking wave and be smashed
against the hull.
	   ``TWO!''
	   The ship lists, begins to roll.
	   ``NOW!''
	   Into the abyss they leap.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   At first, all Mork feels is the cold. It tightens on his temples
like a vise grip.
	   Gradually, the throbbing fades and it's all right. He's wrapped
in darkness, falling without end, hearing only the bump-bump of his
heart.
	   Mork doesn't know when he stops falling through the sea. It
seems a long time. But he remembers rising and bursting into a
deafening world, gulping air, and then going down again.
	   When Mork comes up the second time, he kicks his legs and fights
the water in a heavy-footed panic. Then he feels the collar on his
survival suit inflating and knows he will not drown.
	   The first thing he sees is the red-and-white flashing of the
strobe light on the EPIRB, illuminating flecks of flying, swirling
ice.
	   Carcasses of frigate birds, pieces of wood, a buoy float past
him. Several hundred yards off, he spots the La Conte.
	   Only the hull is visible. The seas are jumping up and down on
it, stomping it mercilessly. Then the ship disappears behind a
swell, and when the wave passes, she's gone.
	   A head pops through the foam _ spitting, gasping, hacking. It's
Hanlon. Morley, the skipper, pops out a few feet (meters) away,
then Decapua and Doyle.
	   ``Sound off!'' Morley shouts.
	   There's more water in the wind than air; it's like trying to
scream above the noise of a passing train while taking a shower.
	   Out of nowhere a landslide of water buries them, then another,
and countless others, sending them tumbling as if they're inside a
washing machine. The ropes tying them together begin to slip.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   At that moment, more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) away
outside Washington, D.C., a computer inside the U.S. Mission
Control Center is downloading an EPIRB signal from a COSPAS-SARSAT
satellite.
	   It's an urgent distress call from the Gulf of Alaska, latitude
N58-13.8, longitude W138-19.4. The computer would identify the ship
and its owner, except that this EPIRB was never registered with the
Coast Guard. Automatically, the computer relays the data to the
station closest to the emergency _ the Coast Guard's North Pacific
Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Juneau.
	   It's 7:02 on a Friday night in Juneau, and Lt. Steve Rutz and
Quartermaster Blake Kilbourne have the watch. They're sitting in
front of computer terminals, a pot of coffee warming beside them,
when the teletype starts spitting.
	   Kilbourne rips off the bulletin and scans it. No ID on the ship.
Maybe the computer is still working on it. He checks the
coordinates. Fairweather Grounds. Checks the printer again.
Nothing.
	   The Middleton Island weather station is reporting windspeeds
greater than 50 knots (92 kph), water temperature of 38 degrees
Fahrenheit (3.3 C). According to Coast Guard calculations, a
200-pound (90-kilogram) man in a survival suit has an 83 percent
chance of surviving 2.6 hours in these waters. A 51 percent chance
of lasting 4.7 hours.
	   That is, if wave heights remain below 25 feet (7.6 meters). A
data buoy outside Prince William Sound, 200 miles (320 kilometers)
northwest of the Fairweather grounds, is registering 30-foot
(9-meter) seas.
	   At 7:15 p.m., Kilbourne issues an Urgent Marine Information
Broadcast, asking any ship that's accidentally tripped an EPIRB to
radio the Coast Guard immediately.
	   Three minutes pass. Ten. A half hour. No response.
	   This one's for real.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ This story is based on interviews with 11 Coast
Guard helicopter flight crew members involved in the rescue; three
members of the ground crew; Coast Guard spokesmen in Juneau,
Alaska, and Martinsburg, West Virginia; the surviving crew members
of the La Conte; Jesse Evans, who found the remains on Shuyak
Island; the two Alaska state troopers who recovered the remains;
and two forensics experts at the Alaska State Medical Examiner's
Office in Anchorage. The story also draws from the 523-page record
of the Coast Guard's inquest into the sinking of the La Conte.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Mark Bureau, Daniel McGillis and Colin
Forbes scored goals and John Vanbiesbrouck made 23 saves as the
Philadelphia Flyers beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 Saturday.
	   Tony Amonte, who leads the NHL with 22 goals, scored for the
Blackhawks with a slap shot from just inside the blue line with
3:36 left.
	   Philadelphia, which is unbeaten in seven games (5-0-2) against
Western Conference teams, played a tenacious defensive game while
outshooting the Blackhawks 16-5 in the second period and 40-24 for
the game.
 &UR; Bruins 4, Red Wings 1
	   In Boston, Ray Bourque had three assists to move past Gordie
Howe into third place on the all-time list with 1,052 as the Boston
Bruins beat the Detroit Red Wings.
	   The defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings suffered their
second straight defeat. They have three losses in their last four
games.
	   The win was the first for the Bruins at home over the Red Wings
since 1991, breaking a five-game losing streak.
	   Bourque helped set up goals by Sergei Samsonov in the second
period and then Darren Van Impe and Anson Carter in the third.
 &UR; Penguins 3, Capitals 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Tom Barrasso stopped 24 shots for his second
shutout of the season as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the slumping
Washington Capitals.
	   Barrasso got his 32nd career shutout and 19th with Pittsburgh as
the Penguins stretched the Capitals' skid to 2-8-0. The Penguins
have had four shutouts in 28 games this season with three different
goalies.
	   Jaromir Jagr, Alexei Morozov and Stu Barnes scored for
Pittsburgh.
 &UR; Panthers 3, Oilers 1
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Rob Niedermayer's goal snapped a 1-1 tie
and Sean Burke had 29 saves as the Florida Panthers defeated the
slumping Edmonton Oilers in the teams' only meeting of the season.
	   The Panthers (11-11-6) reached .500 for the first time since
they were 6-6-5 on Nov. 21.
	   Edmonton, which started the night in first place in the
Northwest Division, finished a seven-game road trip at 1-4-2 and
has won once in its last nine games.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 7, Rangers 4
	   In Toronto, the Maple Leafs beat the New York Rangers for the
first time in 10 games and spoiled Wayne Gretzky's final appearance
at Maple Leaf Gardens.
	   Derek King had two goals for the Maple Leafs while Alyn McCauley
had a four-point night, including a goal. Gretzky had two assists
on power plays to give him 77 points in 30 games at the fabled
arena and eight points in his last three games.
	   The Maple Leafs, 0-9-1 in their last 10 meetings with the
Rangers, will play their final game at the Gardens on Feb. 13 and
then open their new Air Canada Centre on Feb. 20.
 &UR; Devils 1, Canadiens 1
	   In Montreal, Turner Stevenson's goal late in the third period
lifted the struggling Montreal Canadiens to a tie with the New
Jersey Devils.
	   The Canadiens, who were coming off a 4-2 loss to Buffalo on
Friday night, are winless in their last nine games (0-5-4).
	   Stevenson salvaged the point for Montreal when he took a feed in
the slot from Patrick Poulin and fired a shot high past a screened
Martin Brodeur. The Devils took the lead on Vadim Sharifijanov's
second goal of the season midway through the second period.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Sabres 2
	   In Buffalo, New York, Trevor Kidd made 38 saves to help the
Carolina Hurricanes beat Buffalo and snap the Sabres' eight-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Ron Francis, Keith Primeau and Kevin Dineen each scored for
Carolina, which remained seven points ahead of second-place Florida
in the Southeast Division.
	   Miroslav Satan and Curtis Brown scored for Buffalo.
	   In losing for the first time in 11 home games, the Sabres were
victimized for more than two goals at home for the first time since
Boston won 5-4 on April 3.
 &UR; Blues 5, Kings 2
	   In St. Louis, Pavol Demitra had a goal and an assist and Craig
Conroy had three assists as the St. Louis Blues extended the road
woes of the Los Angeles Kings.
	   The Kings have dropped eight straight road games since beating
Vancouver 4-3 on Nov. 24. Los Angeles is 2-8 overall in its last 10
games.
	   With the Blues clinging to a one-goal lead, Demitra swatted home
the rebound of Todd Gill's shot 3:16 into the third period to make
it 3-1. Just 18 seconds later, Scott Young slapped a one-timer past
Los Angeles goalie Jamie Storr to put the game out of reach.
 &UR; Predators 6, Canucks 4
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia _ Sergei Krivokrasov and
Sebastien Bordeleau had two goals and two assists each as Nashville
overcame a two-goal deficit and Markus Naslund's penalty-shot goal
to beat Vancouver.
	   Andrew Brunette and Denny Lambert added a goal and an assist
apiece as the expansion Predators set a franchise high for most
goals scored. Nashville's previous high was five goals in a 5-4 win
over Vancouver on Oct. 27.
	   The win snapped Nashville's three-game winless streak (0-2-1)
and was only the team's second victory in its last nine games
(2-5-2).
 &UR; San Jose 2, Colorado 1
	   In San Jose, California, Dave Lowry and Joe Murphy scored in the
first period as the San Jose Sharks beat the Colorado Avalanche.
	   Lowry scored at 5:31 when he picked up a deflected shot and
scored from eight feet out on the left. Murphy scored his seventh
at 13:04 on a shot from the left circle.
	   Sharks goaltender Mike Vernon stopped 17 of the Colorado shots,
allowing only a goal by Shean Donovan in the second period.

<TEXT>
	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA (AP) _ At liftoff, windspeed is 25 knots
(46 kph). No sweat, Lt. William Adickes says to himself. He's flown
helicopters for 15 years. He won a medal for saving fishermen in a
storm. He's trained to fly in 30-knot (55 kph) winds.
	   But as he rises from the Coast Guard air base in Sitka, Alaska,
and swings the H-60 Jayhawk helicopter around Edgecumbe Mountain,
they get swatted by a 40-knot (74 kpm) gust. The anemometer jumps
to 35, 45, 55. Within minutes, winds are hitting 70 knots (129
kph).
	   The wind shear keeps spiking the helicopter downward and making
its tail slew about.
	   ``Jesus,'' he says, ``how bad is this going to get?''
	   With his crash helmet rapping on the ceiling, he will say later,
it feels like he's sitting on a jackhammer.
	   On the ground, Lt. Glen Jones, the watch captain, starts calling
in reserves. Those boys, he thinks, are flying into trouble.
	   It's 7:52 p.m., Jan. 30, 1998, and the airbase is on red alert.
Fifty minutes earlier, the Coast Guard received a satellite-relayed
distress signal originating from the Fairweather Grounds.
	   Adickes and his three-man crew have no idea what type of ship is
in trouble. They don't know if anyone is overboard or for how long.
And they can only guess how bad the weather is out there.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   In the jaws of the storm, 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Sitka,
five fishermen in neoprene survival suits are bobbing in 80-foot
(24-meter) seas. They're gasping for air, throwing up salt water.
Their boat, the La Conte, is at the bottom of the ocean.
	   It's so dark, the survivors will remember later, that they can't
see their hands.
	   The skipper, Mark Morley, yells again, weakly: ``Sound off!''
	   Everyone responds but David Hanlon.
	   ``DAAAVE!''
	   ``Help!'' Hanlon's voice is faint. ``I can't keep my head up!''
	   Hanlon's survival suit is too big for him and its inflatable
collar has failed to fill with air. He's swallowing water, losing
consciousness. William Mork grabs Hanlon under the armpits and
pulls him up so that his head rests on Mork's chest.
	   Mike Decapua is taking the waves blind; in his haste to zip his
hood, his long hair flopped over his eyes.
	   Morley is in bigger trouble: He bounced off the hull jumping
ship and tore a hole in his suit below the right knee. The
38-degree Fahrenheit (3.3 C) water is getting inside. He's shaking,
jerking.
	   Robert Doyle wraps his arms and legs around Morley.
	   ``Bobby,'' the skipper says. ``I ain't gonna make it.''
	   Doyle turns the talk to children. Time at sea has split up his
marriage, but he has two boys. Morley says he's going to be a
father in seven months. He plans on marrying his fiancee this
summer. Can't wait to see his child.
	   A wave, snarling and foaming at the lip, is standing over them.
The last thing Doyle remembers seeing before it hits is its barrel,
big enough to park a Winnebago recreational vehicle in.
	   Doyle pops up first, followed by Morley, Mork, Decapua.
	   Where's Hanlon?
	   ``Dave?''
	   No response.
	   ``DAAAVE!''
	   Later, the survivors won't be sure how long they kept calling
his name.
	   Mork asks the question on all their minds. ``Are the Coasties
coming, Bob?''
	   ``Sure they are,'' says Doyle, who spent 12 years in the Coast
Guard.
	   Huddled, heads bowed, they pray aloud. Then another comber
barrels toward them. They turn their faces away and take it.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Snow and sleet glaze the windscreen of the Jayhawk. Even with
his night vision goggles, Lt. Dan Molthen, the co-pilot, can't make
out the ragged ocean from 700 feet (200 meters).
	   Adickes switches on his direction-finder, hoping to pick up a
hit from the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon, or EPIRB,
the distress signal beaming from the Fairweather Grounds. He tries
to raise Sitka base on his radio. Static.
	   They're on their own, flying through white out into the mouth of
a powerful arctic storm.
	   The H-60 Jayhawk is the Coast Guard's most sophisticated
helicopter. Powered by twin 1,980-horsepower engines, it can cruise
at 140 knots (258 kph) and hit ``dash'' speeds of 180 knots (331
kph). It can fly 300 miles (480 kilometers) offshore, hover 45
minutes and return with a safe fuel reserve. Its computer can fly
and land the aircraft, and its Global Positioning System can
receive data simultaneously from four satellites, making navigation
a snap.
	   That is, under normal conditions.
	   The helicopter bounces from 1,800 feet (550 meters) to 900 feet
(270 meters) to 1,500 feet (460 meters) to 800 feet (240 meters) _
in 15 seconds. Adickes tries to find clear air, climbing as high as
4,000 feet (1,200 meters), but it does no good.
	   Fifty minutes into the flight, the direction-finder detects a
weak signal from the EPIRB. The trouble, whatever it is, must be
just below.
	   Adickes does a 180-degree spin, turning his nose straight into
the headwind. At that moment, he will say later, he feels the full
force of the storm. Each gust is a giant hand shoving them
backwards.
	   The helicopter shudders. Its nose lifts and pitches. Piloting
becomes a matter of brute strength. Adickes and Molthen seize the
joysticks with both hands. The Jayhawk had roared past the EPIRB in
a half-second. With engines at full power, it takes 25 minutes to
crawl back to it.

<TEXT>
	   Sean Whitherspoon, the flight engineer, throws open the jump
door to a blast of snow and ice. Molthen flips on the floodlights,
which throw cones of light down from the aircraft's belly.
	   Below, the fishermen are looking for a sign of hope.
	   Doyle spots it _ a bright flashlight in the sky.
	   ``HEEEY!'' He waves, his arm feeling like it's got a 50-pound
(23-kilogram) weight attached to it.
	   From above, Whitherspoon spots silvery flashes _ the reflective
tape of survival suits.
	   Molthen's skin crawls at the thought of how cold those people
must be. He's trying to approach zero airspeed, establish a
100-foot (30-meter) hover above them.
	   But everything is jumping around the cockpit: Binoculars, flight
manuals, maps. The dials on the instrument panel are a blur.
	   The few times the aircraft steadies and Molthen can read them,
the instruments make no sense, he will say later. The altimeters
tell him his altitude is zero, then 100 feet (30 meters), 20 feet
(6 meters), 110 feet (36 meters).
	   Out the spotters' window, swells and sky coalesce into one black
mass. Vertigo makes Molthen vomit into his lap.
	   Whitherspoon and Richard Sansone, the crew's rescue swimmer,
heave out three saltwater-activated flares. They'll burn for 20
minutes, providing reference points in the darkness.
	   And then it hits.
	   A wicked gust, upwards of 120 knots, sledgehammers the
helicopter. When Adickes regains control, the 21,000-pound
(9,525-kilogram) aircraft has been blown backward a half mile (800
meters).
	   Whitherspoon peels himself off the rear wall, looks out the jump
door and gasps. Swells are cresting 5 feet (1.5 meters) below the
belly of the helicopter.
	   If a wave catches the tail, the Jayhawk will spin into the sea
and sink.
	   ``UP! UP! UP!''
	   Adickes and Molthen pull the joysticks as far as they'll go and
the aircraft lurches skyward.
	   Fifteen minutes of bucking and pitching, and the Jayhawk is
again above the flares. There's no way Adickes is putting his
swimmer, Sansone, in the water, so he tries lowering the rescue
basket.
	   Whitherspoon pays out the steel cable and stares in shock as the
40-pound (18-kilogram) basket gets whisked backward at a 45-degree
angle.
	   Adickes and Molthen peer out at the flares, rising and falling
on the swells. Suddenly, one flare disappears. The pilots figure
it's slipped behind a wave. They're wrong. It is riding crest of a
huge wave now looming over the helicopter.
	   The men in the water see exactly what's happening.
	   They're behind the flare, bobbing on the crest of the
mountainous wave, looking down in horror at the rotor blades of the
helicopter spinning below them.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ This story is based on interviews with 11 Coast
Guard helicopter flight crew members involved in the rescue; three
members of the ground crew; Coast Guard spokesmen in Juneau,
Alaska, and Martinsburg, West Virginia; the surviving crew members
of the La Conte; Jesse Evans, who found the remains on Shuyak
Island; the two Alaska state troopers who recovered the remains;
and two forensics experts at the Alaska State Medical Examiner's
Office in Anchorage. The story also draws from the 523-page record
of the Coast Guard's inquest into the sinking of the La Conte.

	   This is the second part of a five-day serial. The story so far:
	   Two teen-agers hunting on an uninhabited island in the Gulf of
Alaska have made a grisly discovery: a mitten containing five
fingers. What they have stumbled on is the final clue to a
six-month-old mystery. It all began when the fishing vessel La
Conte broke up in mountainous seas on the Fairweather Grounds 150
miles (240 kilometers) north of Sitka, Alaska. Without a lifeboat,
the five crewmen were left bobbing in the bone-chilling sea. Their
only hope: the radio signal beaming from a device that was
triggered automatically when the ship went down. Alerted by the
signal, the Coast Guard is swinging into action.

Carrier commander: Iraq monitoring flights to resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq, US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Flights to monitor the ``no-fly
zone'' in southern Iraq were being prepared Sunday just hours after
airstrikes were called off, said the commander of the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The quick resumption of the surveillance flights will also
provide an opportunity for a more complete picture of the damage
from four nights of U.S. and British attacks, said Rear Adm. J.
Cutler Dawson Jr.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, it's still in effect: the
prohibitions and sanctions'' on Iraq, including the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq, Dawson said.
	   The United States, Britain and France set up the no-fly zone
over southern Iraq in 1992 to protect the area's Shiite Muslims
from the Iraqi government after a failed uprising following the
1991 Gulf War. The Western allies patrol the airspace to prevent
Iraq from flying over the area.
	   Dawson declined to specify the targets hit by rockets and
Tomahawk cruise missiles. But he noted that no sites were near
medical centers or other large civilian buildings _ countering
claims by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government that
hospitals sustained damage during the barrage.
	   ``I can tell you that the targets we had, there were no
hospitals in the vicinity. And in our assessment ... I saw no
evidence of any (civilian) collateral damage,'' he said.
	   Dawson conceded, however, that some sites could have been struck
by fragments of cruise missiles hit by Iraqi air defenses. In
Washington, U.S. military officials said there was almost no
response to aircraft from Iraqi air defense units, but there had
been reports of some shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles being
launched.
	   The Enterprise and the seven vessels in its battle group moved
farther from Iraq and into the southern Gulf on Sunday, after
leading the attacks since airstrikes were called late Wednesday. It
was joined in the Gulf on Saturday by another flotilla led by the
carrier USS Carl Vinson.
	   Planes from the Vinson took part in the last wave of attacks,
Dawson said.
	   In total, more than 300 attack missions were launched from the
Enterprise battle group _ about half of the total airstrikes from
U.S. and British forces. Also, more than 325 cruise missiles were
fired during the operation, Dawson said.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft fire continued on the final night of the
attacks, but no warplanes were hit. There also were no signs of
Iraqi warplanes during the raids, Dawson said.
	   ``There has not been a scratch, dent, whiff or a bit of damage
to our aircraft,'' said Dawson.
	   If attacks were ordered to resume, Dawson said warplanes could
be put in the air ``within minutes.''

China's recipe for sports success: train 'em young, hard and in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - Chinese Olympian Huang Liping was just
7 when a coach determined his destiny.
	   Scouting for future gymnasts, the coach lined up Huang and his
schoolmates and picked those with promising physiques. Huang and
another boy were the only two chosen.
	   ``He looked at my arms, my feet,'' said Huang. ``He went round
and round the class, then spoke to the teacher and the teacher
said: `Right, you and you.'''
	   From there, years of state-sponsored training brought Huang
Olympic and World Championship medals. He retired after the Atlanta
Games in 1996. But at the Asian Games that ended Sunday, China
continued its medal-winning ways, highlighting its sports machine's
ability to pick and train athletes young, hard and in volume.
	   China won 129 golds, far ahead of second-place South Korea with
65. The Chinese swept all 11 Asian Games rowing golds. They won six
of seven table tennis golds. They also took the most track and
field golds.
	   In weightlifting, diving and gymnastics, all sports where China
prepares athletes from young ages, the Chinese looked untouchable.
In diving, China took all four golds and all four silvers, and
unveiled a new 14-year-old star, Li Na. In gymnastics, China took
gold in 12 of 14 events. In weightlifting, China's women swept all
the gold for the third games in a row and broke world records on
seven consecutive days, thanks to lifters like Liu Xiuhua.
	   The petite 24-year-old, whose new 83.5-kilogram snatch record
was close to twice her body weight, was picked at age 13 by a coach
who ``thought I was physically suited to weightlifting,'' she said.
	   Now, weightlifting ``counts as my job,'' said Liu, who trains
three to four hours a day, five or six days a week.
	   Back in China, many top athletes are paid and housed by the
state, or cared for in state-run sports schools. Once picked for
top teams, promising young talents are trained without charge for
them or their parents. It's a system that enables China to churn
out athletes in big numbers, and shift smoothly from one generation
of athletes to another.
	   The national women's weightlifting team, for instance, numbers
some 40 athletes. That allowed China to field one top-class team of
lifters at last month's World Championships, where its women took
13 golds, and another fresh team of record-breakers at the Asian
Games.
	   When China lost Lu Yufu, a vault specialist, to injury before
the Asian Games gymnastics competition started, coaches quickly
found a replacement. Underscoring its depth, two of China's gold
medalists in men's individual gymnastics disciplines, Yang Wei and
Xing Aowei, were newcomers.
	   The 16-year-old Xing, who won pommel horse gold, looked to have
the makings of a future star. His graceful, relaxed movements
``make people feel as if they are being taken to the stars,'' said
head Chinese coach Qian Kui.
	   But China's Asian Games were not without setbacks. In the pool,
China took second place to Japan in golds. China's total of 15
track and field golds was seven less than at the last games in
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. China was shut out in long and middle
distance events. Noticeably absent were runners trained by
flamboyant coach Ma Junren, whose team was not included because it
did not take part in qualifying events.
	   China's Asian Games delegation head, Yuan Weimin, said Sunday
that overall he was ``basically satisfied, but not totally
satisfied'' with China's showing.
	   As for China's sports system, Yuan said not enough money was
going into sports and that more support was needed from
non-government sources. There was some evidence of private funding
at Bangkok: the Chinese women's diving team and men's gymnastics
team were sponsored by Longines, the watchmakers.
	   At Bangkok, China's fight against doping also appeared to be
bearing fruit. As of Sunday, no Chinese athlete was known to have
tested positive for banned substances. At the last games, 11
Chinese were found to have used drugs.
	   Chinese coaches, however, angrily denied that China's weaker
showing in some events at Bangkok showed that their successes in
previous games must had been due to doping.
	   ``If a Chinese swims fast it's drugs, if a Chinese swims slowly,
no drugs,'' said Zhang Xiong, the swim coach. ``It's not fair.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill
Clinton made headlines around the world Sunday, though most foreign
governments officially remained mum on the political turmoil in the
United States.
	   Many papers in Asia splashed front page headlines in Sunday
morning editions about the impeachment vote against Clinton by the
U.S. House of Representatives.
	   The lower house of the U.S. Congress impeached Clinton on
Saturday for obstructing justice and lying under oath about his
sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky, voting largely along party lines
to send his case to the Senate.
	   ``Clinton impeached for perjury,'' read a banner headline in
Hong Kong's English-language Sunday Morning Post. The Standard,
another English-language paper, said ``House impeaches Clinton.''
	   The territory's Chinese-language press also played up the news.
The Oriental Daily News, one of the two largest mass-circulation
Chinese-language papers, devoted its entire front page to the
story.
	   Two Chinese Communist Party-backed papers stuck with wire
stories and carried no official commentaries, however.
	   Malaysia's two leading English-language newspapers gave page one
treatment to Clinton's impeachment with headlines that read
``Impeached!''
	   The Clinton administration has a mixed reputation in Malaysia,
where the recent U.S.-led bombing of Iraq has been strongly
denounced. Remarks by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in support of
Malaysia's political opposition during a recent trip to the
Southeast Asian nation also rankled many Malaysians.
	   The actual House of Representatives vote came too late to be
carried in morning editions in Japan, but many newspapers ran
stories saying American lawmakers were almost certain to approve at
least one article of impeachment.
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's largest daily, ran a headline noting
Clinton would likely be only the second U.S. President to lose an
impeachment vote and that it would be the first case in 130 years.
	   Meanwhile, in Europe, British newspapers divided along political
lines, with left-wing papers attacking Republicans and conservative
papers demanding Clinton's resignation and replacement by
Vice-President Gore.
	   ``It's time to show Bill the door and say hello to Gore,'' said
an editorial in Britain's biggest selling tabloid, the News of the
World, which is owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
	   The Observer, a left-wing broadsheet, said impeachment was ``a
tragedy for the U.S. and the world,'' but sympathized with
Democrats who believed that the vote was ``an attempted
constitutional coup d'etat by the Republicans.''
	   The British Broadcasting Corp. World Service TV and the Sky TV,
Britain's two satellite TV news services, both led their news
bulletins with running coverage of the impeachment vote,
interspersing coverage with pictures from Baghdad under a fourth
night of U.S. and British air strikes.
	   Saying that the vote was an internal affair of the U.S., British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Clinton's strongest foreign ally, said
he would not comment on the impeachment proceedings.
	   ``That's not right for me to do so,'' Blair said at a news
conference Saturday.
	   The London-based Middle East Broadcasting Corp., which
broadcasts in Arabic throughout the Middle East, ran the story of
Clinton's impeachment second after the latest reports from Iraq.
	   A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige from
the scandal fallout, while a senior aid to Israel's prime minister
was quoted as saying the impeachment vote would likely have little
influence on the Middle East peace process.
	   Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner
Morgenpost daily newspaper, said in a Sunday editorial that the
Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United
States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.
	   In Israel, David Bar-Illan, aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said: ``Until now, none of this domestic embroilment has
affected the administration's involvement in the peace process and
we don't expect it to now.''
	   On Friday in Iraq, Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath
Party, headlined its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica,''
and said that the air strikes aimed to deflect attention from
Clinton's political problems at home and his relationship with the
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.

Japan welcomes end of attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan welcomed the end of United States and British
air strikes on Iraq Sunday and again urged Saddam Hussein's
government to open his country to U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``Japan welcomes the announcements...that the governments of the
United States and Britain have achieved their mission and halted
the use of their military force against Iraq,'' Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura said in a statement.
	   The U.S. and Britain ended air strikes against Iraq after a
fourth day of attacks on Saturday, saying their forces had
inflicted ``significant damage'' to Iraq's military establishment.
	   Japan, which supported the U.S.-led bombings, urged Iraq to
``immediately and unconditionally'' comply with U.N. treaties and
cooperate with arms inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission.
	   Japan also said it ``strongly hopes the plight if the Iraqi
people will be alleviated as soon as possible.''

Round two begins in violence-plagued St. Petersburg election

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A second round of voting for a
city council began Sunday in an election marred by violence and a
high-profile political assassination.
	   The vote is considered key for Russia's democratic politicians,
whose popularity has been dented by the country's roiling economic
crisis. Just six of 50 seats were decided in the first round two
weeks ago.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
other reform-minded parties still in the running in the second
round of the race.
	   A total of 88 candidates are running for the remaining 44 seats.
	   Many see the vote as a first battle in a long political season
leading to national parliamentary elections next year and elections
to replace President Boris Yeltsin in 2000.
	   At stake is not just leadership of the northern port, but also
control over millions of dollars worth of privatization and budget
revenues in the city. St. Petersburg is Russia's second largest
city and a traditional stronghold of support for the country's
democrats.
	   The election was also considered important because the municipal
legislature has been given enhanced powers under a new city
charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city affairs than
similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Intrigue and violence blighted the run-up to Sunday's balloting.
One candidate was beaten with metal rods. A gunman shot out the
windows of a city council member's apartment with an assault rifle.
Observers reported vote-buying, in exchange for money or vodka.
	   The most shocking violence came on Nov. 20, when unidentified
gunmen shot and killed the city's top democratic politician, Galina
Starovoitova. An aide was critically wounded in the attack.
	   Starovoitova's assassination galvanized St. Petersburg. Turnout
for the first round was twice as large as expected and democratic
candidates seem poised to win a majority in the city council as a
result.
	   ``The killing has elevated this to a higher level,'' said Leonid
Kesselman, a sociologist and political columnist. ``It's no longer
about local elections, but a symbol of what will begin in Russia
next year.''
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have also claimed the
lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a
prominent banker.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear if it would affect Sunday's balloting.
	   Some 5,000 policemen were deployed to ensure security at the
city's 1,483 polling stations in 44 regions, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Election officials predicted that voter turnout would probably
be less than the 40.5 percent who voted in the first round.
Preliminary results were expected early Monday.

China offers to help resolve weapons inspections dispute in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After condemning the United States for launching
military strikes on Iraq, China offered Sunday to help find a
diplomatic solution to the controversial U.N. weapons inspections
at the heart of the crisis.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao welcomed the decision by
the U.S. and Britain to end the air assault and stressed China's
continued opposition to such raids.
	   ``We have taken note of the fact that with the call of relevant
parties, the United States and Britain ceased their air strikes
against Iraq,'' Zhu said in a statement carried by the official
Xinhua News Agency.
	   China was ready to work with all interested parties on the
weapons inspections, Zhu said.
	   Iraq vowed Saturday not to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors.
China's vague statement left in doubt whether it supported full and
unfettered resumption of the inspections.
	   Under the terms that ended the Gulf War, the inspectors need to
certify Iraq has dismantled its chemical and biological weapons
programs before the U.N. Security Council can lift punishing
economic sanctions.
	   China wants the sanctions lifted as soon as possible, partly to
counter the U.S. presence in the region and partly to use the
goodwill it has shown Baghdad to secure oil supplies.
	   Beijing criticized the U.N.'s chief inspector, Richard Butler,
last week for disregarding Iraqi progress in a report he gave to
the Security Council. Washington cited Butler's assessment to the
U.N. Security Council as justification for the four days of
punishing air attacks.
	   The latest crisis over Iraq has given China's Communist Party
leadership, often consumed by domestic policies, a chance to engage
in uncharacteristically high-level diplomacy.
	   Party leader and President Jiang Zemin sent a personal message
to U.S. President Clinton on Thursday urging an end to the attacks.
Jiang and Russian President Boris Yeltsin conferred on the phone to
reaffirm their governments' opposition to the U.S.-led air strikes.

<TEXT>
	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA (AP) _ Lt. Glen Jones is worried, and he
should be. The Jayhawk helicopter he sent from Sitka station at 8
p.m. hasn't been heard from since it penetrated the southern edge
of the storm. That was almost an hour ago.
	   The watch captain knows he won't be getting any help soon from
the C-130 search-and-rescue planes at Kodiak station, the Coast
Guard's biggest, on the other side of the Gulf of Alaska. That air
base is buried under an avalanche of snow.
	   So he's called in a crew that has already worked a full day to
fly another Jayhawk out to the Fairweather Grounds: Lt. Cmdr. David
Durham, the pilot; co-pilot Lt. Russell Zullick; flight mechanic
Chris Windnagle; and rescue swimmer A.J. Thompson.
	   This group has a more difficult mission than the first. The
signal from the ship in distress is more than two hours old now,
and time is running out for any survivors struggling in the
38-degree Fahrenheit (3.3 C) water. And now they also have to look
for a potentially downed helicopter and its four-man crew.
	   At 9:35 p.m., the helicopter lifts away from the pad. No one
inside says anything.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   One hundred and fifty miles (240 kilometers) away, over the
Fairweather Grounds, the first rescue helicopter is barely
airborne, hovering in a trough between mountains of landsliding
water.
	   But it's so dark and the sky is so dense with sleet and snow
that Lt. William Adickes, the flight commander, doesn't see the
massive swell looming over the Jayhawk or the survivors riding atop
the crest.
	   ``Jesus, Bill!'' shrieks Lt. Dan Molthen, his co-pilot, pointing
frantically over his head through the windscreen's bubble. ``Take
us up!''
	   Adickes' reflexes take over. He yanks the nose of the helicopter
upward and leftward and hits the engines.
	   The turbines moan, the rotors squeal, but the helicopter feels
as if it's moving in slow motion. They hear the wave's crash just
below them and see clouds of white spray. The Jayhawk wobbles
upward.
	   Adickes checks his instruments and decides he's reached his
limit.
	   They've been on scene for an hour and 20 minutes and his crew
hasn't been able to get the rescue basket closer than 40 feet (60
meters) from the survivors, and they're too exhausted and afraid to
swim to it. The flares his team tossed into the raging seas are
sputtering out. The hoist cable that lowers the rescue basket is
ruined, frayed by constant chafing against the side of the
helicopter.
	   Molthen is dizzy and retching from the aircraft's jackhammering.
The flight mechanic, Sean Whitherspoon, is shaking from exhaustion
and vertigo and is losing feeling in his left arm from hypothermia.
	   They've lost communications, and the fuel gauge is dropping.
Adickes is only minutes from ``bingo,'' the point at which the
helicopter doesn't have enough fuel to return to base.
	   ``It's time to go,'' he remembers whispering into the mike on
his headset.
	   No one responds. They are trained to save lives under conditions
no one else dares to challenge.
	   The Jayhawk labors skyward and, against vicious headwinds, turns
for Sitka. Whitherspoon pulls the jump door closed, sits down on
the floor and goes into convulsions.
	   ``Rich, man,'' says Whitherspoon, ``I can't stop shaking.''
	   Richard Sansone, the rescue swimmer, starts Whitherspoon on
water and saline and pulls a thermal bag over him to raise his body
temperature.
	   They huddle there in the indigo cabin light, trying not to think
about the people they left behind.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The second rescue helicopter is 15 minutes from arriving when a
call comes over the high-frequency radio. The caller identifies
himself as the captain of Alaska Airlines flight 196, a commercial
jetliner en route from Anchorage to Seattle.
	   ``Coast Guard ... We've received a radio transmission from one
of your sister helos ... H-60 Jayhawk ... Flight commander Adickes
says they are aborting mission and returning to base ... They
report four to five people are still in the water, over.''
	   Lt. David Durham rogers the message. The first helicopter is all
right. Their job has just gotten easier.
	   Still, Chris Windnagle, the 34-year-old flight mechanic, is
sweating and thinking about his family. Ninety minutes ago he had a
pizza in the oven and was watching a Disney movie with his wife,
two boys and baby girl.
	   Now he's in pitch darkness, getting hammered by the floor and
ceiling of a Jayhawk as it hurtles into a powerful storm. He's
never been on a high-seas rescue in six years of Coast Guard duty,
never flown in zero visibility and killer wind shears.
	   Durham's adrenaline is pumping. ``Let's get there fast,
people,'' he remembers saying. ``This thing will probably be
nothing.''

	   But it is something. Durham, 38, had been piloting helicopters
since graduating from the Coast Guard academy in 1982. He'd flown
in Alaska for more than three of those years and thought he'd seen
ugly weather.
	   Until now.
	   He's cruising at 300 feet (90 meters) beneath a heavy cloud
cover, backing winds are pushing the aircraft into a 200-knot
(368-kph) sprint and rain bands are swinging across his path like
slamming doors.
	   When his direction finder hits on the EPIRB distress signal,
indicating they've arrived at the scene, Durham swings the
helicopter. But instead of heading back, it sails north as if
skidding on ice.
	   To fight off the headwinds, Durham will say later, he has to
``crab'' the helicopter, swinging the nose and tail back and forth
like a scampering crustacean. It takes them 25 minutes to return a
half mile (one kilometer).
	   Durham and Lt. Russell Zullick, his co-pilot, take turns
steering through a cloverleaf search pattern. For 45 minutes they
find nothing.
	   Then, from the jump door, flight mechanic Chris Windnagle sees
something twinkle. It must be the strobe light from the EPIRB.
	   The survivors are clustered around the strobe and what looks
like a fish float. They're drifting so fast that Zullick has to
reprogram his instruments every few minutes just to keep up.
	   Windnagle shouts to his pilots to establish a hover. Durham
tries to edge the helicopter down, but his altimeters are swinging
180 feet (55 meters) in a matter of seconds.
	   ``Hey, Russ,'' he hollers to his co-pilot, ``are we going up or
down?''
	   Out go five flares. They hit water and burst to life a half mile
(one kilometer) upwind of the survivors. Windnagle pitches out the
basket and it flies back to the rotor tail. He winches it back in,
tries again and again to get it down to the water near the
survivors.
	   After seven tries, the closest he can drop it is about 30 feet
(9 meters) from the strobe light. Later, he will say it was like
``dropping a clothespin into a milk jug from a tall building.''
He's frustrated, delirious from vertigo.
	   After 20 minutes, the smokes sputter out. Durham's not sure, but
he figures they're close to not having enough fuel to return to
base.
	   ``What do you think?'' he asks his co-pilot. Zullick just nods.
	   It's 12:49 a.m. _ five hours and 47 minutes since the La Conte
sank. With each minute, the chances rise sharply of those men
drowning or dying from hypothermia.
	   Durham takes the Jayhawk up to 300 feet (90 meters) and veers
back to base.
	   Two hundred feet (60 meters) below, Robert Doyle and his
exhausted crewmates watch their hopes clatter away.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ This story is based on interviews with 11 Coast
Guard helicopter flight crew members involved in the rescue; three
members of the ground crew; Coast Guard spokesmen in Juneau,
Alaska, and Martinsburg, West Virginia; the surviving crew members
of the La Conte; Jesse Evans, who found the remains on Shuyak
Island; the two Alaska state troopers who recovered the remains;
and two forensics experts at the Alaska State Medical Examiner's
Office in Anchorage. The story also draws from the 523-page record
of the Coast Guard's inquest into the sinking of the La Conte.

	   This is the third part of a five-day serial. The story so far:
	   In the jaws of a powerful arctic storm, five fishermen are
adrift in 80-foot (24-meter) seas. Their fishing vessel, the La
Conte, is at the bottom of the ocean. A Coast Guard helicopter has
found the survivors in the dark in the vast Gulf of Alaska but has
been unable to lower a rescue basket to them. Buffeted by high
winds and downdrafts, the helicopter has come within five feet (1.5
meters) of crashing into the sea.

Cambodian mob riots over dumping of industrial waste from Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with police firing to disperse crowds
ransacking deputy governor's house.
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Police unleashed several volleys
of gunfire over the heads of a mob ransacking the home of a
Cambodian city's deputy governor on Sunday as a protest against the
dumping of suspected toxic waste from Taiwan deteriorated into a
riot.
	   The crackle of gunfire and whiz of bullets sent the mob of more
than 300 people scurrying out of Deputy Governor Khim Bo's mansion
and racing down side streets, but not before they had wrecked his
home and set fire to a vehicle.
	   The attack on the official's home was prompted by a gathering of
residents upset with an apparent business deal to dump Taiwanese
waste on the outskirts of the port city of Sihanoukville, 185
kilometers (115 miles) southwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Earlier Sunday, the mob had vented its anger at government
officials and businessmen suspected of being involved in the deal
by stoning government offices and trashing a hotel.
	   The waste, resembling blocks of concrete and dirt, was dumped
about two weeks ago less than 100 meters (333 feet) from a village
of 30 families about 10 kilometers outside of the city. Many
residents living near the dumping site have complained of health
problems since the waste showed up.
	   One port worker has died after cleaning the hold of the ship
which transported the waste from Taiwan, a port official said on
Sunday. Another resident became ill after rummaging through the
waste looking for empty sacks to store rice, his relatives said.
	   The Taiwanese company that sent the waste has denied the
material is toxic, but said it does contain traces of the chemical
mercury. Mercury can be highly poisonous in large doses.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has insisted that the waste be
returned to Taiwan, which has so far refused to take it back.
	   The angry mob hurled stones at the customs and port offices in
Sihanoukville, shattering windows as they shouted epithets at
government officials they say allegedly accepted bribes to allow
the material to be imported.
	   Their fury unsated, they then moved on to the Camsap Hotel,
which bears the same name as the company that imported the waste.
It was not clear if the two enterprises' ownership was the same,
but that did not stop the mob from looting the hotel.
	   Some participants broke into rooms and pitched televisions,
refrigerators, tables, beds and mattresses out of windows on the
upper floors.
	   Others in front of the hotel set fire to the mattresses,
prompting a city fire brigade to rush to the scene. One
demonstrator was taken to a hospital after he was hit by a table
thrown from an upper floor.
	   Dozens of military police were present, but took no action
except to try and talk to mob leaders and convince them not to do
any more damage.
	   The mob was not soothed by government ministers from Phnom Penh
who have vowed to punish whoever was involved in bringing the waste
to Cambodia.
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng and the ministers of environment and
finance were meeting with protest leaders in the early afternoon,
but the hotel was still occupied by members of the mob late Sunday,
and others began marching back to the port.
	   The marchers made a detour, however, taking them to the home of
Khim Bo, who was busy meeting with the ministers at the provincial
headquarters. The mob burst into the mansion and once again began
tossing televisions, furniture and clothing out of windows.
	   Some tried to pull down a satellite television dish from the
roof.
	   Military police once again attempted to talk to mob leaders and
convince them to stop destroying property. When their entreaties
failed, the police first fired a few rounds into the air.
	   That failed to deter the mob, and so after a few moments they
began firing hundreds of rounds into the air, terrifying mob
members, who then fled.
	   Many, however, were still seething.
	   ``The port and customs officials are corrupt. They took the
money, they took the bribe, and let the thing kill the people
here,'' said Phat Kim Huot, a 23-year-old demonstrator.
	   ``If anyone dies from it, they will be the first to die,'' he
said.
	   Hospital officials said that a port worker named Pith Sovan had
died mysteriously from shock earlier this week and they could not
determine the cause of death.
	   Main Men, chief engineer at the port, said Pith Sovan had
cleaned the hold of the ship that contained the waste after it was
removed.

Israeli injured in explosion, suspected of trying to harm Arabs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli injured in an explosion at a gate of
Jerusalem's walled Old City was detained Sunday by police who
suspected him of attempting to harm Arabs.
	   The man was brought to a Jerusalem hospital early Sunday morning
with wounds to his hand and was held for questioning, police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   Israel's army radio speculated that the suspect was trying to
plant the bomb in the Old City's Muslim quarter when it exploded at
the New Gate.
	   The radio said that police believe the man may be responsible
for seven stabbing attacks on Palestinians in Jerusalem in the last
year.
	   Two of the Palestinians were killed and seven were injured in
the attacks. Police have said they believe an Israeli Jewish
nationalist seeking revenge for attacks by Palestinians on
Israelis.
	   Most of the attacks occurred in Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox
Jewish neighborhood. The New Gate, facing northwest, is the closest
Old City gate to Mea Shearim.
	   Menuhin wouldn't comment on the investigation but did say that
the suspect was being questioned by the same unit investigating the
stabbings.
	   ``It's up to you to draw your own conclusions, since it's the
same unit,'' she said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hours before the announced end of U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Iraqi official said the
attacks had prompted his government to end all dealings with U.N.
arms inspectors searching for Iraq's prohibited weapons.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in announcing an end to the
attacks, said he hoped U.N. arms inspectors could return to Baghdad
with full Iraqi cooperation. But Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
suggested the arms inspection program would never resume.
	   ``The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is
over,'' Ramadan told a news conference Saturday night, referring to
the U.N. agency in charge of the inspections.
	   The implications of Iraq's decision to end U.N. inspections are
grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction as well as overseeing long-range monitoring to ensure
Iraq does not rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Despite the halt to American and British airstrikes, air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad at about 8:15 a.m. (0515 gmt) Sunday. The
sirens were not accompanied by any anti-aircraft fire, and it
appeared they were sounded in error.
	   After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction for Iraq and
failed to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all
this suffering and it ends as if nothing has happened,'' said
Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese sprinter Koji Ito, who won
three gold medals and ran the first 10-flat 100 meters by an Asian,
received the dlrs 100,000 Asian Games most valuable performance
award Sunday.
	   Ito set his Asian record in the semifinals, won the 100 final in

100-meter relay.
	   In a vote by reporters covering the games, Ito finished ahead of
Japanese marathon runner Naoko Takahashi, who missed a women's
world record by just one minute; Japanese swimmer Shunsuke Ito;
Thai boxer Samluck Khamsing; and Japanese swimmer Tomoko Hagiwara.
	   The judges for the award added Olympic silver medalist Lee
Bong-ju of South Korea, who won the games' final event, the men's
marathon, to the top six.
	   ``I can't say exactly if will be able to get a 9 seconds
record,'' Ito replied questions about possibly becoming the first
Asian to break 10. ``Only God knows. But in the future I would like
to do my best.''
	   The dlrs 100,000 from the South Korean company Samsung is not
permitted to go directly to the athlete under International Olympic
Committee rules. But his national Olympic committee is to use the
money for his training.
	   Ito said he also was thinking of arranging a gift from the money
to a worthy cause in Thailand.
	   Ito's favorite race actually has been the 200, which he won here
in 20.25, a games record but slower than his Asian record of 20.16,
set this year.
	   In voting, reporters were not permitted to select athletes from
their own country.
	   Of 1,510 valid votes, Ito received 481, Takahashi 220, Ito 149,
Somluck 82 and Hagiwara 76.
	   Ito and his 22-year-old identical twin brother, Shusuke,
finished 1-2 in the men's 100-meter freestyle. The ``elder'' Ito
also won gold in three relay events.
	   Somluck, Thailand's first Olympic gold medalist in boxing,
defending his featherweight Asian Games title here.
	   Hagiwara won gold medals in two women's backstroke races and a
relay.

Leaking gas kills four in apartment house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gas leaking from a malfunctioning oven in an
apartment house in a Moscow suburb killed four people and sent 12
others to the hospital, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   According to a duty officer at the Russian Ministry for
Emergencies, a gas oven began leaking Saturday night in a two-story
apartment building in the suburban village of Zavety Ilyich, where
37 people lived, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Sixteen people were overcome by carbon monoxide, and four later
died, the report said.

South Korea's Lee wins final race of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with MVP award &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Bong-ju pulled away
from Japan's Akira Manai in the marathon Sunday, pounding a final
stamp of victory on the Asian Games' real battle _ between their
two nations for second in the gold standings.
	   After Lee won the games' final race by nearly a minute, he ran a
victory lap with a South Korean flag while Manai took one step over
the finish line and hung his head in fatigue.
	   Lee's triumph left South Korea ahead of Japan 65 to 52 in gold
medals, although Japan came out ahead 180-165 in total medals.
	   Nobody expected to surpass sports giant China, which finished
with 129 of the 378 gold medals awarded, or 34 percent. The Chinese
had taken 135 of the 342 golds, or 39 percent, at the last games in
1994.
	   Compared to four years ago, the Chinese lost some ground to
Japan in swimming and track events.
	   In some cases where the Chinese won, such as in diving and
rowing, they said the Asian competition was too easy. The diving
coach said his team still faced hard work if it wanted to make the
desired impact at the 2000 Olympics.
	   Yuan Weimin, head of China's delegation here, said that overall
he was ``basically satisfied, but not totally satisfied'' with
China's showing.
	   Looking ahead to 2000 at Sydney was a major theme for China,
South Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller teams were
celebrating their chance to shine on the Asian stage.
	   Host Thailand finished with 24 gold medals, double its initial
target and double its best previous finish _ 12 in 1966.
	   That tied it with Kazakstan for fourth in golds.
	   Hong Kong, which had only one gold from all previous Asian
Games, came out with five.
	   But 2000 also was a concern for marathon winner Lee, who missed
a 1996 Olympic gold by just three seconds.
	   ``I was disappointed with the time. The temperature was too
high,'' Lee said. ``But I am delighted to win the gold.''
	   ``Now I have two goals: a gold medal at the Sydney Olympics and
to break the world marathon record, maybe next year at London,
Rotterdam or Boston,'' he added.
	   Chinese women weightlifters did all the world record setting
here, breaking marks on all seven days of their competition at the
games.
	   But in the more prestigious track events, Japanese runners
turned in the best time. Koji Ito just missed the exclusive club of
men who have run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, turning in a
10-flat semifinal in the semifinals before winning the gold in a
slightly slower time.
	   On Sunday, Ito received the dlrs 100,000 award for the games'
most valuable performance.
	   Second in the voting by reporters covering the games was Japan's
Naoko Takahashi. With nobody pushing her, she missed the world
women's marathon record by just one minute as she won the games'
opening race by 13 minutes.
	   South Korea and Japan, the 2002 soccer World Cup co-hosts,
suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the semifinals of the
games' soccer tournament. Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the gold medal,
while China shut out Thailand 3-0 for the bronze.
	   And overall, said Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake,
``our total number of gold medals did not reach our target.''
	   Kogake noted that Japan lost to the South Koreans in 14 of 15
team sports, and suffered humiliating defeats in baseball and
volleyball.
	   ``We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,''
Kogake said.
	   On the plus side, there had been only two positive tests for
doping as of Sunday, compared with 15 at the 1994 games, when the
disqualification of 11 Chinese in track and swimming affected the
medals standings.
	   Both cases at these games were weightlifters _ a Jordanian and a
Kuwaiti _ who finished no better than seventh in their events.
	   ``I hope we don't have any more in future,'' said Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, the games'
governing body.
	   But, he added, ``I am very happy that there have been only two
cases, not important cases, not involving champions.''

Chinese dissident to begin unprecedented visit to Taiwan on Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng
will begin an unprecedented visit to Taiwan on Monday that
underscores calls for democratic change in China and the sensitive
relationship between Beijing and Taipei.
	   Coming after elections described by Taiwan as a model for reform
in China, Wei's nine-day sojourn will likely spark comparisons
between the island's robust democracy and continuing one-party rule
on the mainland.
	   Wei will be received by top officials, including President Lee
Teng-hui, becoming the first prominent Chinese dissident to
officially meet Taiwan's leader.
	   He will also meet with heads of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's formal and permanent
independence from China, and the New Party, which backs
reunification with China.
	   In an interview with the United Daily News published Sunday, Wei
was quoted saying he opposed the independence movement, but
reunification between the sides should take a backseat to people's
welfare.
	   ``At present Taiwan independence is impossible. In the future it
will not be necessary,'' the paper quoted Wei as saying.
	   China says it will use force if necessary to gain control over
the island, which has been politically united with the mainland for
just four of the last 100 years.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party says China must democratize
before any progress can be made on reunification. Taiwan's peaceful
transition to democracy over the last decade should be a model for
China, which in size, population, and development challenges,
dwarfs this newly-affluent island of 21 million people.
	   Wei has received numerous invitations from Nationalist and
opposition party politicians to visit since his release from a
Chinese prison and exile to the United States late last year.
	   He decided to accept an invitation from the private World League
for Freedom and Democracy, and waited until after Dec. 5 polls for
the legislature and mayors of Taiwan's two largest cities to avoid
appearing to favor any one party, the paper said.
	   Despite that, Wei has praised Lee's ``New Taiwanese'' campaign
to promote solidarity between native-born Taiwanese and those who
fled to the island from China in 1949. That concept has been
credited with narrowing the ethnic divide and contributing to
Nationalist gains in the elections.
	   Taiwan's democracy is a threat to China, which will not pass up
an opportunity to ``eat up the island,'' the paper quoted Wei
saying. The best way to ensure the island's security is to aid
China's democracy movement, it quoted him saying.
	   Wei was quoted by the newspaper saying he expected to discuss
assistance and funding with persons in Taiwan, but wouldn't accept
political conditions on such help.
	   Offering a poignant moment for dissidents on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits, Wei, who spent 18 years in prison for advocating
democracy, may also visit a human rights memorial near a former
prison on remote Green Island.
	   Hundreds of political prisoners were confined and scores
executed on Green Island during nearly four decades of martial law
imposed by the Nationalists after their retreat from advancing
Communists in 1949.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hours before the announced end of U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Iraqi official said the
attacks had prompted his government to end all dealings with U.N.
arms inspectors searching for Iraq's prohibited weapons.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in announcing an end to the
attacks, said he hoped U.N. arms inspectors could return to Baghdad
with full Iraqi cooperation. But Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
suggested the arms inspection program would never resume.
	   ``The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is
over,'' Ramadan told a news conference Saturday night, referring to
the U.N. agency in charge of the inspections.
	   The implications of Iraq's decision to end U.N. inspections are
grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction as well as overseeing long-range monitoring to ensure
Iraq does not rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Despite the halt to American and British airstrikes, air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad at about 8:15 a.m. (0515 GMT) Sunday. The
sirens were not accompanied by any anti-aircraft fire, and it
appeared they were sounded in error.
	   After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction in Iraq and
failed to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all
this suffering and it ends as if nothing has happened,'' said
Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.

<TEXT>
	   COOLUM, Australia (AP) _ Sentimental favorite Stuart Appleby
shot a 17-under-par 271 to claim on Sunday his first professional
victory in his home country and his first solo win since the death
of his wife in July.
	   Cheered on by a gallery which included his parents and members
of his late wife Renay's family, the 27-year-old Australian shot
rounds of 69, 70, a course record 63, and a final round 69 to win
the Coolum Classic.
	   Renay was killed in a freak accident when she was crushed by a
car outside a London railway station. The tragedy devastated
Appleby and sent shock waves through the world golfing community.
	   Appleby said after his four-stroke win over Australian Craig
Spence that he only decided to play the tournament because of the
good times he and Renay had shared together at the host resort.
	   ``I feel very lucky and fortunate that I'm here because I was
only months ago deciding whether I'd bail out,'' said Appleby.
	   ``On sentimental reasons, coming here was probably more of a
decision made by Renay than me, because she just loved the place.
	   ``I was a little worried it was going to be an emotional week
for me.''
	   Appleby set up his win earlier in the day, returning at dawn to
complete his third round, a course record 63 which included nine
birdies, before starting his final round one shot ahead of Spence.
	   At the halfway stage of the storm-marred tournament, Appleby was
seven shots behind Spence. He won by four strokes despite a bogey
on the 72nd hole _ his first dropped shot in 49 holes.
	   Appleby's confidence is high after finishing second at the
Australian Open at the tough Royal Adelaide course and then helping
Peter Thomson's Internationals upset a star-studded U.S. team in
the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.
	   Five-time British open winner Thomson commented after Appleby's
win that he could now go on and take out either the U.S. or British
Open next year.
	   ``I believe that too, I had my first top 10 in the U.S. Open
just gone,'' Appleby said.
	   Spence was satisfied to have fought hard against a player who
has already won twice on the demanding U.S. tour.
	   ``I was really happy the way I held up,'' said Spence, who said
his chance was lost at the ninth when Appleby made birdie and he
dropped a shot.
	   ``To lead all the way would have been awesome ... but it's not
like I played badly and fell back in the pack.''
	   Tony Carolan finished with a seven-under 65 to tie for third
place with Appleby's Presidents Cup teammate Craig Parry at 278.
	   Australia's Paul Gow crashed from 10-under to 5-under after a
horrendous quintuple-bogey nine at the 371-meter par-4 13th hole.
	   Gow finished in a tie for 11th at 283.
	   (rs)
	   Australian Stuart Appleby won the Coolum Classic golf tournament
Sunday by four strokes following a final-round three-under-par 69
for a 17-under total of 271.

 &UR; Kosovo rebel group grows, retools, rearms
 &UR; AP Photo NY196
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The buzz of rebel military activity
across Kosovo during this uneasy Balkan winter is unmistakable. And
ominous.
	   From the frozen farm plains in the north across the forested
hills of the war-blackened Drenica region to icy mountain passes
along the western border with Albania, the Kosovo Liberation Army
is increasingly visible _ expanding, reorganizing, rearming.
	   For the ethnic Albanian fighters, bent on winning the province's
independence from Serbia, a resumption of full-scale war is not a
question of if but when.
	   This is a new, improved KLA by all appearances and experts'
assessments _ stronger and more disciplined than the ragtag force
that was routed over the summer. It is preparing to battle Serbian
forces for years if necessary in the predominantly Albanian
province.
	   ``We have learned from our mistakes,'' declares a young rebel
commander named Remi, who is based at a heavily guarded compound in
Lapastica, a village in northern Kosovo. ``We are trying to form a
professional army.''
	   A two-way radio on his desk crackles with reports from the
field, and a line of young recruits marches past the window,
wearing jeans and camouflage backpacks.
	   ``We know what to do when fighting breaks out again,'' the
27-year-old commander says. ``We are ready to go fight in every
part of Kosovo.''
	   New camouflage or all-black uniforms are only a symbol of the
changes the KLA has undertaken during the 10 weeks since a
U.S.-brokered truce brought a tenuous halt to months of combat.
	   Using the lull to its advantage, the KLA has reshuffled its
ranks to put professionally trained officers in key posts,
instituted a draft, acquired satellite communications and put
military police in many villages. In the wake of Serb withdrawals
required by the Oct. 12 truce agreement, it has moved boldly back
into all the territory it controlled at the high point last July _
some 40 percent of Kosovo.
	   Perhaps most important, foreign analysts and the rebels
themselves say they've smuggled in significant amounts of anti-tank
rockets, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles and long-barreled sniper rifles that can pierce armored
vehicles or take a man's head off from three-quarters of a mile
away.
	   ``We're getting more and more arms every day,'' says the deputy
commander in Lapastica, Daja _ a 38-year-old soldier respected in
the KLA for his four years heading a commando force that fought for
Croatia in its war of independence from Yugoslavia. ``By spring
we'll have five times what we have now.''
	   The KLA remains no battlefield match for the 11,000 Yugoslav
army soldiers and 10,000 Serbian police officers stationed in
Kosovo. Western intelligence sources conservatively estimate KLA
strength at 1,000 trained, professional soldiers and a few thousand
armed supporters.
	   But Western observers agree the rebels now enjoy widespread
support in villages and are better-armed, better-equipped and
better-organized than in the seven months of fighting earlier this
year.
	   ``They're a little bit more sophisticated, and they have bigger
weapons,'' says Frank Larsson of Sweden, a European Union observer
in Kosovo. ``They have learned from before.''
	   Rebel fighters are everywhere, it seems, in central and western
Kosovo these days.
	   Venture down a dirt road and grim-faced guerrillas carrying
automatic rifles emerge from behind bushes or houses, fingers on
triggers.
	   KLA officers wearing berets and carrying field radios cruise the
back roads of Drenica, where their central command is believed to
be located, in Mercedes or sport-utility vehicles.
	   A small army of black-clad, special-force rebels lay by
invisibly when Serb civilians staged a protest march to a command
post this month, springing into view only after the event ended.
	   While the rebels are still struggling to get all fighting units
coordinated, enlisting new support is hardly a problem.
	   A secret ceremony takes place every few days in a different
village, where KLA commanders swear in new recruits who recite
oaths of loyalty, sing the Albanian anthem and salute the Albanian
flag.
	   Most of the fighters are men, but women are helping, too, making
uniforms and donating jewelry and valuables. Remi takes a handful
of gold coins out of his desk drawer as proof.
	   ``Except for a small group, more or less everybody backs the
KLA,'' says Belul Beqaj, an ethnic Albanian political analyst and
freelance journalist who reports on the rebel movement.
	   Military experts aren't convinced the outmanned rebels have
learned all their lessons from the Serbs pushing them out of
stronghold after stronghold in July and August. Some think the
rebels may be too devoted to trying to hold territory, rather than
relying on guerrilla raids.
	   But the rebels say that even as they try to transform into a
regular army _ a people's army _ they haven't abandoned the
hit-and-run tactics that give them their best chance.
	   ``We are a new army, and that means we had no experience before
this,'' says Agim Cervadiku, 38, cradling a Russian-made anti-tank
rocket at a rebel stronghold in Drenica. ``But now we know what we
need to fight against the Serbs, and we have it.
	   ``We are ready to start guerrilla actions again soon.''

China needs law on social security, leading capitalist says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has begun considering a law to compel the
growing private sector to pay into a new Western-style social
welfare system, the official China Daily reported Sunday.
	   A law under consideration would require all firms, whether state
or private, to pay into a nascent national social security system
system, Jing Shuping, head of a government-backed group that
represents the private sector, was quoted by the paper as saying.
	   He added that without the private sector's participation, the
social security system would fail.
	   Without nationwide unemployment and pension schemes, the
government fears expected layoffs of tens of millions of unneeded
state workers could create social unrest. So it views a social
security safety net as an essential part of reforms to end central
planning and privatize state-run industries.
	   But the report quoted an unnamed expert as saying that while 90
percent of state firms are paying into the social insurance pools,
only a minority of private ones are doing so.
	   By last year, the industrial output of private enterprises had
jumped to 75 percent of China's total from just 22 percent in 1978,
the first year of major free market-style economic reforms.

Myanmar's armed ethnic groups unite to counter government offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With Myanmar's military mustering
troops for a major offensive, some of its ethnic rebel opponents
have formed an alliance and are attempting to forge closer ties
with Thailand's military.
	   Shan and Karenni rebels said this weekend they had joined forces
to fight against the imminent offensive by the Myanmar army. They
also said they would appeal to the Thai army to work with them to
staunch the flow of narcotics along the Thai-Myanmar border.
	   Thailand's Foreign Ministry gave qualified support to that
proposal on Sunday.
	   ``Thailand is willing to work with all concerned parties to
combat drug trafficking, but without undermining the national
integrity of the state of Myanmar,'' said Kobsak Chutikul, the Thai
ministry spokesman.
	   ``This doesn't mean that we will give recognition or assistance
to them in their internal struggle against the Yangon government,''
Kobsak said.
	   Thai army generals confirmed this week that Myanmar's military
was mobilizing to attack several rebel guerrilla groups based near
the Thai border.
	   The groups, including ethnic Shan, Karenni, Wa and Karen forces
have been fighting for autonomy from the government in Yangon for
as long as 50 years.
	   For decades, Thailand supported the rebels as a buffer between
them and their traditional enemy Myanmar, also known as Burma. But
as relations improved with Yangon, Thailand has reduced support for
the rebels, who have since suffered a series of crippling defeats
at the hands of Myanmar's army.
	   Some of the rebel groups, particularly the Shan and Wa, have
funded their insurgencies by trafficking in opium, the raw material
for heroin.
	   Myanmar is the world's largest producer of the deadly drug.
	   The Shan State Army, the rebels who announced the alliance this
weekend, are remnants of the army once commanded by opium warlord
Khun Sa, who surrendered to Myanmar's military government in 1996
and now lives in Yangon.
	   Their commander, Yord Serk, said the alliance will mean they
have 20,000 troops in the field. That figure could not be
independently confirmed, however.
	   Although Myanmar's military government is considered a pariah by
many Western countries because of its rampant human rights
violations, support for the rebels has been tepid because of their
drug trafficking.
	   In attempt to make themselves more palatable to the
international community, Yord Serk said his troops have now shunned
drug trafficking and would fight against it.
	   ``SSA is employing more than just military means to achieve our
objective. We are looking at political means as well,'' he said.
	   The Karenni National Progressive Party signed a ceasefire
agreement with Myanmar's military in 1996, but it quickly broke
down in disputes over controlling revenue from timber exports to
Thailand.
	   The Shan and Karenni people and their armies live and operate in
different provinces in Myanmar, so their alliance may prove to be
more symbolic than practical in terms of battlefield efficiency.
	   Myanmar's ethnic groups also have a history of fighting among
each other, leading to the withering of several alliances in the
past.

Israeli injured in explosion, suspected of trying to harm Arabs

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli injured in an explosion at a gate of
Jerusalem's walled Old City was detained Sunday by police who
suspected him of attempting to harm Arabs.
	   The man was brought to a Jerusalem hospital early Sunday morning
with wounds to his hand and was held for questioning, police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   Israel's army radio speculated that the suspect was trying to
plant the bomb in the Old City's Muslim quarter when it exploded at
the New Gate.
	   The radio said that police believe the man may be responsible
for seven stabbing attacks on Palestinians in Jerusalem in the last
year.
	   Two of the Palestinians were killed and seven were injured in
the attacks. Police believe an Israeli Jewish nationalist seeking
revenge for attacks by Palestinians on Israelis carried out the
attacks.
	   Most of the attacks occurred in Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox
Jewish neighborhood just outside Jerusalem's Old City. The New
Gate, facing northwest, is the closest Old City gate to Mea
Shearim.
	   Menuhin wouldn't comment on the investigation but did say that
the suspect was being questioned by the same unit investigating the
stabbings.
	   ``It's up to you to draw your own conclusions, since it's the
same unit,'' she said.

China sends jailed dissident into exile ahead of other's trial

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China released a respected, but ailing labor
rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately
sent him into exile in the United States.
	   Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the
government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming
trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli.
	   Xu is the third leading member of a would-be opposition
political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week
crackdown that has seen 30 dissidents arrested or interrogated.
	   Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groups
decried the Chinese government's timing as manipulative.
	   ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government for
this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, director of New
York-based Human Rights in China.
	   After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor
camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport
and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York,
his mother and brother said.
	   Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their
11-year-old daughter, the family said.
	   Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used in
freeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997
and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released Liu on medical parole,
exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provided he
go into exile, Liu Qing said.
	   Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.
In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide last month,
doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels,
Liu Qing said.
	   Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Western
governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese leaders have
been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s,
finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidents
at home.
	   In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News
Agency reported that judicial departments took into account Liu's
health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole for
medical treatment.
	   ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending
people directly from prison into exile is a type of human rights
violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in a telephone interview
from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.
	   Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the
fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2
years in prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way
China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.
	   Liu was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years. His last
arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights in
May 1995. Liu was never put on trial. Fourteen months passed before
his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his fate and whereabouts: a
three-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, remote northeast.
	   His term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects
without trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence
by a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed was
fabricated.
	   Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to
protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle prods and confined
to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only
sit or stand.
	   His wife fearlessly endured police harassment, beatings and
detentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away and
hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N.
human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in
September.

South Korean navy continues to search for sunken North Korean spy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean navy ships using sonar
scanners continued to search Sunday for a sunken North Korean spy
boat off South Korea's south coast, military officials said.
	   The 12-ton spy boat went down in waters 110 meters (yards) deep
before dawn Friday in a gun battle with South Korean navy ships.
	   The body of a crewman armed with a hand grenade and knife was
recovered after the vessel sank. Officials said navy ships were
searching for more bodies and wreckage of the sunken boat.
	   ``Recovery of the sunken ship is needed to determine the exact
number of crewmen, its equipment and mission,'' said Maj. Gen. Lee
Jang-hum who heads an investigation into the case.
	   Announcing his team's findings, Lee said the communist boat,
believed to be carrying up to eight crewmen, sailed out of North
Korea's western port of Nampo, home to a major naval intelligence
unit.
	   The spy boat was first spotted shortly before midnight Thursday
as it approached Yosu, a port on the southern tip of the Korean
Peninsula. The boat was pursued for hours by South Korean warships
and air force planes before it was sunk in a gun battle.
	   Lee said his team has concluded that the communist craft was
foiled in an attempt to land spies.
	   He described the sunken vessel as a ``semi-submersible craft,''
commonly used by North Koreans to drop off or pick up spies.
	   Launched from a ``mother ship'' which stays in international
waters, such a craft can be operated with virtually all of its body
under water without being detected by radar, Lee said.
	   ``It is believed to be a renovated model, about 12.8 meters (39
feet) long, twice as big as the old type,'' he said.
	   A North Korean boat of the same type was seized in a gun battle
off South Korea's south coast in 1983. One agent was killed and two
others captured.
	   On Saturday, Seoul's Defense Ministry demanded an apology from
North Korea for the infiltration. North Korea rejected the South
Korean accusations as a fabrication.
	   Several North Korean spy crafts have been caught infiltrating
South Korean waters in recent years.
	   In June, a 70-ton North Korean submarine was found off South
Korea's east coast with its propeller and periscope tangled in a
fishing net.
	   South Koreans cut through the hatch and found nine bodies, all
shot dead in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul officials said it was
on a spy mission.
	   North Korea and South Korea are still technically still at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Karin Roten gave Switzerland new
hope for a season first podium finish on Sunday, grabbing the lead
in the first run of a women's World Cup slalom.
	   Roten, who has just one other career World Cup victory, a slalom
in Lillehammer, Norway in 1996, twisted her way around the 49 gates
down the Piste de l'Ours in 42.09 seconds, .23 faster than American
Kristina Koznick.
	   Koznick, runnerup in the World Cup slalom rankings last season
and 11th overall, has like Rotin, just one career World Cup win,
also a slalom in Are, Sweden last season.
	   Australia's Zali Steggall, currently third in the slalom
standings, clocked the third-fastest time, crossing in 42.39, ahead
of Norway's Trine Bakke, .49 adrift.
	   Ylva Nowen, the reigning World Cup slalom champion, was fifth,
.64 back, while the current slalom leader Sabine Egger of Austria
finished sixth in 42.79.
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden was 20th out of the start-hut,
but overcame deteriorating course conditions to post the
eighth-fastest chrono, .96 back.
	   Technical specialist Deborah Compagnoni of Italy, the slalom
Olympic silver medallist in Nagano, ended her chances in the first
leg, veering off in the top half of the course.

finished sixth in 42.79.
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden was 20th out of the start-hut,
but overcame deteriorating course conditions to post the
eighth-fastest time, .96 back.
	   Technical specialist Deborah Compagnoni of Italy, the slalom
Olympic silver medalist in Nagano, Japan, ended her chances in the
first leg, veering off in the top half of the course.

Zimbabwe sure to clinch series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe is virtually assured to win
its first ever series outside home after dense fog prevented play
for the fourth successive day in the third and final cricket Test
against Pakistan in Faisalabad on Sunday.
	   Umpires Dough Cowie and Salim Badar called off the day's play in
the morning session as there was no chance of improvement in dense
fog and fading light.
	   The fog and poor visibility had so far not allowed a single ball
to be bowled at the Iqbal Stadium. It will be third time for
Pakistan when its Test will be abandoned without a ball being
bowled. Pakistan's 1993-94 Test against Sri Lanka was abandoned
because of curfew in Colombo while in 1988-89 a Test against New
Zealand at Dunedin was washed out due to rain.
	   Zimbabwe leads the three-match series 1-0 after winning the
first Test by seven wickets. The second Test was also marred by
dense fog at Lahore as 13 hours were lost in the drawn game due to
poor visibility and fog.

Blair says military objectives in Iraq airstrikes achieved

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday
outlined a three-pronged strategy to keep Saddam Hussein ``in his
cage'' following the four-day bombing campaign against Iraqi
targets.
	   Saddam's military machine would ``take years to repair'' and
Britain and the United States had sent an ``important'' message to
the elite Republican Guard, Blair told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in a television interview in which he began to outline the
next phase of the U.S.-British plan for Iraq.
	   ``First of all we need to have a policy of containment, if
necessary by military means,'' he said. ``Second, tighten the
sanctions enforcement machine and make sure it's really secure.''
	   One of the British targets of Operation Desert Fox was an oil
refinery in the southern Iraq port of Basra that the allies said
had been used in a sanctions-busting plot designed to bring in
dollars for Saddam's war machine, he said.
	   ``Thirdly, we want to see the weapons inspectors go back in
there. But we need a far better regime where Saddam is going to be
cooperating properly,'' Blair said.
	   Iraq has already said it will no longer cooperate with the U.N.
inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain decided to attack Iraq after the
U.N. Special Commission reported last week that Saddam's regime had
failed to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors.
	   The two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of
mass destruction, and has used them against his neighbors.
	   ``We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military
capability, and we have done so,'' Blair said Saturday night in
announcing the end of the attack. ``Substantial damage has been
inflicted upon his air defense systems, the command and control
system for his armed forces, missile production capability, and the
systems which could be used for chemical and biological warfare.''
	   Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, simultaneously announcing
a halt to the airstrikes, both said they remain willing to strike
again if necessary.
	   Blair singled out attacks on the elite Republican Guard, which
bolsters Saddam's regime, as being of particular significance.
	   ``They have been given the message that they are in the front
line of targets,'' Blair said, adding that the ``poorly fed''
conscript army was urged in leaflet drops to stay in barracks
because it was not the target for British and American pilots.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a separate television
interview on Sunday that now the military action was over, the
allies needed to build ``international consensus'' to isolate the
Iraqi leader.
	   ``Now it is very important that we have come to the end of the
military campaign that we should launch a diplomatic campaign,''
Cook said. ``We will be putting forward a strategy of containment
for Saddam.''
	   But the Conservative opposition shadow foreign secretary,
Michael Howard, said in a television interview that Saddam's
removal should be an explicit aim of Western policy.
	   ``Now the action is over, we must not have a policy vacuum,'' he
said.

Chirac delighted by end of airstrikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac is ``delighted'' by
the end of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq, according to a
presidential statement Sunday.
	   Chirac's statement also said ``problems remain'' and that the
solution of those problems will entail a review of the relationship
between the United Nations and Iraq.
	   France is ``ready to make an important, positive contribution to
the necessary way out of the crisis. The efforts of everybody in
the world must come together,'' Chirac's statement said.
	   Chirac said the lives of Iraqis who have been suffering for so
many years must be improved quickly.
	   The international community must be able to have an ``effective
control on Iraqi weapons and their eventual development,'' Chirac
said in the statement.
	   The French President said he had proposals to make on how to
bring about such control, but he did not elaborate in the
statement.
	   The way Iraq uses earnings from foreign sales of oil must also
be controlled, Chirac said in the statement.

Earthquake, aftershocks shake eastern Turkish city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ERZURUM, Turkey (AP) _ A moderate earthquake and two aftershocks
rocked an eastern Turkish city that a strong quake had leveled 15
years earlier, the Anatolia news agency said Sunday. There were no
immediate reports of injuries or damage.
	   The first earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.7,
struck on Saturday. A quake of such intensity can cause slight to
moderate damage.
	   Two aftershocks, the strongest of which had a preliminary
magnitude of 3.2, jolted the city early Sunday, the agency said.
	   A magnitude-6.8 earthquake ravaged Erzurum and its environs in
1983, killing more than 1,300 people. Erzurum lies 900 kilometers
(560 miles) east of the capital, Ankara.
	   Turkey's entire eastern region sits atop an earthquake-prone
belt known as the Anatolian fault.

Opposition gathering forces against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort to garner support for his hawkish peace policies
Sunday, opponents from the left and right prepared to face him in
new elections.
	   ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said head of the
right-wing Land of Israel front Michael Kleiner, referring to the
U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords that obligate Israel to
withdraw from parts of the West Bank. Kleiner told Israel TV that
the Land of Israel Front would run its own candidate to challenge
Netanyahu, but declined to say who it would be.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote
Monday to support several conditions he has demanded of the
Palestinians before Israel carries out another promised troop
withdrawal from parts of the West Bank.
	   The opposition Labor Party has announced that it will vote
against Netanyahu's policies, and several right wing members of
Netanyahu's coalition pledged to follow suit.
	   Regardless of the vote's outcome, a motion for early elections
submitted by the Labor Party is practically guaranteed to pass on
the same day.
	   Netanyahu was meeting with Cabinet ministers Sunday to garner
their support for his peace policies.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak opened his campaign Thursday for
the elections slated for April with an emphasis on social issues,
which have typically taken a back seat to the peace process in
national elections.
	   Saturday night, Barak met with Israel's former armed forces
chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored candidate
for prime minister. Shahak declined Barak's invitation to run in
the number two slot, suggesting that the candidate most likely to
beat Netanyahu run against him, Israel's army radio said.
	   Barak refused.
	   ``I'll be happy if he (Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio,
``(but) I am the one who leads us.''
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, pledged to implement the Wye River Memorandum.
	   In a sudden show of support for Netanyahu, Jewish settler
council leader Pinhas Wallerstein said the council would try to
persuade right wing legislators to vote against early elections,
Israel Radio said.
	   The settlers helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned
against him after he signed the Wye Accords. Monday's announcement
indicated the settlers' concern that new elections would bring to
power a government that would carry out further West Bank troop
withdrawals.
	   Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about
polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu by five percent.
	   ``All I can say is that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996
being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to Labor
candidate Shimon Peres whom Netanyahu beat in a tight race in 1996.

Japan sets economic growth target at 0.5 percent for fiscal 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has set its economic growth target at 0.5
percent for fiscal 1999, the lowest initial growth forecast since
the World War II, the government said Sunday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency also revised down its growth target
for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, to minus 2.2
percent, said an agency official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
	   The new target for next fiscal year and the revised estimate for
fiscal 1998 were approved Sunday at an extraordinary meeting of
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet, the official said.
	   The low forecasts reflect the dim outlook for the world's
second-largest economy, which is mired in its worst recession in at
least five decades. They also raise questions about Prime Minister
Obuchi's ability to fulfill a pledge to engineer a full recovery
within two years.
	   The previous record low initial estimate of Japan's gross
domestic product _ the measure of all goods and services produced
in the country _ was 1.9 percent, which was made for fiscal 1997
and the fiscal year which began in April.
	   Japan first revised this year's estimate down to a 1.8 percent
contraction in October. Sunday's Cabinet decision marked the second
downward revision for fiscal 1998.
	   The forecast for the coming year was made on the basis of
expectations for a gentle recovery in consumer spending and a
slight increase in spending on housing and public works projects,
the EPA official said.
	   The official said consumer spending will likely increase by 0.1
percent on the year, housing spending will rise by 0.3 percent and
public works-related expenditure will grow by 0.8 percent.
	   The Japanese economy shrank 0.4 percent last year. A second
consecutive year of negative growth would be a postwar first for
Japan.

Iraq declares victory after U.S., British airstrikes end

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The morning after the United States and
Britain ended punishing airstrikes on Iraq, Iraqi newspapers
declared victory and pledged not to compromise on contentious U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline Sunday in
Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve but victory
with God's help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is published by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
	   The papers also suggested that Iraq would stand by its vow to
end the work of the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   It was Iraq's failure to cooperate with UNSCOM that prompted the
United States and Britain to launch airstrikes overnight
Wednesday-Thursday. U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair called a halt to the bombardment Saturday
night.
	   As Al-Jumhuriya put it in a red headline at the top of its front
page: ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate.''
	   Iraq has long contended that it has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   But UNSCOM, headed by Richard Butler, says Iraq still is
concealing weapons and the means to produce them.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that the weapons
are eliminated.
	   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan on Saturday night
announced that the Baghdad regime no longer would work with UNSCOM,
declaring ``its mission is over.''
	   It was not immediately clear what would happen to the U.N.
weapons inspectors, who were evacuated last week to Bahrain, or the
more than 100 U.N. humanitarian workers taken by bus to the
Jordanian capital Amman.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM, said in Bahrain on
Sunday that 50 inspectors there were ``sitting tight and waiting
for further instructions from New York.''
	   Other inspections, she said, had been sent home for the
holidays.
	   U.N. officials in Amman refused to say when humanitarian workers
would return to Baghdad. When they were evacuated last week, U.N.
officials said they would be brought back as soon as possible to
resume oversight of U.N. aid programs.
	   The Iraqi government has not released a final casualty toll from
the airstrikes, but previous reports indicated that at least 42
people were killed and 96 wounded.
	   Despite the halt to American and British airstrikes, air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad at about 8:15 a.m. (0515 gmt) Sunday. The
sirens were not accompanied by any anti-aircraft fire, and it
appeared they were sounded in error.
	   Clinton, in announcing an end to the attacks, said he hoped U.N.
arms inspectors could return to Baghdad with full Iraqi
cooperation.
	   Blair made a similar statement and said Sunday that ``we want to
see the weapons inspectors go back in there.''
	   Both leaders threatened further military action, if necessary,
to force Iraqi compliance.
	   The U.N. teams not only must eliminate weapons of mass
destruction but also are responsible for a long-term monitoring
program to ensure Saddam doesn't rebuild his arsenal.
	   After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction for Iraq and
failed to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all
this suffering and it ends as if nothing has happened,'' said
Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.
	   On Saturday night, two missiles struck near the Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth.
	   Al-Thawra said Sunday that 15 people were wounded in the attack
and six cars were destroyed. Iraqi officials had said Saturday that
three guards were injured.
	   Witnesses also reported missile hits near Al-Mustansiriya
University in central Baghdad, and smoke could be seen rising from
the area.
	   The last attack came soon after Baghdad's residents broke their
fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks
Prophet Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God 1,400 years ago.
Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month.

Injured Olympic champion taken home

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc
Cretier was taken home by ambulance Sunday, the day after suffering
a season-ending knee injury.
	   Team officials quoted the French skier as saying that he was
thinking of retirement following his worst injury in a 13-year
career.
	   Cretier added however that he would take a final decision
following surgery and rehabilitation.
	   The 32-year-old French downhiller tore the cruciate ligament of
his left knee and fractured his left hand following a high-speed
spill in the upper part of the icy Saslong track during Saturday's
World Cup downhill in Val Gardena.
	   Cretier, who lives in La Plagne, lost his balance following a
jump, skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and
grass.
	   He was one of the five skiers who suffered season-ending knee
injuries in falls during consecutive downhills in this north
Italian valley.
	   Cretier, who never won a World Cup race, captured the Olympic
downhill title in Nagano this year beating Lasse Kjus and Hannes
Trinkl.

Share purchase heralds more consolidation in Taiwan airline
</HEADLINE>
industry

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a sign of consolidation in Taiwan's
crowded domestic airline industry, Far East Air Transport Corp. has
agreed to buy a 9.83 percent stake in TransAsia Airways, the
company said Sunday.
	   The airlines will share ground services at some destinations to
help lower overhead costs and make operations more economical, the
company said in a statement.
	   Taiwan's government has encouraged consolidation to reduce
losses in the industry, which is characterized by intense
competition and a limited number of routes, _ all of which are
short, cheap flights.
	   The industry has received a double wallop this year from
aftershocks of the Asian economic crisis and cancellations
following a string of aviation mishaps.
	   In July, Great China Airlines and Taiwan Airlines were absorbed
by UNI Airlines, a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group, which also
owns international carrier EVA Airways.
	   Far East's move brings most domestic air traffic under three
main airline groups. China Airlines operates domestic flights on
its own and through subsidiary Formosa Airlines.

Opposition head demands release of report on Malaysia's former No.
</HEADLINE>
2 leader

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - An opposition leader in Malaysia's
Parliament has questioned why a police report on the alleged
beating of the country's jailed former deputy premier has not been
released.
	   The opposition lawmaker, Lim Kit Siang, called in a statement
released Sunday for the Southeast Asian nation's attorney-general,
Mohtar Abdullah, to publicize the report immediately.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, the ex-deputy premier, has said he was beaten by
police officers after being arrested on Sept. 20. He later appeared
in court with an apparent black eye and other bruises on his face.
	   The former No. 2 leader is on trial for abuse of power and faces
separate charges of sexual misconduct. Anwar, however, denies all
the allegations against him, saying they are part of a political
plot to discredit him.
	   Attorney-General Mohtar received the report on Nov. 19 from a
special team investigating the alleged police brutality. But Mohtar
said earlier this month that he and senior prosecutors were still
studying the report.
	   Lim, who is the secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party, also demanded an explanation for the delay by the
attorney-general.

U.N. official reports progress in Cyprus talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ U.N.-sponsored shuttle talks between the
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Cyprus are making
progress and reducing tension, a U.N. official said Sunday.
	   The remarks were made at a news conference by Dame Ann Hercus,
who is conducting the talks as a representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``I believe we have a substantive and substantial process under
way,'' she told reporters. ``I would not continue if progress was
not being made.''
	   Hercus, a former New Zealand Cabinet minister, has spent the
past eight weeks shuttling across the U.N. buffer zone for separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
	   The talks ``have the dual goal of reducing tension and promoting
progress toward a just and lasting settlement,'' she said.
	   She said she was ``genuinely encouraged by the two leaders'
positive and constructive approach to the goal set by the
secretary-general.'' She refused to give details.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Tension has risen on the island following the Greek Cypriot
decision to purchase Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has warned it will prevent deployment of the missiles.
Greece, which has a joint defense agreement with Cyprus, has said
it will defend the Greek Cypriots if they are attacked by Turkey.
	   Clerides has been under intense pressure from the United States
and the European Union to cancel the missile deployment. No firm
date for the deployment has yet been announced.
	   Direct talks between Clerides and Denktash have not been held
since August 1997, when Denktash walked out. He said he would not
resume face-to-face negotiations unless the Turkish Cypriot state
was recognized and the European Union canceled its entry
negotiations with Cyprus.

	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA (AP) _ Fred Kalt has that rugged, Steve
McQueen look. Angular jaw, sharp nose, ice-blue eyes with not a
trace of casualness in them.
	   Average height, average build, he speaks softly and slowly. His
cool head, that sureness under pressure, would make him ideal for
the role of a hero in a Hollywood blockbuster.
	   After high school in Tampa, Florida, he went straight into the
Coast Guard at 18. There was never any doubt about his decision.
``I wanted to experience a search and rescue,'' he says. ``To save
a person, a life, in conditions no one else would want to risk
themselves in.''
	   Twenty years later, he's a flight engineer in Sitka, Alaska,
husband to a woman named Barbara, father to two girls. It's after
midnight, Jan. 31, 1998, and he's crouched in the darkness of a
Jayhawk helicopter, ready to fly into a powerful storm in the Gulf
of Alaska.
	   Next to him sit Michael Fish, a rescue swimmer, and Lee Honnold,
on board as a backup flight mechanic. In the cockpit, Lt. Steven
Torpey and his co-pilot, Cmdr. Theodore Le Feuvre, are firing up
the engines.
	   This is the third helicopter being sent to attempt a rescue of
five men whose fishing vessel, the La Conte, sank in the
Fairweather Grounds. The first nearly crashed into the ocean and
returned without any of the survivors. The second is on scene but
losing fuel rapidly.
	   It's almost a miracle the fishermen haven't frozen to death yet.
They've been floating in 38-degree (3.3 C) water and mountainous
seas for more than 5 hours. The longest anyone should expect to
survive in water that cold _ in calm seas _ is roughly 4 1-2 hours.
	   Even by Coast Guard standards, this is classified as a high-risk
mission, meaning the survivors are close to perishing and the
rescuers are flying in life-threatening conditions.
	   It's one of those missions that gets talked about for years in
the remotest of air bases, in academy classrooms. It's the test of
Kalt's life. He wouldn't be anywhere else.
	   His team is better prepared than the first two. They've got an
extra flight mechanic, chemical ``glow sticks'' so the survivors
will see the rescue basket in the dark, 26 special flares that burn
for 50 minutes, and 700 extra pounds (300 extra kilograms) of fuel.
	   Kalt's going over this checklist in his mind when Le Feuvre's
voice crackles over the intercom.
	   ``We're launching, boys. Hang on.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   They are on the scene 49 minutes later, in complete darkness.
	   Torpey and Le Feuvre, as they will tell it later, are fighting
headwinds, blurred dials and nausea as they try to keep the
pitching aircraft out of the waves.
	   Kalt and Honnold crouch by the jump door, shouting altitudes
above the roar of ice and snow. The helicopter is rising and
falling like a roller coaster.
	   Through the sleet and snow rattling on his visor and helmet,
Kalt spots strips of reflective tape on waving arms.
	   ``Survivors!'' he shouts.
	   Kalt drops nine flares. They hit water and shoot white light.
Next, he lowers the rescue basket. It lands in a trough several
hundred yards (meters) downwind of the men _ too far for them to
swim for it.
	   From his knees, Honnold shouts directions to the pilots. For 20
minutes, Kalt keeps hoisting and dropping the basket, trying to get
it closer, but he can't do it.
	   Fish, the 30-year-old rescue swimmer, offers to jump into the
maelstrom to help the survivors into the basket.
	   ``Appreciate the offer, Mike,'' Torpey remembers shouting back,
``but we don't want to have pull you out, too.''
	   Kalt is tossing out more flares when a hammerhead clobbers them.
The down draft drives the Jayhawk backward a quarter mile (a half
kilometer) and down into a trough.
	   Hannold, Kalt and Fish are screaming ``UP! UP! UP!'' Torpey and
Le Feuvre are practically yanking the joystick out of the floor to
give them lift power. If one wave hits us, Le Feuvre remembers
thinking, we're dead.
	   The radar altimeter reads 40 feet (12 meters). Seconds pass. The
altimeter is still at 40. This can't be, Le Feuvre says to himself.
I'm pulling this helicopter up at full power. We should be going
straight up.
	   They ARE climbing, but below them, a wave is rising at the same
speed.
	   ``Well, Lord, I'm going to meet you,'' Le Feuvre remembers
thinking. ``But do I have to go out being cold and wet?''
	   And then, they're clear. They've outraced the wave.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Ten minutes later, they're back over the survivors. As Kalt
lowers the basket, he notices that its 3-8 -inch (10-mm) cable is
rubbing against the grating on the face of the searchlight on the
helicopter's belly.
	   The basket bounces wildly from crest to trough. After 20
minutes, Torpey manages to drag the basket closer and closer until
it's within 5 yards (meters) of the survivors.
	   Through his binoculars, Honnold sees one of the men break from
the group, thrash across the water and claw his way into the
basket.

SAfrican businessman eyes share in Britain's Everton soccer club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Cape Town investment banker
said his family plans to buy a majority share in Everton, the
English Premier League soccer club, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Ian Kilbride and his English-based father, Bill, would bid on
the shares owned by Peter Johnson, the Sunday Independent of
Johannesburg said.
	   Johnson, who owns 60 percent of the club, resigned as Everton
chairman last month after a dispute with his manager over the sale
of striker Duncan Ferguson to Newcastle.
	   Johnson arranged the transfer without informing manager Walter
Smith, who threatened to quit because he was kept in the dark.
	   Kilbride, 38, runs an investment and banking group with seven
offices in South Africa. His father is the chief executive of a
British-based investment company.
	   ``We have been involved with Everton for a long time as a
family,'' Kilbride was quoted as saying. ``I personally know Peter
Johnson quite well.''
	   Kilbride added that Johnson has not made a formal decision to
sell either all or part of his shares.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   He shouts: ``Survivor in the basket!''
	   Kalt throws the hoist in gear. The basket is swinging and
spinning, foam scudding from it. Kalt steadies the cable, and
within 10 seconds it's hanging in front of the jump door. He grabs
the basket and hauls it in.
	   A man rolls out and curls up in a fetal position. Fish slides
him back into a corner, slits off his survival suit and slips a
thermal-insulated sack over him.
	   ``What's your name?''
	   ``Mo-Mo-Mork,'' he stutters. ``William Mork.''
	   The basket is already going down again. It splashes into a
trough 10 yards (meters) from the survivors. Once again, the cable
is sawing against the search light. If it snaps, Kalt thinks, it's
over.
	   Kalt can't see well through the ice and snow, but it looks as if
someone is swimming toward the basket. He waits for a tug in the
line.
	   A gust of wind buffets the chopper. The hoist cable shrieks and
goes taut as a fiddle string, lashing the Jayhawk's hull. Crewmen
are shouting, the hoist is moaning. The pilots force down the
helicopter's nose to steady the aircraft.
	   Kalt struggles to the hoist control, finds it still operable.
But the helicopter's high-frequency antenna is gone. The hoist
cable has ripped it off. Worse, the cable is now frayed.
	   Below, the basket rises, bouncing like a yo-yo in the wind. It
comes up, up, up until it is hanging just outside of the jump door.
	   ``Hey!'' yells Kalt. ``Someone's still in the basket!''
	   He grabs the metal cage and pulls. It doesn't budge. He pulls
again. Stuck.
	   ``Pull, Lee! Pull!'' Kalt shouts. Both men lean back, pulling
with all the strength in their cramping muscles.
	   Fish, who is tending to Mork on the floor of the cabin, looks
up. Through an opening between Kalt's right leg and the jump door,
he can see why the basket won't enter.
	   A man is dangling from it.
	   Each time Kalt and Honnold try to yank the basket in, the
dangling man's arms and head get rammed against the lip of the jump
door.

	   This is the fourth part of a five-day serial. The story so far:
	   With barely enough fuel left to make it back to base, a Coast
Guard helicopter gives up its rescue efforts, leaving five
fishermen adrift in the frigid waters of the Gulf of Alaska. A
second helicopter has arrived on the scene, but its crew, fighting
powerful winds, has been unable to rescue the swimmers. Finally,
this helicopter, too, is forced to give up and return to base. The
fishermen have been immersed in 38-degree (3.3 C) water, bludgeoned
by huge waves, for almost 6 hours now. With every minute, their
chances of survival diminish.

Iraq declares victory after U.S., British airstrikes end

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The morning after the United States and
Britain ended punishing airstrikes on Iraq, Iraqi newspapers
declared victory Sunday and pledged not to compromise on
contentious U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in the
Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve but victory
with God's help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is published by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
	   The papers also suggested that Iraq would stand by its vow to
end the work of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   It was Iraq's failure to cooperate with UNSCOM that prompted the
United States and Britain to launch airstrikes overnight
Wednesday-Thursday. U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair called a halt to the bombardment Saturday
night.
	   As the newspaper Al-Jumhuriya put it in a red headline at the
top of its front page: ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate.''
	   Iraq has long contended that it has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the elimination of its chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   But UNSCOM, headed by Richard Butler, says Iraq still is
concealing weapons and the means to produce them.
	   U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that the weapons
have been eliminated.
	   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan on Saturday night
announced that the Baghdad regime no longer would work with UNSCOM,
declaring ``its mission is over.''
	   It was not immediately clear what would happen to the U.N.
weapons inspectors, who were evacuated last week to Bahrain, or the
more than 100 U.N. humanitarian workers taken by bus to the
Jordanian capital Amman.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM, said in Bahrain on
Sunday that 50 inspectors there were ``sitting tight and waiting
for further instructions from New York.''
	   Other inspectors, she said, had been sent home for the holidays.
	   U.N. officials in Amman refused to say when the humanitarian
workers would return to Baghdad. When they were evacuated last
week, U.N. officials said they would be brought back as soon as
possible to resume oversight of U.N. aid programs.
	   The Iraqi government has not released a final casualty toll from
the airstrikes, but previous reports indicated that at least 42
people were killed and 96 wounded.
	   Despite the halt to American and British airstrikes, air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad at about 8:15 a.m. (0515 GMT) Sunday. The
sirens were not accompanied by any anti-aircraft fire, and it
appeared they were sounded in error.
	   Clinton, in announcing an end to the attacks, said he hoped U.N.
arms inspectors could return to Baghdad with full Iraqi
cooperation.
	   Blair made a similar statement and said Sunday that ``we want to
see the weapons inspectors go back in there.''
	   Both leaders threatened further military action, if necessary,
to force Iraqi compliance.
	   The U.N. teams not only must eliminate weapons of mass
destruction but also are responsible for a long-term monitoring
program to ensure Saddam doesn't rebuild his arsenal.
	   After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction for Iraq and
failed to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all
this suffering and it ends as if nothing has happened,'' said
Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.
	   On Saturday night, two missiles struck near the Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth.
	   Al-Thawra said Sunday that 15 people were wounded in the attack
and six cars were destroyed. Iraqi officials had said Saturday that
three guards were injured.
	   Witnesses also reported missile hits near Al-Mustansiriya
University in central Baghdad, and smoke could be seen rising from
the area.
	   The last attack came soon after Baghdad's residents broke their
fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks the
Prophet Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God 1,400 years ago.
Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A suspected top aide to Osama Bin Laden,
the Saudi millionaire accused of organizing the deadly bombings at
U.S. embassies in Africa this summer, was turned over to U.S.
officials at Munich airport Sunday for extradition to the United
States.
	   Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman Gerhard Zierl said that
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was taken from Munich's Stadelheim prison to
Munich airport about 9 a.m. and handed over to the Americans. He
was placed on a flight for the United States shortly thereafter.
	   A Bonn government spokesman on Saturday said that the Justice
and Foreign Ministries in Bonn had given final approval for the
extradition of Salim.
	   Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein greeted the
extradition saying it was an ``excellent example of international
cooperation of security officials in the fight against terrorism.''
	   The Federal Constitutional Court cleared the way for the
extradition on Dec. 11, when it declined to accept an appeal
against it from Salim claiming it violated his constitutional
rights.
	   The justice ministry said at the time that extradition would be
approved as soon as the U.S. government gave assurances that Salim
would not face a death penalty, which is forbidden by the German
constitution.
	   Salim, 40, had been jailed since his arrest in Bavaria three
months ago on a U.S. warrant. A Munich state court originally
approved his extradition on Nov. 27.
	   U.S. officials claim Salim is Bin Laden's finance chief and have
charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of weapons
of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are jailed
in the United States.
	   The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.

<TEXT>
	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA (AP) _ Through driving sleet icing his
visor, flight engineer Fred Kalt can barely make out the crouching
figure inside the rescue basket hanging just outside the helicopter
door. He reaches out and gives the basket another yank.
	   Something's wrong. No matter how hard he tries, he can't pull
the basket inside.
	   ``FRED!'' shouts crew member Michael Fish. ``FRED, SOMEONE'S
HANGING ON THE BASKET!''
	   ``Where?,'' Kalt screams into the wind. ``I CAN'T SEE HIM!''
	   The man is inches (centimeters) below Kalt's boots, barely
clinging to the bottom of the basket. He looks into the cabin and
locks eyes with Fish.
	   For a second. Just one second.
	   Time enough for everything to pause in Fish's mind, for the
whining sleet and the groaning turbines to hush.
	   Time enough for one man's eyes to scream for mercy, for
another's to scream in horror.
	   And then he's gone.
	   The altimeter on the cabin wall reads 1-0-3. One hundred and
three feet (31 meters). My God, Fish remembers thinking, that's far
for a man to fall.
	   The clunk of steel on the deck snaps Fish out of his thoughts.
It's the rescue basket. Kalt and flight mechanic Harold Lee Honnold
have finally pulled it in.
	   Inside the basket is the second man they have managed to pull
from the sea. His cheeks are the color of ice. Icicles twitch in
his beard.
	   ``Bob?'' Fish whispers. ``Bob Doyle?''
	   He knows this man. They once worked together at the Coast
Guard's air base in Sitka.
	   Fish strips off Doyle's waterlogged suit and wraps him in a
thermal bag. Doyle has survived more than 7 1-2 hours in 38-degree
(3.3 C) water.
	   ``Bob,'' Fish remembers asking. ``How many men were on the
ship?'' He puts his ear next to Doyle's blue lips.
	   ``Five.''
	   ``Not four?''
	   ``Five.''
	   ``Who just fell from the basket?''
	   ``Mark Morley, our skipper.''
	   From the cockpit, Torpey sees one survivor at the strobe and
another man floating 100 feet (30 meters) downwind. Where is the
fifth man? Torpey checks his fuel: To make it back to Sitka base,
they have to leave now.
	   Torpey thinks a moment, then gives everyone the plan.
	   They will save the man at the strobe. They will try to recover
Morley. They will look for the unsighted fifth fisherman. Then,
they'll fly to the Yakutat airbase, not Sitka station. Yakutat is
70 miles (110 kilometers) away _ half as far as Sitka _ and they
can ride a tailwind, which will save fuel.
	   Kalt lowers the basket, but he's worried about the cable. It is
frayed badly now and could snap or jam in the hoist drum as it
spools. For several minutes the basket bobs empty.
	   ``What's he waiting for?'' Honnold remembers saying.
	   Finally, the survivor leaves the buoy and thrashes his way to
the basket. Kalt throws the hoist gear in reverse, and forty
seconds later, Mike Decapua is in the helicopter.
	   ``What took you so long?'' Fish jokes.
	   ``I couldn't see it,'' Decapua says. ``I got long hair. It was
in my eyes.''
	   Torpey banks into a hover above Morley. The basket touches down
right next to him, but he doesn't move. They bump him with the
basket. Nothing. They try to scoop him up with the basket, but it
doesn't work.
	   After 20 minutes of this, Torpey and Le Feuvre call it quits.
They've been in the air nearly 3 hours. The crew is dehydrated and
dizzy with vertigo. The three rescued men are hypothermic. And fuel
is dangerously low. Torpey takes them up to 300 feet (90 meters),
drops the nose and starts for Yakutat.
	   Kalt pulls off his helmet and visor. The muscles in his legs
flutter and a queasiness rises in the pit of his stomach. He
doesn't feel much like a hero. He just feels exhausted.
	   At his feet sits the rescue basket. The light sticks inside it
still glow a feeble green. Kalt stares at the sticks until they die
out.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   At daybreak the wind is blowing hard, but seas are down to 40
feet (12 meters) and the sleet has softened to a cold rain that
dances along the water.
	   At first light, two Coast Guard C-130 planes from Kodiak and a
helicopter from Sitka station begin crisscrossing the Fairweather
Grounds. Shortly after 3:30 p.m., the helicopter plucks a body from
the sea not 10 miles (16 kilometers) from where the La Conte sank.
It is identified as that of Mark Morley. He will be buried six days
later in his hometown, Plymouth, Michigan.
	   But David Hanlon is still out there somewhere.
	   An area twice the size of Cyprus is combed before the search is
called off at 5 p.m., Wednesday, Feb. 4, 94 hours and dlrs 678,545
after it began.
	   People reckon it'll be a week or so before a crabbing boat spots
Hanlon's body or his remains turn up in a fishing net.
	   But a week passes. Then a month. Then six months.
	   For Hanlon's five sisters and two brothers, life drifts. Without
a body, they can't say their goodbyes.

IN THE GULF OF ALASKA: their goodbyes.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Jesse Evans, 17, and his friend George Connors, 16, dropped
anchor in Bear Cove on uninhabited Shuyak Island because the deer
hunting there is good.
	   They were following a bear trail through a spruce forest when
the red, neoprene mitten appeared before them. Jesse was picking at
it with his hunting knife when he felt the kick of George's boot.
	   ``I see something!'' George shouted.
	   They bolted down the trail to a ring of spruce trees. Parting
the branches, they stepped inside the bear den.
	   In the center was a fresh mound of dirt, a bear bed. Draped
across it was the top half of a survival suit, severed at the
waist, with a jagged rip down the back. The hood was missing.
	   Within an hour, a Coast Guard helicopter lowered state troopers
Steve Hall and Tom Dunn to the beach so the boys could show them
what they had found.
	   The troopers plucked bone chips, strands of hair and pieces of
wetsuit from the dirt and dropped them into a plastic bag. They
also took the fingers and bits of skin Jesse had plucked from the
mitten.
	   Dunn wondered: Who is this person in my evidence bag? Where did
he come from? How did he end up here?
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The Alaska state crime laboratory needed 18 days to identify the
remains.
	   The investigation started with the wetsuit, which had the word
``Tomboy'' stenciled on its back. Calls to skippers of boats named
Tomboy led to a man who said someone had borrowed one of his
survival suits to use on the La Conte.
	   Next, Walter McFarlane, an examiner at the Anchorage crime lab,
checked the ridge patterns of the skin Jesse had plucked from the
mitten. Comparing it to fingerprints state troopers kept on file,
he announced, on Sept. 1, that he'd found a match.
	   The remains belonged to David Hanlon.
	   Somehow, the counterclockwise current in the Gulf of Alaska had
swept the body an incredible 650 miles (1,000 kilometers), where it
washed up on Shuyak. What condition it was in when it reached the
shore, no one will ever know.
	   No one, that is, except the black bear that ambled to the beach
one day and found the last crewman of a doomed ship.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Postscript: The five members of the last rescue team _ Lt.
Stephen Torpey, Lt. Cmdr. Theodore Le Feuvre, rescue swimmer
Michael Fish, flight mechanic Harold Lee Honnold and flight
engineer Fred Kalt _ were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross,
the highest aviation honor given in peacetime. The crews of the
other two rescue helicopters received commendation medals.
	   Tamara Westcott, fiancee of the lost skipper, Mark Morley, gave
birth to his son last summer. She named him Mark. The three
surviving fishermen, William Mork, 39, Mike Decapua, 41, and Robert
Doyle, 39, recovered from hypothermia and still fish the high seas.

	   This is the final part of a five-day serial. The story so far:
	   A mitten and five fingers found on an uninhabited island by two
teen-agers turn out to be the final clues to a 6-month-old mystery
in the Gulf of Alaska. It all began when a fishing vessel, the La
Conte, sank during a violent storm, throwing five crewmen into
38-degree (3.3 C) water. Two Coast Guard helicopters have flown
into the mouth of the storm in failed rescue attempts. Now a third
helicopter is on the scene, fighting downdrafts that have nearly
driven it into the sea. This helicopter crew has succeeded in
pulling one fisherman from the water. Now, the crew has managed to
get a second man into its rescue basket. The basket is hanging
right outside the helicopter door now, but the crew can't seem to
pull it inside.

Back in view, pope bitter over failure to resolve crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday used his first
public appearance since a bout with the flu to express sadness over
the airstrikes of Iraq and bitterness that international bodies
have failed to resolve the crisis.
	   Before he developed a fever Friday that the Vatican said was
caused by a light flu and had to cancel appointments, the pontiff,
via his spokesman, had made it known that he was distressed by the
U.S.-British attacks. The Holy See denounced the action as
``aggression.''
	   On Sunday, the pope appeared at his studio window for his weekly
blessing to those gathered in St. Peter's Square. Bundled up in a
red cloak despite Rome's mild weather, with temperatures in the
mid-teens C (high 50s F), the pope didn't linger at the window as
he often does to banter with the crowd.
	   Instead he devoted most of his message to Iraq.
	   ``The holiday atmosphere renders even more intense the suffering
for all that has happened in these days to the Iraqi people, in the
face of whose drama no one can remain indifferent,'' the pope said.
	   ``To my deep sorrow for the situation of that people is united
bitterness in noting how often are disappointed the hopes rooted in
the validity and force of international law and in the
organizations called to guarantee its application,'' the pope
added, in a clear reference to the United Nations.
	   John Paul then reiterated his contention that war can never
solve problems.
	   ``Thus, more than ever, it is the Iraqi people who must be at
the center of concern of all those, in Iraq and elsewhere, who have
the duty to resolve the crisis,'' the pope said, appealing for
``human solidarity and respect for international order'' to
prevail.
	   The pope, looking tired and coughing at the end of his speech,
kept his appearance briefer than usual.

Mafia boss killed in shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ One of the purported leaders of the
Bulgarian mafia was shot and killed early Sunday at a villa near
Sofia, police reported.
	   Ivo Karamanski had joined a party when a quarrel among guests
ended in a shootout in which the 39-year-old crime boss was gunned
down, police said.
	   Karamanski and his bodyguard, identified by police only as
Dragomir P., died on the spot. Two other guests were wounded.
	   Police later announced that the assailant was arrested. They
identified him as a 33-year-old man, who had shot Karamanski and
his bodyguard with a Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifle.
	   Karamanski, 1981 national rowing champion, ran a prosperous
insurance company. In 1986, he was sentenced to a two-year prison
term for fraud.
	   He was believed to have been one of the key figures in
Bulgaria's underworld.
	   Despite his reputation, Karamanski maintained good connections
with police and judiciary officials and once celebrated his release
from detention by having a very public cup of coffee with the state
prosecutor.
	   Karamanksi was among the founders of criminal groups set up by
former athletes who controlled the shady business in the country.
	   In the nine years since Bulgaria threw out the Communist regime,
those men, formerly famous for their sports records, have gone from
being legitimate bodyguards to operating shady ``security''
services.
	   But the relatively effective measures of the current government
against them forced them to turn recently to insurance business.
	   Some, however, have met violent ends.
	   Street shootings between gangs and bombings have become
commonplace in this impoverished Balkan country.
	   In 1995, Vasil Iliev, a national wrestling champion in 1988 and
one-time head of the Bulgarian wrestling federation, and former
weightlifter Georgi ``the Bear'' Nikolov were gunned down in
separate incidents, apparently in turf battles.
	   Reports of street and organized crime have increased in Bulgaria
reflecting the economic downturn, moral decay and poor law
enforcement nine years after the collapse of communism.

Euro sidelines Britain, and critics say that's where smart money
</HEADLINE>
is &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Europe embarks on a revolution by adopting a
single currency, with Britain, in a familiar role, as the big
outsider.
	   But this time, those who believe Britain's is the smartest
positioning go well beyond the habitual Euroskeptic line-up of
stridently nationalistic tabloids, right-wing legislators who
oppose membership in the European Union, and traditionalists who
can't imagine life without a pound sterling stamped with Queen
Elizabeth II's head.
	   Economists, bankers and business executives are among those who
fear the euro, which 11 of the 15 EU nations adopt Jan. 1, will
either falter or succeed only at the price of a political merger
into a United States of Europe.
	   Critics point to myriad difficulties _ the long delay before
euro notes and coins are issued in 2002; the lack of a single
European government to take responsibility in a banking crisis;
different governments putting different pressures on the new
European Central Bank; national rivalries that a single currency
won't dissolve.
	   ``Britain is going to benefit enormously by being outside the
muddle and the mess,'' said Tim Congdon, a former economist with
the investment house Lehman Brothers and a one-time government
economic adviser.
	   ``Also, we are in control of our own destiny. If we face a
recession next year, we can cut interest rates according to our own
requirements,'' added Congdon, director of Lombard Street Research,
a London-based consulting firm.
	   While the majority of Britain's big business leaders support the
Labor Party government's policy of adopting the euro early next
century if it works well, some critics would rule out relinquishing
the pound for about a decade _ and perhaps longer.
	   Elsewhere in the EU, others have made fruitless pleas to delay
the launch of the euro, a project that has been driven by France
and Germany.
	   In May, 150 German economics professors urged a two-year delay,
saying European labor markets need to become more flexible before
countries are locked into a single interest rate.
	   ``The current state of economic affairs is most unsuitable for
starting monetary union,'' the group said in a letter to The
Financial Times, the London daily.
	   Critics argue that labor flexibility _ the ability or
willingness to leave native regions or even countries to find work
_ is a big difference between Europeans and Americans, and a key
flaw in the argument that the euro will rank alongside the dollar.
	   If people are prepared to move where there is work, the effects
of regional or national economic downturns are lessened: Fewer
people are out of work, and wages, because of competition for jobs
from outsiders, are kept down, making products more competitive.
	   However, for a start, relatively generous welfare programs are a
disincentive to labor flexibility in Europe, as are barriers of
language and nationality.
	   ``I do not believe that the onset of a single currency will
suddenly make the Germans, the French and the Italians mold into
some amorphous Euro-person,'' said Lord Marsh, head of Business for
Sterling, a body of business leaders formed this year to oppose
British membership in the euro.
	   While the U.S. administration wants the euro to work _ everyone
agrees collapse would be a disaster with enormous international
repercussions _ and many economists think it will, some American
experts see the euro encouraging trans-Atlantic tension.
	   Economists Martin and Kathleen Feldstein, writing in The Boston
Globe, maintained that greater uniformity of social benefits _ now
less generous in poorer EU countries like Portugal _ will tempt a
less-competitive Europe to construct trade barriers.
	   ``Even more serious, the European political union that will
follow the establishment of the EMU (economic and monetary union)
will change the political character of Europe in ways that could
lead to increased conflicts in Europe and to confrontations with
the United States,'' the Feldsteins said.
	   And that, for British critics, is the bottom line: In the end,
they say, the euro means political union.
	   It is a prospect that can be a more telling argument than
current anti-euro realities, such as Britain's economic cycle being
out of synch with continental Europe, its taxes some 25 percent
lower and its interest rates higher.
	   ``This can't work without political union, and that means the
end of Britain as a single nation,'' said Congdon, the economist.
``I don't deny there would be enormous benefits from having a
single currency across Europe in the long run. There would
obviously be benefits from having a single world currency _ but
there are drawbacks.''

Germans sweep women's pursuit

<TEXT>
	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Uschi Disl captured her third World Cup
victory in a week and led a German sweep in the 10-kilometer
biathlon pursuit Sunday.
	   Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm, who won Saturday's 7.5K sprint,
placed second in the pursuit, and Katrin Apel was third.
	   All three Germans missed three targets each.
	   Disl clocked a time of 31 minutes, 26.5 seconds to gain her 17th
World Cup victory and grab a share of the overall season lead.
	   Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden, who had to do four penalty laps
after missing four targets, finished fourth, 33.6 seconds behind
Disl. Both women now have 154 points, but Disl holds the advantage
because of more victories in the current season.

Games, gambling, gusto: Italy starts off enthusiastic for euro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY385 of Dec. 16, Graphic EURO COIN &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Euro-games made it on to Italians' Christmas lists
this year. And Santa ordered up more than a few new sets of house
keys, thanks to mortgage rates brought way, way down by rules to
enter the euro club.
	   Like a child delighting over a pile of presents, Italy has
reacted with gusto to the European Union's plans for a monetary
union, culminating in the Jan. 1 launch of the common currency, the
euro.
	   Survey after survey says Italians are the most enthusiastic
europhiles among the 11 nations joining the new single currency. A
survey a year ago found 78 percent of them favored the euro, with
the Irish a bit back at 67 percent and Finns far behind at 33
percent. Four EU nations _ Britain, Denmark, Greece and Sweden _
are staying out of the euro club for now.
	   Sure, Italy's lira was once a laughingstock currency because
sky-high inflation and devaluations eroded its value compared with
neighboring currencies. But studies indicate the Italian embrace of
the euro is as much linked to the perception of practical benefits
as to points of pride.
	   ``Italy's adhesion to the euro is very much tied to its internal
situation, its need to put its (economic) house in order,'' said
Giuseppe Roma, director of Censis, an Italian think tank that has
been monitoring the nation's euro fever.
	   ``For the first time, the country couldn't keep postponing''
measures it long and badly needed to adopt to bolster its economy,
he said.
	   Among the tasks Italy tackled on its way to euro membership: It
reined in government spending, slashed public debt and high
inflation, brought interest rates in line with other EU members and
prodded along privatization of state holdings ranging from
telecommunications to banks. The tough criteria were set to bring
the EU economies closer together before the euro launch.
	   It hasn't all been painless. Last year, Italians paid a special
euro tax to help the government meet entry criteria. Public workers
marched in the streets against leaner contracts.
	   And Communists, feeling betrayed by budget cuts for social
services like health care and pensions, yanked their support for
the premier who guided Italy into euro membership, Romano Prodi,
the economics professor whose coalition collapsed in October.
	   ``Italians must not think all their problems will be resolved
through the European Union and the euro,'' Enrico Letta, minister
for European policy, said in an interview. ``But I think Italians
have seen their sacrifices rewarded with visible and immediate
rewards.''
	   This holiday, workers will see 60 percent of the euro tax given
back to them in their ``13th'' paycheck _ their annual Christmas
bonus of an extra month's pay.
	   Perhaps the biggest benefits to consumers have been an easing of
inflation _ running this year at 1.7 percent, compared with nearly
15 percent in 1983 _ and the freefall of mortgage rates.
	   Just a few years ago, mortgage rates were running in the high
teens, rates that, by today's legal definition, would qualify as
loan-sharking. Now homebuyers are snapping up mortgages at around
4.5 percent.
	   And then there is the unquantifiable when dissecting Italy's
fascination for the euro _ values like identity.
	   ``We don't yet have this European mentality,'' said Tatiana
Enuncio, a sales clerk at BonBon, an accessory shop that was one of
Rome's first stores to display prices both in lire and euros. For
her, using euros will be ``the first step toward the rest of
Europe.''
	   A couple of blocks away, designer stores like Dolce and Gabbana
and Gianfranco Ferre are translating their steep lire prices into
euros. At Dolce and Gabbana, a woman's leather jacket, for example,
goes for 2.4 million lire _ 1,237 euros (dlrs 1,447). A fancy
sleeveless top in Gianfranco Ferre's window was priced at an even 1
million lire _ 515 euros (dlrs 603).
	   While euro coins and bills won't be in circulation before 2002,
consumers can start using credit cards to pay in euros at those
shops that choose to switch early.
	   And Italians can play with fake euros. An educational board game
_ ``Euro: traveling through Europe with the new single currency'' _
was landing in Christmas shopping baskets.
	   Quiz questions include: How often are European citizens called
to vote to renew the European Parliament, the EU's legislative
body? (Answer: every five years.)
	   And to get gamblers euro-ready, the casino in Saint Vincent in
northern Italy will begin operating one slot machine with 50-euro
tokens in February. To attract attention, its top prize will be
worth some 20 times the big prize of current slot machines _ now
roughly dlrs 15,000.

Blair says world is safer since U.S.-British attack on Saddam

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Outlining a strategy of containment of Saddam
Hussein, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that the
U.S.-British attacks on the Iraqi dictator have made the world
safer and set back his military machine by years.
	   ``We have severely damaged Saddam's ability to produce and
repair ballistic missiles. We have severely set back his chemical,
biological and unmanned drone programs,'' Blair told a news
conference Sunday. ``His air defense radar, control centers and
communication facilities in southern Iraq have been severely
damaged and will take years to replace.''
	   ``Saddam is weaker now than he was before we started. His
neighbors, the region, and therefore the world, are safer as a
result,'' Blair said.
	   Part of the containment strategy involves maintaining the threat
of force, Blair said, adding that Britain is to send another
aircraft carrier, H.M.S. Invincible, to the region to that end.
	   Blair said another part of the new strategy would be tougher
enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq and said Britain would
be discussing ways in which an effective weapons inspection program
could resume in Iraq without ``the previous cat and mouse game.''
	   Blair rejected the argument that the only worthwhile mission
would have been to topple Saddam, something he said would involve a
land war in Iraq with hundreds of thousands of Allied troops.
	   ``Just because we can't get into the cage and strike him down,
it doesn't mean we should leave the cage untouched and the bars too
fragile to hold him,'' Blair said. ``What we have done is to put
him back firmly in the cage and secure it.''
	   The bombing campaign involved more than 400 cruise missiles,
more than were used during the 1991 Gulf War, and 200 aircraft
strikes, Blair said.
	   A total of 93 Iraqi targets were hit during the 70-hour, four
day assault, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defense staff,
told the news conference. He said those included 30 weapons of mass
destruction targets, 33 air defense sites, 20 command centers, and
10 targets connected with the elite Republican Guard.
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to the Republican Guard which
Saddam kept out of harm's way during the Gulf War,'' Guthrie said.
``They know now they can no longer hide. We have got the ability to
reach out and strike them.''
	   The general said the missions had been planned meticulously to
inflict maximum damage on the Saddam's regime while avoiding harm
to civilians.
	   The objective had been to disable key parts of the Iraqi armed
forces and so render Saddam's one million strong army useless,
Guthrie said.
	   ``The plan was in effect simple,'' he said. ``Just as a car is
made useless with the engine electronics removed, so Saddam's
military machine cannot function without a few key elements.''
	   Earlier on Sunday, Blair said he wanted to see weapons
inspectors get back to work in Iraq and that a policy of
containment is needed to keep Saddam ``in his cage.''
	   The Iraqi dictator is still a threat, albeit a weaker one, he
said.
	   The United States and Britain decided to attack Iraq after the
U.N. Special Commission reported last week that Saddam's regime had
failed to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors.
	   The two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of
mass destruction, and has used them against his neighbors.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Guests at the Sheraton hotel in
downtown Brussels were evacuated briefly after a anonymous caller
warned a bomb had been placed there in retaliation for the air
attacks on Iraq, Belgian television reported Sunday.
	   Guests were taken to a nearby hotel after the call just before
midnight Saturday. They were allowed to return after a police
search revealed nothing suspicious and a second anonymous call
admitted the bomb threat was a hoax, the RTL-TVI network reported.
	   An employee at the hotel contacted Sunday morning, said the
situation was back to normal.

Opposition gathering forces against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort to garner support for his hawkish peace policies
Sunday, opponents from the left and right prepared to face him in
new elections.
	   ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said head of the
right-wing Land of Israel front Michael Kleiner, referring to the
U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords that obligate Israel to
withdraw from parts of the West Bank. Kleiner told Israel TV that
the Land of Israel Front would run its own candidate to challenge
Netanyahu, but declined to say who it would be.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote
Monday to support several conditions he has demanded of the
Palestinians before Israel carries out another promised troop
withdrawal from parts of the West Bank.
	   The opposition Labor Party has announced that it will vote
against Netanyahu's policies, and several right wing members of
Netanyahu's coalition pledged to follow suit.
	   Regardless of the vote's outcome, a motion for early elections
submitted by the Labor Party is practically guaranteed to pass on
the same day.
	   Netanyahu was meeting with Cabinet ministers Sunday to garner
their support for his peace policies.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak opened his campaign Thursday for
the elections slated for April with an emphasis on social issues,
which have typically taken a back seat to the peace process in
national elections.
	   Saturday night, Barak met with Israel's former armed forces
chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored candidate
for prime minister. Shahak declined Barak's invitation to run in
the number two slot, suggesting that the candidate most likely to
beat Netanyahu will run against him, Israel's army radio said.
	   Barak refused.
	   ``I'll be happy if he (Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio,
``(but) I am the one who leads us.''
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, pledged to implement the Wye River Memorandum.
	   In a sudden show of support for Netanyahu, Jewish settler
council leader Pinhas Wallerstein said the council would try to
persuade right wing legislators to vote against early elections,
Israel Radio said.
	   The settlers helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned
against him after he signed the Wye Accords. Monday's announcement
indicated the settlers' concern that new elections would bring to
power a government that would carry out further West Bank troop
withdrawals.
	   Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about
polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu by five percent.
	   ``All I can say is that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996
being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to Labor
candidate Shimon Peres whom Netanyahu beat in a tight race in 1996.

Report: Taiwan's Lee signals willingness to meet China's Jiang
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui has signaled his
willingness to eventually meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
noting an annual meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders presents an
opportunity, a Japanese newspaper reported.
	   In an interview with Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper published
Saturday, Lee was quoted as saying he would eventually like to meet
Jiang when the timing is right.
	   He did not give details, but suggested a meeting might be
possible during the annual summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, of which both Taipei and Beijing are
members, the newspaper reported.
	   However, Lee said a bilateral meeting with Jiang at APEC was
unlikely as long as China continues to protest the Taiwanese
leader's presence at the regional summit.
	   Both leaders have expressed an interest in meeting in the past,
but the issue of where such an encounter would take place is just
one of a number of obstacles.
	   Lee has said he would be willing to visit China on a ``mission
of peace,'' but China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province,
has said it would refuse Lee's demand to be received in his
capacity as the island's president.
	   The two sides have no formal ties, so they keep in contact
through a cumbersome web of semi-official negotiating bodies.
	   Taiwan and China divided in 1949 amid civil war. Beijing
threatens to use force if necessary to reunite with the island.
	   Lee was also quoted saying he wasn't considering running again
for the presidency when his term runs out in 2000, but would
continue as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party through 2002,
the paper reported.
	   Some in Lee's party have speculated Lee would seek another term
if the Nationalists were unable to field a ticket strong enough to
win.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   WASHINGTON _ Impeached by the House of Representatives for
perjury and obstruction of justice, President Bill Clinton has
become only the second chief executive since America's founding to
be ordered to stand trial in the Senate. Hours after the House vote
Saturday, a defiant Clinton rejected calls for resignation and
vowed to remain in office ``until the last hour of the last day of
my term.'' He called for a ``reasonable, bipartisan and
proportionate'' conclusion in the Senate to end the ordeal. The
drama of impeachment played out on a day made even more tumultuous
by a stunning announcement that incoming House Speaker Bob
Livingston would resign over his own marital infidelities.
Republicans quickly coalesced around Illinois Rep. Dennis Hastert
to replace him. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The morning after the United States and
Britain ended punishing airstrikes on Iraq, Iraqi newspapers
declared victory Sunday and pledged not to compromise on
contentious U.N. weapons inspections. ``Victorious again!'' crowed
the banner headline in the Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does
not deserve but victory with God's help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is
published by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
The papers also suggested that Iraq would stand by its vow to end
the work of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Iraq
has long contended that it has complied with U.N. resolutions
calling for the elimination of its chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons as well as long-range missiles. But UNSCOM says Iraq still
is concealing weapons. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and Britain claim success
for their 70-hour air assault on Iraq, but it remains uncertain
whether Saddam Hussein will now resume building an arsenal of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, unhindered by U.N.
inspectors. In announcing a halt to the airstrikes Saturday,
President Bill Clinton said he was satisfied the bombs and missiles
had inflicted ``significant damage'' on the facilities and
mechanisms that support Iraq's clandestine efforts to build weapons
of mass destruction. The president said the United States will
maintain a strong military presence in the Gulf, and ``we will
remain ready to use it'' if Saddam tries to rebuild his weapons of
mass destruction, strikes at his neighbors, challenges allied
aircraft or moves against Kurdish rebels. In London, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said, ``We set out to diminish and degrade
Saddam's military capability, and we have done so.'' (US-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort to garner support for his hawkish peace policies
Sunday, opponents from the left and right prepared to face him in
new elections. ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said
head of the right-wing Land of Israel front Michael Kleiner,
referring to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords that
obligate Israel to withdraw from parts of the West Bank. The prime
minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote Monday to
support several conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians
before Israel carries out another promised troop withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank. The opposition Labor Party has announced
that it will vote against Netanyahu's policies, and several right
wing members of Netanyahu's coalition pledged to follow suit.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians were preparing to
bury 36 men killed last week in a clash with Serbian border guards,
as international officials tried to strengthen unity among Albanian
leaders. Relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed
in a border clash last Monday recovered the bodies from the
Serb-run morgue in Prizren and were to bury them on Sunday. French
and Austrian diplomats led a group of international officials to
the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova for
talks with Serbian officials. ``We want to give a strong signal to
the Kosovo Albanian side (that) it's time now to start real
negotiating at a broad base ... that represents all the Kosovo
Albanian political forces,'' said Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's
Ambassador to Belgrade. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Karin Roten gave Switzerland its
first victory of the season on Sunday, winning a women's World Cup
slalom.
	   Roten, who led after the first leg, overcame building pressure
to secure Switzerland's first podium of the season, to post a
similarly brilliant second run for a winning combined time of 1
minute, 28.81 seconds.
	   The 22-year-old Swiss, who has one other career World Cup
victory, a slalom in Lillehammer, Norway in 1996, beat out American
Kristina Koznick by exactly half a second.
	   The second place also marked Koznick's first podium of the
season.
	   Finishing 15th and 27th in the season's earlier slaloms, Koznick
finally displayed the form which led her to four slalom podium
finishes _ including a win in Are, Swede _ and a second place in
the World Cup slalom standings last season.
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden finished an impressive third.
	   Twentieth out of the start-hut in the first leg, Paerson
overcame deteriorating course conditions to post the eighth-fastest
chrono.
	   The young Swede then gained even more time in the second leg to
vault to third with an aggregate time of 1:29.62.
	   Compatriot and 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla Wiberg
finished fourth, .94 back, with Norway's Trine Bakke placing fifth
in 1:29.88.

Three policemen suspended for looting Britons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Three police officers in a northern
state in India have been suspended following an inquiry into
complaints that they roughed up three British tourists, the
government said Sunday.
	   The officers were temporarily suspended from their jobs for
``misconduct and misrepresenting facts'' after the Britons and the
British embassy in New Delhi complained that police in Chandigarh,
the capital of Punjab and Haryana states, took away their money and
beat them up.
	   An inquiry by a magistrate revealed that police had falsely
registered the arrests in three different places when in fact the
tourists had been picked up together, according to a government
statement.
	   The tourists had been arrested two weeks ago on charges of
illegally possessing narcotics and arms.
	   The government did not comment on the charges of the Britons.

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Milosevic ally blasting US stand on
Albanians; angry Serbs stage protest in town whose mayor found
slain &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tensions were running high in Kosovo
on Sunday as ethnic Albanians prepared to bury 36 people killed by
Serb border guards and hundreds of Serbs protested against ethnic
Albanian separatists in a town whose mayor was found dead last
week.
	   Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced the United States for allegedly favoring ethnic Albanian
separatists and also neighboring Albania for harboring rebels
seeking independence for the Serb province.
	   Relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a
border clash last Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run
morgue in Prizren and were to bury them on Sunday.
	   At the same time, about 300 Serbs in the village of Kosovo
Polje,a few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, staged a protest
Sunday against ethnic Albanian separatists and demanded
high-ranking Serb officials come to address them.
	   The Serbs were angry over the slaying of their mayor, Zvonko
Bojanic, whose body was found Friday shot between the eyes. Serb
leaders have denounced ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' for the
killing.
	   Tensions aroused by the latest violence have dimmed hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province.
	   In the latest diplomatic effort, French and Austrian envoys led
a group of international officials to the provincial capital
Saturday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders, in an attempt to
bring together the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and more moderate
followers of Ibrahim Rugova for talks with Serbian officials.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   He said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani, ``but we
are still short of a real and definite commitment that will lead to
a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The United States has been playing the lead role in trying to
arrange talks between the two sides on the future of the province.
On Sunday, Milosevic ally Zivorad Igic was quoted by the
government's Tanjug news agency as blaming Washington's alleged
``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended fullscale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Igic also blamed neighboring Albanian for ``becoming the main
base for terrorists and their main supplier of arms.''
	   Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the house
of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong international
observer mission, shouting and pointing their machine gun at
Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.

Large protest in Morocco against United States, Britain, Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Tens of thousands of anti-American
demonstrators marched in the streets of the Moroccan capital Sunday
to protest the U.S.-led airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Independent estimates put the number of protesters at between
50,000 and 100,000. The protesters shouted, ``America, Enemy of the
people,'' and ``Clinton, what if you kept busy with with Monica?''
	   American and British flags were also burned.
	   The demonstration Sunday was organized by the National Committee
for the Support of Iraq. It was similar to protests held in Morocco
during the Gulf War in 1991 that were organized by the same group.
	   Behind the first group of demonstrators was a second composed of
Islamic militants. Some of them burned Israeli flags.
	   It was one of the biggest protests by Islamic militants in
Morocco in recent years.

Nepal's opposition file no-trust motion against Koirala
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's opposition filed a no-confidence
motion on Sunday against Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala three
days after King Birendra rejected his plea for fresh election and
instead called for a special parliamentary session.
	   Debate of the motion begins in a week.
	   The king on Thursday had rejected Koirala's request to call
early elections after he lost majority support in parliament. The
king instead called for a meeting of parliament to give the
opposition a chance to form a government.
	   Koirala had recommended dissolving parliament after all 13
ministers from the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal, his
coalition partner, resigned from the government.
	   The king was an absolute monarch until 1990, when a
pro-democracy movement forced constitutional reforms that made the
monarch a figurehead. Nepal has been politically unstable since
then, with five prime ministers in the last four years.

Roten victory gives Swiss first season podium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second run &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Karin Roten gave Switzerland its
first victory of the season on Sunday, winning a women's World Cup
slalom.
	   Roten, who led after the first leg, overcame building pressure
to secure Switzerland's first podium of the season to post a
similarly brilliant second run for a winning combined time of 1
minute, 28.81 seconds.
	   The 22-year-old Swiss, who has one other career World Cup
victory, a slalom in Lillehammer, Norway in 1996, beat out American
Kristina Koznick by half a second.
	   The second place also marked Koznick's first podium of the
season.
	   Finishing 15th and 27th in the season's earlier slaloms, Koznick
finally displayed the form which led her to four slalom podium
finishes _ including a win in Are, Sweden _ and a second place in
the World Cup slalom standings last season.
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden finished an impressive third.
	   Twentieth out of the start-hut in the first leg, Paerson
overcame deteriorating course conditions to post the eighth-fastest
time.
	   The young Swede then gained even more time in the second leg to
vault to third with an aggregate time of 1:29.62.
	   Compatriot and 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla Wiberg
finished fourth, .94 back, with Norway's Trine Bakke placing fifth
in 1:29.88.

Round two begins in violence-plagued St. Petersburg election

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A second round of voting for a
city council began Sunday in an election marred by violence and a
high-profile political assassination.
	   The vote is considered key for Russia's democratic politicians,
whose popularity has been dented by the country's roiling economic
crisis. Just six of 50 seats were decided in the first round two
weeks ago.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the running in the second round of
the race.
	   A total of 88 candidates are running for the remaining 44 seats.
	   Many see the vote as a first battle in a long political season
leading to national parliamentary elections next year and
presidential elections in 2000.
	   At stake is not just leadership of the northern port, but also
control over millions of dollars worth of privatization and budget
revenues in Russia's second largest city, a traditional stronghold
of support for the country's democrats.
	   The election was also considered important because the municipal
legislature has been given enhanced powers under a new city
charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city affairs than
similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Intrigue and violence blighted the run-up to Sunday's balloting.
One candidate was beaten with metal rods. A gunman shot out the
windows of a city council member's apartment with an assault rifle.
	   The most shocking violence came on Nov. 20, when unidentified
gunmen shot and killed the city's top democratic politician, Galina
Starovoitova. An aide was critically wounded in the attack.
	   Starovoitova's assassination galvanized St. Petersburg. Turnout
for the first round was twice as large as expected and democratic
candidates seem poised to win a majority in the city council as a
result.
	   ``The killing has elevated this to a higher level,'' said Leonid
Kesselman, a sociologist and political columnist. ``It's no longer
about local elections, but a symbol of what will begin in Russia
next year.''
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have also claimed the
lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a
prominent banker.
	   Observers reported several violations of election rules,
including a show on television alleging that Yabloko takes money
from the Central Intelligence Agency and the television of an
opinion poll as the elections were underway, which is forbidden.
There were also reports of vote-buying in exchange for money or
vodka.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance.
	   ``We are afraid at night, we don't go out, said Viktor Kazakov
as he cast his ballot. ``We hope the more honest candidates will
win.''
	   Some 5,000 policemen were deployed to ensure security at the
city's 1,483 polling stations in 44 regions, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Election officials predicted that voter turnout would probably
be less than the 40.5 percent who voted in the first round.
Preliminary results were expected early Monday.
	   Turnout was 12.16 percent at midday, compared 15.32 percent at
the same time two weeks ago.
	   ``We would like more, but it seems the turnout will not be less
than 25 percent,'' said Mikhail Amosov, head of Yebloko in St.
Petersburg. ``For Yabloko, of course, the higher turout the
better.''

Four miners killed in Polish copper mine accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A cave-in at a southwestern copper mine
has killed four miners, company officials said Sunday.
	   The accident occurred 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground on
Saturday at the Lubin copper mine, some 300 kilometers (185 miles)
southwest of Warsaw.
	   Piotr Bielawski, spokesman for the KGHM Polska Miedz holding,
which operates the mine, said bodies of the four miners were
recovered overnight.
	   Meanwhile, 24 miners staging a sit-in at the same mine to
protest government-proposed pension changes, decided to suspend
their action at the news of the tragedy.
	   In 41 other coal and copper mines on Sunday, 300 miners
continued the protest that began Dec. 10, the PAP news agency said.
	   Parliament has approved changing retirement rules by setting age
limits of 65 for men and 60 for women. Under the current formula,
miners could retire with full pensions after 25 years of work, no
matter their age.
	   Mining, one of Poland's major industries, is undergoing reforms
as the economy completes the shift from communist-style central
control to free market principles.
	   Improved safety standards and the closure of some mines has
decreased the number of accidents. The government reported 8,882
accidents last year, more than 1,000 fewer than in 1996.

Opposition gathering forces against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cabinet approving conditions; final
version of conditions; Palestinian reaction; background on Shahak;
settlers to back Netanyahu &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort on Sunday to garner support for his hawkish peace
policies, while his opponents on the left and right prepared to
face him in new elections.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote
Monday to support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians
before Israel carries out another troop withdrawal from parts of
the West Bank, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace
accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty _ he has said he will
go to early elections.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally-held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to
declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, and of claims on
Jerusalem as the capital of such a state;
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   The Palestinians, who say they have complied with Wye, derided
the conditions.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these five points, this is an
election campaign,'' said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of the
Palestinian cabinet. ``No matter what direction Israel takes or
whoever becomes prime minister, be it Netanyahu or Barak or Shahak,
there are agreements that must be implemented.''
	   Both opponents of further concessions to the Palestinians and
doves in the opposition who want to accelerate the accords have
announced that they will vote against Netanyahu's policies.
	   ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said Michael
Kleiner, who heads Land of Israel Front, a parliamentary grouping
that opposes any further concessions.
	   Kleiner told Israel TV that the Front _ which includes
legislators in Netanyahu's coalition _ would run its own candidate
to challenge Netanyahu, but declined to say who it would be.
	   Among doves, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, whose party began
the Israel-Palestinian peace process in 1993, was readying for new
elections.
	   Barak met Saturday with Israel's former armed forces chief, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored candidate for prime
minister.
	   Shahak, who has been performing well in polls, declined Barak's
invitation to run alongside him in the number two slot, suggesting
that the candidate most likely to beat Netanyahu run against him,
Israel's army radio said.
	   Barak refused.
	   ``I'll be happy if he (Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio,
``(but) I am the one who leads us.''
	   Israeli media reports say that Shahak may opt to head a centrist
list.
	   Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about
polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu by a statistically
insignificant five percent.
	   ``All I can say is that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996
being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to former
Prime Minister, beaten by Netanyahu in a tight race in 1996.
	   Netanyahu could take heart from a last-minute reversal by
settlers, who on Sunday pledged to back him in parliament.
	   ``At this present time, it would not be beneficial for the
residents and communities (of settlements) to topple the
government,'' said settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar.
	   The settlers helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned
against him after he signed the Wye Accords.
	   The settlers' announcement would move a few legislators who had
been considering bolting the coalition to back Netanyahu's peace
proposals _ but not enough to salvage his government.

Spanish bullfighting world mourns hero matador Antonio Ordonez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish bullfighting world Sunday
mourned the death of one of the country's most respected matadors,
Antonio Ordonez, who died in hospital this weekend.
	   Hundreds of people packed the Esperanza de Triana church in this
southern city for a midday funeral mass. The former bullfighter's
remains were to placed in Seville's town hall for a day of public
homage.
	   On Monday, his remains are to be cremated and, in accordance
with his wishes, his ashes are to be dispersed about the bullring
of his native town of Ronda where he fought so many bulls as he
rose to fame in the 1950s and 1960s.
	   A long time suffering from lung cancer, the 66-year-old former
matador was admitted to hospital Friday. He died a day later.
	   Known for his frill-free, disciplined, classical style of
bullfighting, Ordonez is considered one of the greatest matadors
Spain has produced. His fame spread outside Spain and among his
many friends were the novelist Ernest Hemingway and filmmaker Orson
Welles.
	   ``He was one of the most important matadors of this century,''
bull breeder Alvaro Domecq told reporters. ``His prowess, his
bravery and his knowledge of bulls and the art (of bullfighting)
were unique.''
	   The son of a well-known bullfighter Cayetano Ordonez, Antonio
was born in Ronda in 1932. He became a professional bullfighter in
1951 and is known to have fought more than 2,000 bulls in a career
that spanned some 30 years.
	   ``A Bullfighting Myth Dies'' was the headline of the La Razon
national daily which dedicated its front page to the matador.
	   His first marriage was to Carmen Gonzalez, the sister of fellow
bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin and the rivalry in the bullring
between the two brother-in-laws in the late 1950s inspired
Hemingway's novel, 'The Dangerous Summer.'
	   On his formal retirement in 1971, Ordonez dedicated his time to
breeding bulls and became the owner of the bullring in Ronda.
	   He is survived by his second wife Pilar Lazcano, two daughters
and one grandson, Francisco Rivera Ordonez, currently one of the
country's leading matadors.

Thailand's crown prince closes Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn
formally closed the Asian Games Sunday night, and a barrage of
fireworks punctuated the end of two weeks of sport that temporarily
diverted Thailand from its economic crisis.
	   The games ended with an artistic celebration of ``Amazing
Thailand,'' which could have been a commentary as well on the
frantic last-minute work the nation went through to put on games
that had been jeopardy at various stages during the years of
preparations.
	   China came out far ahead in the gold medals race, winning 129 of
the 378 awarded. South Korea took the very last one, reaching 65
with Olympic silver medalist Lee Bong-ju's victory in the marathon
Sunday morning.
	   Japan had 52 golds, and the top two winners in voting for the
games' most valuable athlete _ sprinter Koji Ito, a triple gold
medalist who ran a 10-flat 100 meters in the semifinals, and Naoko
Takahashi, who missed a world record by just one minute in the
games opening women's marathon.
	   But for Thais, the excitement came from a ``miracle'' soccer
team that upset South Korea in the quarterfinals, and from the home
nation's boxing team, which was 5-for-5 in gold-medal matches. The
Thais ended up with 24 gold medals _ double their best previous
showing.
	   Dancers formed intricate patterns on the field, lasers flashed
back and forth, and thousands of lights twinkled in the 60,000-seat
stands before the formal part of the program began.
	   A model sailing ship glided past on make-believe waves, before
going down in a fiery shipwreck from an epic Buddhist story.
	   Unlike the nation-by-nation procession of athletes in the
opening ceremonies, Sunday night's march was by representatives of
the 36 sports contested here. Even the billiards players, who
competed in formal dress, wore track suits for the parade.
	   Some 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed during the games,
but some already had left before the closing.
	   After the crown prince declared the games closed, and Thailand's
royal anthem was played, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the
Olympic Council of Asia, presented the MVP trophy to Ito.
	   The OCA flag was passed to Mayor Ahn Sang-young and other
representatives of Pusan, South Korea, host for the next games in
2002. Korean percussionists in native costume followed with an
exuberant beating of drums, gongs and cymbals.
	   The games flame was extinguished, the scoreboard flashed ``See
you again in Pusan,'' and a giant bundle of white balloons lifted
the same message aloft.
	   Dancers bearing lanterns crisscrossed the field, forming
constantly changing shapes, and white, red and orange balls of
fireworks burst over the stadium.

	   KORAA, Algeria (AP) _ Hocine Medah remembers some strange
shadows waking him one warm evening in his village home.
	   ``They asked me where the light switch was,'' the 13-year-old
recalls.
	   Then the horror began. Muslim militants who had descended on the
hamlet of Koraa began to kill.
	   ``They slashed the throats of my little sisters and little
brother, and I felt the blade of the knife on my throat,'' Hocine
says. As it began to slice in, he saw his blood dripping on his
clothes.
	   Hocine managed to wrench himself from his equally young
attacker.
	   ``I ran outside and hid in the stable,'' he says. ``There was a
sack of feed and I used some of that to stop the bleeding. I stayed
there all night with the goats.''
	   In the morning, when he ventured out, his father, brother and
two sisters were dead or dying. His mother was gone. In all, 34
people died that night in the village.
	   A year and a half later, Hocine is living a vastly different
life, one that most Algerian children could never dream of.
	   Hocine's father had been a poor farmer. The man who owns the
farm, Hadj Eddouch, a wealthy agricultural engineer, adopted the
boy after the massacre. Now, Hocine lives in a three-story villa in
the nearby town of Hadjout.
	   Where he once lived in a farm hamlet, sharing one room with his
entire family with no electricity and no heat, Hocine is now taken
to and from school by car. He has a big bedroom all to himself, and
his own toys. For the first time, he brushes his teeth and wears
pajamas to bed.
	   It was a startling and difficult change.
	   ``Every time I came to speak to him, he would just cry,'' says
his stepmother, Fatiha. ``It was very hard for me. I feared he
thought I wanted to take his mother's place.''
	   The atmosphere of danger remains in Hocine's life. On the recent
evening he sat down with a journalist, Muslim militants murdered
four adults and eight children in a village just 10 miles (15
kilometers) away.
	   The extremists have waged a campaign of bombings and massacres
since Algeria's military-backed secular government canceled January
1992 elections that an Islamic party was poised to win. More than
75,000 people have died in the struggle.
	   Earlier this year, the violence appeared to have ebbed, due
partly to an army campaign against militant strongholds, and to the
government's arming of tens of thousands of townspeople in civil
defense groups.
	   But attacks resumed this month in the weeks leading up to this
weekend's start of the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Hocine still has trouble speaking about the night of July 23,
1997, when militants attacked Koraa, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
southwest of Algiers, the capital.
	   No one knows exactly why certain villages are targeted. Koraa is
close to a forest, and often the raiders go to dwellings closest to
the forest to steal food, animals, blankets _ whatever they can.
Survivors often report that women have been kidnapped.
	   When Hocine returned to his house after spending the night in
the stable, badly injured from the knife wound in his neck, ``I
couldn't find my mother,'' he says.
	   ``My father was lying on the ground, covered with blood. My
little brother was moaning.'' Hocine tried to talk to the
10-year-old boy, but couldn't because of his slashed throat. The
boy died soon after.
	   ``My little sisters were still in the bed,'' Hocine says.
Four-year-old Zora ``had her eyes half open, but she didn't move
anymore.'' Seven-year-old Jamila was dead.
	   Hocine, in pain and shock, lay down next to them and fell
asleep.
	   Rescued by Eddouch, he spent two months in the hospital before
his vocal chords recovered enough to talk.
	   ``The doctors thought he'd never speak,'' says his stepmother.
	   There is something Hocine doesn't know. Three days after the
massacre, security forces found the body of his mother, her throat
slashed, on a road near their home.
	   ``We didn't tell Hocine anything,'' his stepmother says. ``We'll
tell him when he's better prepared to hear it.''
	   Hocine has become a smiling, playful member of his new family.
He does his homework with the help of Amina, 13, one of his
stepsisters.
	   ``I love her very much,'' he says.
	   But every Friday, the Muslim holy day, he goes to the graves of
his family.
	   ``I will never forget them,'' he says. ``My mother loved me very
much. I know that someday she'll come back to find me.''

Klima says no EU expansion without financial reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Echoing the position of the new German
government, Austria's chancellor says adding new members to the
European Union will be untenable without reductions in the
financial burden of richer members.
	   ``We must ensure a just burden-sharing,'' Chancellor Viktor
Klima said in an interview with the Austrian newsmagazine
``Profil.'' Klima also said the EU must ``put the brakes'' on its
spending.
	   Klima's comments reflect the concerns of the new German
government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who has been pushing
for a reduction in Germany's payments to finance the addition of
Cyprus, Malta and 10 countries of Eastern Europe over the next
decade.
	   Richer EU members such as Germany, France, the Netherlands,
Austria and Denmark insist on a spending freeze, keeping outlays at
about dlrs 100 billion in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear they will lose EU funds to
newcomers poorer than they and argue that outlays must at least
rise in line with economic growth, adding about dlrs 24 billion to
the EU budget by 2006.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries and millions of inefficient farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   The leaders have set a March deadline to sort out budget reform.
``Without time pressure, nothing works'' in the EU, Klima said.

Injured Olympic champion taken home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc
Cretier was taken home by ambulance Sunday, the day after suffering
a season-ending knee injury.
	   Team officials quoted the French skier as saying that he was
thinking of retirement following his worst injury in a 13-year
career.
	   Cretier added however that he would take a final decision
following surgery and rehabilitation.
	   The 32-year-old French downhiller tore the cruciate ligament of
his left knee and fractured his left hand following a high-speed
spill in the upper part of the icy Saslong track during Saturday's
World Cup downhill in Val Gardena.
	   Cretier, who lives in La Plagne, lost his balance following a
jump, skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and
grass.
	   He was one of the five skiers who suffered season-ending knee
injuries in falls during consecutive downhills in this north
Italian valley.
	   Cretier, who never won a World Cup race, captured the Olympic
downhill title in Nagano this year beating Lasse Kjus and Hannes
Trinkl.

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic ally blasting U.S. stand on ethnic
Albanians; angry Serbs stage protest in town whose mayor found
slain. TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A funeral for dozens of ethnic
Albanian guerrillas and a Serb protest against Kosovo's rebellious
majority raised tensions in the chaotic province even higher
Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced the United States for allegedly favoring separatist
ethnic Albanians and also criticized neighboring Albania for
harboring rebels seeking independence for the Serb province.
	   Relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a
border clash last Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run
morgue in Prizren and were to bury them Sunday.
	   Also Sunday, about 300 Serbs in the village of Kosovo Polje, a
few kilometers (miles) west of Pristina, staged a protest against
ethnic Albanian separatists and demanded high-ranking Serb
officials come to address them.
	   The Serbs were angry over the slaying of their mayor, Zvonko
Bojanic, whose body was found Friday shot between the eyes. Serb
leaders have denounced ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' for the
killing.
	   Tensions aroused by the latest violence have dimmed hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in Kosovo, a
province in the Yugoslavian republic of Serbia.
	   In the latest diplomatic effort, a group of international
officials talked with ethnic Albanian leaders Saturday in an
attempt to bring the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army and the more
moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova to talks with Serbian
officials.
	   Rugova has said he will accept broad autonomy within Serbia,
while the KLA is determined to fight for full independence.
	   The United States has been playing the lead role in trying to
arrange talks between the two sides on the future of the province.
On Sunday, Milosevic ally Zivorad Igic was quoted by the
government's Tanjug news agency as blaming Washington's alleged
``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended full-scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Igic also blamed Albanian for ``becoming the main base for
terrorists and their main supplier of arms.''
	   On Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the
house of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong
international observer mission, shouting and pointing a machine gun
at Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.

South Korea's Lee wins final race of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Bong-ju pulled away
from Japan's Akira Manai in the marathon Sunday, pounding a final
stamp of victory on the Asian Games' real battle _ between their
two nations for second in the gold standings.
	   After Lee won the games' final race by nearly a minute, he ran a
victory lap with a South Korean flag while Manai took one step over
the finish line and hung his head in fatigue.
	   Lee's triumph left South Korea ahead of Japan 65 to 52 in gold
medals, although Japan came out ahead 180-165 in total medals.
	   Nobody expected to surpass sports giant China, which finished
with 129 of the 378 gold medals awarded, or 34 percent. The Chinese
had taken 135 of the 342 golds, or 39 percent, at the last games in
1994.
	   Some 11 hours after Lee finished his race, Thailand's Crown
Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn formally closed the games, athletes
mingled in the stadium and fireworks burst overhead.
	   Compared to four years ago, the Chinese lost some ground to
Japan in swimming and track events.
	   In some cases where the Chinese won, such as in diving and
rowing, they said the Asian competition was too easy. The diving
coach said his team still faced hard work if it wanted to make the
desired impact at the 2000 Olympics.
	   Yuan Weimin, head of China's delegation here, said that overall
he was ``basically satisfied, but not totally satisfied'' with
China's showing.
	   Looking ahead to 2000 at Sydney was a major theme for China,
South Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller teams were
celebrating their chance to shine on the Asian stage.
	   Host Thailand finished with 24 gold medals, double its initial
target and double its best previous finish _ 12 in 1966.
	   That tied it with Kazakstan for fourth in golds.
	   Hong Kong, which had only one gold from all previous Asian
Games, came out with five.
	   But 2000 also was a concern for marathon winner Lee, who missed
a 1996 Olympic gold by just three seconds.
	   ``I was disappointed with the time. The temperature was too
high,'' Lee said. ``But I am delighted to win the gold.''
	   ``Now I have two goals: a gold medal at the Sydney Olympics and
to break the world marathon record, maybe next year at London,
Rotterdam or Boston,'' he added.
	   Chinese women weightlifters did all the world record setting
here, breaking marks on all seven days of their competition at the
games.
	   But in the more prestigious track events, Japanese runners
turned in the best time. Koji Ito just missed the exclusive club of
men who have run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, turning in a
10-flat semifinal in the semifinals before winning the gold in a
slightly slower time.
	   On Sunday, Ito received the dlrs 100,000 award for the games'
most valuable performance.
	   Second in the voting by reporters covering the games was Japan's
Naoko Takahashi. With nobody pushing her, she missed the world
women's marathon record by just one minute as she won the games'
opening race by 13 minutes.
	   South Korea and Japan, the 2002 soccer World Cup co-hosts,
suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the semifinals of the
games' soccer tournament. Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the gold medal,
while China shut out Thailand 3-0 for the bronze.
	   And overall, said Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake,
``our total number of gold medals did not reach our target.''
	   Kogake noted that Japan lost to the South Koreans in 14 of 15
team sports, and suffered humiliating defeats in baseball and
volleyball.
	   ``We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,''
Kogake said.
	   On the plus side, there had been only two positive tests for
doping as of Sunday, compared with 15 at the 1994 games, when the
disqualification of 11 Chinese in track and swimming affected the
medals standings.
	   Both cases at these games were weightlifters _ a Jordanian and a
Kuwaiti _ who finished no better than seventh in their events.
	   ``I hope we don't have any more in future,'' said Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, the games'
governing body.
	   But, he added, ``I am very happy that there have been only two
cases, not important cases, not involving champions.''

Austria looking for Annan to revive dialogue with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- With the end of U.S.-British air attacks
on Iraq, Austria is hoping U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan can
revive a dialogue with Baghdad to ensure Iraqi disarmament and
maintenance of U.N. humanitarian programs.
	   ``We trust that a political dialogue can be undertaken as soon
as possible, primarily with the involvement of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
told the newsmagazine ``Profil.''
	   In a statement Sunday, Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
expressed satisfaction with the end of the air campaign, which
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair announced
Saturday evening.
	   Schuessel said the priority now should be finding a ``longterm
political solution'' to ensure that Iraq complies which U.N. orders
to destroy all longrange missiles and mass destruction weapons.
	   Iraq's alleged failure to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors
was cited by Washington and London to justify the punishing air
campaign.
	   Schuessel said such a political solution must ``bring to an end
the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people'' and restore
cooperation between Baghdad and the United Nations.
	   Iraq has long maintained it has complied with U.N. disarmament
resolutions. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan on Saturday
night announced that the Baghdad regime no longer would work with
U.N. weapons inspectors, declaring their ``mission is over.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has refused to lift crippling economic
sanctions until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq has
complied with disarmament resolutions issued at the end of the 1991
Gulf War.
	   The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.

Von Gruenigen wins giant slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second run, will be UPDATED with detail, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALTA BADIA, Italy (AP) _ Michael Von Gruenigen beat Italian
runnerup Patrick Holzer by 0.76 seconds as he captured Sunday's
World Cup giant slalom for the first Swiss season victory on the
men's circuit.
	   The moustachioed Swiss ace, the defending World giant slalom
champion, mastered the icy Gran Risa course in the winning combined
time of two minutes, 41.01 seconds.
	   He rallied from second place in the first run, to his 15th World
Cup career victory, by setting the fastest time in the second run.
	   Holzer, a surprising first-run leader, finished in 2:41.77 ahead
of Austrian teammates Andreas Schifferer and Hermann Maier who
placed third and fourth respectively.
	   The two Austrians trailed the winner by more than one second.
	   Austrian skiers, who had won the two first giant slaloms of the
season, missed victory for the third consecutive World Cup race,
including two downhills at nearby Val Badia.
	   Holzer stepped on the podium (top three) for the first time in
six years at the Italian venue which was a favorite course of
retired Italian star Alberto Tomba.
	   Rainer Salzgeber and Christian Mayer finished fifth and sixth
respectively as the powerful Austrian team placed four skiers
within the top six, although missing victory.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus placed tenth, after escaping a near fall in
the second run, and kept atop the World Cup overall standings.

U.N. official reports progress in Cyprus talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ U.N.-sponsored talks with Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot leaders are making progress and reducing
tension, a U.N. official said Sunday.
	   The remarks were made at a news conference by Dame Ann Hercus,
who is conducting the separate talks as a representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``I believe we have a substantive and substantial process
underway,'' she told reporters. ``I would not continue if progress
was not being made.''
	   Hercus, a former New Zealand Cabinet minister, has spent the
past eight weeks shuttling across the U.N. buffer zone for separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader,
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Tension has risen on the island following the Greek Cypriot
decision to purchase Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   The talks ``have the dual goal of reducing tension and promoting
progress toward a just and lasting settlement,'' she said.
	   She said she was ``genuinely encouraged by the two leaders'
positive and constructive approach to the goal set by the
secretary-general.'' She refused to give details.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Up to a dozen people splattered the walls
of the U.S. embassy in Madrid with red paint Sunday to protest the
bombing raids against Iraq and to protest the continuing sanctions
against the Gulf nation.
	   The activists, members of the Campaign for the Lifting of
Sanctions Against Iraq, hurled bottles of red paint both at the
surrounding wall of the embassy compound and also at the embassy
building itself.
	   Carlos Varea, a spokesman for the group, told reporters that
although the airstrikes against Iraq had halted, the United States
was continuing its war against Iraq with economic sanctions.
	   The protest lasted some 15 minutes. There were no reports of
arrests.

7 dead, buildings damaged in explosions in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A car bomb in southeastern Iran on Sunday
damaged several buildings but caused no casualties, state-run
television said.
	   The television also reported that seven people were killed in a
separate explosion near the northern city of Qazvin. The official
Islamic Republic News Agency said the blast in Qazvin was Friday.
	   The blasts come at a time of high tension between moderate and
hard-line rivals inside Iran's Islamic government. They also come
amid a series of attacks that have taken the lives of five
dissidents in just over a month.
	   The incident in Qazvin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of
the Iranian capital Tehran, took place when ``some explosives
caught fire,'' the television said.
	   It said seven people died, but gave no other details.
	   The television said the car bomb exploded outside an office of
the hard-line Basij volunteer militia in the southeastern city of
Zahedan.
	   IRNA quoted provincial authorities as saying they had found
clues indicating that the perpetrators of the Zahedan bombing had
slipped into Iran from across the border.
	   The report did not say which border, but Zahedan is close to
Iran's border with Pakistan.
	   The bomb was hidden in a car that was stolen two weeks ago in
Zahedan, IRNA said.

<TEXT>
	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Germany's powerful biathlon team capped
an extraordinary week by capturing both World Cup pursuit races
Sunday.
	   Uschi Disl captured her third World Cup victory in a week and
led a German sweep in the 10-kilometer women's pursuit.
	   Sven Fischer overcame two shooting errors to win the men's 12.5K
event and hold on to first place in World Cup standings.
	   Germans won seven of eight events held in this Slovak resort
during the week.
	   Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm, who won Saturday's 7.5K sprint,
placed second in the pursuit, and Katrin Apel was third.
	   All three Germans missed three targets each.
	   Disl clocked a time of 31 minutes, 26.5 seconds to gain her 17th
World Cup victory and grab a share of the overall season lead.
	   Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden, who had to do four penalty laps
after missing four targets, finished fourth, 33.6 seconds behind
Disl. Both women now have 154 points, but Disl holds the advantage
because of more victories in the current season.
	   Fischer posted a time of 33:11.1, beating Raphael Poiree of
France by 43.7 seconds and Pavel Rostovtsev of Russia by 44.5.
Fischer leads the season standings with 134 points, ahead of Poiree
with 125.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort on Sunday to garner support for his hawkish peace
policies, while his opponents on the left and right prepared to
face him in new elections.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote
Monday to support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians
before Israel carries out another troop withdrawal from parts of
the West Bank, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace
accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty _ he has said he will
go to early elections.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally-held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to
declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, and of claims on
Jerusalem as the capital of such a state;
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   The Palestinians, who say they have complied with Wye, derided
the conditions.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these five points, this is an
election campaign,'' said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of the
Palestinian cabinet. ``No matter what direction Israel takes or
whoever becomes prime minister, be it Netanyahu or Barak or Shahak,
there are agreements that must be implemented.''
	   Both opponents of further concessions to the Palestinians and
doves in the opposition who want to accelerate the accords have
announced that they will vote against Netanyahu's policies.
	   ``Netanyahu disappointed his voters at Wye,'' said Michael
Kleiner, who heads Land of Israel Front, a parliamentary grouping
that opposes any further concessions.
	   Kleiner told Israel TV that the Front _ which includes
legislators in Netanyahu's coalition _ would run its own candidate
to challenge Netanyahu, but declined to say who it would be.
	   Among doves, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, whose party began
the Israel-Palestinian peace process in 1993, was readying for new
elections.
	   Barak met Saturday with Israel's former armed forces chief, Lt.
Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, considered a favored candidate for prime
minister.
	   Shahak, who has been performing well in polls, declined Barak's
invitation to run alongside him in the number two slot, suggesting
that the candidate most likely to beat Netanyahu run against him,
Israel's army radio said.
	   Barak refused.
	   ``I'll be happy if he (Shahak) joins us,'' Barak told the radio,
``(but) I am the one who leads us.''
	   Israeli media reports say that Shahak may opt to head a centrist
list.
	   Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about
polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu by a statistically
insignificant five percent.
	   ``All I can say is that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996
being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to former
Prime Minister, beaten by Netanyahu in a tight race in 1996.
	   Netanyahu could take heart from a last-minute reversal by
settlers, who on Sunday pledged to back him in parliament.
	   ``At this present time, it would not be beneficial for the
residents and communities (of settlements) to topple the
government,'' said settler spokeswoman Yehudit Tayar.
	   The settlers helped bring Netanyahu to power in 1996 but turned
against him after he signed the Wye Accords.
	   The settlers' announcement would move a few legislators who had
been considering bolting the coalition to back Netanyahu's peace
proposals _ but not enough to salvage his government.

New York architect rejects compromise with culture minister on
</HEADLINE>
design for memorial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A New York architect whose design for
a Berlin Holocaust memorial that had been favored by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, but has since been called too monumental,
said he can't accept a compromise on the project with Germany's new
culture minister.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in Frankfurt Sunday,
Peter Eisenman said he would drop out of the memorial project if
parliament votes against his design next year. ``If they say no, I
have to say goodbye to the project.''
	   He added that he would not take part in a museum as a memorial
favored by Culture Minister Michael Naumann. ``I would have nothing
to do with it.''
	   The two men met Saturday for talks in Berlin. Eisenman said the
talks were ``friendly and fruitful,'' but declined to provide any
other details.
	   Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, who
also favored Eisenman's project, told the AP he had understanding
for the architect's position.
	   Bubis said he is in favor of a memorial that shows
``acknowledgement of guilt,'' for Nazi persecution of Holocaust
victims.
	   But he said he would wait calmly for a parliament decision and
``not take to the streets,'' in protest if they voted against it.
	   	   Eisenman's design for the Holocaust memorial, which had been
heavily favored by Kohl, is comprised of 2,500 pillars in a
cemetery-like field of two hectacres (5 acres) just south of
Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.
	   But the conservative former chancellor put off a parliament vote
on the project until after the Sept. 27 elections, which he lost to
the new center-left coalition of Social Democrats and Greens.
	   New Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has charged Naumann with coming
up with a rapid solution to the memorial question and the culture
minister has said that his new concept aims above all at educating
young people about the Holocaust. He has described Eisenman's
design as too monumental and a ``lanscape of stone.''
	   Nauman has also said he wants to cooperate with Holocaust
museums in Washington and Jerusalem and the Leo Baeck Institute in
New York in setting up a Holocaust library and research center in
Berlin as well as a teaching museum.
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been in contention
for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing over
whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent an
atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million Jews were killed in
the Holocaust.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China released a respected, but ailing labor
rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately
sent him into exile in the United States.
	   Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the
government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming
trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli.
	   Xu is the third leading member of a would-be opposition
political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week
crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested or
interrogated.
	   Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China Democracy Party
colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending the trial,
Xu's wife said.
	   Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groups
decried the Chinese government's timing as manipulative.
	   ``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government for
this cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, director of New
York-based Human Rights in China.
	   After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor
camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport
and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York,
his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu into exile was his
wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, the family said.
	   Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used in
freeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997
and Wang Dan in April.
	   Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five months
before the end of his prison term, provided he go into exile, said
his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing.
	   Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.
In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide last month,
doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels,
Liu Qing said.
	   Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Western
governments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese leaders have
been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s,
finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidents
at home.
	   In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News
Agency reported that judicial departments took into account Liu's
health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole for
medical treatment.
	   ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending
people directly from prison into exile is a type of human rights
violation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in a telephone interview
from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.
	   Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in the
fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2
years in prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way
China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.
	   Liu was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years.
	   His last arrest came after he signed a petition calling for
labor rights in May 1995. Liu was never put on trial. Fourteen
months passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his
fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor camp in the
frigid, remote northeast.
	   His term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects
without trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence
by a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed was
fabricated.
	   Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to
protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle prods and confined
to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only
sit or stand.
	   His wife endured police harassment, beatings and detentions in
campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away and hit by
security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September.

Doctor called in after German hostage falls ill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesman holding four Germans hostage
called the Germany Embassy on Sunday and asked for urgent medical
help for a woman they were holding.
	   A German Embassy official said a cardiologist was dispatched to
examine the woman, but refused to reveal her identity or her
condition.
	   The official said the cardiologist was chosen because he spoke
German, not necessarily because the woman was suffering from heart
trouble. The official spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Germans, three women and a man, were abducted Dec. 7 by
gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib province, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the Yemeni capital, San`a.
	   The four German hostages have been identified by the Yemen Times
as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner.
The names have not been confirmed by the embassy.
	   Meanwhile, a German diplomat on Sunday visited a journalist who
is being questioned by authorities about a meeting with the
hostages, the official said.
	   Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who works for the Berliner
Zeitung daily, was taken into custody Thursday as he returned from
a meeting with the four German hostages.
	   Hamaiel was escorted to the area by tribesmen close to the
kidnappers. He was arrested with two tribesmen and charged with
traveling in tribal areas without government permission.
Authorities have said he will be tried.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor province.

Primakov: Russia unhappy with U.S. use of force against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos DEL101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
expressed apprehension Sunday that the U.S. airstrikes on Iraq
could be renewed and said Russia categorically opposes the use of
force to solve the dispute.
	   Speaking at the beginning of a two-day official visit to India,
Primakov told reporters in New Delhi that ``we are satisfied that
the United States has stopped using force. But we are very upset
that it may only be a temporary halt and the strikes may be
renewed.''
	   ``Our basic position has not changed _ that use of force should
be only with the consent of the (U.N.) Security Council,'' said
Primakov, who is leading a delegation that includes eight
government ministers.
	   Primakov is the first leader of a nuclear-declared state to
visit India since the May atomic tests India conducted in the
deserts of Rajasthan state. The tests and a similar series by
neighboring Pakistan prompted the United States and several other
industrialized nations to impose economic sanctions on both
countries.
	   The visit aims at expanding economic and military cooperation
between the two countries.
	   India and Russia will sign seven agreements, including one on
extending military and technical cooperation through 2010. The two
countries have an agreement now that expires in the year 2000.
	   India is a major buyer of Russian arms. India also is setting up
two Russian-built nuclear power reactors.
	   Both countries have demanded an immediate end to military action
by the United States and Britain in Iraq.
	   On Thursday, Russia recalled its ambassador to the United
States, protesting the U.S. attack on Baghdad.
	   President Boris Yeltsin canceled his visit to New Delhi in
January after his health deteriorated.

Chirac delighted by end of airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from French Foreign Minister, head of
Socialist Party, former Foreign Minister Herve de Charette &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac is ``delighted'' by
the end of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq, according to a
presidential statement issued Sunday.
	   Chirac's statement also said ``problems remain'' and that the
solution of those problems will entail a review of the relationship
between the United Nations and Iraq.
	   France is ``ready to make an important, positive contribution to
the necessary way out of the crisis. The efforts of everybody in
the world must come together,'' Chirac's statement said.
	   Chirac said the lives of Iraqis who have been suffering for so
many years must be improved quickly.
	   The international community must be able to have an ``effective
control on Iraqi weapons and their eventual development,'' Chirac
said in the statement.
	   The French President said he had proposals to make on how to
bring about such control, but he did not elaborate in the
statement.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, speaking late Saturday
night, said his country was working on proposals for ``a new form
of cooperation between the United Nations and Iraq to restore the
role of the U.N. Security Council.''
	   The way Iraq uses earnings from foreign sales of oil must also
be controlled, Chirac said in the statement.
	   Some French political leaders denounced the U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   Francois Hollande, the leader of the Socialist Party, said that
the airstrikes had not ``accomplished any of their objectives'' and
had hurt civilians.
	   Former Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, a member of the
conservative Union for French Democracy, criticized ``the
unbearable hegemony of American diplomacy.''
	   De Charette appealed to France to play a greater role in
international politics.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill
Clinton made headlines around the world Sunday, though most
governments remained silent on the political turmoil in the United
States.
	   The lower house of the U.S. Congress impeached Clinton on
Saturday for obstructing justice and lying under oath about his
sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky, voting largely along party
lines to send his case to the Senate.
	   Government leaders elsewhere were reluctant to make public
statements about the impeachment vote, calling it a matter for
Americans to resolve on their own.
	   Philippine Pres. Joseph Estrada, who has faced allegations of
womanizing in the past, declined to respond to questions about the
vote and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch ally of
Clinton's, said it was an internal U.S. matter and that it would
not be right for him to comment.
	   In France, Jack Lang, the former Socialist Culture Minister who
is now president of the Foreign Affairs Commission in France's
National Assembly, on Sunday reaffirmed his long-standing support
of Clinton. He said the U.S. president has been ``the victim of a
witch hunt from another era.''
	   The House of Representatives has ``just offered the world a
festival of hypocrisy,'' he said, adding that the proceedings had
been a ``parody of justice'' and a ``sectarian fundamentalism''
that risks destabilizing a great democracy.''
	   David Bar-Illan, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ziad Abu Zayyad, Palestinian legislator and
Minister without Portfolio, said an internal issue such as the
impeachment vote would not affect the Middle East peace process.
	   ``President Clinton has proven he can work on international
issues while under internal pressure. We hope he can continue to do
so,'' Zayyad said.
	   Kuwaiti newspaper columnist Ayed al-Manaa, who writes for
Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, told The Associated Press that the
impeachment vote ``stressed the power of the constitutional
institutions in the developed world _ something we hoped we had in
ours.''
	   ``I was very sure the strike in the Gulf would not impede the
constitutional procedures,'' he said. ``In the West, great
achievements do not automatically mean that you stay in power.''
	   In a commentary on the attacks on Iraq, the China's Communist
Party newspaper People's Daily accused Clinton of timing the
attacks to ``influence the U.S. people, opinion and members of
Congress and bring a beneficial change to the impeachment case.''
	   A similar editorial appeared in The Sunday Independent of
Johannesburg in South Africa.
	   ``Despite his (Clinton's) claims that the two events were not
linked, it is difficult to see how they are separate,'' it said.
	   The South Korean state-run news agency, Yonhap, said it was a
``very unhappy day for President Bill Clinton and the United
States.''
	   It urged Clinton to apologize for his ``lies'' to defuse the
political crisis and prevent instability not only within the United
States, but worldwide.
	   British newspapers divided along political lines, with left-wing
papers attacking Republicans and conservative papers demanding
Clinton's resignation and replacement by Vice-President Al Gore.
	   ``It's time to show Bill the door and say hello to Gore,'' said
an editorial in Britain's biggest selling tabloid, the News of the
World, which is owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
	   The Observer, a left-wing broadsheet, said impeachment was ``a
tragedy for the U.S. and the world,'' but sympathized with
Democrats who believed that the vote was ``an attempted
constitutional coup d'etat by the Republicans.''
	   A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige due to
the scandal.
	   Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner
Morgenpost daily newspaper said in a Sunday editorial that the
Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United
States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.

Angolan rebels move to crack government hold on provincial town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces on Sunday eased their
offensive on the strategic central highland city of Kuito and
reportedly moved southward to crack the government's hold on
another provincial town.
	   UNITA rebels were proceeding south from Kuito to Chitembo, about
650 kilometers (400 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda,
suggesting an attempt to seize the last town in the Bie province
under clear government hold, state radio RNA reported.
	   Kuito, the provincial capital of Bie, was quiet on Sunday,
according to RNA.
	   The strategic city, which lies some 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of Luanda, has been the target of fierce battles since
fighting between UNITA rebels and government forces flared up again
this month.
	   The army launched an attack in the central highlands Dec. 4
aiming to regain control of Andulo and Bailundo, about 480
kilometers (295 miles) southeast of Luanda, where UNITA's
leadership is based.
	   But the rebels were able to secure their strongholds and then
counterattacked with an offensive to seize other key central
highland towns, namely Kuito and Malange, about 350 kilometers (200
miles) east of Luanda.
	   Angola has been afflicted by war since before the country's
independence from Portugal in 1975. The latest fighting threatens
to scrap entirely the 1994 peace accord that ended a two-decade
civil war between the government and UNITA, whose name is a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.

7 dead, buildings damaged in explosions in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A car bomb in southeastern Iran on Sunday
damaged several buildings but caused no casualties, state-run
television said.
	   The television also reported that seven people were killed in a
separate explosion near the northern city of Qazvin. The official
Islamic Republic News Agency said the blast in Qazvin was Friday.
	   The blasts come at a time of high tension between moderate and
hard-line rivals inside Iran's Islamic government. They also come
amid a series of attacks that have taken the lives of five
dissidents in just over a month.
	   The incident in Qazvin, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of
the Iranian capital Tehran, took place when ``some explosives
caught fire,'' the television said.
	   It said seven people died, but gave no other details.
	   The television said the car bomb exploded outside an office of
the hard-line Basij volunteer militia in the southeastern city of
Zahedan.
	   IRNA quoted provincial authorities as saying they had found
clues indicating that the perpetrators of the Zahedan bombing had
slipped into Iran from across the border.
	   The report did not say which border, but Zahedan is close to
Iran's border with Pakistan.
	   The bomb was hidden in a car that was stolen two weeks ago in
Zahedan, IRNA said.

Angolan rebels move to crack government hold on provincial town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces in Angola eased their
offensive on the strategic central highland city of Kuito on Sunday
and reportedly moved southward to crack the government's hold on
another provincial town.
	   UNITA rebels were proceeding south from Kuito to Chitembo, about
650 kilometers (400 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda,
suggesting an attempt to seize the last town in the Bie province
under clear government hold, state radio RNA reported.
	   Kuito, the provincial capital of Bie, was quiet Sunday,
according to RNA.
	   The strategic city, which lies some 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of Luanda, has been the target of fierce battles since
fighting between UNITA rebels and government forces flared up again
this month.
	   The army launched an attack in the central highlands Dec. 4
aiming to regain control of Andulo and Bailundo, about 480
kilometers (295 miles) southeast of Luanda, where UNITA's
leadership is based.
	   But the rebels were able to secure their strongholds and then
counterattacked with an offensive to seize other key central
highland towns, namely Kuito and Malange, about 350 kilometers (200
miles) east of Luanda.
	   Angola has been afflicted by war since before the country's
independence from Portugal in 1975. The latest fighting threatens
to scrap entirely the 1994 peace accord that ended a two-decade
civil war between the government and UNITA, whose name is a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Tens of thousands of anti-American
demonstrators, including many Islamic militants, marched in the the
Moroccan capital Sunday to protest airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Independent estimates put the number of protesters at about
100,000 people, a large demonstration for Morocco. Police presence
was heavy.
	   The protesters shouted, ``America, Enemy of the people,'' and
``Clinton, what if you kept busy with with Monica?''
	   American and British flags were also burned.
	   The demonstration Sunday was organized by the National Committee
for the Support of Iraq. It was similar to protests held in Morocco
during the Gulf War in 1991 that were organized by the same group.
	   Behind the first group of demonstrators was a second composed of
Islamic militants. Some of them burned Israeli flags.
	   Others marched behind a black banner of a banned Islamic
movement called ``Justice and Charity.
	   It was one of the biggest protests by Islamic militants in
Morocco in recent years.
	   The protesters dispersed peacefully.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Sharon suggesting bill annexing territories in case of
Palestinian statehood &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a
last-ditch effort on Sunday to garner support for his hawkish peace
policies, while his opponents on the left and right prepared to
face him in new elections.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Parliament in a vote
Monday to support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians
before Israel carries out another troop withdrawal from parts of
the West Bank, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace
accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty _ he has said he will
go to early elections.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally-held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to
declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, and of claims on
Jerusalem as the capital of such a state;
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon suggested during the Cabinet
meeting that Israel prepare a bill to annex all the West Bank and
Gaza territories Israel still controls, to become law as soon as
the Palestinians declare a state.
	   Netanyahu asked his attorney general to study the possibility of
preparing such a bill.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala, whose government appeared set to fall, managed to persuade
another party Sunday to help keep him in power.
	   Koirala struck a deal with the United Marxist-Leninist Communist
Party of Nepal, one of the two big communist groups.
	   The Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal nearly toppled
Koirala's government when the party's 13 ministers quit the cabinet
over several local disputes.
	   A group of opposition parties filed a no-confidence motion
Sunday. Koirala then asked King Birendra, the titular head of
government, to call for elections. Birendra refused and instead
asked political parties to try to cobble together another
government.
	   Under Nepali law, new elections must be held by November, but
the agreement reached Sunday calls for elections by April 13, the
end of the Nepalese year.
	   The prime minister's Nepali Congress has 87 lawmakers. With the
support of 49 lawmakers from the communist group, he has a clear
majority in the 205-member lower house of Parliament.
	   On Monday, Koirala will formally resign as prime minister of the
minority government, a technical requirement. He will then form a
new government with the help of the new communist partner and will
have to prove his majority in a confidence vote in the legislature.
	   Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy, but a pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that reduced King Birendra
to a figurehead. Nepal has been politically unstable since then,
with five prime ministers in the last four years.

the West Bank, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace
accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty _ he has said he will
go to early elections.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally-held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by the Palestinian leadership the intention to
declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, and of claims on
Jerusalem as the capital of such a state;
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon suggested during the Cabinet
meeting that Israel prepare a bill to annex all the West Bank and
Gaza territories Israel still controls, to become law as soon as
the Palestinians declare a state.
	   Netanyahu asked his attorney general to study the possibility of
preparing such a bill.

Mafia boss killed in shootout in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ One of the purported leaders of the
Bulgarian mafia was shot to death early Sunday at a villa, police
reported.
	   Ivo Karamanski, 39, was shot during a quarrel among guests at a
party near the capital, Sofia, police said.
	   Police arrested the assailant and identified him as a
33-year-old man who shot Karamanski and his bodyguard with a
Kalashnikov semi-automatic rifle.
	   Karamanski, 1981 national rowing champion, ran a prosperous
insurance company. In 1986, he was sentenced to a two-year prison
term for fraud.
	   Despite his reputation as one of the nation's key mafia figures,
Karamanski maintained good connections with police and judiciary
officials. He once celebrated his release from detention by having
a very public cup of coffee with the state prosecutor.

Four miners killed in Polish copper mine accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A cave-in at a copper mine in southwest
Poland has killed four miners, company officials said Sunday.
	   The accident occurred 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground on
Saturday at the Lubin copper mine, 300 kilometers (185 miles)
southwest of Warsaw.
	   Piotr Bielawski, spokesman for the KGHM Polska Miedz holding,
which operates the mine, said bodies of the four miners were
recovered overnight.
	   The accident prompted 24 miners staging a sit-in at the same
mine to protest government-proposed pension changes to suspend
their demonstration.
	   In 41 other coal and copper mines on Sunday, 300 miners
continued the protest that began Dec. 10, the PAP news agency said.
	   Parliament has approved changing retirement rules by setting age
limits of 65 for men and 60 for women. Under the current formula,
miners could retire with full pensions after 25 years of work, no
matter their age.
	   Mining, one of Poland's major industries, is undergoing reforms
as the economy completes the shift from communist-style central
control to free market principles.
	   Improved safety standards and the closure of some mines has
decreased the number of accidents. The government reported 8,882
accidents last year, more than 1,000 fewer than in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Several small leftist political
parties held marches in Dhaka Sunday to protest the U.S. and
British airstrikes against Iraq.
	   Some 500 activists shouted slogans against American and British
leaders.
	   ``Down with U.S. imperialism!'' and ``Down with UN support to
imperialists' aggression against Iraq!'' read the banners held by
the marchers. They later burned an effigy of U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
	   ``The U.S. and British attack on Iraq is an aggression against
the peace-loving people of that country,'' said Haider Akbar Ronu,
one of the marchers. ``The aggressors must end their airstrike.''

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with preparations for the funeral, details of Serb
protest, corrects mayor to deputy mayor, trims. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tensions ran high in Kosovo on
Sunday as ethnic Albanians prepared to bury 36 guerrillas killed by
Yugoslav border guards and hundreds of Serbs protested against
ethnic Albanian separatists in a town whose mayor was slain this
week.
	   Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced the United States for allegedly favoring ethnic Albanian
separatists and also neighboring Albania for harboring rebels
seeking independence for the Serbian province.
	   Thousands of mourners for the 36 members of the pro-independence
Kosovo Liberation Army gathered in rebel-held territory on a hill
some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the provincial capital for
the joint funeral organized as a major event for the secessionist
movement.
	   By early afternoon, hundreds of cars were pouring from various
parts of Kosovo at a special burial site, a hilltop renamed
``Heroes' Graves.'' A stage was erected for speeches by KLA
commanders.
	   At the same time and also in sub-freezing temperature, about 300
Serbs angry over the recent slaying of their deputy mayor gathered
in the town of Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, to demand state
protection.
	   ``That can happen tomorrow to any of us,'' Mayor Dobrica Lazic
told the crowd, demanding a visit by top-ranking officials from
Belgrade. Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic is expected to meet
the Serbs here on Monday.
	   Tensions aroused by the latest violence have dimmed hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province. More than 1,000 people have been killed and up to
300,000 forced from their homes since fighting escalated in
February.
	   In the latest peace effort, a group of mostly Western diplomats
met with ethnic Albanian leaders here on Saturday, trying to bring
closer their two factions - the political wing led by Ibrahim
Rugova and the KLA guerrilla - before any direct negotiations with
the Serbian government.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's ambassador to Belgrade.
	   The diplomats met first with Rugova's close aide, Fehmi Agani,
then with KLA spokesman Adem Demaci. Rugova's camp has said it
would accept broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA insists on
full independence.
	   Petritsch said he and the diplomats from the Contact Group
countries - Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia - got a ``positive response'' from Agani, ``but we are still
short of a real and definite commitment.''
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch said that ``As long as the
KLA is engaged in military activities and violence, then we do not
see a chance.''
	   The United States has played the lead role in mediating on the
future of the province. On Sunday, Milosevic ally Zivorad Igic was
quoted by the government's Tanjug news agency as blaming
Washington's alleged ``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between US envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended full scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   Igic also blamed neighboring Albania for ``becoming the main
base for terrorists and their main supplier of arms.''

Mandela praises guards for protection in killer tornado
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
praised his guards for their quick reaction to protect him during a
killer tornado last week, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   ``The whole scene reminded me of a television program,'' Mandela
was quoted by the Sunday Times of Johannesburg as saying. ``If they
had been killed I would have been dragged out alive from underneath
their corpses.''
	   Mandela, 80, whose home is about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
outside Umtata, was shopping at a pharmacy when the storm hit.
Seventeen people died in the tornado.
	   The storm shattered the windows of the pharmacy, blew down the
door and collapsed part of the roof. Mandela's bodyguards acted
quickly, pushing him to the floor and crouching over him.
	   Two of his bodyguards received stitches for injuries from flying
glass, the newspaper said.
	   Mandela was buying 12 bars of a special dry-skin soap in the
pharmacy, the newspaper said.
	   His guards returned the same day to collect three bars. Mandela
picked up the other nine the next day, when he toured the
devastated city center, the Times said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first public comment since the
United States and Britain ended punishing airstrikes, President
Saddam Hussein said Sunday that the Iraqi people had triumphed.
	   ``You have been worthy to what your leadership expected from you
_ and to your brother and comrade, Saddam Hussein,'' the president
said. ``God will repay you well and crowns your heart with clear
victory.''
	   His brief comments, provided on tape to Qatar's Al-Jazeera
Television and other broadcast outlets, also chided the Arab world
for not supporting Iraq in its dispute over U.N. weapons
inspections and sanctions.
	   Saddam told the Iraqis: ``Your sacrifice ... awakened those who
are asleep or those who pretended to be sick, a lot of whom exist
in the Arab nation and in the world.''
	   Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers declared victory and pledged
not to compromise on contentious U.N. weapons inspections.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign economic intelligence has become one of
the most important focuses for Russia's secret services, an
intelligence service spokesman said Sunday.
	   The Foreign Intelligence Service had correctly predicted that
the Asian financial crisis would have an impact on Russia, said
Yuri Kobaladze, the spokesman for the service, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Economic information is in demand, bearing in mind the new
situation,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federal Security Service told
Russian state television on Saturday night that anti-terrorist
measures had become a central activity for his branch, which is
also responsible for counteracting subversion by foreign
intelligence services.
	   Putin also stressed that the service is working to preserve
Russia's territorial integrity, fight extremism and battle
corruption at the highest levels.
	   The Federal Security Service, the main successor to the
Soviet-era KGB, has come under strong public criticism recently.
Several of the service's officers have accused their bosses of
ordering contract killings, extortion and other crimes.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A funeral for dozens of ethnic

Von Gruenigen wins giant slalom

<TEXT>
	   ALTA BADIA, Italy (AP) _ Michael Von Gruenigen, showing a
superior class at one of the most technical World Cup courses, beat
Italian runnerup Patrick Holzer by 0.76 seconds in Sunday's giant
slalom to earn Switzerland the first season victory on the men's
circuit.
	   The moustachioed Swiss ace, the defending World giant slalom
champion, mastered the icy Gran Risa course in the winning combined
time of two minutes, 41.01 seconds.
	   He rallied from second place in the first run, to his 15th World
Cup career victory, by setting the fastest time in the second run.
	   ``I won on a very icy course, in difficult condition. It was a
well deserved, tough victory. My form and my morale are improving
following a difficult start,'' said Von Gruenigen whose previous
giant slalom victory dated back to last February in Yong Pyong,
South Korea.
	   Holzer, a surprising first-run leader, completed the two runs in
2:41.77 ahead of four Austrians who took from third to sixth place.
	   Andreas Schifferer and Hermann Maier came in third and fourth
respectively ahead of Rainer Salzgeber and Christian Mayer. They
trailed the winner by a wide gap between 1.25 to 2.58 seconds.
	   Austrian skiers, who had won the two first giant slaloms of the
season and four races out of five, were winless over the last World
Cup week including consecutive downhills at nearby Val Gardena.
	   Holzer stepped on the podium (top three) for the first time in
six years at the track which was a favorite of retired Italian star
Alberto Tomba - a four-time winner in this northern valley in the
Dolomite mountains.
	   Holzer made a big mistake midway through the second run, but did
not complain about the missed opportunity.
	   ``I am overjoyed with this second place, after so many years of
disappointment,'' the 28-year-old Italian said.
	   Holzer won his only World Cup race, a super giant slalom, at
Garmisch, in 1992.
	   Young Italian Giorgio Rocca, a late starter with No. 60, had two
stunning runs as he finished ninth, 3.3 seconds behind Von
Gruenigen.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus placed tenth, after escaping a near-fall in
the second run, and kept atop the World Cup overall standings with
519 points in 11 events.
	   Kjus, who had two straight wins and a second place in downhill
races this season, led by 79 points Maier, the defending World Cup
overall, giant slalom and super-G champion.
	   Maier climbed to 440 points by placing fourth in the second race
in a row.
	   His teammate Stephan Eberharter slipped from second to third
overall, at 403 points, as he did not finish Sunday.
	   Eberharter, winner of the previous giant slalom at Park City,
made a decisive mistake in the second run while leading the race by
0.64 seconds.
	   The men's World Cup continues Monday with a super giant slalom,
the third of the season, at Patscherkofel, near Innsbruck.

Roten victory gives Swiss first season podium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, ADDS detail, background, CHANGES
throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Karin Roten gave Switzerland its
first podium of the season on Sunday, winning a women's World Cup
slalom.
	   Leading after the first run, Roten overcame building pressure to
end the Swiss women's two-year victory drought, to post a brilliant
second run for a winning combined time of 1 minute, 28.81 seconds.
	   Roten was hailed a heroine in Switzerland, whose women had not
won a race since 1997 when Heidi Zurbriggen won a downhill in
Cortina, Italy.
	   The victory also ended Roten's own famine.
	   The 22-year-old's last _ and only other _ victory dated back two
years, when she won a slalom in Lillehammer, Norway. In between,
Roten recorded three podium finishes. Her last was a third place in
a giant slalom in Vail a year ago.
	   ``It was somewhat of a relief,''said Roten immediately after her
victory. ``Two years is a long time. It was important for
Switzerland, which needed a win, or at least a podium finish.
	   ``This victory confirms the belief I had inside myself,'' said
Roten. ``I never doubted myself, but I knew I had to give
everything I had.''
	   The Swiss beat out American Kristina Koznick by exactly half a
second.
	   Koznick's second place marked the Americans' first podium finish
of the season, too.
	   Finishing 15th and 27th in the season's earlier slaloms, Koznick
finally displayed the form which led her to four podium finishes _
including a win in Are, Swede _ and her second place in the World
Cup slalom standings last season.
	   ``I needed this result to prove I could still ski well,'' said
Koznick, whose goal this year is to win the slalom World Cup
trophy. ``After doing so well last year, I put a lot of pressure on
myself at the start of this season.
	   ``But I had a good talk with my coach this week and he said that
last year was another matter completely,'' Koznick said. ``So I put
it behind me and I'm starting over and just skiing for this year.''
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden finished an impressive third.
	   Twentieth out of the start-hut in the first leg, Paerson
overcame badly deteriorating course conditions to post the
eighth-fastest chrono.
	   The young Swede gained even more time in the second run to vault
to third with an aggregate time of 1:29.62.
	   ``It's really exciting to start my World Cup career this way,''
said Paerson, a native of Taernaby, Sweden, the same village ski
legend Ingemar Stenmark is from. ``It's always been a dream of mine
to be a skier. In my village skiing is a religion.
	   ``To do so well and so suddenly is a surprise for me,'' added
Paerson, who received a congratulatory call and advice from
Stenmark after her win in Mammoth Mountain. ``I hope I continue
skiing so well.''
	   Paerson's third place lifted her to the top of the World Cup
slalom standings where she sits with 184 points, 14 ahead of
Austria's Sabine Egger.
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion,
is currently third with 145.
	   The slalom also counted towards the combined event, which was
won by reigning World Cup combined champion Hilde Gerg of Germany,
followed by teammate Martina Ertl and Norway's Trude Gimle.
	   The day's events did nothing to shake Austria's Alexandra
Meissnitzer from her perch atop the World Cup overall standings.
	   With points from her seventh place in the combined, Meissnitzer
now tops the overall with 811 points.
	   With a second place in the combined and a 23rd in the slalom,
Ertl regained second place in the overall with 504, while Austria's
Renate Goetschl dropped from second to third with 467.

Israeli foreign minister postpones trip to Russia, Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has
postponed a visit to Russia and the Ukraine until next month due to
a domestic political crisis, his office said Sunday.
	   The visit was slated to begin on Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to call for early
elections this week. Members of his coalition have said they no
longer have confidence in how he handles the peace process with the
Palestinians.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first public comment since the
United States and Britain ended punishing airstrikes, President
Saddam Hussein said Sunday that the Iraqi people had triumphed.
	   ``You have been worthy of what your leadership expected from you
_ and of your brother and comrade, Saddam Hussein,'' the president
said. ``God will repay you well and crown your heart with clear
victory.''
	   His brief comments, provided on tape to Qatar's Al-Jazeera
Television and other broadcast outlets, also chided the Arab world
for not supporting Iraq in its dispute over U.N. weapons
inspections and sanctions.
	   Saddam told the Iraqis: ``Your sacrifice ... awakened those who
are asleep or those who pretended to be sick, a lot of whom exist
in the Arab nation and in the world.''
	   Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers declared victory and pledged
not to compromise on contentious U.N. weapons inspections.

Truck with explosives found in Dagestan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A truck carrying powerful explosives was found by
the side of a road in the troubled Caucasus region of Dagestan, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
	   A robot has inspected the truck, which was discovered on
Saturday evening, and found a bag with explosives, a detonator and
remote-control wire. Investigators have not disclosed the size of
the explosive cache, but said it was at least as big as a bomb that
exploded in the Daghestani capital Makhachkala in September,
killing 20 people and wounding 60, ITAR-Tass reported.

Results of U.S.-British missile and air attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Given Iraq's secrecy and the limits of assessing the effect of
airstrikes from afar, the full damage to Iraq in the four-day
U.S-British military campaign probably will never be known. Here is
a description of the damage from the viewpoint of the attackers,
reporters and witnesses on the ground, and the Iraqi government.
 &UR; Americans and British &QC; 
	   The Pentagon says the 70-hour offensive hit nearly 100 targets
and involved 650 aircraft missions; 425 cruise missiles, each
costing dlrs 750,000, were fired from U.S. ships in the Gulf or
B-52 bombers.
	   President Bill Clinton said the attacks inflicted ``significant
damage'' on Iraqi weapons programs, command structures and military
and security infrastructure.
	   Among targets listed as hit by U.S. officials: 20 command and
control facilities, 18 facilities providing security for weapons
programs, seven or eight of President Saddam Hussein's palaces and
posts of the elite Republican Guard.
	   The Pentagon showed videotapes of laser-guided missiles striking
targets and aerial photos of bombed sites, one an Iraqi missile
repair station that suffered moderate to heavy damage.
	   British videotape showed bomb hits on Republican Guard
facilities in southern Iraq, and officials said the Guard was a key
target. Another British target was an oil refinery in the southern
city of Basra which was allegedly used to skirt the U.N. ban on
Iraqi oil exports.
 &UR; Reporters and Witnesses &QC; 
	   Iraq controls access to damage sites for reporters,
photographers and TV crews, and access was limited.
	   After the first round of attacks, journalists were taken to a
street in the upscale Baghdad neighborhood of Karada where a
missile left a hole and broke a water main that flooded a street;
no obvious military targets were nearby.
	   Another site was Baghdad's Museum of Natural History, where a
missile put a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole in a wall and
shattered glass display cases for stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   After the final attack Saturday, reporters were taken to the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, where two missiles left a
40-foot (12-meter) hole and shattered windows. Reporters were
blocked from seeing where a third missile landed nearby.
	   Journalists staying at the downtown Rashid hotel saw missiles
hit in areas containing headquarters of the Special Security
Services and the command center of the paramilitary Popular Army.
	   Iraqi witnesses described damage as heavy in some parts of
Baghdad.
	   They said the headquarters of the Military Industrial
Corporation, which runs Iraq's factories, was gutted. The area
around Saddam's biggest palace was hit, but his whereabouts were
not known at the time.
	   Other targets they listed included security offices,
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, and al-Mustansiriya
University in downtown Baghdad.
 &UR; Iraqi Officials &QC; 
	   Iraqi officials concentrated on reporting damage to what they
consider civilian facilities.
	   Among targets they listed as hit included a house belonging to
Saddam's daughter Hala, which is in a Baghdad complex of homes for
high-ranking officials and Saddam's family. Reports said the house
was destroyed, but no one was home.
	   Officials said many facilities hit were being monitored by U.N.
arms inspectors to prevent renewal of weapons production. One such
target was the Nida heavy machinery factory south of Baghdad.
	   Also listed were headquarters of the security police and
military intelligence, which officials said had been inspected by
U.N. experts.
	   Officials said missiles caused collateral damage to hospitals
near the Defense Ministry in Baghdad. Also described as damaged
were a Trade Ministry warehouse and the building housing state-run
radio and television.
	   Iraq's satellite station went off the air Thursday, and phone
lines to the south were cut. Some electrical facilities were
reported hit, and the official Iraqi News Agency said a missile
damaged a historic palace, parts of which date to 1180 A.D.

Fewer fans, little excitement at Alta Badia race without Italian

 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALTA BADIA, Italy (AP) _ Alberto Tomba's retirement is causing
blanks along Italian slopes and in ski business cash registers.
	   At the Grand Risa, one of Tomba's favorite World Cup courses,
there were only about 1,000 people watching Sunday's giant slalom,
the first race in 13 years at Alta Badia without the idolized
Italian star.
	   When three-time Olympic champion Tomba dominated gate events,
winning four World Cup giant slaloms here between 1987 and 1994,
there were up to 15,000 supporters cheering in noisy soccer style.
	   And there was relatively little excitement during Sunday's race
despite the outstanding performances of home skiers Patrick Holzer
and Giorgio Rocca, who placed second and ninth respectively.
	   Swiss Michael Von Gruenigen, one of Tomba's long-time rivals at
this track, won the race for the first Swiss victory of the season
on the men's circuit.
	   A smaller crowd was also seen at the night slalom in Sestriere
earlier this month - another Italian venue where Tomba won five
World Cup races.
	   ``Last year, with Tomba competing, we had traffic jams in the
streets and lines of customers shortly after dawn,'' said the cafe
barman, who declined to give his name, at the Hotel Christiania,
not far from the finish line. ``This year traffic is quiet, and we
had the first few customers in the late morning.''
	   Tomba, the most successful and popular Italian skier ever,
announced his retirement in October to begin an acting career.
	   The skier known as ``La Bomba'' because of his explosive style
had earned wide international attention because of his wins and his
off-and-on slope antics.
	   Tomba's impressive career record, including three Olympic golds,
two World titles, one World Cup overall title and 50 World Cup
races, had sparked emulation among Italian teenagers and boosted
sales of ski outfits for all ages.
	   Tomba's retirement was recently cited as a factor in gloomy
predictions made by the ski industry and by Italian tourist offices
for the current and the next winter seasons.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The family of a deceased Scottish
tourist whose heart was removed and returned separately, claimed
Sunday that Israeli authorities returned the wrong organ.
	   The family of Alistair Sinclair is suing Israel for one million
shekels (dlrs 250,000) for removing his heart and thyroid for
medical tests without their permission.
	   Sinclair was arrested in Israel in April on his way out of the
country on accusations he was smuggling drugs. Police found him the
next morning hanging from his shoelaces in his cell in what police
said was a suicide. The family says Sinclair was killed.
	   Israel has since returned the heart and thyroid to the family
but Sinclair's brother James told reporters in Tel Aviv he believes
Israel kept his brother's heart and may have even used it in an
organ transplant.
	   ``I do not believe this is my brother's heart,'' Sinclair said.
``My brother's heart could be pumping in someone else right now.''
	   Israel's Health Ministry denied the charges. it would not
	   ``The heart that was sent to Scotland is the one that was taken
out of the body of Alistair Sinclair, '' read a statement from
Yoram Malka, spokesman for the ministry.
	   He said the heart was removed to be tested for disease and that
thyroid removal is typical procedure for victims of hangings.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two ethnic Albanians were wounded
and another four were arrested Sunday after attacking a Serbian
police patrol in central Kosovo, Serb sources said.
	   The Serb Media Center, based in the capital of the Serbia's
secessionist Kosovo province, reported the incident occurred on a
main east-west road, some 40 kilometers west of Pristina, when the
alleged perpetrators opened fire on the police.
	   The police fired back, wounding two, who were taken to a
hospital, and apprehending another four. They reportedly fired on
the police from two parked cars where a Chinese-made automatic
rifle and some ammunition were later found.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Christer Olsson scored twice to lead world
champion Sweden to a 5-3 victory Sunday over Russia, capturing the
Baltika Cup.
	   Ravil Gusmanov opened scoring for Russia in the fifth minute of
the first period but Swedish defender Olsson equalized five minutes
later on a power play as he changed direction of the puck when
teammate Jan Huukko fired from the blue line.
	   Russian Alexander Barkov put Russia ahead 2-1 in the 18th minute
while Kim Johnsson overplayed the Russian defense and found himself
one-on-one with Russian goalie Maxim Sokolov to make it 2-2 with
only 32 seconds left in the first period.
	   Thomas Johansson fired from outside the blue line to put Sweden
ahead 3-2 in the third minute of the second period. Just over a
minute later, Olsson scored his second goal on a pass from Marcus
Thuresson.
	   Right wing Samuel Pahlsson made it 5-2 in the third minute of
the last period and Alexei Kudashov scored Russian's third goal in
the fifteenth minute.
	   ``We are satisfied with the results. We tried out several new
players for the world championships,'' Swedish coach Sune Bergman
told reporters.
	   The tournament was the third in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first one in the Czech Republic three months ago. Finland
captured the Karjala Cup in November. The last tournament will be
played in Sweden in February 1999.
	   Sweden now leads the overall standings with 13 points. Finland
has 10, the Czech Republic eight, and Russia five.
	   The Swedes' streak started when they won the World Championships
in Switzerland in May. Russia snapped Sweden's 21-game unbeaten
streak in international hockey with a 4-1 victory in the Karjala
Cup tournament.

Results of U.S.-British missile and air attacks

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Given Iraq's secrecy and the limits of assessing the effect of
airstrikes from afar, the full damage to Iraq in the four-day
U.S-British military campaign probably will never be known. Here is
a description of the damage from the viewpoint of the attackers,
reporters and witnesses on the ground, and the Iraqi government.
 &UR; Americans and British &QC; 
	   The Pentagon says the 70-hour offensive hit nearly 100 targets
and involved 650 aircraft missions; 425 cruise missiles, each
costing dlrs 750,000, were fired from U.S. ships in the Gulf or
B-52 bombers.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the attacks inflicted
``significant damage'' on Iraqi weapons programs, command
structures and military and security infrastructure.
	   Among targets listed as hit by U.S. officials: 20 command and
control facilities, 18 facilities providing security for weapons
programs, seven or eight of President Saddam Hussein's palaces and
posts of the elite Republican Guard.
	   The Pentagon showed videotapes of laser-guided missiles striking
targets and aerial photos of bombed sites, one an Iraqi missile
repair station that suffered moderate to heavy damage.
	   British videotape showed bomb hits on Republican Guard
facilities in southern Iraq, and officials said the Guard was a key
target. Another British target was an oil refinery in the southern
city of Basra, which was allegedly used to skirt the U.N. ban on
Iraqi oil exports.
 &UR; Reporters and Witnesses &QC; 
	   Iraq controls access to damage sites for reporters,
photographers and TV crews, and access was limited.
	   After the first round of attacks, journalists were taken to a
street in the upscale Baghdad neighborhood of Karada where a
missile left a hole and broke a water main that flooded a street;
no obvious military targets were nearby.
	   Another site was Baghdad's Museum of Natural History, where a
missile put a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole in a wall and
shattered glass display cases for stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   After the final attack Saturday, reporters were taken to the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, where two missiles left a
40-foot (12-meter) hole and shattered windows. Reporters were
blocked from seeing where a third missile landed nearby.
	   Journalists staying at the downtown Rashid hotel saw missiles
hit in areas containing headquarters of the Special Security
Services and the command center of the paramilitary Popular Army.
	   Iraqi witnesses described damage as heavy in some parts of
Baghdad.
	   They said the headquarters of the Military Industrial
Corporation, which runs Iraq's factories, was gutted. The area
around Saddam's biggest palace was hit, but his whereabouts were
not known at the time.
	   Other targets they listed included security offices,
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, and al-Mustansiriya
University in downtown Baghdad.
 &UR; Iraqi Officials &QC; 
	   Iraqi officials concentrated on reporting damage to what they
consider civilian facilities.
	   Among targets they listed as hit included a house belonging to
Saddam's daughter Hala, which is in a Baghdad complex of homes for
high-ranking officials and Saddam's family. Reports said the house
was destroyed, but no one was home.
	   Officials said many facilities hit were being monitored by U.N.
arms inspectors to prevent renewal of weapons production. One such
target was the Nida heavy machinery factory south of Baghdad.
	   Also listed were headquarters of the security police and
military intelligence, which officials said had been inspected by
U.N. experts.
	   Officials said missiles caused collateral damage to hospitals
near the Defense Ministry in Baghdad. Also described as damaged
were a Trade Ministry warehouse and the building housing state-run
radio and television.
	   Iraq's satellite station went off the air Thursday, and phone
lines to the south were cut. Some electrical facilities were
reported hit, and the official Iraqi News Agency said a missile
damaged a historic palace, parts of which date to 1180 A.D.

Family of Scottish tourist says wrong heart was returned

 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The family of a deceased Scottish
tourist whose heart was removed and returned separately, claimed
Sunday that Israeli authorities returned the wrong organ.
	   The family of Alistair Sinclair is suing Israel for one million
shekels (dlrs 250,000) for removing his heart and thyroid for
medical tests without their permission.
	   Sinclair was arrested in Israel in April on his way out of the
country on accusations he was smuggling drugs. Police found him the
next morning hanging from his shoelaces in his cell in what police
said was a suicide. The family says Sinclair was killed.
	   Israel has since returned the heart and thyroid to the family
but Sinclair's brother James told reporters in Tel Aviv he believes
Israel kept his brother's heart and may have even used it in an
organ transplant.
	   ``I do not believe this is my brother's heart,'' Sinclair said.
``My brother's heart could be pumping in someone else right now.''
	   Israel's Health Ministry denied the charges.
	   ``The heart that was sent to Scotland is the one that was taken
out of the body of Alistair Sinclair, '' read a statement from
Yoram Malka, spokesman for the ministry.
	   He said the heart was removed to be tested for disease and that
thyroid removal is typical procedure for victims of hangings.

Unknown assailants explode device on memorial grave slab of former
</HEADLINE>
Jewish leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Unknown assailants exploded a device at the grave
of Germany's former Chairman of the Central Council of Jews,
destroying the 1.5 meters square (16 square foot) memorial slab
that covered Heinz Galinski's last resting place, police said
Sunday.
	   Police blocked off entry to the Jewish cemetery on Heer street
in the Charlottenburg district to search for clues, after witnesses
reported an explosion at the site about 8:45 p.m. Saturday.
	   German President Roman Herzog reacted with bewilderment and
anger when hearing of the attack.
	   In a telegram to Galinski's wife Ruth, Herzog said ``this crime
is the result of crazy minds and the work of confused loners,'' and
that he wanted to express his sadness and pain for himself and the
Germans.
	   Three months ago a similar attack on Galinski's grave caused
only minor damage.
	   Ignatz Bubis, who succeeded Galinski after his death in 1992,
said the attacks were not only against the former Jewish leader,
whose grave was apparently sought out as a symbol. ``I also feel
personally attacked.''
	   Bubis added that the latest attack was carried out by
``incorrigibles,'' whom he presumed were probably among the young
rather than the old Nazis.
	   Berlin's Interior Senator, Eckart Werthebach, said that police
would work with all their resources to solve the crime and arrest
the perpetrators.
	   Galinski who was born in 1912 in Poland, gained wide respect as
the outspoken but fair head of Berlin's Jewish community from 1949
until his death. He took over as Chairman of the Central Council of
Jews in 1988.
	   He died in Berlin on July 19, 1992 following heart surgery.

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serb reports of another shootout in Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians attacked a police
patrol Sunday in central Kosovo, Serb sources said, raising
tensions which were already running high after an upsurge of
violence which threatens the province's fragile cease-fire.
	   The Serb Media Center said ethnic Albanian separatists opened
fire on a police patrol along the province's main east-west road
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Police fired back, wounding two of the attackers. They and four
others were captured, the media center said. The assailants opened
fire from two parked cars, where police found a Chinese-made
semi-automatic rifle and ammunition, the media center added.
	   Tensions were already running high in the ethnically troubled
province as the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army was burying 36
guerrillas killed by Yugoslav border guards and hundreds of Serbs
protested against the slaying of a local official whose body was
found last week.
	   Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced the United States for allegedly favoring ethnic Albanian
separatists and also neighboring Albania for harboring rebels
seeking independence for the Serbian province.
	   Thousands of mourners for the 36 members of the pro-independence
Kosovo Liberation Army gathered in rebel-held territory on a hill
some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the provincial capital for
the joint funeral organized as a major event for the secessionist
movement.
	   By early afternoon, hundreds of cars were pouring from various
parts of Kosovo at a special burial site, a hilltop renamed
``Heroes' Graves.'' A stage was erected for speeches by KLA
commanders.
	   At the same time and also in sub-freezing temperature, about 300
Serbs angry over the recent slaying of their deputy mayor gathered
in the town of Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, to demand state
protection.
	   ``That can happen tomorrow to any of us,'' Mayor Dobrica Lazic
told the crowd, demanding a visit by top-ranking officials from
Belgrade. Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic is expected to meet
the Serbs here on Monday.
	   Tensions aroused by the latest violence have dimmed hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province. More than 1,000 people have been killed and up to
300,000 forced from their homes since fighting escalated in
February.
	   In the latest peace effort, a group of mostly Western diplomats
met with ethnic Albanian leaders here on Saturday, trying to bring
closer their two factions - the political wing led by Ibrahim
Rugova and the KLA guerrilla - before any direct negotiations with
the Serbian government.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's ambassador to Belgrade.
	   The diplomats met first with Rugova's close aide, Fehmi Agani,
then with KLA spokesman Adem Demaci. Rugova's camp has said it
would accept broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA insists on
full independence.
	   Petritsch said he and the diplomats from the Contact Group
countries - Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia - got a ``positive response'' from Agani, ``but we are still
short of a real and definite commitment.''
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch said that ``As long as the
KLA is engaged in military activities and violence, then we do not
see a chance.''
	   The United States has played the lead role in mediating on the
future of the province. On Sunday, Milosevic ally Zivorad Igic was
quoted by the government's Tanjug news agency as blaming
Washington's alleged ``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between US envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended full scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes against the Serbs.
	   Igic also blamed neighboring Albania for ``becoming the main
base for terrorists and their main supplier of arms.''

	   Norway, runnerup at the world championships and the Nagano
Olympics, finished back in sixth, 1:54.9 behind.

Roten victory gives Swiss first season podium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, ADDS detail, background, CHANGES
throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Karin Roten gave Switzerland its
first podium of the season on Sunday, winning a women's World Cup
slalom.
	   Leading after the first run, Roten overcame building pressure to
end the Swiss women's two-year victory drought, to post a brilliant
second run for a winning combined time of 1 minute, 28.81 seconds.
	   Roten was hailed a heroine in Switzerland, whose women had not
won a race since 1997 when Heidi Zurbriggen won a downhill in
Cortina, Italy.
	   The victory also ended Roten's own famine.
	   The 22-year-old's last _ and only other _ victory dated back two
years, when she won a slalom in Lillehammer, Norway. In between,
Roten recorded three podium finishes. Her last was a third place in
a giant slalom in Vail a year ago.
	   ``It was somewhat of a relief,''said Roten immediately after her
victory. ``Two years is a long time. It was important for
Switzerland, which needed a win, or at least a podium finish.
	   ``This victory confirms the belief I had inside myself,'' said
Roten. ``I never doubted myself, but I knew I had to give
everything I had.''
	   The Swiss beat out American Kristina Koznick by exactly half a
second.
	   Koznick's second place marked the Americans' first podium finish
of the season, too.
	   Finishing 15th and 27th in the season's earlier slaloms, Koznick
finally displayed the form which led her to four podium finishes _
including a win in Are, Swede _ and her second place in the World
Cup slalom standings last season.
	   ``I needed this result to prove I could still ski well,'' said
Koznick, whose goal this year is to win the slalom World Cup
trophy. ``After doing so well last year, I put a lot of pressure on
myself at the start of this season.
	   ``But I had a good talk with my coach this week and he said that
last year was another matter completely,'' Koznick said. ``So I put
it behind me and I'm starting over and just skiing for this year.''
	   Winner of the last slalom in Mammoth Mountain, United States,
17-year-old Anja Paerson of Sweden finished an impressive third.
	   Twentieth out of the start-hut in the first leg, Paerson
overcame badly deteriorating course conditions to post the
eighth-fastest chrono.
	   The young Swede gained even more time in the second run to vault
to third with an aggregate time of 1:29.62.
	   ``It's really exciting to start my World Cup career this way,''
said Paerson, a native of Taernaby, Sweden, the same village ski
legend Ingemar Stenmark is from. ``It's always been a dream of mine
to be a skier. In my village skiing is a religion.
	   ``To do so well and so suddenly is a surprise for me,'' added
Paerson, who received a congratulatory call and advice from
Stenmark after her win in Mammoth Mountain. ``I hope I continue
skiing so well.''
	   Paerson's third place lifted her to the top of the World Cup
slalom standings where she sits with 184 points, 14 ahead of
Austria's Sabine Egger.
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion,
is currently third with 145.
	   The slalom also counted towards the combined event, which was
won by reigning World Cup combined champion Hilde Gerg of Germany,
followed by teammate Martina Ertl and Norway's Trude Gimle.
	   The day's events did nothing to shake Austria's Alexandra
Meissnitzer from her perch atop the World Cup overall standings.
	   With points from her seventh place in the combined, Meissnitzer
now tops the overall with 811 points.
	   With a second place in the combined and a 23rd in the slalom,
Ertl regained second place in the overall with 504, while Austria's
Renate Goetschl dropped from second to third with 467.

Nakata matches Batistuta, Perugia holds Fiorentina to draw

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata slotted in a penalty kick
in the 95th minute of play Sunday to give Perugia a 2-2 draw
against Fiorentina, cutting the Serie A leader's advantage to three
standings points heading into the winter break.
	   Before Nakata's heroics, made possible when Spanish midfielder
Martinez Amor used his hand to knock down a cross in the penalty
area during the dying seconds of injury time, Fiorentina looked
headed for another victory thanks to Gabriel Batistuta's exploits.
	   The Argentine star gave the visitors a 2-1 lead with 17 minutes
left by netting a header for his league-best 14th goal in as many
games. Fiorentina had won two straight 1-0 games on second-half
Batistuta goals.
	   But Perugia, which led 20 seconds into the match on Croat
striker Milan Rapajic's header, pressed forward repeatedly. Nakata,
the second Japanese player in the Italian League, calmly hit the
equalizer for his seventh goal of the season.
	   AC Parma moved up to second place by beating Empoli 5-3 as Diego
Fuser tallied two goals and two assists.
	   AC Milan is third after a 2-2 draw against Sampdoria of Genoa,
whose new coach, former England captain David Platt, watched from
the stands. Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega, back from a drunk
driving suspension, curled in a penalty kick with four minutes
remaining, to tie the score for Sampdoria.
	   Fiorentina (9-2-3), alone in first place for the first time
since 1982, leads the table with 29 points. Parma follows with 26,
and Milan has 25.
	   Defending champion Juventus of Turin (6-3-5), tied for sixth
with 21 points, snapped a three-game losing streak and ended a
club-record goal drought by beating Salernitana 3-0 on striker
Filippo Inzaghi's hat-trick. Before Inzaghi found the target,
Juve's goalless stretch reached 511 minutes, 5 more than the club
went without scoring in the 1967-68 season.
	   French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane, expected to collect all
the major player of the year awards, assisted on Inzaghi's first
two goals.
	   Elsewhere, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas scored twice to lead
Lazio of Rome past Udinese 3-1; veteran Giuseppe Signori's free
kick gave Bologna a 1-0 win at Cagliari; Piacenza edged Bari 3-2;
and Vicenza and Venezia drew 0-0.
	   At night, Ronaldo's Internazionale of Milan hosted Francesco
Totti's AS Roma.
	   The league now takes more than two weeks off, and action resumes
Jan. 6 with a rare slate of Wednesday games.

Weary Gulf strike force `owns the night,' then rests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: The United States rained more Tomahawk cruise
missiles on Iraq during the four-day Operation Desert Fox than
during the Gulf War. This is how it looked from the center of the
action, the carrier USS Enterprise. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ The admiral went to the ship's
bridge. It was 53 minutes to midnight on Wednesday. About 8 miles
(13 kms) away, a bright white glow lit the sea.
	   Rear Adm. J. Cutler Dawson Jr. watched the fiery trail of the
first Tomahawk cruise missile carry 1,000 pounds (450 kgs) of
explosives toward Iraq. The firing from the submarine USS Miami
opened the barrage. Less than a half hour later, warplanes began
streaking from the deck of the USS Enterprise.
	   Dawson left the bridge and prepared for a long night.
	   He made no announcement to the nearly 5,000 airmen and sailors
aboard. Everyone had known for hours that the attacks would begin.
They had been readying for the possibility since the Enterprise
raced to the Gulf at 31 knots, near its maximum speed.
	   In the flight area, the air wing commander, Capt. Tom Hagen,
gathered pilots to review their missions: suspected weapons sites
and facilities for Saddam Hussein's prized Republican Guard.
	   More than half the airmen had experience in the 1991 Gulf War or
monitoring the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. These were the men
Hagen wanted in the air.
	   ``Opening night is not the time for the new folks to go,'' said
Hagen of Billings, Montana.
	   He told the pilots to make sure they had all their survival gear
and that their flight suits were ``sanitized'' _ free of all names
and markings in case they were captured.
	   ``I want you to visualize yourself up there, dropping the bombs
and coming back safely,'' he urged. Hagen watched the pilots
closely. He didn't want to see anyone too cocky or too calm.
	   ``They should have their game face on,'' he said. ``It's focused
on what needs to be done.''
	   The first night was an all-Navy barrage. F/A-18 Hornet and F-14
Tomcat warplanes, loaded with laser-guided rockets and free-fall
bombs, flew runs off the carrier.
	   About 200 cruise missiles were launched from the Miami and other
vessels in the battle group during the first assault _ more than
one every two minutes until sunrise. Fewer than 300 Tomahawks hit
Iraq during the entire Gulf War.
	   The last plane arrived back at the carrier about 5:30 a.m.
	   Military planners decided to wage the attacks in the dark to
take advantage of night-vision technology and the extra concealment
it gives warplanes.
	   ``We feel that we own the night,'' said Dawson.
	   The following evening, the Iraqis fought back with more
firepower.
	   The flak from the anti-aircraft batteries was heavier. Pilots
also began seeing more surface-to-air missiles. Still, there was no
sign of Iraqi jets challenging the air armada.
	   In Kuwait _ rescued from Iraqi occupation in the Gulf War _
British Tornado fighters left their base to join the air assault.
U.S. Air Force B-52 and B-1 bombers also took to the sky. Extra
American ground troops arrived in Kuwait.
	   Tankers planes were also sent aloft _ allowing the
fighter-bomber pilots to double the duration of their missions,
what they call ``events,'' to about three hours.
	   ``The intensity of the (anti-aircraft fire) is about what we
expected,'' said Dawson. ``It's not overwhelming in any fashion.''
	   Cmdr. Kevin Miller, leader of an F/A-18 squadron, attributed the
heavier second night anti-aircraft fire to Iraqi preparations.
	   ``The first night we had the element of surprise,'' said Miller
of Jacksonville, Florida. ``They were ready for us the second
night.''
	   About 50 cruise missiles were fired from the Enterprise battle
group. The cruiser USS Gettysburg, which arrived with about 100
Tomahawks, had nearly exhausted its supply.
	   Day 3: The adrenaline rush was waning. Most of the crew had only
a few hours' sleep since the attacks began. Officers watched for
signs of stress or fatigue.
	   ``If I spot anyone getting giddy, I tell them to go to bed,''
said Patrick Lynch of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, the aviation
ordnance chief who oversees the flow of weaponry from the storage
bays to the flight deck.
	   Deep in the hull, assembly teams raced to keep up with the
orders for missiles.
	   A dozen men put together a missile in about 10 minutes _ from
bracing the tail fins to securing the guidance system in the nose.
The pace is twice as fast as the training runs.
	   Aviation Ordnance 3rd Class Randy Self of Cullman, Alabama, was
getting by on about 90 minutes of sleep a day.
	   ``We were going flat out,'' he said. ``We didn't even know if it
was day or night.''
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan had begun. Arabs around the
Middle East intensified protests against the attacks. Syrian
demonstrators ripped the flag from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus and
burned it. Palestinians raged against the United States _ just a
week after President Clinton visited the Gaza Strip and boosted
Palestinian efforts for self-determination.
	   ``With Ramadan coming, we had a very limited window,'' said
F/A-18 pilot Lt. Cmdr. Eric Rasmussen of Jacksonville, Florida.
	   Saddam claimed hospitals and other civilian sites were hit by
the air strikes.
	   On the Enterprise, military experts reviewed the digital images
from the raids. The video is downloaded into computers before being
sent for more detailed analysis at Central Command in Tampa,
Florida.
	   Dawson declined to specify the targets hit, but he insisted no
sites were near medical centers or other large civilian buildings.
	   Pentagon officials announced the air strike could continue into
Ramadan.
	   In the Gulf, a second U.S. carrier arrived. The USS Carl Vinson
led its six-vessel battle group into position.
	   Early Sunday, Dawson received a call from the military command
for Southwest Asia. Desert Fox was over. The last warplane returned
to the Vinson about 2 a.m.
	   In total, 650 U.S. and British attack missions were launched
against Iraq _ about half from the Enterprise battle group. More
than 325 cruise missiles were fired from Navy ships, and more than
90 from B-52s.
	   No flights were planned for the rest of Sunday. Pilots and
others caught up on their sleep. Unused bombs were dismantled.
	   At a Roman Catholic Mass in the ship's chapel, Rev. Bob Panec
offered a prayer for the Iraqis ``suffering from the rages of
war.''
	   The daily flight schedule always features a cartoon on the back.
Sunday's drawing was a caricature of Saddam running from a shower
of rockets. The caption read: ``It was fun while it lasted.''

 &UR; Terrorist suspect turned over to U.S. Sunday for flight to United
States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A suspected top aide to Osama Bin Laden,
the Saudi millionaire accused of organizing the deadly bombings at
U.S. embassies in Africa this summer, was turned over to U.S.
officials at Munich airport Sunday for extradition to the United
States.
	   Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman Gerhard Zierl said that
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was taken from Munich's Stadelheim prison to
Munich airport about 9 a.m. and handed over to the Americans. He
was placed on a flight for the United States shortly thereafter.
	   A Bonn government spokesman on Saturday said that the Justice
and Foreign Ministries in Bonn had given final approval for the
extradition of Salim.
	   Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein greeted the
extradition saying it was an ``excellent example of international
cooperation of security officials in the fight against terrorism.''
	   The Federal Constitutional Court cleared the way for the
extradition on Dec. 11, when it declined to accept an appeal
against it from Salim claiming it violated his constitutional
rights.
	   The justice ministry said at the time that extradition would be
approved as soon as the U.S. government gave assurances that Salim
would not face a death penalty, which is forbidden by the German
constitution.
	   Salim, 40, had been jailed since his arrest in Bavaria three
months ago on a U.S. warrant. A Munich state court originally
approved his extradition on Nov. 27.
	   U.S. officials claim Salim is Bin Laden's finance chief and have
charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of weapons
of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are jailed
in the United States.
	   The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.

	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic and world champions Russia and
Norway both recorded World Cup cross country relay victories on
Sunday.
	   Triple Olympic champion Bjoern Daehlie helped Norway's men to
victory in the 4x10km (4x6 mile) classic/freestyle race, the
foursome completing the course in 1 hour, 38 minutes, 48.2 seconds.
	   Sweden's men just missed victory by .3 seconds, while Austria
clocked the third-fastest aggregate time of 1:39:27.1.
	   Russia's women, led by double Olympic gold medallist Olga
Danilova and triple Olympic champion Larissa Lazutina, clinched the
4x5km (4x3 mile) relay in 54:32.1, a comfortable 47.6 seconds clear
of runnerup Italy, the Olympic bronze medallist.
	   A second Russian team finished third, 51.8 adrift.
	   Norway, runnerup at the world championships and the Nagano
Olympics, finished back in sixth, 1:54.9 behind.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill
Clinton made headlines around the world Sunday, though most
governments remained silent on the political turmoil in the United
States.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives impeached Clinton on Saturday
for obstructing justice and lying under oath about his sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky and voted largely along party lines to
send his case to the Senate for a trial.
	   Government leaders elsewhere were reluctant to make public
statements about the impeachment, saying it was an internal matter
for America.
	   Philippine Pres. Joseph Estrada, who has faced allegations of
womanizing in the past, declined to respond to questions about it
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch ally of Clinton's,
said it would not be right for him to comment.
	   But Blair said he had ``nothing but contempt'' for suggestions
that the U.S.-British bombing raid on Iraq was timed to divert
attention away from the impeachment.
	   ``I find it utterly grotesque and offensive, not just to
President Clinton, but to me, that anyone could suggest we would
put British or American service men or women into action because of
any internal matter in the United States of America,'' Blair said.
	   He said he would have insisted on the timing and that delaying
the attack until after the impeachment vote would have been a
``gross dereliction of duty.''
	   In France, Jack Lang, president of the Foreign Affairs
Commission in the National Assembly, reaffirmed his long-standing
support of Clinton, saying the U.S. president has been ``the victim
of a witch hunt from another era.''
	   The House of Representatives has ``just offered the world a
festival of hypocrisy,'' he said, adding that the proceedings had
been a ``parody of justice'' and a ``sectarian fundamentalism''
that risks destabilizing a great democracy.
	   The South Korean state-run news agency, Yonhap, said it was a
``very unhappy day for President Bill Clinton and the United
States.''
	   It urged Clinton to apologize for his ``lies'' to defuse the
political crisis and prevent instability not only within the United
States, but worldwide.
	   British newspapers divided along political lines, with left-wing
papers attacking Republicans and conservative papers demanding
Clinton's resignation and replacement by Vice-President Al Gore.
	   ``It's time to show Bill the door and say hello to Gore,'' said
an editorial in Britain's biggest selling tabloid, the News of the
World, which is owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
	   The Observer, a left-wing broadsheet, said impeachment was ``a
tragedy for the U.S. and the world,'' but sympathized with
Democrats who believed that the vote was ``an attempted
constitutional coup d'etat by the Republicans.''
	   A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige due to
the scandal.
	   Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner
Morgenpost daily newspaper said in a Sunday editorial that the
Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United
States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.
	   In Turin, Italy, La Stampa ran an unusually large closeup of
Clinton's face.
	   ``These eyes, red and humiliated, those heavy bags under the
eyes, that ashen complexion, are the tragic testimony to the
humiliation of a young leader, William Jefferson Clinton, the
Democrat who stopped the 12-year-hegemony of the Republicans in the
White House, the man who had relaunched the hopes of a reasoning
left in all the world,'' wrote columnist Gianni Riotta, a former
U.S.-based foreign correspondent.
	   ``The reader who compares this extraordinary, dramatic photo
with the Clinton radiant in 1992, with the sharp Clinton in 1995
when he defeated his rival (Newt) Gingrich in the battle over the
budget, with the statesman Clinton of the Balkans, Ireland, the
Middle East, will find elements of reflection,'' Riotta said.
	   ``Not only on the future of politics in America and in the
world, but also, perhaps above all, on the frailty of human things,
of the destiny of he who is powerful but not immune to his own
weaknesses or to the cruelty of Fate.''

IOC president wants new selection system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee will likely
find a new way to select host cities for the Summer and Winter
Games as a result of the widening bribery scandal, according to its
powerful president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   ``After this scandal, I believe that the IOC as a whole must
accept that the system needs to change and that we can't continue
like this,'' Samaranch said in an interview with the Le Matin
newspaper Sunday.
	   ``We are not happy with the way of selecting organizing cities
for the games,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The IOC has been shaken to its core by allegations of rampant
corruption and vote-buying masterminded by crooked agents. A top
IOC member, Switzerland's Marc Holder, has estimated that 5-7
percent of the 115 members are open to bribery.
	   Samaranch said the Olympic movement should aim to follow the
example of other big sports bodies, which leave major decisions to
their executive committees rather than the full membership.
	   He told Le Matin he had proposed this several times.
	   ``But it's not easy to ask members to agree to cut off their own
heads,'' he said in the two page interview.
	   But given the circumstances, he said it was possible that the
IOC members give the 11-member executive committee special powers,
he said.
	   Samaranch said the investigation into wrongdoings by Salt Lake
City, the host for the 2002 Winter Games, should be completed by
Jan. 23 and would be discussed at a meeting that day.
	   Salt Lake City organizers have admitted to using a dlrs 400,000
scholarship fund to let IOC members' families study _ but have said
this was a humanitarian gesture rather than bribery.
	   There is growing evidence of other favors for IOC members,
including free medical care and gifts in excess of the IOC imposed
limit.
	   Many of the allegations focus on IOC members from Africa,
particularly those from the Congo, Libya and Swaziland.
	   Samaranch told the newspaper that the bombshell about
misdemeanors concerning Salt Lake City had come to him only as a
``semi-surprise.''
	   Even prior to that, senior Olympic officials had doubts that
some members' behavior was at the ``limit.''
	   ``We are going to react in a strong way and clean up,'' he said.
	   IOC members found guilt of corruption will be kicked out of the
exclusive club, he said.
	   Under Samaranch the Olympic Games have become one of the world's
biggest money-spinning events. For instance, television rights for
the Moscow Olympics in 1980 were dlrs 100 million. For the Athens
games in 2004 they will be dlrs 1.4 billion.
	   As the Games have grown, so has the scope for abuse.
	   Samaranch indicated that the new selection procedure might be in
place by next summer, when the choice is made on the host for the
2006 Winter Olympics.
	   If successful, the same system would be used for the 2008 Games
decision, he said.
	   The Swiss city of Sion, which lost out to Salt Lake City for
2002, is widely considered the front-runner for the 2006 Games.
	   Hodler, a former head of the International Ski Federation, is on
the Sion organizing committee But there is growing concern that by
provoking the IOC's biggest ever scandal, Hodler may prompt a loss
of support for the Swiss bid.
	   In an interview with the SonntagsZeitung newspaper, Swiss Sports
Minister Adolf Ogi resisted demands for Hodler to distance himself
from the Sion bid.
	   ``Out of the question,'' said Ogi.
	   Ogi also said that the selection procedure needed changing so
that just the executive committee or evaluation committee decided
rather than the entire membership.

Opposition claims Saddam's cousin executed several officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group claimed Sunday
that a cousin of Saddam Hussein who commands the military in the
southern region has executed several army officers for disobeying
orders.
	   Among those executed was the commander of the 11th Mechanized
Division in the southern city of Amarah, the Supreme Council for
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The cousin, former Defense Minister Ali Hasan Al-Majid, was
given the command of the predominantly Shiite southern region as
part of a reorganization by Saddam, who divided the country into
four military districts on Wednesday.
	   The Supreme Council said the executions took place immediately
after al-Majid took control.
	   The Supreme Council is based in Iran, and there has been no
independent confirmation of the report. Iraqi authorities do not
comment on such claims.
	   Besides al-Majid, Saddam gave control of the other three new
commands to trusted aides. The move was apparently aimed at
thwarting possible civilian uprising in case U.S. and British
airstrikes inflicted heavy military damage.
	   The southern Shiite districts have long been trouble spots for
Saddam's government.
	   After the end of the 1991 Gulf War that routed Saddam's forces
from Kuwait, 14 provinces in the Shiite south as well as Kurdish
north rebelled against the government, but were put down brutally.
	   The Supreme Council said the executed Mechanized Division's
commander, who was not identified, objected to some arrangements
made by al-Majid to counter Shiites in case they rebelled again.
	   It said several other officers close to the commander were also
executed in front of other officers by a firing squad brought by
al-Majid from Baghdad.
	   Al-Majid has deployed in four key towns members of the
Republican Guard, members of the ruling Baath Party and soldiers
from Saddam's Fedayeen, or Saddam's Commandos, an elite military
unit.
	   Al-Majid is known for brutality.
	   Video footage broadcast by some Western television stations
after the 1991 uprising showed al-Majid kicking in the face and
chest several alleged rebels arrested by the Republican Guard.
	   The Supreme Council statement said five other officers, in the
al-Rasheed military camp on the outskirts of Baghdad, were executed
on Friday after being suspected of trying to move their units
outside the camp.
	   It said the five officers barricaded themselves inside the camp
with other soldiers. A unit from the Special Guard stormed the
building and arrested the officers.

ROME: Wednesday games.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Perugia 2, Fiorentina 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At Perugia, the hosts took the early lead when Rapajic met
Brazilian defender Ze Maria's cross to net his sixth goal.
Fiorentina found an equalizer 10 minutes later when Anselmo
Robbiati, making a rare start because Brazil's Edmundo was
suspended, tucked a free kick under the crossbar from the edge of
the penalty area.
	   Batistuta, trying to become the fifth player in the last 20
years to lead the league in scoring while playing for a title
winner, then put Fiorentina ahead by nodding home Belgian winger
Luis Oliveira's pass.
	   Perugia, which was in Serie B last season, is 5-4-5.
 &UR; Parma 5, Empoli 3 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Fuser set up Argentine Hernan Crespo's ninth goal of
the season in the 10th minute and French midfielder Alain
Boghossian's tally at the end of the first half. Fuser put the ball
in the net himself for Parma (7-5-2) in the 57th and in second-half
injury time. Arturo Di Napoli scored two goals for Empoli (3-5-6),
including one on which replays appeared to show he trapped a pass
with his hand.
 &UR; Sampdoria 2, Milan 2 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, Ortega's fourth goal of the season, after Italy
captain Paolo Maldini fouled Samp striker Francesco Palmieri on a
breakaway, gave the hosts (3-5-6) _ who fired coach Luciano
Spalletti this week after losing three of five _ the surprising
draw. Milan (7-4-3) led 2-1 in the 73rd minute on German striker
Oliver Bierhoff's header.
 &UR; Juventus 3, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, Inzaghi collected the ball after a Zidane free kick
sliced through the defensive wall and slotted home from 12 meters
(yards) after 20 minutes of play. In the 29th, the Italian
international took a perfect through-ball from Zidane and sent a
low, 8-meter (yard) shot into the corner. Inzaghi completed the
rout in the 87th, knocking in a rebound for his eighth goal on the
year. Salernitana fell to 3-3-8.
 &UR; Lazio 3, Udinese 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Salas scored in the 55th minute and again in injury
time to rally Lazio (6-5-3), which also saw Roberto Mancini hit his
152nd career goal, most among active players. Tomas Locatelli
scored for Udinese (4-4-6) after five minutes.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Cagliari 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Signori pounded home a 20-meter (yard) free kick in
the 50th minute for UEFA Cup quarterfinalist Bologna (5-6-3).
Cagliari fell to 4-2-8.
 &UR; Piacenza 3, Bari 2 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, Giampiero Piovani (19th minute), veteran Giovanni
Stroppa (43rd) and Massimo Rastelli (90th) found the target for the
hosts (4-4-6), which moved four spots away from the relegation
zone. Bari (3-9-2) failed in an attempt to tie the franchise record
of 10 games without a loss.
 &UR; Vicenza 0, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, two clubs battling relegation failed to put up much
of a fight. Vicenza (2-6-6) is 16th in the 18-team league, Venezia
(2-5-7) is 18th.

Vialli's team has new-found consistency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Can Chelsea stay there?
	   Gianluca Vialli's team has hit the top of the Premier League for
the first time in almost 10 years. The question now is whether the
fashionable west London team can match its only other league
triumph 44 seasons ago.
	   Chelsea's collection of stars from around the world have defied
the critics who argued they lacked consistency. They are now
considered strong title contenders along with Manchester United.
	   It's likely that Chelsea will only stay top for two days.
	   Saturday's 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge enabled
Vialli's star-studded team to jump from third to first and head
Aston Villa on goal difference. All Villa has to do to get its lead
back is gain a draw at home to struggling Charlton on Monday.
	   So Chelsea, which has not lost in the league since the opening
day of the season and is unbeaten in 17 games, may not have long to
savor the moment. Yet all the signs are that Vialli's team has the
talent and the new-found determination to maintain its title
challenge.
	   Chelsea has always had talented players. It's problem always has
been an inability to stay the distance in long title races and the
club has been outlasted by more consistent teams like Manchester
United, Arsenal and Liverpool.
	   Performances like last Wednesday's 1-1 tie at Old Trafford,
where Chelsea fell behind to Manchester United but hit back
strongly in the last 30 minutes to gain a tie and almost snatch
victory, was a sign of the new Chelsea.
	   Vialli knows that, even if Chelsea loses its place at the top on
Monday, it has the character and the players to get back. He
believes they have the ability to stay there.
	   ``The players are very happy and going top might give us a lot
of confidence. It's important to get into that position but it's
even more important to stay there,'' Vialli said.
	   ``Now everybody thinks that Chelsea are one of the best teams in
England and they try everything to beat us. Life will be even more
difficult in the future. I will be curious to see how we will react
but I do think we'll be able to cope with that as we have
experienced players who are used to staying at the top.''
	   While Italian striker Gianfranco Zola has returned to close to
his best form and French World Cup defenders Marcel Desailly and
Franck Leboeuf have formed a solid alliance at the back, Vialli
sees Uruguayan midfielder Gustavo Poyet as probably the biggest
influence in his team's surge to the top.
	   ``He's one of the most clever players that I've played with in
all my career,'' the former Sampdoria and Juventus striker said.
	   ``He scores a lot of goals and also works very hard for the
team. He's got an unbelievable attitude and is always positive.
He's one of the players all the managers would love to have.
	   ``Unfortunately, he missed six months last season through injury
and that was very important for Chelsea,'' Vialli said.
	   ``He was one of the reasons why we were in a great position last
season and probably people have only started talking about him this
season because he's playing regular football.
	   ``He can do everything. He can defend, he can play fancy
football, his runs are always very clever, his passes are very
precise,'' the Chelsea manager said. ``He is the complete
midfielder.''
	   Poyet hit Chelsea's first goal against Spurs on Saturday with 10
minutes remaining to take his total for the season to 10, including
seven in the league.
	   ``I was a striker in my younger days so I know about scoring
goals and hopefully I can go on and beat that record this season,''
said Poyet, who was a consistent scorer over seven seasons for Real
Zaragoza including 14 in his last season in Spain.
	   Poyet has more chances to score at struggling Southampton on
Saturday before Chelsea has a high-powered game against Manchester
United at Stamford Bridge Dec. 29.

Nakata matches Batistuta, Perugia holds Fiorentina to draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. WILL be UPDATED after Internazionale-Roma late
match, scheduled to start at 1930 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata slotted in a penalty kick
in the 95th minute of play Sunday to give Perugia a dramatic 2-2
draw against Fiorentina, cutting the Serie A leader's advantage to
three standings points heading into the winter break.
	   Before Nakata's heroics, made possible when Spanish midfielder
Martinez Amor used his hand to knock down a cross in the penalty
area during the dying seconds of injury time, Fiorentina looked
headed for another victory thanks to Gabriel Batistuta's exploits.
	   The Argentine star gave the visitors a 2-1 lead with 17 minutes
left by netting a header for his league-best 14th goal in as many
games. Fiorentina had won two straight 1-0 games on second-half
Batistuta goals.
	   But ninth-place Perugia, which led 20 seconds into the match on
Croat striker Milan Rapajic's header, pressed forward. Nakata, the
second Japanese player in the Italian League, calmly hit the
equalizer for his seventh goal of the season.
	   AC Parma moved up to second place by beating Empoli 5-3 as Diego
Fuser tallied two goals and two assists.
	   AC Milan is third after a 2-2 draw against Sampdoria of Genoa,
whose new coach, former England captain David Platt, watched from
the stands. Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega, back from a drunk
driving suspension, curled in a penalty kick with four minutes
remaining to tie the score for Sampdoria.
	   Fiorentina (9-2-3), alone in first place for the first time
since 1982, leads the table with 29 points. Parma follows with 26,
and Milan has 25.
	   Defending champion Juventus of Turin (6-3-5), tied for sixth
with 21 points, snapped a three-game losing streak and ended a
club-record goal drought by beating Salernitana 3-0 on striker
Filippo Inzaghi's hat-trick. Before Inzaghi found the target,
Juve's goalless stretch reached 511 minutes, 5 more than the club
went without scoring in the 1967-68 season.
	   French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane, expected to collect all
the major player of the year awards, assisted on Inzaghi's first
two goals.
	   Elsewhere, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas scored twice to lead
Lazio of Rome past Udinese 3-1; veteran Giuseppe Signori's free
kick gave Bologna a 1-0 win at Cagliari; Piacenza edged Bari 3-2;
and Vicenza and Venezia drew 0-0.
	   At night, Ronaldo's Internazionale of Milan hosted Francesco
Totti's AS Roma.
	   The league now takes more than two weeks off, and action resumes
Jan. 6 with a rare slate of Wednesday games.
 &UR; Perugia 2, Fiorentina 2 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, the hosts took the early lead when Rapajic met
Brazilian defender Ze Maria's cross to net his sixth goal.
Fiorentina equalized 10 minutes later when Anselmo Robbiati, making
a rare start because Brazil's Edmundo was suspended, tucked a free
kick under the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area.
	   Batistuta, trying to become the fifth player in the last 20
years to lead the league in scoring while playing for a title
winner, then put Fiorentina ahead by nodding home Belgian winger
Luis Oliveira's pass.
	   Perugia, which was in Serie B last season, is 5-4-5.
 &UR; Parma 5, Empoli 3 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, Fuser set up Argentine Hernan Crespo's ninth goal of
the season in the 10th minute and French midfielder Alain
Boghossian's tally at the end of the first half. Fuser put the ball
in the net himself for Parma (7-5-2) in the 57th and in second-half
injury time. Arturo Di Napoli scored twice for Empoli (3-5-6),
including one on which replays appeared to show he trapped a pass
with his hand.
 &UR; Sampdoria 2, Milan 2 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, Ortega's fourth goal of the season, after Italy
captain Paolo Maldini fouled Samp striker Francesco Palmieri on a
breakaway, gave the hosts (3-5-6) _ who fired coach Luciano
Spalletti this week after losing three of five _ the surprising
draw. Milan (7-4-3) led 2-1 in the 73rd minute on German striker
Oliver Bierhoff's header.
 &UR; Juventus 3, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, Inzaghi collected the ball after a Zidane free kick
sliced through the defensive wall and slotted home from 12 meters
(yards) after 20 minutes of play. In the 29th, the Italian
international took a perfect through-ball from Zidane and sent a
low, 8-meter (yard) shot into the corner. Inzaghi completed the
rout in the 87th, knocking in a rebound for his eighth goal on the
year. Salernitana fell to 3-3-8.
 &UR; Lazio 3, Udinese 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Salas scored in the 55th minute and again in injury
time to rally Lazio (6-5-3), which also saw Roberto Mancini hit his
152nd career goal, most among active players. Tomas Locatelli had
put Udinese (4-4-6) in the fifth minute.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Cagliari 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Signori pounded home a 20-meter (yard) free kick in
the 50th minute for UEFA Cup quarterfinalist Bologna (5-6-3).
Cagliari fell to 4-2-8.
 &UR; Piacenza 3, Bari 2 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, Giampiero Piovani (19th minute), veteran Giovanni
Stroppa (43rd) and Massimo Rastelli (90th) found the target for the
hosts (4-4-6), which moved four spots away from the relegation
zone. Bari (3-9-2) failed in an attempt to tie the franchise record
of 10 games without a loss.
 &UR; Vicenza 0, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, two clubs battling relegation failed to put up much
of a fight. Vicenza (2-6-6) is 16th in the 18-team league, Venezia
(2-5-7) is last.

Yeltsin: Use of force only complicated solution to Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Sunday that the
U.S.-British airstrikes had only complicated any solution to the
Iraqi crisis, and welcomed the end to the bombardment.
	   ``Reason has finally prevailed,'' he said in a statement
transmitted by Russian news agencies. ``Now the international
community should draw serious conclusions from these tragic
events.''
	   The United States and Britain halted airstrikes against Iraq on
Saturday after four days of attacks, saying their forces had
inflicted ``significant damage'' on Iraq's military.
	   ``It still remains to fully assess the negative political
consequences the bombardment led to, not to speak of the victims
among the civilian population and the significant damage to the
Iraqi economy, which was already bled dry by the sanctions,''
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``However, now it is absolutely clear that the use of force only
complicated the solution of the Iraqi problem.''
	   Yeltsin said that Russia insisted on the creation of a
multipolar system in the world and the strengthening of the United
Nations' role.
	   ``This is the universal organization that is charged with
guaranteeing collective responses to the new, dangerous challenges
confronted by the family of nations. Nobody has the right to
violate the U.N. charter, which for more than half a century has
been the reliable guarantee of peace and stability,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin called on Iraq to fulfill the U.N. resolutions that
would allow the lifting of sanctions. However, he said that the
world must not neglect Iraq's humanitarian needs, saying that ``now
like never before'' the Iraqis needed massive food and medical aid.
	   The Iraq crisis has underlined Moscow's loss of global influence
and the unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials
about close post-Soviet ties with the West. Part of Yeltsin's anger
stemmed from his not being informed in advance about the
airstrikes.

Ajax holds Feyenoord to 1-1 draw in Rotterdam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Defender Kees van Wonderen scored
a 72nd-minute equalizer to earn Dutch league leader Feyenoord
Rotterdam a draw against its old rival Ajax Amsterdam.
	   The result left Feyenoord at the top of the Dutch honor
division, six points ahead of Vitesse Arnhem and nine ahead of Ajax
as the Dutch league goes into its winter break which lasts until
February.
	   South African striker Benni McCarthy gave Ajax the lead in the
39th minute, crowning a spell of pressure that followed a lifeless
opening half hour.
	   But Feyenoord fought its way back into the match in the second
half and missed a number of good chances after Van Wonderen's
equalizer in front of 50,000 fans at De Kuip stadium.
	   Ajax nearly stole the tie deep in injury time at the end of the
match but Polish midfielder Andrzej Rudy's shot flashed just wide
of the Feyenoord goal.
	   Police arrested 21 supporters before the match but no serious
incidents were reported.
	   At the other end of the table, last-placed RKC Waalwijk recorded
just its second victory of the season, beating second-from-bottom
NAC Breda 2-1.
	   Roberto Lanckohr gave RKC a 9th-minute lead but Jeffrey van As
brought NAC level in the 17th minute before Hans van Arum sealed a
much-needed victory for RKC. Despite the win, RKC remained rooted
to the foot of the table with just 10 points from 19 matches. NAC
remained one place higher with 13 points from eight matches.
	   FC Utrecht effectively won its match against Sparta Rotterdam
inside the first half hour, scoring three times in the first 25
minutes. Jochem van der Hoeven pulled back a goal for Sparta in the
56th minute, but Utrecht scored again in the 77th minute to make
the final score 4-1 to Utrecht.

 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: The United States rained more Tomahawk cruise
missiles on Iraq during the four-day Operation Desert Fox than
during the Gulf War. This is how it looked from the center of the
action, the carrier USS Enterprise. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAH102,103, XSE111,112. WXS105, 107 of Dec. 19. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ The admiral went to the ship's
bridge. It was 53 minutes to midnight on Wednesday. About 8 miles
(13 kms) away, a bright white glow lit the sea.
	   Rear Adm. J. Cutler Dawson Jr. watched the fiery trail of the
first Tomahawk cruise missile carry 1,000 pounds (450 kgs) of
explosives toward Iraq. The firing from the submarine USS Miami
opened the barrage. Less than a half hour later, warplanes began
streaking from the deck of the USS Enterprise.
	   Dawson left the bridge and prepared for a long night.
	   He made no announcement to the nearly 5,000 airmen and sailors
aboard. Everyone had known for hours that the attacks would begin.
They had been readying for the possibility since the Enterprise
raced to the Gulf at 31 knots, near its maximum speed.
	   In the flight area, the air wing commander, Capt. Tom Hagen,
gathered pilots to review their targets: suspected weapons sites
and facilities for Saddam Hussein's prized Republican Guard.
	   More than half the airmen had experience in the 1991 Gulf War or
monitoring the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. These were the men
Hagen wanted in the air.
	   ``Opening night is not the time for the new folks to go,'' said
Hagen of Billings, Montana.
	   He told the pilots to make sure they had all their survival gear
and that their flight suits were ``sanitized'' _ free of all names
and markings in case they were captured.
	   ``I want you to visualize yourself up there, dropping the bombs
and coming back safely,'' he urged. Hagen watched the pilots
closely. He didn't want to see anyone too cocky or too calm.
	   ``They should have their game face on,'' he said. ``It's focused
on what needs to be done.''
	   The first night was an all-Navy barrage. F/A-18 Hornet and F-14
Tomcat warplanes, loaded with laser-guided rockets and free-fall
bombs, flew runs off the carrier.
	   About 200 cruise missiles were launched from the Miami and other
vessels in the battle group during the first assault _ more than
one every two minutes until sunrise. Fewer than 300 Tomahawks hit
Iraq during the entire Gulf War.
	   The last plane arrived back at the carrier about 5:30 a.m.
	   Military planners decided to wage the attacks in the dark to
take advantage of night-vision technology and the extra concealment
it gives warplanes.
	   ``We feel that we own the night,'' Dawson said.
	   The following evening, the Iraqis fought back with more
firepower.
	   The flak from the anti-aircraft batteries was heavier. Pilots
also began seeing more surface-to-air missiles. Still, there was no
sign of Iraqi jets challenging the air armada.
	   In Kuwait _ rescued from Iraqi occupation in the Gulf War _
British Tornado fighters left their base to join the air assault.
U.S. Air Force B-52 and B-1 bombers also took to the sky. Extra
American ground troops arrived in Kuwait.
	   Tanker planes, with the capability to refuel jets in mid-air,
were also sent aloft to allow the fighter-bomber pilots to double
the duration of their missions, what they call ``events,'' to about
three hours.
	   ``The intensity of the (anti-aircraft fire) is about what we
expected,'' said Dawson. ``It's not overwhelming in any fashion.''
	   Cmdr. Kevin Miller, leader of an F/A-18 squadron, attributed the
heavier second night anti-aircraft fire to Iraqi preparations.
	   ``The first night we had the element of surprise,'' said Miller
of Jacksonville, Florida. ``They were ready for us the second
night.''
	   About 50 cruise missiles were fired from the Enterprise battle
group. The cruiser USS Gettysburg, which arrived with about 100
Tomahawks, had nearly exhausted its supply.
	   Day 3: The adrenaline rush was waning. Most of the crew had only
a few hours' sleep since the attacks began. Officers watched for
signs of stress or fatigue.
	   ``If I spot anyone getting giddy, I tell them to go to bed,''
said Patrick Lynch of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, the aviation
ordnance chief who oversees the flow of weaponry from the storage
bays to the flight deck.
	   Deep in the hull, assembly teams raced to keep up with the
orders for missiles.
	   A dozen men put together a missile in about 10 minutes _ from
bracing the tail fins to securing the guidance system in the nose.
The pace is twice as fast as the training runs.
	   Aviation Ordnance 3rd Class Randy Self of Cullman, Alabama, was
getting by on about 90 minutes of sleep a day.
	   ``We were going flat out,'' he said. ``We didn't even know if it
was day or night.''
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan had begun. Arabs around the
Middle East intensified protests against the attacks. Syrian
demonstrators ripped the flag from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus and
burned it. Palestinians raged against the United States _ just a
week after President Bill Clinton visited the Gaza Strip and
boosted Palestinian efforts for self-determination.
	   ``With Ramadan coming, we had a very limited window,'' said
F/A-18 pilot Lt. Cmdr. Eric Rasmussen of Jacksonville, Florida.
	   Saddam claimed hospitals and other civilian sites were hit by
the airstrikes.
	   On the Enterprise, military experts reviewed the digital images
from the raids. The video is downloaded into computers before being
sent for more detailed analysis at Central Command in Tampa,
Florida.
	   Dawson declined to specify the targets hit, but he insisted no
sites were near medical centers or other large civilian buildings.
	   Pentagon officials announced the airstrike could continue into
Ramadan.
	   In the Gulf, a second U.S. carrier arrived. The USS Carl Vinson
led its six-vessel battle group into position.
	   Early Sunday, Dawson received a call from the military command
for Southwest Asia. Desert Fox was over. The last warplane returned
to the Vinson about 2 a.m.
	   In total, 650 U.S. and British attack missions were launched
against Iraq _ about half from the Enterprise battle group. More
than 325 cruise missiles were fired from Navy ships, and more than
90 from B-52s.
	   No flights were planned for the rest of Sunday. Pilots and
others caught up on their sleep. Unused bombs were dismantled.
	   At a Roman Catholic Mass in the ship's chapel, Rev. Bob Panec
offered a prayer for the Iraqis ``suffering from the rages of
war.''
	   The daily flight schedule always features a cartoon on the back.
Sunday's drawing was a caricature of Saddam running from a shower
of rockets. The caption read: ``It was fun while it lasted.''

Balloon team sails over Central Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ After braving a night of fierce thunderstorms, British
tycoon Richard Branson and his crew soared over Central Asia on
Sunday heading for the Himalayas on day three of their historic
attempt to circle the globe in a balloon.
	   ``Somebody was looking over us last night,'' an elated Branson
told the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone company that
is supporting the trip, after making it through the storms.
	   The storms forced Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fosset and
teammate Per Lindstrand to navigate through a narrow corridor
bringing them close to three countries that had denied them access
to fly over their territory: Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   Fosset, who lost a balloon in the Pacific two months ago as a
result of a thunderstorm, shouted to his teammates to put on their
parachutes Saturday as they headed north over Turkey to avoid Iraq.
	   ``By climbing the winds blew us closer to Iraq. What was worse _
a possible storm ahead or the `storms' of Iraq? We decided to risk
the thunder and press on,'' Branson told the ground crew, according
to a communique.
	   The balloon missed Iraq by just 60 miles (97 kilometers), Iran
by 7 miles (12 kilometers) and Russia by just 10 miles (16
kilometers).
	   ``I have never seen anything like this in the 30 years I have
been ballooning,'' said ICO Project Director Mike Kendrick, saying
going through such a gap was ``like threading a needle.''
	   The crew hoped to have a quiet day Monday, flying across
Turkmenistan before heading into Afghanistan and then along the
Himalayas, another potential trouble spot.
	   The first leg of the trip has been probably the most politically
sensitive, and only intense diplomacy overcame a last-minute
decision by Libya rescinding permission to fly over its territory.
	   ICO spokeswoman Lori Levin-Hyams said Branson had recovered from
a sore throat he had early in the trip, which began with the launch
Friday from a Moroccan airforce base.
	   Branson and his colleagues, who are all wearing silver
jumpsuits, estimate the trip could last from eight days to nearly
three weeks.
	   The crew hope to touch down somewhere in western Europe at the
end of a 24,000-mile flight which will take them over India, the
South China sea, the Pacific and the United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals - Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. Branson has
tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to circle
the world in a balloon.
	   Improved technology has been used to make the balloon, including
a canopy of Kevlar of the kind used for bulletproof vest that
covers the canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon - from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Opposition claims Saddam's cousin executed several officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group claimed Sunday
that a cousin of Saddam Hussein who commands the military in the
southern region has executed several army officers for disobeying
orders.
	   Among those executed was the commander of the 11th Mechanized
Division in the southern city of Amarah, the Supreme Council for
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The cousin, former Defense Minister Ali Hasan Al-Majid, was
given the command of the predominantly Shiite southern region as
part of a reorganization by Saddam, who divided the country into
four military districts on Wednesday.
	   The Supreme Council said the executions took place immediately
after al-Majid took control.
	   The Supreme Council is based in Iran, and there has been no
independent confirmation of the report. Iraqi authorities do not
comment on such claims.
	   Besides al-Majid, Saddam gave control of the other three new
commands to trusted aides. The move was apparently aimed at
thwarting possible civilian uprising in case U.S. and British
airstrikes inflicted heavy military damage.
	   The southern Shiite districts have long been trouble spots for
Saddam's government.
	   After the end of the 1991 Gulf War that routed Saddam's forces
from Kuwait, 14 provinces in the Shiite south as well as Kurdish
north rebelled against the government, but were put down brutally.
	   The Supreme Council said the executed Mechanized Division's
commander, who was not identified, objected to some arrangements
made by al-Majid to counter Shiites in case they rebelled again.
	   It said several other officers close to the commander were also
executed in front of other officers.
	   Al-Majid is known for brutality.
	   The Supreme Council statement said five other officers, in the
al-Rasheed military camp on the outskirts of Baghdad, were executed
on Friday after being suspected of trying to move their units
outside the camp.

PAOK beats Paniliakos, moves to second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Bozidar Bandovic scored one goal and Mirko
Taccola added another as PAOK Salonica marked its sixth win in a
row, beating Paniliakos 2-1 in Pyrgos Sunday to gain second place
in the Greek first decision soccer league.
	   After 14 rounds, PAOK has 29 points, the same with AEK Athens
but from 13 games.
	   They are two points behind defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus
which also has a match in hand.
	   Both Olympiakos and AEK play Monday against Iraklis Salonica and
Ethnikos Piraeus respectively.
	   Panathinaikos Athens trounced crosstown Apollon 5-0 but dropped
to fourth place with 28 points.
	   PAOK's rise from 5th to 2nd place was made possible only after a
disciplinary sports committee last week decided to give back the
team three points deducted for fan violence during a league game
against Olympiakos.
	   In addition, the committee reduced from five to three the home
games that the punished PAOK would play away.
	   Last month, angry PAOK supporters entered the pitch and clashed
with police when the referee canceled a goal by PAOK eight minutes
before the end of the game. Olympiakos was leading 2-1 when the
referee stopped the match.
	   The committee ruled that the match was properly completed and
that the disturbances occurred after the end of it. The club was
therefore not held responsible for what had happened after the
game.
	   ``The committee's decision is illegal and in direct
contravention of the rules governing soccer games,'' said the
Association of Professional Soccer Clubs (EPAE), organizer of
Greece's soccer leagues. It asked for the immediate replacement of
the members of the disciplinary committee.
	   The decision was also widely criticized by the sports press
which claimed that it was a result of political pressure to appease
anger among sports fans in northern Greece, who claim the league is
biased toward Athens.
	   In Sunday's game, PAOK took the lead with Bandovic off a pass
from Costas Frantzeskos in the 8th minute.
	   The scorer came close to a second goal in the 30th when,
one-on-one with goalie Socratis Kopsahilis, shot wide.
	   Taccola made it 2-0 with a backward scissor kick from inside the
area in the 45th.
	   The hosts had two good scoring opportunities with Peruvian
striker Miguel Rosales during this half.
	   Paniliakos became more aggressive in the second period, but
could only narrow the gap with a goal from Miltiadis Sapanis in the
61st.
	   After a scoreless first half during which Apollon's goaltender
Vangelis Koentas made a series of key saves, Panathinaikos came out
in the second period and crushed the visitors 5-0, all goals scored
by the club's two Polish strikers.
	   Panathinaikos' task was highly facilitated after the expulsion
with two yellow cards of Stavros Lambriakos in the 45th minute.
	   Krzysztof Warzycha opened the scoring in the 46th, and made it
2-0 in the 77th.
	   Igor Sypniewski completed the triumph with a hat trick in the
78th, 81st and 85th minutes.

Kelly denies payment was bribe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Graham Kelly, who quit as English soccer's most
powerful official over an unauthorized 3.2 million pound (dles 5
million) loan to the Welsh federation, maintained on Sunday the
payment was not a bribe.
	   Kelly has agreed that he and Football Association chairman Keith
Wiseman promised the money to the Welsh FA without telling the rest
of the executive committee of the English FA and the payment has
been interpreted as a bribe to gain a Welsh vote in Wiseman's favor
in a FIFA/UEFA election.
	   Kelly has denied that was the motive. But he has agreed that the
payment was in keeping with the English FA's long-running policy of
helping out other cash-strapped soccer federations and he could not
see anything wrong if that policy had a positive effect on
England's bid to win the 2006 World Cup.
	   ``A bribe to me is somebody slipping something into somebody's
back pocket and then they go away and stash it in the Bahamas,'' he
said.
	   ``What I was doing was in the best interests of English
football. I went into it with the very good intentions of trying to
seek to strengthen England's position in world football generally
and in connection with the World Cup 2006 campaign.''
	   Kelly said he believed the World Cup bid didn't need much help
anyway.
	   ``If the 2006 World Cup is decided on the strength of the bids
then England is in fine shape,'' he said. ``It is in the best
position at the moment. It has the best case, the best grounds, the
best infrastructure and I believe it will stay that way up until
the time the decision is taken in March 2000.''
	   Kelly agreed that he and Wiseman should have let the executive
committee know about the Welsh offer at an earlier stage.
	   ``With hindsight it would have been better to come up front with
it much more quickly than we did,'' he said. ``That was not a
deliberate act and it was something which didn't get done in the
heat of the moment.''
	   But the executive committee weren't prepared to accept his
explanation and, in the biggest scandal in the FA's 135-year

Balloon team sails over Central Asia

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with flight, speed, altitude details &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ After braving a night of fierce thunderstorms, British
tycoon Richard Branson and his crew soared over Central Asia on
Sunday heading for the Himalayas on day three of their historic
attempt to circle the globe in a balloon.
	   ``Somebody was looking over us last night,'' an elated Branson
told the ground crew of ICO Global, a mobile telephone company that
is supporting the trip, after making it through the storms.
	   The storms forced Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fosset and
teammate Per Lindstrand to navigate through a narrow corridor
bringing them close to three countries that had denied them access
to fly over their territory: Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   Fosset, who lost a balloon in the Pacific two months ago as a
result of a thunderstorm, shouted to his teammates to put on their
parachutes Saturday as they headed north over Turkey to avoid Iraq.
	   ``By climbing the winds blew us closer to Iraq. What was worse _
a possible storm ahead or the `storms' of Iraq? We decided to risk
the thunder and press on,'' Branson told the ground crew, according
to a communique.
	   The balloon missed Iraq by just 60 miles (97 kilometers), Iran
by 7 miles (12 kilometers) and Russia by just 10 miles (16
kilometers).
	   ``I have never seen anything like this in the 30 years I have
been ballooning,'' said ICO Project Director Mike Kendrick, saying
going through such a gap was ``like threading a needle.''
	   The crew hoped to have a quiet day Monday, flying across
Turkmenistan before heading into Afghanistan and then along the
Himalayas, another potential trouble spot.
	   The balloon was flying Sunday at an altitude of 28,000 feet and
about 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour. By mid-afternoon, it had
already traveled 3,000 miles (4,860 kilometers) since takeoff.

America's allies looking to Kofi Annan to pick up the pieces after
</HEADLINE>
Desert Fox &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Now that U.S.-British airstrikes against
Iraq are over, America's European partners are looking to U.N.
chief Kofi Annan to find a way to maintain arms controls against
Baghdad.
	   ``We trust that a political dialogue can be undertaken as soon
as possible, primarily with the involvement of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
said after U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair announced an end to the airstrikes.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating presidency of the 15-member
European Union. Austria's foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel,
said the focus should be on a ``long-term political solution'' to
ensure that Iraq complies with U.N. orders to destroy all
long-range missiles and mass destruction weapons.
	   Schuessel said such a political solution must ``bring to an end
the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people'' and restore
cooperation between Baghdad and the United Nations.
	   The challenge facing Annan, however, would be to find a formula
for maintaining arms controls against Iraq that would satisfy both
President Saddam Hussein's government and the United States and
Britain.
	   Washington and London have traditionally taken the strongest
positions within the U.N. Security Council in refusing to relax
sweeping economic sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify that
Baghdad has destroyed all its long-range missiles and weapons of
mass destruction.
	   That is the main condition before the U.N. Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam invaded Kuwait,
touching off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   On Saturday, Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, made
clear that his government will no longer work with inspectors from
the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   Claims by U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler that Iraq was not
cooperating fully with his teams led to the four days of
airstrikes.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said France, a permanent
Security Council member, would support a ``new organization, new
methods'' so that the United Nations could maintain ``effective
control on Iraqi weapons and their eventual development.''
	   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said French diplomats
were already working on proposals for ``a new form of cooperation
between the United Nations and Iraq to restore the role of the U.N.
Security Council.''
	   Vedrine gave no details, and it was unclear whether those
proposals would be acceptable to the United States. Any new formula
must win the approval of each of the five permanent Security
Council members _ the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain.
	   In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also called
Sunday for a new initiative to maintain arms control and to
``improve the conditions of the Iraqi people.''
	   German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said Russia should
also play a role in reviving ``a political dialogue (with Iraq) as
soon as possible.''

Blair says world is safer since U.S.-British attack on Saddam

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Outlining a strategy of containing Saddam Hussein,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that the U.S.-British
attacks on the Iraqi dictator have made the world safer and set
back his military machine by years.
	   ``We have severely damaged Saddam's ability to produce and
repair ballistic missiles. We have severely set back his chemical,
biological and unmanned drone programs,'' Blair told a news
conference Sunday. ``His air defense radar, control centers and
communication facilities in southern Iraq have been severely
damaged and will take years to replace.''
	   ``Saddam is weaker now than he was before we started. His
neighbors, the region, and therefore the world, are safer as a
result,'' Blair said.
	   But, he said, the two nations remain ready to attack again if
necessary. Part of the containment strategy involves maintaining
the threat of force and Britain is to send another aircraft
carrier, H.M.S. Invincible, to the region to that end, Blair said.
	   The containment strategy would also include tougher enforcement
of U.N. sanctions against Iraq and Britain would be discussing ways
in which an effective weapons inspection program could resume in
Iraq without ``the previous cat and mouse game,'' he said.
	   Blair rejected the argument that the only worthwhile mission
would have been to topple Saddam, something he said would involve
thousands of Allied troops in a land war.
	   ``Just because we can't get into the cage and strike him down,
it doesn't mean we should leave the cage untouched and the bars too
fragile to hold him,'' Blair said. ``What we have done is to put
him back firmly in the cage and secure it.''
	   Allied tacticians aimed to disable the sprawling armed forces
which keep the dictator in power by raining down laser-guided
munitions and cruise missiles over a 70 hour period on four key
sections of the Iraqi military, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of
the defense staff, told the news conference.
	   ``I think that Saddam Hussein made a great miscalculation,''
Guthrie said. ``I believe that he thought that America might have
been preoccupied in other business and he might well have thought
that we would not do anything because of the approach of Ramadan
and he miscalculated.''
	   Blair said he found ``utterly grotesque and offensive, not just
to President (Bill) Clinton, but to me,'' any suggestions that the
timing of the assault was designed to divert attention away from
Clinton's impeachment toubles.
	   Delaying an attack until after the impeachment vote would have
coincided with Rammadan, the holy Muslim holiday, and waiting until
after the month-long fast was over would have given Saddam five
weeks to prepare.
	   The bombing campaign involved more than 400 cruise missiles,
more than were used during the 1991 Gulf War, and 200 aircraft
strikes, Blair said.
	   A total of 93 Iraqi targets were hit during the four day
assault, Guthrie said.
	   He said those included 30 chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons sites, including a missile repair factory on the edge of
Baghdad and a hardened bunker at the Tallil airfield in southern
Iraq, containing robot drones designed to spray anthrax.
	   Also targeted were 33 air defence sites, including six
airfields, vital to sheltering the Republican Guard, and secret
ballistic missile installations. A total of 20 command centers were
hit, as well as 10 Republican Guard barracks and installations.
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to the Republican Guard which
Saddam kept out of harm's way during the Gulf War,'' Guthrie said.
``They know now they can no longer hide. We have got the ability to
reach out and strike them.''
	   The general said the missions had been planned meticulously to
inflict maximum damage on the Saddam's regime while avoiding harm
to civilians.
	   The objective had been to disable key parts of the Iraqi armed
forces and so render Saddam's one million strong army useless,
Guthrie said.
	   ``The plan was in effect simple,'' he said. ``Just as a car is
made useless with the engine electronics removed, so Saddam's
military machine cannot function without a few key elements.''
	   The United States and Britain decided to attack Iraq after the
U.N. Special Commission reported last week that Saddam's regime had
failed to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors.
	   The two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of
mass destruction, and has used them against his neighbors.

PAOK beats Paniliakos, moves to second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Bozidar Bandovic scored one goal and Mirko
Taccola added another as PAOK Salonica marked its sixth win in a
row, beating Paniliakos 2-1 in Pyrgos Sunday to gain second place
in the Greek first decision soccer league.
	   After 14 rounds, PAOK has 29 points, the same with AEK Athens
but from 13 games.
	   They are two points behind defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus
which also has a match in hand.
	   Both Olympiakos and AEK play Monday against Iraklis Salonica and
Ethnikos Piraeus respectively.
	   Panathinaikos Athens trounced crosstown Apollon 5-0 but dropped
to fourth place with 28 points.
	   PAOK's rise from 5th to 2nd place was made possible only after a
disciplinary sports committee last week decided to give back the
team three points deducted for fan violence during a league game
against Olympiakos.
	   In addition, the committee reduced from five to three the home
games that the punished PAOK would play away.
	   Last month, angry PAOK supporters entered the pitch and clashed
with police when the referee canceled a goal by PAOK eight minutes
before the end of the game. Olympiakos was leading 2-1 when the
referee stopped the match.
	   The committee ruled that the match was properly completed and
that the disturbances occurred after the end of it. The club was
therefore not held responsible for what had happened after the
game.
	   ``The committee's decision is illegal and in direct
contravention of the rules governing soccer games,'' said the
Association of Professional Soccer Clubs (EPAE), organizer of
Greece's soccer leagues. It asked for the immediate replacement of
the members of the disciplinary committee.
	   The decision was also widely criticized by the sports press
which claimed that it was a result of political pressure to appease
anger among sports fans in northern Greece, who claim the league is
biased toward Athens.
	   In Sunday's game, PAOK took the lead with Bandovic off a pass
from Costas Frantzeskos in the 8th minute.
	   The scorer came close to a second goal in the 30th when,
one-on-one with goalie Socratis Kopsahilis, shot wide.
	   Taccola made it 2-0 with a backward scissor kick from inside the
area in the 45th.
	   The hosts had two good scoring opportunities with Peruvian
striker Miguel Rosales during this half.
	   Paniliakos became more aggressive in the second period, but
could only narrow the gap with a goal from Miltiadis Sapanis in the
61st.
	   After a scoreless first half during which Apollon's goaltender
Vangelis Koentas made a series of key saves, Panathinaikos came out
in the second period and crushed the visitors 5-0, all goals scored
by the club's two Polish strikers.
	   Panathinaikos' task was highly facilitated after the expulsion
with two yellow cards of Stavros Lambriakos in the 45th minute.
	   Krzysztof Warzycha opened the scoring in the 46th, and made it
2-0 in the 77th.
	   Igor Sypniewski completed the triumph with a hat trick in the
78th, 81st and 85th minutes.

Pinochet wife says family expects econmic problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's family will have
``to start selling the few things we have'' to pay the former
Chilean dictator's medical and legal expenses in London, a news
report Sunday quoted his wife as saying.
	   In an interview with the Santiago daily La Tercera, Lucia
Hiriart called reports that the family has bank accounts in
Switzerland ``pure, nonsense, foolishness.''
	   Asked how the family will pay Pinochet's medical and legal
bills, she replied, ``Only God knows.''
	   Pinochet was detained Oct. 16 in London as he recovered from
back surgery. Since then, he has been fighting in court a request
to be extradited to Spain to face genocide and torture charges for
human rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   Little is known in Chile about Pinochet's finances, but the
family owns several houses.
	   In the interview in London, Mrs. Pinochet said her 83-year-old
husband has recovered well from the surgery.
	   He is exercising and walking, and spends hours reading and
working at a computer, she said.
	   The extradition case has left Pinochet bitter, she said.
	   He is especially bothered ``by the fact that this happened in a
country he considered friendly. He had always been received well
here. Deep in his heart, that is an additional suffering,'' she
said.
	   Mrs. Pinochet said her husband, who is a senator for life, had
not decided whether he would retire from politics if he returns to
Chile, as the government has suggested.

Students to continue campaign of disruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Ignoring pleas from the government,
protesting high school students vowed Sunday to step up their
campaign to block roads and occupy school buildings around Greece.
	   Student representatives, demanding that government education
reforms be scrapped, voted to expand sporadic blockades to Greece's
main highways. They also decided to continue school occupations
into the new year, as well as stage more mass rallies and rush-hour
roadblocks of Athens' busy streets.
	   Some 2,000 high school buildings are currently under occupation
by their students.
	   Under the reforms, university entrance exams will be scrapped in
favor of a more complicated continual assessment system.
	   The protest, growing steadily over the last two months, has put
additional strain on the Socialist government. Premier Costas
Simitis is already struggling with strike-minded unions over an
array of labor and economic reforms, which have seen his popularity
drop sharply in opinion polls.
	   A survey of lawmakers published Sunday by the Athens daily
Eleftherotypia found that 162 deputies in the 300-member unicameral
parliament now believe the education law should be abolished or
amended.
	   The continuing school protests come in spite of an all-out
information campaign by Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis. He
has spent weeks visiting schools and holding teleconferences with
students and educators to explain the new school program.

China prepares to try one dissident, sends another into exile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and leads throughout with more detentions, comments

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a
crackdown on democracy campaigners, China sent a respected labor
rights activist from jail into U.S. exile Sunday even as it
prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial.
	   Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would
deprive a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer
and a moderate voice. He is the third and most influential leader
in the China Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign that
has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.
	   For organizing the party and thereby challenging the ruling
Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused of subverting state power, a
crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison.
	   To prevent supporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1
Intermediate People's Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues
Sunday and kept watch on the homes of at least two others, friends
and a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   As police moved against Xu's friends, labor rights campaigner
Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and, with
his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada and then New
York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years.
	   Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before
the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother,
exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing.
	   His wife claimed for two years that Liu's health was worsening.
But only last month did authorities grant a comprehensive exam.
Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's
mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said.
	   The timing of Liu's exile and Xu's trial was the most brazen in
a string of high-profile dissident releases calculated to influence
Western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounced
Liu's release as cynical and manipulative.
	   ``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with
no true commitment to international human rights standards,'' said
Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying
group that Liu Qing heads.
	   Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the West, Beijing
signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for bringing its
spotty legal system closer to international standards. The ruling
Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views among
academics.
	   Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open
atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 14 provinces
and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and register
the China Democracy Party.
	   In a sign of the opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents from
across China issued a petition Sunday calling for the immediate
release of Xu and two other leaders, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
	   To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities have violated
recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the rights of
criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to
trial with less than four days notice given to their families,
instead of the 10 required by law.
	   Qin and a third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were also
denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared off prospective
lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses in separate
trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced.
	   The Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He
Xintong, suspects it is merely a formality in what she expects to
be a show trial.
	   ``He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to
represent my husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the
lawyer and his aide.
	   Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to
attend the trial, and He said she has been given one pass, for
herself.
	   Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has
played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party members and
exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Sunday said
Iraqis have been victorious against ``enemies of God'' during four
nights of airstrikes by the United States and Britain.
	   In his first public comment since the strikes ended Saturday,
Saddam said in a brief speech on radio and television that the
Iraqi people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what your
leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,
which will be attested by your enemies,'' he said.
	   Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers also declared victory in the
airstrikes that pounded Iraq with the most severe firepower since
the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq did not retaliate except with anti-aircraft
guns.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated that at least 42 people were killed and 96 wounded.
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   But the rhetoric in Iraqi newspapers Sunday was as strident as
before the assault.
	   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in Al-Musawir
Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve but victory with God's
help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's Baath Party.
	   In his speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for
pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq.
	   ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said.
	   After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N.
weapons inspectors will be able to go back into Iraq to resume
their 7 1/2-year-old mission to search and destroy Iraq's illegal
weapons. The strikes were launched on the ground that Iraq was
obstructing the work of the weapons inspectors of the United
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   But Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared on
Saturday night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.''
	   ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate,'' the government
newspaper, Al-Jumhuriya, said in a red headline on the front page
Sunday.
	   In the streets of Baghdad, there was anger.
	   If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the
inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an
unemployed 32-year-old man.
	   If ``they have destroyed everything illegal (in the airstrikes)
the next step ought to be lifting of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the U.N. economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq is free of all nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain that 50
inspectors were waiting in Bahrain ``for further instructions from
New York.''
	   After the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the
blows the missiles have dealt to their lives.
	   Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he is
preparing to drive 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southern town
of Ali al-Gharbi. Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a
mass destruction weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old
niece.''
	   He said the girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile
strikes. He said he still hasn't received the details.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down
more than 100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called off the attack, it apparently caught the
British by surprise.
	   Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said four
Tornadoes were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions
when the stand-down ordered reached British forces based in Kuwait.
	   Collins said the fighters were recalled. Although that was a
``little bit of anti-climax'' there was a ``great sense of relief''
too, he told reporters in Kuwait.
	   In the final stages of the attack, one missile struck near the
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter)
hole into the earth.
	   The last attack came hours after Baghdad's residents broke their
fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks
Prophet Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God 1,400 years ago.
Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month.
	   A statement by the General Command of the Armed Forces said the
missiles targeted presidential sites, civil establishments,
government offices, colleges, students' dormitories, factories,
refineries and some military units. It did not elaborate.
	   The strikes also forced the withdrawal of international staffers
of the United Nations humanitarian program, which helps to relieve
the hardships of the sanctions.
	   No date has been set for the return of the staffers, Paulette
Austin, the officer in charge of the humanitarian program, said in
Amman, Jordan.
	   ``But the staff is very relieved ... by the halting of the
strikes. We want to get back and complete our mission,'' she said.

Hackl wins singles and takes lead in World Cup standings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WINTERBERG, Germany (AP) _ Three-time Olympic champion Georg
Hackl of Germany won his second singles race of the season and took
the lead in overall luge World Cup standings Sunday.
	   Hackl battled through a snowy first run in 55.439 seconds to
take a .18 of a second advantage over his perennial rival, Markus
Prock of Austria.
	   The 32- year-old German rode that margin with a second heat time
of 55.047 for a winning aggregate of one minute, 50.486 seconds.
The victory gave Hackl 309 points after four of seven events.
	   Prock, 34, winless to date, was second in 1:50.578 and is second
ranked with 290.
	   Adam Heidt of the United States posted his best career finish by
coming in third.
	   Armin Zoeggeler of Italy, 11th in the event, fell from first to
third with 289.
	   ``I like this track and I was lucky with the conditions,'' Hackl
said after his 20th career World Cup victory.
	   Heidt, of Northport, N.Y., overcame the weather problems to take
third in 1:50.785.
	   ``I hit some snow banks in the first run,'' said Heidt. ``I was
just trying to hold onto my position and not fall back as I have in
other races. But the second run was really good and I was hoping
this would be my day,'' Heidt said.
	   The 21-year-old appreciated his achievement after the final sled
had crossed the finish line and his name was announced at the
awards ceremony.
	   ``That is great company to be in,'' Heidt said. ``At the
ceremony, I felt like a baby. Those guys were racing when I was in
diapers.''
	   Heidt also became the third U.S. men singles luger to ever claim
a World Cup medal. Retired racers Duncan Kennedy and Wendel Suckow
were the others.
	   Clay Ives of Lake Placid, N.Y., now racing for the United States
after representing Canada in two Olympics, was 17th in 1:51.639.
	   Tony Benshoof of White Bear Lake, Minn. finished 18th in
1:51.702. Nick Sullivan, Oakdale, Minn. was 22nd in 1:52.007, and
Christian Niccum of Woodinville, Wash., a doubles specialist,
placed 27th in 1:52.660.
	   The World Cup tour resumes Jan. 16 in Oberhof, Germany after the
holiday break.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Voters chose a new city council
Sunday in an election considered key for Russia's democratic
politicians, whose popularity has been dented by the country's
roiling economic crisis.
	   The campaign in this northern port city has been marred by
violence and a political assassination. Already by mid-afternoon,
observers reported violations in the voting.
	   Just six of 50 seats were decided in the first round of
balloting two weeks ago, but liberals took a prominent lead, with
22 members of the Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the running in Sunday's second
round.
	   A total of 88 candidates were running for the remaining 44
seats. Turnout was 22.96 percent at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT).
	   Many saw the vote as a first battle in a long political season
leading to national parliamentary elections next year and
presidential elections in 2000.
	   At stake is control over millions of dollars worth of
privatization and budget revenues in Russia's second largest city,
a traditional stronghold of support for the country's democrats.
	   The election is also considered important because the authority
of the municipal legislature has been enhanced under a new city
charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city affairs than
similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Intrigue and violence blighted the run-up to Sunday's balloting.
One candidate was beaten with metal rods. A gunman shot out the
windows of a city council member's apartment with an assault rifle.
	   The most shocking violence came on Nov. 20, when unidentified
gunmen shot and killed the city's top democratic politician, Galina
Starovoitova. An aide was critically wounded in the attack.
	   Starovoitova's assassination galvanized St. Petersburg. Turnout
for the first round was twice as large as expected and democratic
candidates seem poised to win a majority in the city council as a
result.
	   ``The killing has elevated this to a higher level,'' said Leonid
Kesselman, a sociologist and political columnist. ``It's no longer
about local elections, but a symbol of what will begin in Russia
next year.''
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have also claimed the
lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a
prominent banker.
	   Observers reported several violations of election rules,
including a show on television alleging that Yabloko takes money
from the Central Intelligence Agency.
	   Also, city governor Vladimir Yakovlev appeared on local
television Sunday endorsing candidates, according to election
officials. There were also reports of vote-buying in exchange for
money or vodka.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance.
	   ``We are afraid at night, we don't go out, said Viktor Kazakov
as he cast his ballot. ``We hope the more honest candidates will
win.''
	   Some 5,000 policemen were deployed to ensure security at the
city's 1,483 polling stations, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Policemen with German shepherds patrolled city streets.
	   Preliminary results were expected early Monday.

mass destruction weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old
niece.''
	   The girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile strikes, he
said. He said he still hasn't received the details.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down
more than 100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called off the attack, it apparently caught the
British by surprise.
	   Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said four
Tornadoes were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions
when the stand-down order reached British forces based in Kuwait.
	   Collins said the fighters were recalled.
	   In the final stages of the attack, one missile struck near the
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter)
hole into the earth.
	   The last attack came hours after Baghdad's residents broke their
fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks the
prophet Mohammed's receipt of the Koran from God 1,400 years ago.
Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month.
	   A statement by Iraq's General Command of the Armed Forces said
the missiles targeted presidential sites, civil establishments,
government offices, colleges, students' dormitories, factories,
refineries and some military units. It did not elaborate.

Servants of Saudi prince say he beat them, held them captive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ten servants of a Saudi prince living in a
luxury hotel signed a note saying they were being held captive,
attached it to a clothespin and threw it out the window. Now that
note may land eight of them in jail.
	   The servants, who work for Saudi Prince Turki bin Abdel Aziz, a
brother of King Fahd, were arrested Sunday after the prince charged
they stole four diamond-studded watches, a police official said.
	   But the women, from the Philippines, say the prince's charges
were merely retaliation for complaints they filed Friday with
Egyptian authorities and the Filipino Embassy.
	   They claimed he locked them up for 11 months in a 30th-floor
suite of the Ramses Hilton, beat them whenever they spoke out and
withheld their pay, the police official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The cases are the latest in a series of controversies involving
the prince, who has lived in Egypt for 16 years since a falling-out
with the Saudi royal family.
	   In November, police dropped an investigation into whether Turki
was mistreating his Egyptian servants when they withdrew their
complaint, after receiving wages they said he owed them. They had
also claimed that he kept them locked in his suites.
	   The latest spat began Friday, when taxi driver Nagi Shukri,
parked outside the hotel, was struck by a clothespin.
	   Attached was a note that read: ``Save our souls.'' The note,
signed by 10 servants, said they were being held captive in the
quarters of Prince Turki's wife on the 30th floor.
	   Shukri turned the note over to the hotel management, which
contacted the police, who detained the eight women.
	   The women claim that the two remaining servants are still being
held captive in the hotel, the official said. It was not clear if
any charges had been filed against the prince.
	   Earlier this year, Turki was quoted as saying that the servants
usually sign an agreement not to leave the suite for six months.
	   Last year, police arrested one of the prince's American
bodyguards after he allegedly punched two men who objected to his
blocking a road with his car. Three others who worked for him have
been deported from Egypt over similar incidents.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Christer Olsson scored twice to lead world
champion Sweden to a 5-3 victory Sunday over Russia, capturing the
Baltika Cup, and the Czech Republic defeated Canada 6-3 in a
spirited match.
	   Ravil Gusmanov opened scoring for Russia in the fifth minute of
the first period but Swedish defender Olsson equalized five minutes
later on a power play as he changed direction of the puck when
teammate Jan Huukko fired from the blue line.
	   Russian Alexander Barkov put Russia ahead 2-1 in the 18th minute
while Kim Johnsson overplayed the Russian defense and found himself
one-on-one with Russian goalie Maxim Sokolov to make it 2-2 with
only 32 seconds left in the first period.
	   Thomas Johansson fired from outside the blue line to put Sweden
ahead 3-2 in the third minute of the second period. Just over a
minute later, Olsson scored his second goal on a pass from Marcus
Thuresson.
	   Right wing Samuel Pahlsson made it 5-2 in the third minute of
the last period and Alexei Kudashov scored Russian's third goal in
the fifteenth minute.
	   ``We are satisfied with the results. We tried out several new
players for the world championships,'' Swedish coach Sune Bergman
told reporters.
	   In the second match on Sunday, the Czech Republic prevailed over
Canada 6-3. While the results of the Baltika Cup tournament had
already been decided, the two teams put their whole hearts into the
game.
	   The first goal was scored on a power play in the 6th minute by
Martin Stepanek. A minute and a half later, Victor Ujcik made it
2-0 in favor of the Czechs.
	   Just one second before the end of the first period, Ryan Lindsay
scored the first goal for the Canadians. In the second period, Jan
Caloun scored for the Czechs on a power play in the 23rd minute,
but just 14 seconds later Canadian Justin Cardwell scored.
	   The Czechs came back strong, with Miroslav Khlinka again
stretching the margin in the 27th minute. Five minutes later, Deoff
Peters made a solo and put the puck into the net for the Czechs.
	   In the 33rd minute, Roman Meluzin scored again on a power play,
and Thomas Vlasak scored his only goal in the 56th minute.
	   The Canadian team made 43 shots on the goal against 36 by the
Czechs, but goalie Milan Hnilicka was at his best.
	   The tournament was the third in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first one in the Czech Republic three months ago. Finland
captured the Karjala Cup in November. The last tournament will be
played in Sweden in February 1999.
	   Sweden now leads the overall standings with 13 points. Finland
has 10, the Czech Republic eight, and Russia five.
	   The Swedes' streak started when they won the World Championships
in Switzerland in May. Russia snapped Sweden's 21-game unbeaten
streak in international hockey with a 4-1 victory in the Karjala
Cup tournament.

Britain protests attack against embassy in Damascus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Britain has protested to Syria over the
attack on its embassy by demonstrators angered by the U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, the British Embassy said Sunday.
	   Britain complained of the ``damage inflicted on the offices of
the British Council and the British Embassy and demanded adequate
protection and compensation,'' an embassy statement said.
	   The protest was delivered by British Ambassador Basil Eastwood
to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday, the
statement said.
	   More than 1,000 angry demonstrators, mostly students, attacked
the American and British embassies and their cultural institutes
Saturday, to protest U.S. and British missile strikes against
Baghdad.
	   The strikes were called off Saturday.
	   The statement said that al-Sharaa offered a ``full apology and
stressed that there will be suitable protection for all British
buildings and nationals.''
	   Separately, the Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over
the attacks and pledged to increase security for ``diplomatic
corps, consulates and international organizations,'' the official
Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   Scores of riot police were deployed around the U.S. and British
embassies in Damascus Sunday.

Interior ministry steps up security after extortionist threat
</HEADLINE>
against railway &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Security has been tightened for the
German railway, after an extortionist suspected of carrying out
three attacks on trains demanded 10 million marks (dlrs 6 million),
an interior ministry spokesman said Sunday.
	   Increased security includes up to 400 border police making
checks on especially endangered stretches of the railway, supported
by German Air Force overflights with high-performance cameras, the
spokesman who requested anonymity said.
	   While the federal police in Wiesbaden could not report any
progress in tracking the extortionist, the railway reported two new
attacks on trains that it said were probably not connected to the
demands.
	   A freight train in Berlin ran into 10 concrete flagstones that
have been placed on the tracks late Saturday. The train's snow
shield pushed the stones off the tracks safely and it continued its
journey undamaged, Several passenger trains were delayed about 25
minutes while security checked the tracks at Hohenschoenhausen, but
no other tampering was found, the railway said.
	   Early Saturday morning a local commuter train ran into six trees
that someone had sawed down toppling them onto the tracks. The
train was damaged but was able to continue on under its own power.
None of the five passengers on the train was hurt. Railway
officials said evidence on the attack did not fit that on the
extortionist.
	   In the most serious incident tied to the extortion attempt, a
cargo train carrying paper rolls derailed early Friday near Anklam,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Berlin. No one was hurt.
	   Teams with heavy equipment were still working to clear the track
of the 15 derailed cars Sunday, and it was not expected to be
reopened until Monday.
	   Earlier in the week, rail workers discovered bolts had been
loosened on the same line, and officials have said they believe the
tools to loosen them were stolen from the railway.
	   The railway said it had received four letters in the past week,
apparently from the same source, demanding money.

America's allies looking to Kofi Annan to pick up the pieces after
</HEADLINE>
Desert Fox &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Now that U.S.-British airstrikes against
Iraq are over, America's European partners are looking to U.N.
chief Kofi Annan to find a way to maintain arms controls against
Baghdad.
	   ``We trust that a political dialogue can be undertaken as soon
as possible, primarily with the involvement of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
said after U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair announced an end to the airstrikes.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating presidency of the 15-member
European Union. Austria's foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel,
said the focus should be on a ``long-term political solution'' to
ensure that Iraq complies with U.N. orders to destroy all
long-range missiles and mass destruction weapons.
	   Schuessel said such a political solution must ``bring to an end
the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people'' and restore
cooperation between Baghdad and the United Nations.
	   The challenge facing Annan, however, would be to find a formula
for maintaining arms controls against Iraq that would satisfy both
President Saddam Hussein's government and the United States and
Britain.
	   Washington and London have traditionally taken the strongest
positions within the U.N. Security Council in refusing to relax
sweeping economic sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify that
Baghdad has destroyed all its long-range missiles and weapons of
mass destruction.
	   That is the main condition before the U.N. Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed in 1990 after Saddam invaded Kuwait,
touching off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   On Saturday, Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, made
clear that his government will no longer work with inspectors from
the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   Claims by U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler that Iraq was not
cooperating fully with his teams led to the four days of
airstrikes.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said France, a permanent
Security Council member, would support a ``new organization, new
methods'' so that the United Nations could maintain ``effective
control on Iraqi weapons and their eventual development.''
	   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said French diplomats
were already working on proposals for ``a new form of cooperation
between the United Nations and Iraq to restore the role of the U.N.
Security Council.''
	   Vedrine gave no details, and it was unclear whether those
proposals would be acceptable to the United States.
	   In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said relations
between Iraq and the United Nations must be ``overhauled'' and
hinted that Italy wanted to see changes in the sanctions system.
	   Dini spoke of the need for ``introducing evolutionary elements''
in the ``sanctions regime.'' He did not elaborate.
	   But French and Russian diplomats at the United Nations have
suggested that Iraq should be offered incentives, such as phasing
out inspections of certain weapons systems such as missiles.
	   Any new formula must win the approval of each of the five
permanent Security Council members _ the United States, Russia,
China, France and Britain.
	   In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also called
Sunday for a new initiative to maintain arms control and to
``improve the conditions of the Iraqi people.''
	   German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said Russia should
also play a role in reviving ``a political dialogue (with Iraq) as
soon as possible.''

Bergkamp stars as Arsenal downs Leeds 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated after Scottish match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored one goal and set up two
more for French World Cup stars Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit
as defending titlist Arsenal downed Leeds 3-1 Sunday in the Premier
League.
	   The result meant that Arsenal moved up one place to sixth,
behind Leeds on goal difference and four points behind leader
Chelsea, who moved top on Saturday by downing Leicester 2-0.
	   Bergkamp's 28th minute strike had an element of good fortune.
There was a strong hint of offside when Petit floated a pass
forward to Nicolas Anelka whose header on put the Dutchman clear.
Bergkamp only had goalkeeper Nigel Martyn to beat but he mis-hit
the shot and the ball went off the side of his heel into the net.
	   There was nothing fortunate about Vieira's strike eight minutes
into the second half when he took Bergkamp's through ball and,
shrugged off a challenge and fired the ball home with his left
foot.
	   Leeds hit back in the 66th minute when Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink fired a low right footer between Arsenal's Austrian
goalkeeper, Alex Manninger, and the post from a layoff by
Australian forward Harry Kewell.
	   Four minutes from the end Bergkamp set up Petit with another
well-timed pass from deep which split the Leeds defense and the
French midfielder fired home first time with his right foot.
	   Arsenal substitute Gilles Grimandi, who had been on the field
for barely 15 minutes, was expelled by referee Paul Durkin for
head-butting Leeds Alan Smith when the two flared up in midfield.

Britain protests attack against embassy in Damascus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Britain has protested to Syria the attack
on its embassy by demonstrators angered by the U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, the British Embassy said Sunday.
	   Britain complained of the ``damage inflicted on the offices of
the British Council and the British Embassy and demanded adequate
protection and compensation,'' an embassy statement said.
	   The protest was delivered by British Ambassador Basil Eastwood
to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa late Saturday, the
statement said.
	   More than 1,000 angry demonstrators, mostly students, attacked
the American and British embassies and their cultural institutes
Saturday to protest missile strikes against Baghdad.
	   The strikes were called off Saturday.
	   The statement said that al-Sharaa offered a ``full apology and
stressed that there will be suitable protection for all British
buildings and nationals.''
	   Separately, the Foreign Ministry on Sunday expressed regret over
the attacks and pledged to increase security for ``diplomatic
corps, consulates and international organizations,'' the official
Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
	   Scores of riot police were deployed around the U.S. and British
embassies in Damascus Sunday.

Yeltsin: Use of force only complicated solution to Iraqi crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution, UPDATES with foreign minister's comments
in new grafs 6-8. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Sunday that the
U.S.-British airstrikes had only complicated any settlement of the
Iraqi crisis, and welcomed the end to the bombardment.
	   ``Reason has finally prevailed,'' he said in a statement
distributed by his press office. ``Now the international community
should draw serious conclusions from these tragic events.''
	   The United States and Britain halted airstrikes against Iraq on
Saturday after four days of attacks, saying their forces had
inflicted ``significant damage'' on Iraq's military.
	   ``It still remains to fully assess the negative political
consequences the bombardment led to, not to speak of the victims
among the civilian population and the significant damage to the
Iraqi economy, which was already bled dry by the sanctions,''
Yeltsin said.
	   ``However, now it is absolutely clear that the use of force only
complicated the solution of the Iraqi problem.''
	   In an interview with state television, Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said that the airstrikes had destroyed any hope for the
system of monitoring Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``In fact, the work of the Special Commission has been ended.
The system of monitoring that was organized over past few years in
Iraq has sustained serious blows,'' Ivanov said. The commission is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   ``All of this complicates the fulfillment of U.N. resolutions
even more _ the very resolutions in whose name the U.S.-British
actions were taken,'' Ivanov said.
	   The foreign minister accused the United States and Britain of
setting a dangerous new precedent.
	   ``It's not just about Iraq,'' he said. ``If today we don't do
everything we can today to prevent such actions, tomorrow they may
become the rule in international conduct.''
	   Yeltsin said that Russia insisted on the creation of a
multipolar system in the world and the strengthening of the United
Nations' role.
	   ``This is the universal organization that is charged with
guaranteeing collective responses to the new, dangerous challenges
confronted by the family of nations. Nobody has the right to
violate the U.N. charter, which has been the reliable guarantor of
peace and stability for more than half a century,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin called on Iraq to fulfill the U.N. resolutions that
would allow the lifting of sanctions. However, he said that the
world must not neglect Iraq's humanitarian needs, saying that
``now, like never before,'' the Iraqis needed massive food and
medical aid.
	   The Iraq crisis has underlined Moscow's loss of global influence
and the unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials
about close post-Soviet ties with the West. Part of Yeltsin's anger
stemmed from his not being informed in advance about the
airstrikes.

Arson attack at Communist official's office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A homemade bomb exploded outside legal
office of a Communist city counselor Sunday, causing damage but no
injury, police said.
	   The bomb, made with small camping gas canisters, damaged the
third-floor office in central Athens held by Leon Avdis, a veteran
member of the Greek Communist Party.
	   A teenage girl, attending class at a private night school in the
same building, was hospitalized in shock.
	   An anarchist group calling itself the Children of November
claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   In a telephone call to the private Sky radio, the group blamed
the Communist Party for helping police arrest more than 100 people
during riots last month. The riots broke out at a rally on Nov. 17
to commemorate a student uprising in 1973, which paved the way for
the collapse of the seven-year military junta.
	   There have been more than 200 arson attacks carried out this
year in Athens by obscure anarchist groups.
	   Avdis shares the office with three other lawyers, including
Nikos Constandopoulos, leader of the small Coalition of the Left
and Progress party.

Warsaw authorities renovate synagogue entrance damaged in 1997

arson attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw authorities have renovated the main
entrance to the city's only operating synagogue, damaged in a 1997
arsonist attack, a Jewish community official said Sunday.
	   In a brief ceremony late Saturday, Warsaw Mayor Marcin Swiecicki
joined about 150 members of the Jewish community to inaugurate the
renovated entrance to the Nozyk family synagogue, according to
Robert Pasieczny, a Jewish leader in Warsaw.
	   Pasieczny said the city paid about 120,000 zlotys (dlrs 34,000)
for the renovation.
	   In the Feb. 26, 1997 attack, the simply-carved heavy wooden door
at the main entrance and another set of wooden doors were
completely burned, while plaster fell off the blackened vestibule
ceiling.
	   So far, police have failed to trace the perpetrators.
	   Founded in 1902, the synagogue stands in the former Jewish
district of Warsaw, next to the state-run Jewish Theater.
	   During the war, the Nazis used it as a stable and then destroyed
it. Communist authorities rebuilt it in 1983 and it has been used
since.
	   Some 10,000 Jews remain in Poland from the pre-World War II
community of 3.5 million. Most died in Nazi death camps and most
who survived the Holocaust left Poland in the 1950s and 1960s
because of communist-sponsored anti-Semitic purges.

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with rebel funerals; CHANGES number buried in

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians fired on a Serb
police patrol Sunday in central Kosovo, Serb sources said, adding
to the upsurge in violence threatening the province's fragile
cease-fire.
	   The Serb Media Center said ethnic Albanian separatists attacked
along the province's main east-west road about 40 kilometers (25
miles) west of Pristina, the provincial capital. Police fired back,
wounding two of the attackers. Those and four others were captured,
the media center said.
	   Tensions already were running high in the province as the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army buried 33 guerrillas killed by Yugoslav
border guards, and hundreds of Serbs protested the killing of a
local official.
	   Meanwhile, an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
denounced the United States for allegedly favoring separatist
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia that has an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population.
	   About 5,000 mourners for the 33 KLA members gathered in
rebel-held territory 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Pristina for
the funeral.
	   ``There is no better nor more honorable way to die than to die
for one's fatherland,'' said a KLA commander, Rame Buja, standing
beside the coffins on a ridge renamed ``Heroes' Grave.''.
	   The dead were among 36 ethnic Albanians killed in the border
clash last week. The bodies of all but three were handed over to
the rebels after mediation by the International Committee of the
Red Cross.
	   At the same time, about 300 Serbs angry over the recent death of
their deputy mayor gathered in sub-freezing temperatures in the
town of Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, to demand state
protection.
	   The latest violence has dimmed hopes that diplomacy can head off
a return to full-scale war in Kosovo. More than 1,000 people have
been killed and up to 300,000 have been forced from their homes
since fighting escalated in late February.
	   A group of international officials tried Saturday to bring the
KLA and the followers of Ibrahim Rugova, a moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, to talks with Serbian officials.
	   Rugova has said he will accept broad autonomy within Serbia,
while the KLA is determined to fight for independence.
	   The United States has taken the lead in trying to arrange talks
between the two sides about the future of the province.
	   On Sunday, Milosevic aide Zivorad Igic was quoted by the
government's Tanjug news agency as criticizing Washington's alleged
``supportive'' stand toward the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended full-scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Igic also blamed Albania for ``becoming the main base for
terrorists and their main supplier of arms.''

Mallorca stays leader for new year, Real Madrid slumps to Oviedo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Modest Mallorca held onto the league
leadership for a fifth consecutive week despite only drawing 1-1
against lowly Racing de Santander in an end-of-year round that saw
mighty Real Madrid slump 1-0 against Oviedo.
	   Mallorca took the lead in the 55th minute with a goal by Dani
Garcia Lara but Racing's Victor Sanchez drew his team level in the
71st. Mallorca, with a record of 8-5-2, now has 29 points, four
more than its closest rivals Celta and Valencia who both suffered
defeats. Racing stays in the lower rungs with 18 points.
	   Oviedo which pulled off the surprise of the day by downing
Madrid 1-0 with goal by Panama's Julio Cesar Dely Valdez in the
75th minute.
	   Real now has 22 points and lies No. 8 while Oviedo moves up to
No. 5 with 24.
	   Other results Sunday were: Villarreal 0, Athletic Bilbao 1;
Atletico Madrid 0, Zaragoza 0; Real Sociedad 2, Celta 0; Espanyol
2, Valencia 1 and Alaves 1, Salamanca 0.
	   Barcelona was to play Valladolid later Sunday with rumors
rampant that if the powerhouse club loses its fifth consecutive
game it could be the end of the road for Dutch coach Louis Van
Gaal. Tenerife faced Extremadura in the day's other late game.
	   Deportivo de La Coruna was held to a 2-2 draw by a resurgent
Betis in the league's only game Saturday.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 2, Celta 0  &QC; 
	   Celta stayed No. 2 with 25 points, four less than Mallorca
despite losing 2-0 against Sociedad. Yugoslavia's Darko Kovacevic
gave Real the lead in the 37th minute. The Balkan striker made it
2-0 five minutes before the whistle.
 &UR; Espanyol 2, Valencia 1 &QC; 
	   Valencia remained No. 3 behind Celta on goal difference after
losing 2-1 to lowly Espanyol. Espanyol scored first with a goal by
Cabdevila in the 35th minute but Valencia's Francisco Javier
Farinos stole back with an equalizer seven minutes later. Defender
Cristobal Parralo gave the homeside the winning edge in the 76th
minute.
 &UR; Villarreal 0, Athletic Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   League leading scorer Ismael Urzaiz knocked in his ninth of the
season to give Bilbao the lead in the 54th minute. Bilbao now
shares 23 points with Atletico de Madrid, six behind the leader.
Villarreal stays with 19.

Mexican ambassador returns to Cuba after Fidel apologizes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has returned its ambassador to Cuba,
declaring an end to a controversy over Cuban President Fidel
Castro's seeming criticism of Mexican policies.
	   The spat ``is totally overcome for the government of Mexico,''
Ambassador Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on return to Havana on
Saturday, according to the Mexican government's Notimex news
agency.
	   Mexico withdrew Joaquin Coldwell on Dec. 4, two days after
Castro seemed to criticize Mexico's free trade pact with the United
States and suggested that Mexican youth knew more about Mickey
Mouse than about their national heroes.
	   It was an unprecedented, if relatively minor, diplomatic row
between Cuba and one of its best friends. Mexico is the only Latin
American nation that never broke ties with Cuba under U.S. pressure
in the 1960s.
	   On Friday, Castro sent Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to
Mexico City with a public letter expressing love for Mexico and
apologizing if his comments had given offense.
	   Cuban independence hero Jose Marti ``taught us to love Mexico,
the country I love and admire more than any other,'' Castro said in
the letter.
	   If ``one single Mexican feels offended by my words, I have no
objection at all to apologizing,'' he said.
	   Castro said he did not mean to offend Mexico and had made his
comments informally and in jest to an intimate audience of friends.
	   Castro lauded Cuban-Mexican relations dating back to the Spanish
conquest of the Americas and including his own exile in Mexico,
from which he launched his revolutionary return to Cuba.
	   ``This message erases any doubt that their might have been about
the feelings of the President of Cuba toward Mexico,'' Joaquin
Coldwell said in Havana.

Servants of Saudi prince say he beat them, held them captive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ten servants of a Saudi prince living in a
luxury hotel signed a note saying they were being held captive,
attached it to a clothespin and threw it out the window. Now that
note may land eight of them in jail.
	   The servants, who work for Saudi Prince Turki bin Abdel Aziz, a
brother of King Fahd, were arrested Sunday after the prince charged
they stole four diamond-studded watches, a police official said.
	   But the women, from the Philippines, say the prince's charges
were merely retaliation for complaints they filed Friday with
Egyptian authorities and the Filipino Embassy.
	   They claimed he locked them up for 11 months in a 30th-floor
suite of the Ramses Hilton, beat them whenever they spoke out and
withheld their pay, the police official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The cases are the latest in a series of controversies involving
the prince, who has lived in Egypt for 16 years since a falling-out
with the Saudi royal family.
	   In November, police dropped an investigation into whether Turki
was mistreating his Egyptian servants when they withdrew their
complaint, after receiving wages they said he owed them. They had
also claimed that he kept them locked in his suites.
	   The latest spat began Friday when taxi driver Nagi Shukri,
parked outside the hotel, was struck by a clothespin.
	   Attached was a note that read: ``Save our souls.'' The note,
signed by 10 servants, said they were being held captive in the
quarters of Prince Turki's wife on the 30th floor.
	   Shukri turned the note over to the hotel management, which
contacted the police, who detained the eight women.
	   The women claim that the two remaining servants are still being
held captive in the hotel, the official said. It was not clear if
any charges had been filed against the prince.
	   Earlier this year, Turki was quoted as saying that the servants
usually sign an agreement not to leave the suite for six months.
	   Last year, police arrested one of the prince's American
bodyguards after he allegedly punched two men who objected to his
blocking a road with his car. Three others who worked for him have
been deported from Egypt over similar incidents.

Policeman wounded in clash with protesters of Iraq attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Protesters threw stones and
scuffled with police Sunday in a demonstration against the U.S.-led
airstrikes against Iraq, and one officer was injured in the clash.
	   An estimated 4,000 people massed outside the U.S. Consulate on
Amsterdam's bustling Museumplein to protest the military action,
which ended Saturday.
	   Police arrested four protesters, but one officer was
hospitalized after suffering injuries in the standoff with several
dozen stone-throwing demonstrators, Dutch television reported. His
condition was not immediately known.
	   The consulate was not damaged, probably because window shutters
had been drawn over the weekend in anticipation of such unrest.
	   On Friday, police clashed with Iraqi protesters outside the U.S.
Embassy in The Hague, using batons to break up a demonstration
against the American airstrikes against targets in Baghdad. At
least two demonstrators were injured.

Bremen beats Berlin as Bundesliga breaks off for winter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Rade Bogdanovic scored late in the
first half-time and early in the second to secure Werder Bremen's
2-1 victory Sunday over Hertha Berlin in the last Bundesliga game
before the winter break.
	   After missing three opportunities earlier in the match,
Bogdanovic found the target in the final minute of the first
half-time.
	   Michael Preetz brought his season total to 11 in the 47th,
heading in a cross to level the score for Hertha.
	   As Bremen took the ball from the center, Andreas Herzog found
Bogdanovic in Hertha's penalty area and the Yugoslav struck again,
restoring Bremen's lead after 45 seconds.
	   Bogdanovic now has seven goals for Bremen, which jumped from
12th to 9th.
	   Berlin had its run of four consecutive wins snapped by a
determined Bremen team, which gave 28,000 fans its best performance
of the season.

Nobel Prize winning biologist Sir Alan Hodgkin dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nobel prize winning biologist Sir Alan Hodgkin has
died aged 84, his family said Sunday.
	   Hodgkin's daughter Rachel said her father died Sunday at his
Cambridge, eastern England home, after a long illness. She did not
give a cause of death.
	   Hodgkin won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1963 with fellow
scientists Sir Andrew Huxley and Sir John Eccles after discovering
the complex system of how nerve cells transmit electrical impulses
from the skin to the brain and back again.
	   ``The problem was one that has haunted physiology for 100
years,'' the Nobel committee said at the time of the award.
	   Hodgkin was born on Feb. 5 1914, and educated at Cambridge
University. He halted his research into the nervous system at the
onset of World War II, when he worked with other scientists to
develop Britain's radar program.
	   After the fall of Nazi Germany, Hodgkin investigated the ionic
theory of how nerve cells send messages to the brain via an
``electric cable'' in the spinal cord. They conducted a series of
ingenious and complex experiments on the nerve fibers of squids and
frogs to discover how the human brain responded to nerve messages.
	   Hodgkin's American father-in-law, Frederick Rous, won the same
Nobel award three years later for discovering that some forms of
leukemia are caused by a virus.
	   Hodgkin was knighted in 1972 and awarded the prestigious Order
of Merit in 1973. He is survived by his wife, Marion, and four
children. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Rome mayor demands vandal clean up pride-and-joy piazza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rome's mayor is demanding that an out-of-town youth
who carved initials in a newly restored statue of a lion in the
city's pride-and-joy piazza spend three days at cleanup.
	   On Saturday, less than two weeks after Mayor Francesco Rutelli
declared Piazza del Popolo, the city's largest square, a piazza of
the pedestrians by banning cars, a 17-year-old student was caught
by security guards vandalizing a stone fountain in the shape of a
lion.
	   The youth, who had come to Rome with friends to join in a
protest against public funds for private schools, told police he
was using a key to carve his girlfriend's initials, Rome daily Il
Messaggero reported Sunday.
	   Vehicles were banned from the square after a dlrs 2.1 million
restoration. When the spruced-up square was inaugurated on Dec. 8,
Rutelli warned graffiti artists they would be prosecuted.
	   In the case of the key-wielding student, Rutelli suggested that
he come back to Rome to spend three days in cleaning up the square,
whose have served as the northern entry into the city for pilgrims
and other travelers over the centuries.
	   It will be up to a juvenile court magistrate to decide on the
punishment.

Italy approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Chamber of Deputies on Sunday gave final
approval to the 1999 budget.
	   The Senate, the Italian Parliament's upper legislative chamber,
had given its final nod on Saturday.
	   Passage of the budget could speed up the Italian central bank's
final discount rate cut, from 3.5 percent to 3.0 percent, expected
by the end of the month, to get the country in line with the other
10 nations in European Monetary Union, which starts on Jan. 1.
	   Passage also came in time to give Italians back in their final
year paycheck 60 percent of the ``eurotax,'' a special tax citizens
paid to help Italy meet criteria earlier this year to make the
cutoff for charter membership in the single currency union.
	   The budget includes nearly dlrs 9 billion worth of new revenues
or spending cuts, continuing several straight years of
budget-trimming.

Top UN official for refugees arrives in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.N. refugee official said
Sunday that aid agencies and humanitarian workers are ``racing
against time'' to build on the current truce in the Serbian
province and prevent a renewed tragedy.
	   ``The main task now is to get more people back to their homes,
help them rebuild and see to it that they survive winter,'' said
Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, upon
arriving in Kosovo for a 24-hour visit.
	   Ogata said that since her visit here in September, some 75,000
Kosovo people, most affected by the fighting between ethnic
Albanian separatists and Serbian government forces, have gone back
to their homes but that many more are yet to be enabled to do so.
	   The worst fighting ended in October with U.S. pressure on
President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his crackdown on the rebels
and allow 2,000 international peace verifiers into the province.
	   ``I hope that my visit will further strengthen cooperation
between relief agencies and the (peace) verifiers so that
conditions will be created that will allow people to feel more
secure,'' Ogata said.
	   After meeting with officials from both sides in the conflict,
Ogata is to tour the province Monday and talk to the refugees.
Later in Belgrade, she is to talk to Milosevic.

Malone likes offer by NBA owners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Karl Malone sees a settlement
coming in the U.S. National Basketball Association lockout. He says
the NBA owners have made a ``decent'' contract proposal that needs
only to be tweaked before the season can begin.
	   His union director is not so sure.
	   ``To me, I feel the deal is almost done,'' Malone said before
playing in a charity exhibition game won by his team 125-119 behind
the fourth-quarter shooting of Tim Hardaway.
	   ``Without a doubt, that deal (the owners' offer) is fair. It
just needs some minor changes,'' the Utah Jazz star said. ``I think
the deal is decent.''
	   In fact, Malone thought the nine-page letter that arrived by
overnight mail last Thursday and outlined the owners' concessions
was actually sent to him by the union. It wasn't until he got to
the last page and saw commissioner David Stern's name that he
realized the letter was from the league.
	   Union director Billy Hunter attended the game and did a
double-take when informed of Malone's comments. ``Karl said that?''
Hunter said.
	   Hunter said no new negotiations are scheduled between him and
Stern.
	   Sunday marked the eighth day since the last round of bargaining,
and players continue to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries as
the lockout, essentially a strike by the owners, drags on. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The two sides are trying to divvy up about dlrs 2 billion in
annual revenues.
	   If a deal isn't reached soon, the entire season will be
scrapped. Stern has steadfastly refused to say when it will be too
late to save the season.
	   Malone thinks a resolution could come by Saturday.
	   ``I don't care if it's 40 or 50 games. You all can call it a
shortened season, but I still want a championship. And to me, a
championship is a championship,'' Malone said.

IOC president wants new selection system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The president of the International Olympic
Committee expects his organization to find a new way of selecting
Olympic cities as a result of the widening bribery scandal.
	   ``After this scandal, I believe that the IOC as a whole must
accept that the system needs to change and that we can't continue
like this,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch said Sunday in the Le Matin
newspaper.
	   ``We are not happy with the way of selecting organizing cities
for the games.''
	   The IOC has been shaken by accusations of rampant corruption and
vote-buying masterminded by agents. A top IOC member, Switzerland's
Marc Holder, has estimated that 5 to 7 percent of the 115 members
are open to bribery.
	   Samaranch said the Olympics should follow the example of other
major sports bodies, which leave significant decisions to their
executive committees rather than the full membership.
	   He told Le Matin he had proposed this several times.
	   ``But it's not easy to ask members to agree to cut off their own
heads,'' he said.
	   But given the circumstances, he said it was possible the IOC
members would give the 11-member executive committee special
powers.
	   Samaranch said the investigation into actions by Salt Lake City,
the host for the 2002 Winter Games, should be completed by Jan. 23
and would be discussed at a meeting that day.
	   Salt Lake organizers admit having a $400,000 scholarship fund
for IOC members' families but have said this was a humanitarian
gesture rather than bribery.
	   There is growing evidence of other favors for IOC members,
including free medical care and gifts in excess of the IOC imposed
limit.
	   Many of the accusations focus on IOC members from Africa,
particularly those from the Congo, Libya and Swaziland.
	   Samaranch told the newspaper the revelations about Salt Lake
City were only as a ``semi-surprise'' to him.
	   Even before that, senior Olympic officials had doubts that some
members' behavior was at the ``limit.''
	   ``We are going to react in a strong way and clean up,''
Samaranch said.
	   He said IOC members found guilty of corruption will be kicked
out of the organization.
	   Under Samaranch the Olympics have become one of the world's
biggest money-spinning events. For example, television rights for
the Moscow Olympics in 1980 were $100 million. For the Athens Games
in 2004 they will be $1.4 billion.
	   As the games have grown, so has the scope for abuse.
	   Samaranch indicated that the new selection procedure might be in
place by next summer, when the choice is made for the host of the
2006 Winter Olympics.
	   If successful, the same system would be used for the 2008 Games,
he said.
	   The Swiss city of Sion, beaten by Salt Lake City for 2002, is
widely considered the front-runner for the 2006 Games.
	   Hodler, a former head of the International Ski Federation, is on
the Sion organizing committee. But there is growing concern that by
provoking the IOC's biggest scandal, Hodler may prompt a backlash
against the Swiss bid.
	   In an interview with the SonntagsZeitung newspaper, Swiss Sports
Minister Adolf Ogi resisted demands for Hodler to distance himself
from the Sion bid.
	   ``Out of the question,'' Ogi said.
	   Ogi also said the selection procedure needs changing, with the
executive committee or an evaluation committee making the decision
rather than the entire membership.

Kosovo Albanians bury dead guerrillas, vow to fight on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POLAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 5,000 ethnic Albanians, many of
them weeping, gathered on a fog-shrouded hilltop Sunday to bury
their comrades and proclaim their resolve to fight on for an
independent Kosovo.
	   The mass funeral for 33 rebels, killed last week in a clash with
Yugoslav border guards, was aimed at portraying the Kosovo
Liberation Army as formidable force despite efforts by President
Slobodan Milosevic to crush them.
	   A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black uniforms, fired
volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a final salute as
the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the frozen ground on a
ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``There is no better nor more honorable way to die than to die
for one's fatherland,'' a top KLA commander, Rame Buja, said as he
stood behind the coffins.
	   An honor guard of four KLA fighters stood at attention beside
each of the coffins.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''
	   Uniformed KLA fighters comforted families of the dead, whose
bodies were handed over by Serb authorities to the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Many of the women wept during the military rites, and several of
them fainted.

Luzhkov: Illegally privatized property should be returned to state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of the favorites to
succeed President Boris Yeltsin, called on Sunday for property that
had been privatized illegally to be returned to the state.
	   In an interview on Russian state television, Luzhkov also said
that businesses that had been privatized but were working
inefficiently should be declared bankrupt and turned over to new
owners, or given to the state.
	   Privatization of state-owned property has been one of the most
controversial of the free-market reforms implemented in Russia over
the last decade. A June report by a private think-tank, the Council
for Foreign and Defense Policies, estimated that 30 percent of
deals in the massive sell-out of state assets broke the law.
	   Though he has not announced his candidacy, Luzkhov is one of the
leading contenders to replace Yeltsin in the 2000 elections. He
presided Saturday over the founding congress of a new political
movement, Fatherland.
	   Luzhkov has said he favors a state system based on social
democracy, combining free-market policies with generous social
support. He has lambasted what he considers wrong-headed reforms in
Russia, which he said Saturday had been turning the country into a
``dump-site.''
	   Luzhkov is popular in Moscow, and enjoys consistently strong
ratings in opinion polls. However, it is unclear how strong a
popular following he has in Russia's outlying regions.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Voters chose a new city council
Sunday in an election considered key for Russia's democratic
politicians, whose popularity has been dented by the country's
roiling economic crisis.
	   The campaign in this northern port city has been marred by
violence and a political assassination. Already by mid-afternoon,
observers reported violations in the voting.
	   Just six of 50 seats were decided in the first round of
balloting two weeks ago, but liberals took a prominent lead, with
22 members of the Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the running in Sunday's second
round.
	   A total of 88 candidates were running for the remaining 44
seats. Turnout was 30.04 percent at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT), an hour
before the polls closed.

Curfew tightens, military patrols intensify in Freetown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Intervention troops defending
Sierra Leone's government on Sunday tightened a night curfew and
patrolled beaches and suburbs of the capital amid fears of a new
rebel advance.
	   Without explaining, the multi-national West African force known
as ECOMOG announced on state radio that all residents in Freetown
would be required to be behind closed doors by 10 p.m. until 6:30
a.m. instead of the previous midnight to 6:00 a.m. curfew.
	   ECOMOG and civilian militia patrols and checkpoints were stepped
up in and around Freetown, while rumors spread among Freetown
residents of rebel advances on several major towns in Sierra
Leone's interior.
	   Neither government nor ECOMOG officials were available for
comment.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government has announced a
clampdown on unapproved press reports about Sierra Leone's civil
war and earlier this month arrested a BBC reporter over a news
report on fighting between government forces and rebels in the Port
Loko district in the northern region.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its rebel allies since his
reinstatement following 10 months of exile during a period of junta
rule that ended early this year.
	   Although ECOMOG and the government-backed Kamajor militia group
have claimed recent successes against the rebel alliance, fighting
continues and thousands of people have been killed, raped and
maimed by the rebels in a sweeping revenge campaign against the
government.
	   Sierra Leone has recently accused neighboring Liberia of giving
support to the rebels, who live in remote jungle bases and have
isolated themselves from contact with the outside world.

Bergkamp stars as Arsenal downs Leeds 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with English division one, Scottish matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dennis Bergkamp scored one goal and set up two
more for French World Cup stars Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit
as defending titlist Arsenal downed Leeds 3-1 Sunday in the Premier
League.
	   The result meant that Arsenal moved up one place to sixth,
behind Leeds on goal difference and four points behind leader
Chelsea, who moved top on Saturday by downing Leicester 2-0.
	   Bergkamp's 28th minute strike had an element of good fortune.
There was a strong hint of offside when Petit floated a pass
forward to Nicolas Anelka whose header on put the Dutchman clear.
Bergkamp only had goalkeeper Nigel Martyn to beat but he mis-hit
the shot and the ball went off the side of his heel into the net.
	   There was nothing fortunate about Vieira's strike eight minutes
into the second half when he took Bergkamp's through ball and,
shrugged off a challenge and fired the ball home with his left
foot.
	   Leeds hit back in the 66th minute when Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink fired a low right footer between Arsenal's Austrian
goalkeeper, Alex Manninger, and the post from a layoff by
Australian forward Harry Kewell.
	   Four minutes from the end Bergkamp set up Petit with another
well-timed pass from deep which split the Leeds defense and the
French midfielder fired home first time with his right foot.
	   Arsenal substitute Gilles Grimandi, who had been on the field
for barely 15 minutes, was expelled by referee Paul Durkin for
head-butting Leeds Alan Smith when the two flared up in midfield.
	   Ipswich cut Sunderland's lead in division one to eight points
after Richard Naylor's last minute winner at Bramall Lane gave
George Burley's team a 2-1 win over Sheffield United. Sunderland
tied 0-0 at Birmingham on Saturday.
	   And Kilmarnock scored a 2-0 victory over struggling Dundee
United to trim Rangers advantage in the Scottish Premier League to
three points.
	   Rangers scored a 3-2 win at Hearts on Saturday.

Curfew tightens, military patrols intensify in Freetown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to ADD that ECOMOG is empowered by the government to
carry out national defense duties. Minor edits. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Intervention troops defending
Sierra Leone's government on Sunday tightened a night curfew and
patrolled beaches and suburbs of the capital amid fears of a new
rebel advance.
	   Without explaining, the multi-national West African force known
as ECOMOG announced on state radio that all residents in Freetown
would be required to be behind closed doors from 10 p.m. until 6:30
a.m. instead of the previous midnight to 6:00 a.m. curfew.
	   ECOMOG and civilian militia patrols and checkpoints were stepped
up in and around Freetown, while rumors spread among Freetown
residents of rebel advances on several major towns in Sierra
Leone's interior.
	   Neither government nor ECOMOG officials were available for
comment. Together with a civilian militia, ECOMOG is empowered by
the government to carry out national defense duties since the West
African country's rebellious military was dissolved earlier this
year.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government has announced a
clampdown on unapproved press reports about Sierra Leone's civil
war and earlier this month arrested a BBC reporter over a news
report on fighting between government forces and rebels in the Port
Loko district in the northern region.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its rebel allies since his
reinstatement following 10 months of exile during a period of junta
rule that ended in February.
	   Although ECOMOG and the government-backed Kamajor militia group
have claimed recent successes against the rebel alliance, fighting
continues and thousands of people have been killed, raped and
maimed by the rebels in a sweeping revenge campaign against the
government.
	   Sierra Leone has recently accused neighboring Liberia of giving
support to the rebels, who live in remote jungle bases and have
isolated themselves from contact with the outside world.

Mallorca stays leader for new year, Real Madrid slumps to Oviedo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS following Barcelona win &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mallorca retained the league leadership for
a fifth consecutive week on drawing 1-1 against Racing de Santander
in an end-of-year round that gave Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal some
breathing space as troubled FC Barcelona scraped a 1-0 win over
Valladolid.
	   Elsewhere, Oviedo pulled of a surprise 1-0 victory over reigning
European Champion Real Madrid exacerbating problems for that side's
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.
	   Argentine Hector Cuper's Mallorca took the lead in the 55th
minute with a goal by Dani Garcia Lara but Racing's Victor Sanchez
drew his team level in the 71st.
	   Mallorca, with a record of 8-5-2, now has 29 points, four more
than its closest rivals, Celta and Valencia, who both suffered
defeats. Racing stays in the lower rungs with 18 points.
	   With rumors rampant that another Barcleona defeat could have led
to the sacking of Louis Van Gaal, few were surprised when in
totally uncharacteristic fashion the Dutch coach lept into the air
with delight as 18-year-old Xavi Hernandez put the side ahead in
the 15th minute.
	   Valladolid pounded away in search of goals but a mediocre
Barcelona managed to maintain the lead and ended its streak of four
consecutive defeats. The side now has 22 points and lies No. 9
behind eternal rival Real Madrid on goal difference.
	   Up north, Oviedo downed Madrid with a goal by Panama's Julio
Cesar Dely Valdez in the 75th minute. Real now has 22 points and
lies No. 8 while Oviedo moves up to No. 5 with 24.
	   Other results Sunday were: Villarreal 0, Athletic Bilbao 1;
Atletico Madrid 0, Zaragoza 0; Real Sociedad 2, Celta 0; Espanyol
2, Valencia 1; Alaves 1, Salamanca 0 and Tenerife 1, Extremadura 1.
	   Deportivo de La Coruna was held to a 2-2 draw by a resurgent
Betis in the league's only game Saturday.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 2, Celta 0  &QC; 
	   Celta stayed No. 2 with 25 points, four less than Mallorca
despite losing 2-0 against Sociedad. Yugoslavia's Darko Kovacevic
gave Real the lead in the 37th minute. The Balkan striker made it
2-0 five minutes before the whistle.
 &UR; Espanyol 2, Valencia 1 &QC; 
	   Valencia remained No. 3 behind Celta on goal difference after
losing 2-1 to lowly Espanyol. Espanyol scored first with a goal by
Cabdevila in the 35th minute but Valencia's Francisco Javier
Farinos stole back with an equalizer seven minutes later. Defender
Cristobal Parralo gave the homeside the winning edge in the 76th
minute.
 &UR; Villarreal 0, Athletic Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   League leading scorer Ismael Urzaiz knocked in his ninth of the
season to give Bilbao the lead in the 54th minute. Bilbao now
shares 23 points with Atletico de Madrid, six behind the leader.
Villarreal stays with 19.

Mexican ambassador returns to Cuba after Castro apologizes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has sent its ambassador back to Cuba,
declaring an end to a spat over comments by Fidel Castro thought to
criticize Mexican policies.
	   Ambassador Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on his return to Havana
on Saturday that the diplomatic row was completely over, the
official Notimex news agency reported.
	   Mexico withdrew Joaquin Coldwell on Dec. 4 after Castro,
speaking two days earlier at a meeting of Latin American leaders,
seemed to criticize Mexico's free-trade pact with the United
States, and suggested that Mexican youth knew more about Mickey
Mouse than about their national heroes.
	   It was an unprecedented, if relatively minor dispute between the
two close nations. Mexico is the only Latin American nation that
never broke ties with Cuba under U.S. pressure in the 1960s.
	   On Friday, Castro sent Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to
Mexico City with a public letter expressing his affection for the
country.
	   Castro said in the letter that Cuban independence hero Jose
Marti ``taught us to love Mexico, the country I love and admire
more than any other.''
	   Castro wrote that if ``one single Mexican feels offended by my
words, I have no objection at all to apologizing.''
	   But he insisted that ``at no moment did the idea or plan to
offend or injure Mexico pass through my mind.''
	   Castro said his comments were taken out of context due to ``bad
information, bad interpretation or bad intention.''
	   He said he was speaking informally and in jest to an intimate
audience of friends when he suggested that in joining the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development _ the world's
club of industrialized nations _ the Mexicans might ``leave us in
the town of misery and move into an aristocratic neighborhood.''
	   Castro defended his criticism of the U.S. ``cultural invasion''
of Latin America, which he called ``the nuclear weapon of the 21st
century for dominion of the world.''

Egypt calls for review of weapons inspection committee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa called
Sunday for a reevaluation of the role of the U.N. committee
responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Moussa told reporters that the findings of the United Nations
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, over the past 7 1/2 years should be
checked, ``for all to know the truth.''
	   ``Is it possible that the international community has exerted
all this time, money and effort without reaching anything that
would allow the closing of a single file concerning the Iraqi
weapons?'' Moussa said.
	   It was a report by UNSCOM chief Richard Butler, accusing Iraq of
obstructing weapons inspector, that triggered four nights of
punishing U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The assault ended
Saturday.
	   Moussa urged the United Nations to sack Butler, accusing him of
unfair assessment and unnecessarily escalating tensions.
	   Butler's fate may be in the hands of the Security Council ``but
we will comment on how we see the way he works,'' Moussa said.
	   The United States and Britain say they launched the strikes to
diminish Iraq's capacity to manufacture weapons of mass destruction
and its ability to threaten its neighbors.

Hotel evacuated after bomb hoax

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with demonstration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Guests at the Sheraton hotel in
downtown Brussels were evacuated briefly after a anonymous caller
warned a bomb had been placed there in retaliation for the air
attacks on Iraq, Belgian television reported Sunday.
	   Guests were taken to a nearby hotel after the call just before
midnight Saturday. They were allowed to return after a police
search revealed nothing suspicious and a second anonymous call
admitted the bomb threat was a hoax, the RTL-TVI network reported.
	   An employee at the hotel contacted Sunday morning, said the
situation was back to normal.
	   Later Sunday, some 1,500 people joined a march organized by the
leftist Belgium Workers Party against the American and British
raids on Iraq. Police erected razor-wire barricades to prevent the
protesters approaching the U.S. embassy.

Anti-potency drug an expensive hit in Senegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Although four pills cost a month's wage
for many Senegalese government workers, demand for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra has surged within hours of its release
for sale.
	   Drug store owners in the trend-conscious capital of this West
African country on Sunday reported a flood of mainly well-to-do
middle-aged men as Viagra was released to drug store shelves by
manufacturer Pfizer a day earlier.
	   ``Since Saturday, many people, mostly in their forties and above
have been asking for it,'' said Moussa Coulibaly, a salesman at a
Dakar pharmacy. ``However most don't have prescriptions yet. We
expect sales to be high on Monday.''
	   The pills are priced at about 30,000 CFA francs (about dlrs 60)
for four pills, or relatively equal to the salary of workers with
menial government jobs.
	   ``I welcome the sale of the drug,'' said Alassane Fall, a
middle-aged male civil servant in Dakar. ``But I'm flabbergasted at
the price. I can't afford it.''
	   Other pharmacists said they had been surprised that demand was
so strong despite the onset earlier this week of the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan, in which sexual activity is forbidden for Muslim
adherents.
	   Although Senegal is a majority-Muslim country, there is a strong
liberal sector of society with cultural and fashion ties to the
country's former colonial ruler, France.

Spain's small Jewish community celebrates first public Hanukkah in
</HEADLINE>
500 years &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's small Jewish community celebrated
its first public Hanukkah in more than 500 years Sunday at the same
spot where their ancestors sought protection centuries ago from
anti-Semitic violence sweeping the country.
	   ``This is an emotional and unforgettable day,'' Mayor Joaquim
Nadal told the outdoor gathering seated in early evening darkness
beside the ruins of Gironella Tower, where residents of the city's
Jewish quarter found refuge from marauding crowds in 1391.
	   The ritualistic lighting of eight candles on the eighth and
final day of Hanukkah attracted nearly 1,000 people, including many
non-Jews.
	   ``It moves me to be standing at this spot,'' said Eliahu Bakshi
Doron, chief Sephardic rabbi, who came from Israel to lead the
ceremony. The celebration was organized by the Spanish Federation
of Jewish Communities with the backing of city and regional
governments.
	   He said the lighting of the candles in the 4.5-meter (15-foot)
tall Menorah holder symbolized ``peace and love in a world of war
and tragedy.''
	   One of the Jewish religion's most sacred ceremonies, the Hanukka
commemorates the story of how some 2,000 years ago a group of
Jewish freedom fighters known as the Maccabees returned to their
ruined temple in Jerusalem and found a small jar of undesecrated
lamp oil which miraculously lasted the eight days it took to
acquire more.
	   Jewish leaders said they had wanted to hold public worship
services in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
expulsion from Spain of all Jews, but it had taken until this year
to organize it in a setting with deep Jewish roots.
	   Although no Jews are known to live today in Girona, a city of
74,000 in the northeastern Catalonian region, it has one of the
best-preserved medieval Jewish quarters in Europe. The city has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its restoration.
	   ``This celebration demonstrates that in Spain there is true
religious liberty,'' said Assumcio Hosta, a city official who
helped organize the event.
	   Estimates of the number of Jews living in Spain range from
12,000 to 25,000, compared with more than 200,000 when the Catholic
monarchs, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, ordered all Jews to
convert to Christianity or get out of the country in 1492.
	   Most Jews left for Portugal, which in turn expelled all its Jews
four years later. Most of the Spanish, or Sephardic, Jews ended up
in North Africa, although others went to France and Italy and the
Ottoman Empire.
	   Later, the state-sponsored Catholic Inquisition hunted down
converted Jews suspected of secretly practicing their traditional
religion, burning an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 at the stake.
	   Until 20 years ago, Spain remained an exclusively Roman Catholic
country, except for some short periods of religious tolerance in
the 19th century and again during the 1931-39 Second Republic.
	   Dictator Francisco Franco, the general who overthrew the
Republic during the Spanish Civil War, kept Spain officially
Catholic until his death in 1975.
	   Sunday's landmark public Hanukkah was the latest demonstration
of Spain's new religious tolerance. Other milestones include the
1978 constitution, which reestablished democracy and freedom of
worship and legislation in 1992 putting Muslims, Protestants and
Jewish religions on an equal footing with Roman Catholicism.

four nights of airstrikes by the United States and Britain.
	   In his first public comment since the strikes ended Saturday,
Saddam said the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be
``worthy of what your leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,
which will be attested by your enemies,'' he said in a brief speech
on radio and television.
	   Earlier Sunday, Iraqi newspapers also declared victory in the
airstrikes that pounded Iraq with the most severe firepower since
the 1991 Gulf War. Iraq offered little resistance other than
anti-aircraft guns.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated that at least 42 people were killed and 96 wounded.
	   In halting the strikes, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the
70-hour assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of
mass destruction.
	   But the rhetoric in Iraqi newspapers Sunday was as strident as
before the assault.
	   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in Al-Musawir
Al-Arabi weekly. ``Iraq does not deserve but victory with God's
help,'' said Al-Thawra, which is published by Saddam's Baath Party.
	   In his speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for
pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq.
	   ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said.
	   After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N.
weapons inspectors will be able to go back into Iraq to resume
their 7 1/2-year-old mission to search for and destroy Iraq's
illegal weapons. The strikes were launched after accusations that
Iraq was obstructing the work of the weapons inspectors of the
United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday night
that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.''
	   ``Swear by God, we will never negotiate,'' the government
newspaper, Al-Jumhuriya, said in a red headline on the front page
Sunday.
	   In the streets of Baghdad, there was anger.
	   If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the
inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an
unemployed 32-year-old man.
	   If ``they have destroyed everything illegal (in the airstrikes)
the next step ought to be lifting of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Under U.N. resolutions, the U.N. economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq is free of all nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain that 50
inspectors were waiting in Bahrain ``for further instructions from
New York.''
	   UNCSOM chief Richard Butler said it was necessary to get the
inspectors back in Iraq.
	   ``There is a need to bring those weapons to account. And there
is a need not to lose the Iraq case because it is test case in the
field of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction,'' he said
in an interview with Associated Press Television News.
	   In Iraq, many were coming to terms with the attack's aftermath.
	   Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he is
preparing to drive 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southern town
of Ali al-Gharbi. Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a
mass destruction weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old
niece.''
	   The girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile strikes, he
said. He said he still hasn't received the details.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign, compared to 290 fired in the entire Gulf War to evict
Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down more than 100
Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called off the attack, it apparently caught the
British by surprise.
	   Royal Air Force spokesman Group Capt. Bryan Collins said four
Tornadoes were en route to Iraq to bomb Republican Guard positions
when the stand-down order reached British forces based in Kuwait.
	   Collins said the fighters were recalled.
	   In the final stages of the attack, one missile struck near the
Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter)
hole into the earth.
	   The last attack came hours after Baghdad's residents broke their
fast on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks the
prophet Mohammed's receipt of the Koran from God 1,400 years ago.
Muslims fast during daylight throughout the month.
	   A statement by Iraq's General Command of the Armed Forces said
the missiles targeted presidential sites, civil establishments,
government offices, colleges, students' dormitories, factories,
refineries and some military units. It did not elaborate.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. special envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said
more than 100 international workers of the U.N. humanitarian
program will return to Baghdad on Wednesday, possibly Tuesday.
	   The workers were evacuated to Jordan on Friday. The humanitarian
program monitors the food distribution under an oil-for-food
program.

Opposition gathering forces against Netanyahu

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu camp planning for elections,
fresh Barak quotes, Shahak planning to quit military; CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ All but conceding defeat in a planned vote on
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's peace policies, his closest
allies were planning Sunday for an election campaign.
	   The prime minister will ask parliament in a vote Monday to
support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before
Israel carries out another troop withdrawal from parts of the West
Bank, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty as Netanyahu's
coalition continued to shed legislators left and right _ he has
said he will go to early elections.
	   ``The big question is not whether or not the early elections law
will pass tomorrow, the question is how long'' it will be before
elections take place, said Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, a member
of Netanyahu's Likud party and a close ally of the premier.
	   Katzav said he was already plotting a campaign against Israel's
former armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, whom he
considers the likeliest opposition candidate.
	   Shahak would announce his retirement from the military once
elections were called, Israel radio reported Sunday night, in a bid
to stand for election.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to
declare unilaterally a Palestinian state by May, and of claims on
Jerusalem as the capital of such a state;
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   The Palestinians, who say they have complied with Wye, derided
the conditions.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these five points, this is an
election campaign,'' said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of the
Palestinian cabinet.
	   Israeli media reports say that Shahak may opt to head a centrist
list. Polls have shown that that would likely push Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first round of voting, and
lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, appeared concerned by the prospect of a Shahak bid.
	   ``I feel it's an unnecessary division of strengths, there is no
`third way,''' he told Israel TV.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies _ as a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion _ but his deep involvement in
the Oslo process suggests that he is a moderate who favors
territorial concessions.
	   Katzav, Netanyahu's ally, also appeared spooked by the prospect
of a Shahak candidacy.
	   ``I don't yet know the way to defeat Amnon Shahak,'' he told
reporters.
	   Within Netanyahu's coalition, he has lost the confidence of
ministers who back Wye. His defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai,
said Sunday night that the only way he saw out was a national unity
government jointly led by Netanyahu and Barak.
	   Netanyahu also faced defectors from hard-liners in his coalition
who oppose further concessions to the Palestinians .
	   Michael Kleiner, who heads a parliamentary grouping that opposes
any further concessions, said that the hard-liners would run their
own candidate.
	   Netanyahu himself already seemed in elections mode, striking a
tough pose in his one public appearance Sunday _ before a
collection of 100 bar mitzvah boys and bat mitzvah girls from
Israel and the Diaspora.
	   Citing the example of the warrior Macbabees, whose repulsion of
the Greek empire 2,200 years ago is celebrated at Hanukkah, he
exhorted the youths to ``battle against assimilation, hellenization
and loss of identity.''

	   HAVANA (AP) _Several women and children huddled Sunday around
the plastic figurines of Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus on sale
for dlrs 1 outside the Miraculous Medallion Roman Catholic church.
	   ``Pretty!'' a 7-year-old girl proclaimed, holding up one of the
three kings.
	   The crudely painted nativity sets are among the rare religious
manifestations of Christmas, declared a permanent holiday in Cuba
this year for the first time in nearly three decades.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II and decided last month to make
it permanent.
	   Thus far, most of the holiday trappings in this formerly
atheistic nation are secular: small plastic trees with twinkling
lights, cardboard cutouts of a winking Santa Claus in store
windows, government discounts on traditional holiday offerings such
as roast pork.
	   Church leaders now find themselves echoing a lament heard around
the world, reminding their parishioners not to forget the holiday's
religious origins.
	   ``Something of the sense of the birth of Jesus Christ has been
lost,'' the Rev. Carlos M. Piedra Lopez, of the Reformed
Presbyterian church, said during a news conference of Protestant
ministers last week.
	   Even so, he and other Cuban pastors see the resumption of the
holiday as an opportunity to restore fading family traditions.
	   ``If for only one night a year, the Cuban family will sit down
together,'' for a holiday meal, said the Rev. Pablo Oden Marichal
Rodriguez, an Episcopal priest and president of the Council of
Churches of Cuba.
	   Those traditions have always been part of family life for Mariem
Garcia, 20, who brought her 2-year-old daughter to Sunday Mass at
the Christ Child Catholic parish in the October 10 neighborhood.
	   ``We have always celebrated Christmas as Christians,'' Garcia
said. ``But this year, we feel better to share this happiness with
everyone.''
	   Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches and a
government that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained
an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the government was
throwing much of the country's resources into an unsuccessful
effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest
and also canceled the New Year's holiday that year. The New Year's
holiday _ which also marked the triumph of the revolution led by
Fidel Castro _ soon returned. But Christmas remained a day of work.
	   In November, the Communist Party said mechanization had reduced
the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and declared that
Christmas once again would be a holiday.
	   The party insisted that the abolition of the holiday in 1969
``was not inspired by any anti-religious sentiment'' even though
the government at the time was avowedly atheist and often clashed
with the Catholic hierarchy.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious
believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than
an atheist state.
	   Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state
relations have warmed, especially since the pope's visit here early
this year.
	   In downtown Old Havana on Sunday, Cubans formed long lines
outside state stores to take advantage of government discounts on
holiday foods, which are also prepared for the New Year's holiday.
	   On a street leading from Old Havana's broad Plaza de Armas,
bystanders gaped at wooden Santa Claus music boxes decorating the
windows of a government stationary store. Inside, a brightly
painted train was set up around a decorated 10-foot (3-meter) high
Christmas tree.
	   ``Oh!'' declared a 3-year-old boy named Maximo, who ventured
inside with his parents to look at the music boxes. ``Santa!''

	   Given Iraq's secrecy and the limits of assessing the effect of
airstrikes from afar, the full damage to Iraq in the four-day
U.S-British military campaign probably will never be known. Here is
a description of the damage from the viewpoint of the attackers,
reporters and witnesses on the ground, and the Iraqi government.
 &UR; Americans and British &QC; 
	   The Pentagon says the 70-hour offensive hit nearly 100 targets
and involved 650 aircraft missions; 425 cruise missiles, each
costing dlrs 750,000, were fired from U.S. ships in the Gulf or
B-52 bombers.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the attacks inflicted
``significant damage'' on Iraqi weapons programs, command
structures and military and security infrastructure.
	   Among targets listed as hit by U.S. officials: 20 command and
control facilities, 18 facilities providing security for weapons
programs, seven or eight of President Saddam Hussein's palaces and
posts of the elite Republican Guard.
	   The Pentagon showed videotapes of laser-guided missiles striking
targets and aerial photos of bombed sites, one an Iraqi missile
repair station that suffered moderate to heavy damage.
	   British videotape showed bomb hits on Republican Guard
facilities in southern Iraq, and officials said the Guard was a key
target. Another British target was an oil refinery in the southern
city of Basra, which was allegedly used to skirt the U.N. ban on
Iraqi oil exports.
	   Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, showed reconnaissance photographs Sunday showing substantial
damage to three Iraqi targets. At the Taji Missile Repair Facility
outside of Baghdad, all five targeted buildings were hit and
damaged, three of them severely. A missile components fabrication
facility about 13 miles (20 kilometers) southwest of Baghdad was
struck. And a liquid fuel rocket facility used to build and test
rocket engines was severely damaged.
 &UR; Reporters and Witnesses &QC; 
	   Iraq controls access to damage sites for reporters,
photographers and TV crews, and access was limited.
	   After the first round of attacks, journalists were taken to a
street in the upscale Baghdad neighborhood of Karada where a
missile left a hole and broke a water main that flooded a street;
no obvious military targets were nearby.
	   Another site was Baghdad's Museum of Natural History, where a
missile put a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole in a wall and
shattered glass display cases for stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   After the final attack Saturday, reporters were taken to the
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, where two missiles left a
40-foot (12-meter) hole and shattered windows. Reporters were
blocked from seeing where a third missile landed nearby.
	   Journalists staying at the downtown Rashid hotel saw missiles
hit in areas containing headquarters of the Special Security
Services and the command center of the paramilitary Popular Army.
	   Iraqi witnesses described damage as heavy in some parts of
Baghdad.
	   They said the headquarters of the Military Industrial
Corporation, which runs Iraq's factories, was gutted. The area
around Saddam's biggest palace was hit, but his whereabouts were
not known at the time.
	   Other targets they listed included security offices,
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, and al-Mustansiriya
University in downtown Baghdad.
 &UR; Iraqi Officials &QC; 
	   Iraqi officials concentrated on reporting damage to what they
consider civilian facilities.
	   Among targets they listed as hit included a house belonging to
Saddam's daughter Hala, which is in a Baghdad complex of homes for
high-ranking officials and Saddam's family. Reports said the house
was destroyed, but no one was home.
	   Officials said many facilities hit were being monitored by U.N.
arms inspectors to prevent renewal of weapons production. One such
target was the Nida heavy machinery factory south of Baghdad.
	   Also listed were headquarters of the security police and
military intelligence, which officials said had been inspected by
U.N. experts.
	   Officials said missiles caused collateral damage to hospitals
near the Defense Ministry in Baghdad. Also described as damaged
were a Trade Ministry warehouse and the building housing state-run
radio and television.
	   Iraq's satellite station went off the air Thursday, and phone
lines to the south were cut. Some electrical facilities were
reported hit, and the official Iraqi News Agency said a missile
damaged a historic palace, parts of which date to 1180 A.D.

enormous damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and to human

Baggio inspires Inter past Roma 4-1, into fourth place

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With Roberto Baggio providing a spark off the bench,
Internazionale of Milan is back in the Italian League title hunt.
	   After entering Sunday night's game against AS Roma with Inter
down a goal, the veteran almost immediately set up the equalizer,
drew the foul that got an opponent expelled, and then added his
first league score of the season in a 4-1 rout that moved the Milan
club into fourth place.
	   Heading into the winter break, Fiorentina (9-2-3), alone in
first place for the first time since 1982, leads the table with 29
points to AC Parma's 26. AC Milan has 25, Inter 24.
	   With Brazil's Ronaldo, who played 80 sometimes effective minutes
Sunday, still not at 100 percent, Inter may need to rely more and
more on Baggio.
	   The 31-year-old was spectacular Sunday.
	   Four minutes after coming in in the 55th, Baggio beat Roma's
offsides trap with a perfectly lobbed pass for Francesco Colonnese,
whose ensuing cross was slammed under the crossbar by France's
Benoit Cauet to tie the game 1-1.
	   In the 71st, Baggio spun a free kick over the defensive barrier,
but the ball smacked off the left post. Two minutes later, the
striker earned the foul that sent Roma defender Fabio Petruzzi off
with a second yellow card.
	   Petruzzi protested, and replayed appeared to show that there was
little or no contact between the two.
	   Inter took full advantage of the extra man. Argentine Diego
Simeone's long pass hit Ivan Zamorano in full stride in the 79th,
and the Chilean striker chipped the ball past charging 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti and in off the right post.
	   Next, it was Baggio's turn to find the mark. In the 86th,
Italy's 1994 World Cup goalscoring hero took Andrea Pirlo's pass
and slotted it inside the left post from 15 meters (yards) out for
his 152nd career Serie A goal, tying Baggio with Lazio's Roberto
Mancini for most among active players.
	   Argentina's Javier Zanetti added another goal in the 88th for
Inter (7-3-4), which beat Vicenza 1-0 last week when Baggio came
off the bench to assist on Ronaldo's winner.
	   Roma (6-5-3), without a road victory this year, had taken the
lead Sunday in the 38th on Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio's sixth
goal.
	   Earlier Sunday, Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata slotted in a penalty
kick in the 95th minute of play to give Perugia a dramatic 2-2 draw
against leader Fiorentina.
	   Before Nakata's heroics, made possible when Spanish midfielder
Guillermo Martinez Amor used his hand to knock down a cross in the
penalty area during the dying seconds of injury time, Fiorentina
looked headed for another victory thanks to Gabriel Batistuta's
exploits.
	   The Argentine star gave the visitors a 2-1 lead with 17 minutes
left by netting a header for his league-best 14th goal in as many
games. Fiorentina had won two straight 1-0 games on second-half
Batistuta goals.
	   But ninth-place Perugia, which led 20 seconds into the match on
Croat striker Milan Rapajic's header, pressed forward. Nakata, the
second Japanese player in the Italian League, calmly hit the
equalizer for his seventh goal of the season.
	   AC Parma moved up to second place by beating Empoli 5-3 as Diego
Fuser tallied two goals and two assists.
	   AC Milan is third after a 2-2 draw against Sampdoria of Genoa,
whose new coach, former England captain David Platt, watched from
the stands. Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega, back from a drunk
driving suspension, curled in a penalty kick with four minutes
remaining to tie the score for Sampdoria.
	   Defending champion Juventus of Turin (6-3-5), tied for sixth
with 21 points, snapped a three-game losing streak and ended a
club-record goal drought by beating Salernitana 3-0 on striker
Filippo Inzaghi's hat-trick. Before Inzaghi found the target,
Juve's goalless stretch reached 511 minutes, 5 more than the club
went without scoring in the 1967-68 season.
	   French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane, expected to collect all
the major player of the year awards, assisted on Inzaghi's first
two goals.
	   Elsewhere, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas scored twice to lead
Lazio of Rome past Udinese 3-1; veteran Giuseppe Signori's free
kick gave Bologna a 1-0 win at Cagliari; Piacenza edged Bari 3-2;
and Vicenza and Venezia drew 0-0.
	   The league now takes more than two weeks off, and action resumes
Jan. 6 with a rare slate of Wednesday games.

Opposition gathering forces against Netanyahu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu camp planning for elections,
fresh Barak quotes, Army chief planning to quit military to enter
politics; CHANGES byline. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ All but conceding defeat in a planned vote on
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's peace policies, his closest
allies were planning Sunday for an election campaign.
	   The prime minister will ask parliament in a vote Monday to
support conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before
Israel carries out any further pullback from the West Bank,
according to the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accords.
	   If he does not succeed _ a near certainty as Netanyahu's
coalition continues to disintegrate _ he has said he will go to
early elections.
	   ``The big question is not whether or not the early elections law
will pass tomorrow, the question is how long'' it will be before
elections take place, said Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, a member
of Netanyahu's Likud party and a close ally of the premier.
	   Katzav said he was already plotting a campaign against Israel's
former armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, whom he
considers the likeliest opposition candidate.
	   Shahak would announce his retirement from the military once
elections were called, Israel radio reported Sunday night, in a bid
to stand for election.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved his conditions for
resuming Israel's compliance with the accords. Netanyahu says the
conditions are necessary because the Palestinians have not met
their obligations according to Wye.
	   The conditions, published by Netanyahu's office, include:
	   _The collection of illegally held weapons;
	   _A renunciation by Palestinian leadership the intention to
unilaterally declare independence by May, and of claims to make
Jerusalem its capital.
	   _Recognition that Israel never promised to release prisoners
jailed for killing;
	   _A stop to violence and incitement to violence.
	   A fifth condition reported by Israeli media, that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, did not appear in the final
published list.
	   The Palestinians, who say they have complied with Wye, derided
the conditions.
	   ``We have nothing to do with these five points, this is an
election campaign,'' said Ahmed Abdel Ruhman, the secretary of the
Palestinian cabinet.
	   Israeli media reports say that Shahak, who has been on leave
since stepping down as military chief in July, may opt to head a
centrist list. Polls have shown that that would likely push Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak out of the race in the first round of
voting and lead to a run-off between Netanyahu and Shahak.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, appeared concerned by the prospect of a Shahak bid.
	   ``I feel it's an unnecessary division of strengths, there is no
`third way,''' he told Israel TV.
	   Little is known of Shahak's policies _ as a soldier, he is
prohibited from expressing an opinion _ but his deep involvement in
the peace talks suggests that he is a moderate who favors
territorial concessions.
	   Katzav, Netanyahu's ally, also appeared concerned by the
prospect of a Shahak candidacy.
	   ``I don't yet know the way to defeat Amnon Shahak,'' he told
reporters.
	   Netanyahu has already lost the confidence of the ministers who
back Wye. His defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, said Sunday
night that the only way he saw out was a national unity government
jointly led by Netanyahu and Barak.
	   Netanyahu also faced defectors from hard-liners in his coalition
who oppose further concessions to the Palestinians .
	   Michael Kleiner, who heads a parliamentary grouping that opposes
any further concessions, said that the hard-liners would run their
own candidate.
	   Netanyahu himself already seemed in elections mode, striking a
tough pose in his one public appearance Sunday _ before a
collection of 100 bar mitzvah boys and bat mitzvah girls from
Israel and abroad.
	   Citing the example of the warrior Macbabees, whose repulsion of
the Greek empire 2,200 years ago is celebrated during Hanukkah, he
exhorted the youths to ``battle against assimilation, hellenization
and loss of identity.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A two-day operation to regain
control of the National Penitentiary _ much of which was in
inmates' hands for weeks _ was a success, officials said Sunday.
	   Prison Director Dimas Carbajal said police seized more than
9,000 weapons, including 6,000 machetes and 80 homemade pistols
during searches by hundreds of police. At least 1,820 of the 2,600
inmates were armed.
	   Carbajal also said prison officials destroyed a small plantation
of marijuana grown in plastic bottles and found four tunnels dug
near one of the walls.
	   The prison, inaugurated in 1996, was supposed to be Honduras'
top security prison, a model institution that would help end
repeated escapes and riots in other prisons. But troubles broke out
in early November when the facility was forced to take in
additional inmates because of damage to other prisons caused by
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Honduras' 24 prisons house 10,000 inmates. Ninety percent are
awaiting trial due to a sluggish judicial system. There have been
30 escapes and riots since 1996 in which some 4,000 prisoners have
managed to escape.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's army is vowing to crack down on a
small group of soldiers who marched through the capital last week
to protest the military justice system, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The chief military prosecutor, Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha,
was quoted by the newspaper Reforma as saying the military would
not tolerate the ``bad example'' of the soldiers.
	   About 50 uniformed soldiers marched down the Paseo de la Reforma
boulevard on Friday to demand the abolition of what they called
unfair, lengthy and outdated courts-martial that are used to punish
even minor offenses.
	   Newspapers reported the civilian Interior Secretariat had
promised the group's leader, Lt. Col. Hildegardo Bacilio Gomez,
passage outside the country.
	   But Bacilio did not show up for a planned flight to Venezuela on
Saturday and Macedo de la Concha insisted the insubordination must
be punished.
	   ``Every soldier who criticizes his institutions and his
superiors should be severely punished,'' he was quoted as telling
Reforma.
	   Bacilio already faces apparently unrelated charges of
insubordination and many of the other soldiers in the march also
face courts-martial.

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field
goal with three seconds left gave the New England Patriots a spot
in the NFL playoffs and a 24-21 upset victory Sunday over the San
Francisco 49ers.
	   Scott Zolak, making his first start in three years for the
injured Drew Bledsoe, matched Steve Young's two touchdown passes,
but outdid him in the fourth quarter. The eight-year veteran led
the Patriots back from a 21-14 deficit with two scoring drives in
the last eight minutes.
	   The victory and Tennessee's loss to Green Bay clinched a
wild-card berth for New England (9-6). The playoff-bound 49ers
(11-4) ended their four-game winning streak.
 &UR; Packers 30, Oilers 22 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre and Antonio Freeman
connected on three long touchdown plays as Green Bay beat Tennessee
on a snowy day and a slippery field.
	   The Oilers (8-7) saw their playoff hopes dim. The Oilers must
beat Minnesota next week and hope New England loses its season
finale and Miami loses its last two games beginning Monday night
against Denver.
	   The Packers, who clinched their sixth straight playoff berth
Saturday night when Washington beat Tampa Bay, improved to 10-5,
winning consecutive games for the first time in nearly two months.
	   Packers Pro Bowl tight end Mark Chmura left early in the game
with a strained calf and didn't return, but fellow Pro Bowler
Freeman caught TD passes of 57, 68 and 32 yards in the first half.
Freeman finished with seven catches for 186 yards.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 24 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, losers of nine in a row, blew a
13-point lead, but rallied to eliminate Pittsburgh from playoff
contention behind Jeff Blake's 367 yards passing and a touchdown.
	   Blake found Darnay Scott behind Lee Flowers and Carnell Lake for
a 61-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, and Doug Pelfrey,
whose heady play allowed him to kick a field goal just before
halftime, won it with a 21-yard field goal _ his fourth of the game
_ with 5:12 remaining.
	   The Bengals (3-12) have two of their three victories this season
over Pittsburgh, including a 25-20 win on Oct. 11 that was their
last until Sunday. They now can finish no worse than 3-13, which
would only match the franchise record for their worst season.
	   Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart, who threw a temper tantrum
when he was pulled from last week's 16-3 loss in Tampa, was benched
again after passing for only 30 yards in the first half as the
Steelers (7-8) lost their fourth in a row.
 &UR; Giants 28, Chiefs 7 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Kent Graham threw for a
touchdown and ran for another as New York continued its late-season
turnaround by beating Kansas City.
	   Percy Ellsworth led the defensive effort by returning one of his
two interceptions 43 yards for an early score. The Giants (7-8),
who had a total of four interceptions, won their third straight
game and for the fourth time in five games since Graham replaced
Danny Kanell as the starting quarterback.
	   To make the playoffs for a second straight year, New York has to
win in Philadelphia next week, Tampa Bay (7-8) must lose in
Cincinnati and the winner of Sunday's New Orleans-Arizona game must
lose next week.
 &UR; Panthers 20, Rams 13 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Steve Beuerlein's 68-yard
touchdown pass to backup tight end Luther Broughton with 2:44 left
gave Carolina its third victory of the season.
	   It marked the first time in 11 games this season that Carolina
(3-12) won after trailing after three quarters.
	   Beuerlein threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and the
Panthers forced four St. Louis turnovers and converted them into 10
points.
	   St. Louis (4-11) fell to 0-7 against NFC West opponents this
season.
 &UR; Bears 24, Ravens 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Third-string tailback James Allen, making his first
NFL start, did what first-round pick Curtis Enis and veteran Edgar
Bennett could not do for Chicago this season _ rush for 100 yards.
	   Allen got 135 of his 163 yards in the first half with bursts of
57 and 54 yards as the Bears routed Baltimore to end a six-game
losing streak.
	   In a game certain to have an impact on the coaching futures of
Baltimore's Ted Marchibroda and Chicago's Dave Wannstedt, the Bears
(4-11) bolted to a 24-0 halftime lead.
	   Only Walter Payton, Willie Gallimore, Rick Casares and Gale
Sayers have had better one-game rushing performances for the Bears
than Allen, who had 23 carries. It was the most yards for a Bears
back since Payton gained 163 against Green Bay in 1977.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Outlining a strategy of containing Saddam Hussein,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that the U.S.-British
attacks on the Iraqi dictator have made the world safer and set
back his military machine by years.
	   ``We have severely damaged Saddam's ability to produce and
repair ballistic missiles. We have severely set back his chemical,
biological and unmanned drone programs,'' Blair told a news
conference Sunday. ``His air defense radar, control centers and
communication facilities in southern Iraq have been severely
damaged and will take years to replace.''
	   ``Saddam is weaker now than he was before we started. His
neighbors, the region, and therefore the world, are safer as a
result,'' Blair said.
	   But, he said, the two nations remain ready to attack again if
necessary. Part of the containment strategy involves maintaining
the threat of force and Britain is to send another aircraft
carrier, H.M.S. Invincible, to the region to that end, Blair said.
	   Quoting unnamed defense sources, The Times newspaper said in
early editions Monday that Britain's first submarine equipped with
Tomahawk cruise missiles, HMS Splendid, would likely be sent to
reinforce Britain's military presence in the Persian Gulf when it
was operational in the spring.
	   The British government is buying 65 Tomahawks from the United
States for $317 million, only the second country to own the missile
system.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Cruzeiro and Corinthians tied for
the second straight playoff game of the 1998 Brazilian soccer
championship Sunday before 60,000 screaming fans at Sao Paulo's
Morumbi stadium. A third and deciding game will be played
Wednesday.
	   In the first half, the Corinthians kept up a relentless attack
but were stopped by tenacious defense and several spectacular goals
by Cruzeiro goalie Dida.
	   Also in the first half, a television replay showed a referee
erred when he called an off sides after a goal by Corinthian's
Freddy Rincon. Minutes later, Corinthian defender Gilmar was
carried off the field with a leg injury and is expected to miss
Wednesday's decisive game
	   In the second half, Corinthian's Marcelinho opened the scoring
by tapping in a goal in front of the net in the 59th minute. It was
his 18th goal in the championship series and it caused the partisan
crowd to dance and chant in unison.
	   In the 70th minute, the crowd went silent after Cruzeiro finally
scored when defender Marcelo Djian made a brilliant pass to Marcelo
Ramos, who kicked the ball into the net past Corinthian goalie Nei.
	   On Wednesday, the two teams will play for the title at Morumbi
stadium. Last Sunday, they tied 2-2 at Belo Horizonte's Minerao
stadium.
	   The Corinthians can win the title with a tie in the next game
because of a better won-loss record during the championship series.
For Cruzeiro, they would need a win.

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field
goal with three seconds left gave the New England Patriots a spot
in the NFL playoffs and a 24-21 upset victory Sunday over the San
Francisco 49ers.
	   Scott Zolak, making his first start in three years for the
injured Drew Bledsoe, matched Steve Young's two touchdown passes,
but outdid him in the fourth quarter. The eight-year veteran led
the Patriots back from a 21-14 deficit with two scoring drives in
the last eight minutes.
	   The victory and Tennessee's loss to Green Bay clinched a
wild-card berth for New England (9-6). The playoff-bound 49ers
(11-4) ended their four-game winning streak.
 &UR; Packers 30, Oilers 22 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin (AP) _ Brett Favre and Antonio Freeman
connected on three long touchdown plays as Green Bay beat Tennessee
on a snowy day and a slippery field.
	   The Oilers (8-7) saw their playoff hopes dim. The Oilers must
beat Minnesota next week and hope New England loses its season
finale and Miami loses its last two games beginning Monday night
against Denver.
	   The Packers, who clinched their sixth straight playoff berth
Saturday night when Washington beat Tampa Bay, improved to 10-5,
winning consecutive games for the first time in nearly two months.
	   Packers Pro Bowl tight end Mark Chmura left early in the game
with a strained calf and didn't return, but fellow Pro Bowler
Freeman caught TD passes of 57, 68 and 32 yards in the first half.
Freeman finished with seven catches for 186 yards.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 24 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, losers of nine in a row, blew a
13-point lead, but rallied to eliminate Pittsburgh from playoff
contention behind Jeff Blake's 367 yards passing and a touchdown.
	   Blake found Darnay Scott behind Lee Flowers and Carnell Lake for
a 61-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, and Doug Pelfrey,
whose heady play allowed him to kick a field goal just before
halftime, won it with a 21-yard field goal _ his fourth of the game
_ with 5:12 remaining.
	   The Bengals (3-12) have two of their three victories this season
over Pittsburgh, including a 25-20 win on Oct. 11 that was their
last until Sunday. They now can finish no worse than 3-13, which
would only match the franchise record for their worst season.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The impeachment vote against U.S. President Bill
Clinton made headlines around the world Sunday, though most
governments remained silent on the political turmoil in the United
States.
	   The U.S. House of Representatives impeached Clinton on Saturday
for obstructing justice and lying under oath about his sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky and voted largely along party lines to
send his case to the Senate for a trial.
	   Government leaders elsewhere were reluctant to make public
statements about the impeachment, saying it was an internal matter
for America.
	   Philippine Pres. Joseph Estrada, who has faced allegations of
womanizing in the past, declined to respond to questions about it
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch ally of Clinton's,
said it would not be right for him to comment.
	   But Blair said he had ``nothing but contempt'' for suggestions
that the U.S.-British bombing raid on Iraq was timed to divert
attention away from the impeachment.
	   ``I find it utterly grotesque and offensive, not just to
President Clinton, but to me, that anyone could suggest we would
put British or American servicemen or women into action because of
any internal matter in the United States of America,'' Blair said.
	   But in France, Jack Lang, president of the Foreign Affairs
Commission in the National Assembly, reaffirmed his long-standing
support of Clinton, saying the U.S. president has been ``the victim
of a witch hunt from another era.''
	   The House of Representatives has ``just offered the world a
festival of hypocrisy,'' he said, adding that the proceedings had
been a ``parody of justice'' and a ``sectarian fundamentalism''
that risks destabilizing a great democracy.
	   The South Korean state-run news agency, Yonhap, said it was a
``very unhappy day for President Bill Clinton and the United
States.''
	   It urged Clinton to apologize for his ``lies'' to defuse the
political crisis and prevent instability not only within the United
States, but worldwide.
	   In some countries' newspapers, opinion on the impeachment
divided along political lines with left-wing papers attacking
Republicans and conservative papers demanding Clinton's resignation
and replacement by Vice-President Al Gore.
	   ``It's time to show Bill the door and say hello to Gore,'' said
an editorial in Britain's biggest selling tabloid, the News of the
World, which is owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
	   The Observer, a London-based left-wing broadsheet, said
impeachment was ``a tragedy for the U.S. and the world,'' but
sympathized with Democrats who believed that the vote was ``an
attempted constitutional coup d'etat by the Republicans.''
	   There was no official reaction in Mexico, one of America's
partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement and a country
heavily affected by U.S. politics. Newspapers universally made
impeachment their lead story, with columnists portraying the issue
as a political conflict rather than an issue of law.
	   ``In Latin America it is a joke that a president could be judged
for an extramarital affair,'' said the centrist Cronica newspaper.
	   A German newspaper lamented the loss of American prestige due to
the scandal.
	   Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner
Morgenpost daily newspaper said in a Sunday editorial that the
Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United
States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.
	   In Turin, Italy, La Stampa ran an unusually large closeup of
Clinton's face.
	   ``These eyes, red and humiliated, those heavy bags under the
eyes, that ashen complexion, are the tragic testimony to the
humiliation of a young leader, William Jefferson Clinton, the
Democrat who stopped the 12-year-hegemony of the Republicans in the
White House, the man who had relaunched the hopes of a reasoning
left in all the world,'' wrote columnist Gianni Riotta, a former
U.S.-based foreign correspondent.
	   The impeachment story shared headlines with airstrikes on Iraq
in the mass-selling Swiss German SonntagsBlick newspaper
	   ``From now on, only saints can be president,'' it said in a
report criticizing Republican behavior.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's small Jewish community celebrated
its first public Hanukkah in more than 500 years Sunday at the same
spot where their ancestors sought protection centuries ago from
anti-Semitic violence sweeping the country.
	   ``This is an emotional and unforgettable day,'' Mayor Joaquim
Nadal told the outdoor gathering seated in early evening darkness
beside the ruins of Gironella Tower, where residents of the city's
Jewish quarter found refuge from marauding crowds in 1391.
	   The ritualistic lighting of eight candles on the eighth and
final day of Hanukkah attracted nearly 1,000 people, including many
non-Jews.
	   ``It moves me to be standing at this spot,'' said Eliahu Bakshi
Doron, chief Sephardic rabbi, who came from Israel to lead the
ceremony. The celebration was organized by the Spanish Federation
of Jewish Communities with the backing of city and regional
governments.
	   He said the lighting of the candles in the 4.5-meter (15-foot)
tall Menorah holder symbolized ``peace and love in a world of war
and tragedy.''
	   The Hanukkah commemorates the story of how some 2,000 years ago
a group of Jewish freedom fighters known as the Maccabees returned
to their ruined temple in Jerusalem and found a small jar of
undesecrated lamp oil which miraculously lasted the eight days it
took to acquire more.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In the latest of a wave of attacks on
business owners, police reported Sunday that robbers killed a
married couple as they locked up their general store in eastern
Guyana.
	   The killing Saturday night came three days after President Janet
Jagan's government ordered troops into the streets to help police
stem the crime wave.
	   Robbers shot and killed Mohamed Shaheed Kassim and his wife
Dora, both believed to be in their 40s, as they were closing their
general store in Berbice County.
	   Investigators said there were few witnesses because of a
blackout at the time.
	   Four business owners have been killed and one wounded in the
last two weeks in Georgetown, the capital.
	   Police are blaming the attacks on heavily armed groups of
muggers.
	   Business leaders are warning the increase in robberies could
scare foreign businesses from Guyana, which is still trying to lure
back investors following racially charged riots earlier this year.

Small Jewish community celebrates Hanukkah for first time in 500

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's small Jewish community publicly
celebrated Hanukkah on Sunday for the first time in more than 500
years, lighting candles at the same spot where their ancestors
sought protection centuries ago from anti-Semitic violence sweeping
the country.
	   ``This is an emotional and unforgettable day,'' Mayor Joaquim
Nadal told the outdoor gathering seated in early evening darkness
beside the ruins of Gironella Tower, where residents of the city's
Jewish quarter found refuge from marauding crowds in 1391.
	   The ritualistic lighting of candles on the eighth and final day
of Hanukkah attracted nearly 1,000 people, including many non-Jews.
	   ``It moves me to be standing at this spot,'' said Israel's chief
Sephardic rabbi, Eliahu Bakshi Doron, who led the ceremony.
Sephardic Jews trace their roots back to Spain.
	   The celebration was organized by the Spanish Federation of
Jewish Communities with the backing of city and regional
governments.
	   Doron said the lighting of the eight candles _ a ninth candle is
used to light the others _ in the 4.5-meter (15-foot) tall Menorah
symbolized ``peace and love in a world of war and tragedy.''
	   Hanukkah commemorates the Jewish uprising more than 2,000 years
ago against the Greek-Syrian kingdom, which had tried to impose its
culture and adorn the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem with statues of
Greek gods.
	   Jewish legend says that when a small group of Jewish warriors
tried to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found only
enough oil for one day. But the oil lasted eight days and is
believed to have been a miracle.
	   Jewish leaders said they had wanted to hold public worship
services in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
expulsion from Spain of all Jews, but it had taken until this year
to organize it in a setting with deep Jewish roots.
	   Although no Jews are known to live today in Girona, a city of
74,000 in the northeastern Catalonian region, it has one of the
best-preserved medieval Jewish quarters in Europe. The city has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its restoration.
	   ``This celebration demonstrates that in Spain there is true
religious liberty,'' said Assumcio Hosta, a city official who
helped organize the event.
	   Between 12,000 and 25,000 Jews are estimated to live in Spain,
compared with more than 200,000 when the Catholic monarchs, King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, ordered all Jews to convert to
Christianity or get out of the country in 1492.
	   Most Jews left for Portugal, which in turn expelled all its Jews
four years later. Most of the Spanish, or Sephardic, Jews ended up
in North Africa, although others went to France and Italy and the
Ottoman Empire.
	   Later, the state-sponsored Catholic Inquisition hunted down
converted Jews suspected of secretly practicing their traditional
religion, burning an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 at the stake.
	   Until 20 years ago, Spain remained an exclusively Roman Catholic
country, except for some short periods of religious tolerance in
the 19th century and early 20th century.
	   Sunday's celebration was the latest demonstration of Spain's new
religious tolerance. Other milestones include the 1978
constitution, which reestablished democracy and freedom of worship
and legislation in 1992 putting Islam, Protestant Christianity and
Judaism on an equal footing with Roman Catholicism.

	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Julie Foudy scored three goals,
leading the United States' women's soccer team over Ukraine 5-0.
	   Foudy scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half
Sunday for a 4-0 lead.
	   Coming into the game, Foudy had 24 goals in 137 international
appearances. She had three previous goals this year for the U.S.
team (22-1-2).
	   Tiffeny Milbrett scored 20 minutes into the game scoring off a
centering pass from Shannon MacMillan. Foudy then made it 2-0 with
a line drive shot from 25 yards (20 meters) out.
	   ``I got a great ball in from Kate Sobrero and there was a lot of
space there,'' Foudy said.
	   Debbie Keller finished off the scoring with a goal on a pass
from Susan Bush, who was making just her second international
appearance.
	   Ukraine appeared content to stay back on defense and try to keep
the game close. Ukraine had just two shots on goal the entire game,
one in each half.

 &UR; Eds: Items are on Julia Roberts, Jerry Seinfeld and Zorba the
Greek. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Actress Julia Roberts goes giddy at the mere
mention of boyfriend Benjamin Bratt.
	   ``It's nice to be happy. I'm just so happy,'' Roberts says in
Sunday's Daily News, which describes her as giggling like a
schoolgirl with a crush. ``Happy and lucky. I'm in a great place.''
	   Things haven't always been so great for the actress who hit the
big time in ``Pretty Woman.'' Her roller-coaster love life has been
tabloid fodder dating back to her highly publicized engagement and
11th-hour breakup with actor Kiefer Sutherland.
	   Later, her whirlwind courtship and marriage to singer-actor Lyle
Lovett made headlines. Less than two years after that came news of
their sudden divorce. Sometimes critical celebrity watchers never
really got it right, she says.
	   ``The perception of me was always more harried and chaotic than
the reality,'' Roberts said. ``Even in the worst of times.
	   Bratt co-stars on the TV drama ``Law and Order.'' Roberts' many
film credits include ``Flatliners,'' ``Steel Magnolias,''
``Conspiracy Theory,'' ``The Pelican Brief'' and ``My Best Friend's
Wedding.'' Her latest film, ``Stepmom,'' opens Christmas Day.

	   LANCASTER, California (AP) _ In a new series of TV ads for the
charge card American Express, American comedian Jerry Seinfeld
cruises the United States in a tan 1966 Rambler, getting into tough
situations he handles with the card.
	   In a one scene, Seinfeld asks a clerk:
	   ``Do you have a 1966 Rambler American manual?''
	   The clerk says yes and Seinfeld agrees to buy it.
	   ``That'll be dlrs 731.41,'' the clerk responds.
	   Seinfeld spent 11 days shooting the commercials for American
Express. Past spots had him using the card to get back onto a
cruise ship after he fell overboard, besting a card-less Superman
in a shopping emergency and traveling to England to learn British
slang.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ The last two descendants of Alexis
Zorbas, the legendary traveler whose lust for life inspired the
character ``Zorba the Greek,'' have been awarded Greek citizenship.
	   His grandchildren, Anna Geiger, 57, and Vangelis Yantas, 63,
were made Greeks in this northern port city Friday at a ceremony
attended by government officials. Both are Yugoslav and live in the
capital Belgrade.
	   Zorbas became famous when he was portrayed by actor Anthony
Quinn in the award-winning 1963 movie ``Zorba the Greek''. The film
was set on the island of Crete, and Zorba captured the
freedom-loving spirit of Greeks with his dancing, womanizing and
uncompromising view of the world.
	   The story was written by Cretan-born author Nikos Kazanzakis and
based on his acquaintance with Zorbas, whose real first name was
Giorgos.
	   Little is known about the man other than that he was born in
northern Greece, traveled around the Balkans, fathered 12 children
and died during World War Two in what is now the Balkan country of
Macedonia.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Sunday said
Iraqis have been victorious against the ``enemies of God'' during
four nights of airstrikes by the United States and Britain. In his
first public comment since the strikes ended Saturday, Saddam said
the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be ``worthy of what
your leadership expected from you.'' No final casualty toll has
been released, but previous reports indicated that at least 42
people were killed and 96 wounded. The United States and Britain
carried out the airstrikes after accusing Iraq of trying to block
mandatory U.N. weapons inspections. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the impeachment of President Bill Clinton
now in their hands, senators vowed Sunday to move quickly although
they disagreed on the format _ speedy trial or immediate censure.
Democrats generally favored censure; Republicans leaned toward at
least a brief trial. Both said the upper chamber of Congress had to
restore civility and ``political sanity'' to the process. The
president, meanwhile, prepared for a defense led by White House
Counsel Charles F. C. Ruff. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move that could bring the collapse of his
government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is asking parliament
on Monday to vote on his handling of his peace process. If he does
not succeed, which appears all but certain, Netanyahu has said he
will call elections nearly two years ahead of time. Virtually
conceding defeat, Netanyahu's closest allies on Sunday said they
were planning for an early campaign. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a
crackdown on democracy campaigners, China sent a respected labor
rights activist from jail into U.S. exile Sunday even as it
prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial. Xu Wenli's trial
Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive a nascent
opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate
voice. He is the third and most influential leader in the China
Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at
least 32 members detained or questioned. For organizing the party
and thereby challenging the ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is
accused of subverting state power, a crime punishable by 10 years
to life in prison. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A woman on Sunday become the mother of the first
known surviving set of octuplets, giving birth to five girls and
two boys. The eighth child was born on Dec. 8. All eight were in
critical condition on Sunday, doctors said. Nkem Chukwu gave birth
to seven of the children by Ceasarean section early Sunday. A girl
was born nearly two weeks earlier, said Dr. Brian Kirshon, who was
among three doctors who delivered the children. The girl born Dec.
8 was 12 weeks premature. The others were born 10 weeks early, the
doctors said. The babies range from 11 ounces (312 grams) to 1
pound, 11 ounces (765 grams). The Nigeria-born woman had undergone
fertility treatment. (US-OCTUPLETS)

Officials deny reports about Cancun drug probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The federal attorney general's office has
angrily denied reports that it seized several hotels and that its
own top agent in Cancun was under investigation.
	   ``It is the falsehood of all falsehoods that the attorney
general's office has seized the Palace Resort hotel group,'' the
agency said, reacting to newspaper reports on Sunday.
	   ``There have not even been police or prosecution investigations
in that hotel group,'' the agency said.
	   Local newspapers have reported on a widening probe of drug
trafficking in the Cancun area and Quintana Roo state, and of
complaints by hotel operators about the effect on tourism.
	   The agency denounced ``a cynical campaign which tries to
denigrate the actions of the federal prosecutor, as well as to
misinform and confuse public opinion'' about drug-fighting efforts
in the state.
	   It denied that it was investigating its top official in Quintana
Roo, Jorge Pena Sandoval, army Gen. Gaston Menchaca or several
other people mentioned in newspaper reports.
	   The agency did, however, that it had seized several other hotels
on suspicion of money laundering, as well as a security company. It
also has said it has detained several people for questioning.
	   The daily La Jornada on Sunday reported that the Palace Resort
group of hotels had been seized and claimed that Menchaca and a
number of officials in Cancun were being questioned.
	   The investigation has alarmed Cancun hotel operators, who have
complained that it could soil the image of the tourist resort.
	   Law enforcement officials say that drug smugglers have
increasingly tried to use Quintana Roo's beaches as a corridor for
narcotics and have publicly acknowledged investigating drug-related
money laundering there.
	   Quintana Roo Gov. Mario Villanueva has denied that drug
trafficking is a major problem.

Puerto Rican independence party looks for support after referendum
</HEADLINE>
defeat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican Independence
Party, badly wounded in a recent vote on the island's relationship
with the United States, is now trying to heal its differences with
more radical differences.
	   The party central committee approved a resolution Sunday to
``open the channels of communication'' with other groups ``within a
framework of respect toward the diversity and integrity of each
organization.''
	   The Independence Party believes independence from the United
States can be achieved through political means. For the last two
decades, it has tried to distance itself from more militant groups
like the New Independence Movement, Common Cause for Independence,
the Nationalist Party and the Socialist Front.
	   Those groups complain that the Independence Party's longtime
leader, Ruben Berrios Martinez, is too authoritarian.
	   On Sunday, Berrios warned the divisions between the factions
were deep.
	   ``After 20 years, beginning dialogue is the most we can do at
this moment,'' he said. ``As the dialogue develops, we'll see what
consequences the future will hold.''
	   Berrios' party was crippled by a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's
future in which only 2.5 percent of voters chose independence.
	   About 46.5 percent of voters chose U.S. statehood, while 50.2
percent voted for a ``none of the above'' option advocated by
supporters of the current commonwealth arrangement.
	   The results worry party leaders because the group could lose its
official certification _ and public electoral funds _ if it gets
less than 3 percent of the vote in the next general elections, in
2000.
	   Under the current commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens
but cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress. They
pay no income tax but receive some federal benefits, and they can
be drafted into the U.S. military.

Koznick carries country's hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ When skiers arrive in Vail,
Colorado, for the world championships in five weeks, American hopes
will be riding on one pair of skis: Kristina Koznick's.
	   Koznick added to those expectations on Sunday, when she reached
the World Cup podium for the first time this season with a second
place finish in a slalom.
	   The result also added to the pressure on her as the United
States' one legitimate hope at the worlds, which they will host
starting Jan. 30.
	   With the American ski team decimated by injury and retirements,
Koznick is the only skier on the team _ men and women _ to have
stepped onto a World Cup podium.
	   Koznick struggled at home during early season races in Park
City, Utah, and Mammoth Mountain, California, finishing 15th and
27th. But on Sunday, Karin Roten showed the American what home
advantage can do, giving the Swiss women their first win in almost
two years.
	   Like Roten, Koznick will hope to ride the emotional wave
provided by her countrymen instead of letting it drown her.
	   ``In Park City and Mammoth Mountain, I put a lot of pressure on
myself after doing so well last year,'' said Koznick, who recorded
four podium finishes _ including her first career win in Are,
Sweden _ and finished second in the World Cup slalom standings last
season.
	   ``Being at home, even if skiing there is not a big deal, also
added to the pressure,'' she said. ``But maybe that was good
practice for the world championships.''
	   While she realizes there are high hopes for her at Vail, world
championship gold is not Koznick's ultimate target. Though she
admits a world title would nicely flush out her resume, it is the
slalom World Cup crown that Koznick covets most.
	   ``Of course I want to be at the top of the podium in Vail in
front of a home crowd,'' said Koznick, 23, a native of Burnsville,
Minnesota. ``But my main goal this season is the World Cup slalom
title, which is more meaningful.
	   ``To win a world championship title you just need to be great on
one day,'' explained Koznick, currently eighth in the slalom
standings. ``To be a World Cup champion you have to be consistent
and strong throughout the entire season. That determines who's
really the best.''
	   Having finished second in the World Cup slalom last season with
just one victory, Koznick's more immediate goal is to win a pair of
races this campaign.
	   ``I'm capable of doing it,'' said Koznick. ``I need to be
consistent but I also need wins to come out on top.''
	   The slalom event this season is wide open.
	   At this time last year Ylva Nowen of Sweden was putting the
finishing touches on a four-race winning streak that carried her to
the World Cup slalom title.
	   This season, three races have produced three different winners,
with 17-year-old World Cup rookie Anja Paerson of Sweden taking the
early lead in the standings on the strength of two podium finishes
_ a win in Mammoth and a third in Sunday's race.
	   Reigning world champion Deborah Compagnoni of Italy is far from
top form, with just one second place to show for her efforts this
year. She went out early in the slalom in Switzerland this weekend.
	   Urska Hrovat, a bronze medallist at the last worlds, claimed the
season opening slalom in Park City, but since then has only cracked
the top-10 once.
	   The Olympic slalom gold medallist Hilde Gerg of Germany sits in
34th in the rankings, having yet to post a top-20 finish.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Monday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach
President Clinton over the weekend. Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 115.50 yen in early trading, up 0.30 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 115.61
yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 86.30 points,
or 0.61 percent, to 14,107.99 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed up 67.30 points, or 0.48
percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell from its level in New York
following the House's move to impeach Clinton on Saturday.
	   Hours after the House vote, Clinton rejected calls for his
resignation and vowed to remain in office until he completes his
four-year presidency. His case has been sent to the Senate for
trial.
	   On the stock market, share prices started lower following
weakness in the dollar and concerns of rising interest rates amid
fears that the Japanese government will have to issue more bonds to
help pay for a record government budget.
	   The Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue government bonds
totaling 71.13 trillion yen (dlrs 618.5 billion) in the fiscal year
beginning in April, up 22.8 from the initial fiscal 1998 budget,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Monday, quoting government sources.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher. Higher interest rates
tend to discourage stock investors because they raise the cost of
borrowing for companies.
	   Trading remained thin as many investors have retreated to the
sidelines ahead of a national holiday on Wednesday in Japan.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 5.65 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,096.05. The
TOPIX closed up 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.340 percent from Friday's finish of 1.320
percent, driving its price down to 103.87 yen from 104.04 yen.

Impeachment issue should be resolved quickly: Howard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
called Monday for a speedy resolution to the impeachment
proceedings against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   But Howard said he would not take sides in what was a ``domestic
political contest between a Democratic president and a Democratic
White House and the House of Representatives.''
	   ``The only observation I would make is that the constitutional
processes of the United States are very different from ours and
they do throw up this extraordinary situation where you can have a
president's authority under challenge in the most fundamental of
ways for a period of months,'' Howard said in a radio interview.
	   ``I can only express the hope that the issue is resolved as
speedily and effectively as possible.''
	   Howard said his dealings with Clinton had been positive.
	   ``As far as the relationship (between Australia and the United
States) is concerned, he has been a good president.
	   ``As far as his leadership in foreign affairs issues are
concerned, I think he has been an effective president and there's
little doubt that the American economy during his presidency has
prospered very strongly.''
	   Howard said peoples' private lives should be off limits except
where there was a clear demonstration that private issues were
impinging on the performance of their public duties.
	   ``I think there has to be a clear dividing line between the
two,'' he said.

Few civilian casualties from US bombs: Howard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq appeared to have been ``surgical'' and very effective,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Monday.
	   ``I'm certainly confident they have been very effective,''
Howard said in a radio interview.
	   Howard said he was pleased the strikes appeared to have caused
few civilian casualties.
	   ``It seems on the evidence available to me that the attacks have
been fairly surgical,'' he said.
	   ``They have not involved as much collateral damage as perhaps
has occurred on other occasions, although obviously some has
occurred and that is always absolutely regrettable and tragic.
	   ``But the responsibility for that has to rest with Saddam
Hussein who really brought these attacks on himself and his own
people.''

Japan's trade surplus falls for first time in 20 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world fell 15
percent in November from the same month last year, its first fall
in almost two years, the government said Monday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported
by Japan minus those imported, dropped to 902 billion yen (dlrs 7.8
billion) from 1.1 trillion yen (dlrs 9.6 billion) the year before,
the Ministry of Finance said.
	   The ministry said it was the surplus' first decline in 20
months. In October, it had surged 24 percent to 1.4 trillion yen
(dlrs 12.2 billion).
	   The numbers surprised economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Newswires, who had predicted a slight increase.
	   While the ministry said it was impossible to access the trade
situation from one month's figures, they could point to a slowing
down of Japan's export industries, which had been the only engine
of growth in an otherwise lackluster economy.
	   The figures also showed a drop in the amount of goods imported
by Japan as consumers tighten their purse strings further amid the
longest recession in half a century.
	   Japan's surplus shrank or held even against all other regions of
the world except the United States, where it grew by 1 percent to
488 billion yen (dlrs 4.2 billion) _ or more than half the total
surplus, the ministry said.
	   The biggest decline was in exports to the rest of Asia, which
remains mired in a 17-month-old economic crisis. Japan's surplus
with its neighbors plunged by two-thirds to 184 billion yen (dlrs
1.6 billion), the ministry said.

Games give Asia's big three an Olympic warmup, others chance to
</HEADLINE>
shine &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the region's big three in sports,
Asia's version of the Olympic Games was largely a proving ground
for the real Olympics.
	   Many Chinese, South Korean and Japanese athletes who won gold
medals wondered aloud whether their performances were good enough
to win on a world stage.
	   For others, it was a chance to shine without worrying about
Americans, Europeans and Africans stealing the spotlight. In the
Southeast Asian sport of sepak takraw, host Thailand could consider
its five golds equivalent to world championships since the sport's
other top nations were all here.
	   In all, the Thais won 24 gold medals, double their initial
target and their previous best showing of 12 in 1966. Olympic gold
medalist Samluck Kamsing led a haul of five gold medals in boxing's
12 weight classes. The hosts also won three golds in yachting.
	   Tiny Hong Kong, which had won only one gold in all previous
games, took five this time, concluding with Wong Kam Po's
victorious ride in the 200-kilometer cycling road race.
	   India, a big nation with relatively weak performances in recent
games, won seven golds _ most importantly its first in men's field
hockey in 32 years.
	   For the fifth consecutive Asian Games, China was the biggest
collector of gold medals, taking 129, or 34 percent of the 378
awarded.
	   South Korea won 65, and Japan 52.
	   Yuan Weimin, head of China's games delegation, said he was
``basically satisfied, but not totally satisfied.''
	   He estimated that roughly 55 of China's golds were won with
results that were world class.
	   Diving team leader Xue Li was blunt about weaknesses, however,
even though China swept all four gold and silver medals in the
sport and showed off a rising star in 14-year-old Li Na.
	   ``Winning these golds means nothing to us, for most of other
Asian countries lag behind the rest of the world in diving and we
Chinese divers mainly compete against ourselves in the games,'' Xue
said. ``But in the world major competitions such as the Olympics or
the world championships, there will be a galaxy of high-echelon
divers. Even a small error can cost you the gold when you compete
against them.''
	   China's rowing team, which swept all 11 golds in that sport,
also said Asian competition was too easy.
	   Japan, however, had some of the best individual performances.
	   Sprinter Koji Ito was voted the dlrs 100,000 games' most
valuable athlete award for his triple gold performance. He set an
Asian record of 10 seconds flat in semifinals of the 100 meters,
won the final in 10.05, ran away with the gold at 200 meters and
added another gold in the 4 x 100 relay.
	   Second in the voting was Japan's Naoko Takahashi. With nobody
pushing her, she missed the world women's marathon record by just
one minute as she won the games' opening race by 13 minutes.
	   Japan beat China 15 golds to 13 in the pool, and came behind 15
to 12 in track and field, but suffered embarrassments in team
sports, notably baseball and volleyball.
	   ``We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,''
said Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake.
	   Another embarrassment for Japan and its 2002 soccer World Cup
co-host, South Korea, was that neither reached the semifinals of
the Asian Games tournament. Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the gold, and
China downed Thailand _ South Korea's conqueror _ 3-0 for the
bronze.
	   World records fell on all seven nights of women's weightlifting
competition, where China swept the gold medals.
	   Also in the big league department, South Korea brought along Los
Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho to help it win gold in
baseball. In the gold-medal game, shortened to seven innings under
the ``mercy'' rule, Park pitched a four-hitter as the Koreans
trounced Japan 13-1.
	   Park, in turn, saw his Major League career benefit from a South
Korean rule offering exemption from mandatory military service for
gold medal winners in Olympics, Asian Games and certain other
international competitions.
	   Controversy at the games included South Koreans' complaints
about bowling, archery and equestrian events in which they swept
the top three places. Under games rules limiting any nation to two
medals per event, they had to give up the bronzes to the
fourth-place finishers.
	   Thai officials also accused Chinese judges in wushu, China's
martial art, of bias in favor of Chinese competitors. The Chinese
did not immediately respond.
	   The Chinese, on the other hand, said agents for countries that
they did not identify tried to bribe Chinese athletes into throwing
gold medal matches.
	   China also was dogged by the specter of doping, after 11 of its
athletes were disqualified from the last games in 1994 and swimmers
were caught in positive tests as recently as the world
championships in January 1998.
	   The Chinese said they had tested extensively just before these
games to ensure clean performances and called continued questions
unfair.
	   As of Sunday, just two doping cases had been disclosed at the
games _ two weightlifters, from Jordan and Kuwait, who had finished
no better than seventh in their divisions.
	   ``I hope we don't have any more in future,'' said Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, the games'
governing body.
	   But, he added, ``I am very happy that there have been only two
cases, not important cases, not involving champions.''
	   Thailand also was happy that the games proceeded without a major
hitch. And its soccer team helped take the nation's mind off an
economic crisis that threatened efforts to get all the facilities
and operations ready in time.

Computer software expert named new Korean information minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung appointed a new
information and communications minister Monday, signaling his
resolve to restructure South Korea's major industries.
	   Namgoong Suek, 60, president of Samsung SDS, a leading computer
software firm under the wing of the giant Samsung group, replaced
Bae Soon-hoon, who resigned over the weekend.
	   Bae, who was appointed to the post eight months ago, quit after
criticizing a government-mediated pact in which major conglomerates
agreed to sharply pare the number of affiliates each controls.
	   He was especially critical of a swap in which Samsung, South
Korea's second-largest conglomerate, is to exchange its fledgling
automobile subsidiary for Daewoo Group's home appliance businesses.
	   Bae, 55, had headed Daewoo Electronics Co. for eight years
before joining Kim's Cabinet. Daewoo Electronics Co. runs 28
assembly plants in England, Poland, France, Mexico and other
countries.
	   Presidential aides said the Kim's acceptance of Bae's
resignation confirmed his resolve to force the restructuring of the
nation's largest conglomerates, or chaebol.
	   That was a key condition of a dlrs 58 billion bailout of the
country's economy by the International Monetary Fund last year.
	   The chaebol thrived on cozy relations with past military
governments under a system of cross-funding and cross-loan payment
guarantees among their subsidiaries.
	   That system has allowed a single chaebol to control 40 to 60
subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips to cars, ships
and garments.
	   About a dozen conglomerates collapsed under mounds of bad bank
loans last year, fueling the nation's financial crisis.

Clinton impeachment probe voted top international news story of
</HEADLINE>
1998 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The impeachment investigation of President Bill Clinton over a
fling with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was voted the top
news story of 1998 in an international poll of Associated Press
subscribers.
	   It finished well ahead of the second-place story, the Asian
economic crisis, which spread around the world and roiled stock
markets everywhere. The Asian meltdown had finished third in 1997's
top 10.
	   Ballots were submitted by 84 news media subscribers in 39
countries worldwide, with editors listing their top 10 story
choices. Ten points were awarded for each first-place vote, nine
points for second and so on down to one point per 10th-place vote.
	   The poll was conducted before the U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq. However, the impasse over U.N. weapons' inspections
still made the top 10 list.
	   Clinton's impeachment process, sparked by allegations of perjury
over his grand jury testimony about his relationship with Lewinsky,
garnered 23 first-place votes and a total of 638 points.
	   While the Asian crisis had more first-place votes at 28, it did
not attract the overall support of the impeachment story and
finished second with 561 points.
	   There was a tight grouping for the next four places.
	   In third with 288 points and four first-place votes was the
exchange of nuclear weapons' tests by India and Pakistan, followed
by the devastation caused to Central America by Hurricane Mitch and
the Caribbean rampage by Hurricane Georges, with 282 points and
four first-place votes.
	   The Northern Ireland peace accord and the subsequent Nobel Peace
Prize for two of its principal negotiators was fifth with 276
points. Russia's economic and political crisis _ including
President Boris Yeltsin's ongoing health troubles _ was next with
271 points.
	   In seventh place with 244 points was the arrest of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Britain on charges filed
by a Spanish judge. The Kosovo conflict, which drew NATO threats of
airstrikes, was next with 243 points.
	   Indonesian President Suharto's resignation and the accompanying
unrest was ninth with 229 points. The standoff between Iraq and the
United Nations over weapons inspections wrapped up the top 10 with
195 points.
	   Last year's top story was Princess Diana's death, followed by
the British handover of Hong Kong's control to China.
	   The second 10 stories, with point totals:
	   _The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
provoked U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, 194.
	   _The Israeli-Palestinian land-for-peace accord, 190.
	   _Helmut Kohl's ouster as West German chancellor after 16 years,
135.
	   _Viagra, the first effective anti-impotence drug, 118.
	   _Pope John Paul II's historic trip to Cuba, 92.
	   _Preparations for the introduction of the Euro currency, 86.
	   _The World Cup soccer tournament, 60.
	   _The continued spread of AIDS, 56.
	   _The ouster and trial of Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, 54.
	   _The death of Cambodian Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, 43.
	   Other stories that were mentioned on at least seven ballots
were: Swiss banks' agreement to pay restitution to Holocaust
survivors; U.S. astronaut John Glenn's return to space; the final
report by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the
tidal wave that killed nearly 3,000 people in Papua New Guinea;
Chinese floods that killed more than 2,000 people; and the crash of
a Swissair jet off the coast of Canada that killed all 229 aboard.

Saddam hails Iraqis for standing firm against enemies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-109 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqis have been victorious against
``enemies of God'' during four days of U.S.-British airstrikes,
Saddam Hussein said in his first public comments since the attacks
ended.
	   The Iraqi president said in a brief speech Sunday on radio and
television that the Iraqi people and the army have proved to be
``worthy of what your leadership expected from you.''
	   ``God will repay well and crown your heart with clear victory,''
he said.
	   No final casualty toll has been released, but previous reports
indicated at least 42 Iraqis were killed and 96 wounded in the
strikes, which unleashed the most severe firepower since the 1991
Gulf War. Iraqi forces offered little resistance, other than
anti-aircraft fire.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, claimed Sunday the toll
was much higher.
	   ``Casualties are in the thousands in terms of people killed or
wounded, but we don't have any final figure,'' he told CNN. ``There
has been enormous damage mainly to the civilian infrastructure and
to human lives.''
	   In halting the strikes, President Bill Clinton said the 70-hour
assault severely damaged Iraq's ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday the United
States might strike again if Saddam rebuilds his weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We reserve the right to use force again,'' Albright said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
	   Iraqi officials have not allowed reporters to inspect areas
where the most extensive damage occurred, including presidential
palaces and defense installations.
	   The U.N. envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said more than 100
international workers of the U.N. humanitarian program will return
to Baghdad by Wednesday.
	   The workers were evacuated to Jordan on Friday. The humanitarian
program monitors the food distribution under an oil-for-food
program.
	   The rhetoric in Iraqi newspapers Sunday was as strident as
before the assault.
	   ``Victorious again!'' crowed the banner headline in Al-Musawir
Al-Arabi weekly.
	   In his speech, Saddam also criticized the Arab world for
pretending to be ``asleep ... or sick'' and not supporting Iraq.
	   ``A new aggression (was) started by the enemies of God and the
nation. With it, the resistance started again,'' he said.
	   After calling off the attacks, Clinton said he hoped that U.N.
weapons inspectors would be able to go back to Iraq to resume their
7 1-2-year mission to search and destroy illegal weapons. The
airstrikes were launched on the grounds that Iraq was obstructing
the work of the weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission,
or UNSCOM.
	   But Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan declared Saturday
night that UNSCOM's ``mission is over.''
	   Baghdad was bustling with normal activity Sunday, but in the
streets, there was anger.
	   If ``Clinton has achieved his mission, why does he say the
inspectors must return?'' asked Ali Mahmoud Abdel Munaim, an
unemployed 32-year-old man. If ``they have destroyed everything
illegal (in the airstrikes) the next step ought to be lifting of
sanctions.''
	   The U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free
of all nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   UNCSOM chief Richard Butler said it was necessary to get the
monitors back into Iraq, telling Associated Press Television News
that the inspections were ``a test case in the field of
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.''
	   After the strikes, many Iraqis were coming to terms with the
blows the missiles dealt to their lives.
	   Adil Mohammed Nori, a 50-year-old spice store owner, said he was
preparing to drive 185 miles to the southern town of Ali al-Gharbi.
Asked why, he said: ``To attend a funeral for a mass destruction
weapon that Clinton has destroyed: my 12-year-old niece.''
	   He said the girl, Zehra, was killed in one of the missile
strikes.
	   The Pentagon says 425 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired during
the campaign _ more than the number fired in the entire five-week
Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq says its gunners shot down
more than 100 Tomahawks.
	   The offensive involved 650 aircraft missions, including 32
sorties by 12 British Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   When Clinton called a halt to the attack, it apparently caught
the British by surprise. The Royal Air Force had to recall four
Tornadoes that were already en route from Kuwait to Iraq to bomb
Republican Guard positions, said Group Capt. Bryan Collins.
	   The last attack Saturday came hours after Baghdad residents
broke their fast on the first day of Ramadan. Muslims fast during
daylight throughout the month.
	   A statement by Iraq's armed forces general command said the
missiles targeted presidential sites, civil establishments,
government offices, colleges, students' dormitories, factories,
refineries and some military units. It did not elaborate.

It's revenge time for the Herminator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead planned after race scheduled at 1145 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PATSCHERKOFEL, Austria (AP) _ It's revenge time for ``the
Herminator.''
	   The men's World Cup is returning to Austria for a super giant
slalom, perhaps Hermann Maier's favorite discipline.
	   The skier who dominated the international scene last season
leads the Austrian team quest for a home victory in Monday's race
following an unexpected streak of setbacks in consecutive downhills
at Val Gardena and in a giant slalom at Alta Badia, northern Italy.
	   Maier, who won the season opener at Soelden and a super-G at Val
D'Isere last week, displayed his usual powerful style but achieved
unusually disappointing returns in the most recent races.
	   Some critics suggested that concentration of Austria's No. 1
skier was possibly shaken by controversy that surrounded the
removal of the former East German doctor who supervised his
training program.
	   Maier recently severed his ties with Bernd Pansold, a
doping-tainted doctor, bowing to pressures by the Austrian Ski
Federation.
	   ``I believe the real pressure for Hermann is to be the team No.1
and feel that fans expect his victory in every race,'' said
Kristian Ghedina, the Italian daredevil who beat the favored
Austrians in Saturday's downhill race in Val Gardena.
	   Maier placed third and fourth in the back-to-back speed races in
Val Gardena and captured another fourth place in Sunday's giant
slalom, which was won by Swiss veteran Michael Von Gruenigen ahead
of Italy's Patrick Holzer.
	   Maier, who clinched two Olympic titles at Nagano and 10 World
Cup wins in three different disciplines last season, was
undoubtedly the man to beat at the legendary Patscherkofel course.
	   The Austrian course, which hosted the Olympic downhill in 1976,
hosts the first World Cup race in 22 years as it replaces the super
giant slalom canceled in Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this
month.
	   Maier will have to beware of his teammate Stephan Eberharter and
of Norway's Lasse Kjus, who showed impressive form in recent speed
races with two wins and a second place.
	   Eberharter, who beat Maier in a super-G at Aspen last month,
also seeks revenge after failing to complete Sunday's giant slalom.
	   Eberharter, the World Cup overall leader until eight days ago,
has slipped to third place in the standings with 403 points.
	   Kjus is the new leader with 519 points with Maier second at 440.

Kosovo Albanians bury dead guerrillas, vow to fight on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POLAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 5,000 ethnic Albanians, many of
them weeping, gathered on a fog-shrouded hilltop to bury their
comrades and proclaim their resolve to fight on for an independent
Kosovo.
	   The mass funeral Sunday was for 33 rebels killed last week in a
clash with Yugoslav border guards. But it also was aimed at
portraying the Kosovo Liberation Army as a formidable force,
despite efforts by President Slobodan Milosevic to crush them.
	   A special, elite KLA unit, dressed in black uniforms, fired
volleys of semi-automatic fire into the air in a final salute as
the simple wooden caskets were lowered into the frozen ground on a
ridge renamed ``Heroes' Graves'' about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
west of Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   ``There is no better nor more honorable way to die than to die
for one's fatherland,'' a top KLA commander, Rame Buja, said as he
stood behind the coffins.
	   An honor guard of four KLA fighters stood at attention beside
each of the coffins.
	   ``We all together took the oath for the same cause,'' a KLA
commander, Saban Shala, said in a eulogy. ``And we promise you that
we will continue our fighting for freedom.''
	   Uniformed KLA fighters comforted families of the dead, whose
bodies were handed over by Serb authorities to the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Many of the women wept during the military rites, and several of
them fainted.
	   As the rebels were burying their dead, Serb sources reported new
violence in the secessionist Serbian province. The Serb Media
Center said ethnic Albanians fired on a Serb police patrol Sunday
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Police fired back, wounding two of the attackers. Those and four
others were captured, the media center said.
	   Meanwhile, about 300 Serbs angry over the recent killing of
their deputy mayor gathered in sub-freezing temperatures in the
town of Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, to demand state
protection.
	   The latest violence has dimmed hopes that diplomacy can head off
a return to full-scale war in Kosovo. More than 1,000 people have
been killed and up to 300,000 have been forced from their homes
since fighting escalated in late February.
	   The United States has taken the lead in trying to arrange talks
between the two sides about the future of Kosovo, which is part of
Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   On Sunday, Milosevic aide Zivorad Igic was quoted by the
government's Tanjug news agency as accusing Washington of favoring
the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Igic said ethnic Albanian rebels had killed dozens of people
since an Oct. 12 agreement between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic ended full-scale fighting and averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes.

 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with late games; UPDATES Giants
playoff chances with Arizona winning. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Adam Vinatieri's 35-yard field
goal with three seconds left gave the New England Patriots a spot
in the NFL playoffs and a 24-21 upset victory Sunday over the San
Francisco 49ers.
	   Scott Zolak, making his first start in three years for the
injured Drew Bledsoe, matched Steve Young's two touchdown passes,
but outdid him in the fourth quarter. The eight-year veteran led
the Patriots back from a 21-14 deficit with two scoring drives in
the last eight minutes.
	   The victory and Tennessee's loss to Green Bay clinched a
wild-card berth for New England (9-6). The playoff-bound 49ers
(11-4) ended their four-game winning streak.
 &UR; Packers 30, Oilers 22 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre and Antonio Freeman
connected on three long touchdown plays as Green Bay beat Tennessee
on a snowy day and a slippery field.
	   The Oilers (8-7) saw their playoff hopes dim. The Oilers must
beat Minnesota next week and hope New England loses its season
finale and Miami loses its last two games beginning Monday night
against Denver.
	   The Packers, who clinched their sixth straight playoff berth
Saturday night when Washington beat Tampa Bay, improved to 10-5,
winning consecutive games for the first time in nearly two months.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 24 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, losers of nine in a row, blew a
13-point lead, but rallied to eliminate Pittsburgh from playoff
contention behind Jeff Blake's 367 yards passing and a touchdown.
	   Blake found Darnay Scott behind Lee Flowers and Carnell Lake for
a 61-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, and Doug Pelfrey,
whose heady play allowed him to kick a field goal just before
halftime, won it with a 21-yard field goal _ his fourth of the game
_ with 5:12 remaining.
	   The Bengals (3-12) have two of their three victories this season
over Pittsburgh, including a 25-20 win on Oct. 11 that was their
last until Sunday. They now can finish no worse than 3-13, which
would only match the franchise record for their worst season.
	   Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart, who threw a temper tantrum
when he was pulled from last week's 16-3 loss in Tampa, was benched
again after passing for only 30 yards in the first half as the
Steelers (7-8) lost their fourth in a row.
 &UR; Giants 28, Chiefs 7 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Kent Graham threw for a
touchdown and ran for another as New York continued its late-season
turnaround by beating Kansas City.
	   Percy Ellsworth led the defensive effort by returning one of his
two interceptions 43 yards for an early score. The Giants (7-8),
who had a total of four interceptions, won their third straight
game and for the fourth time in five games since Graham replaced
Danny Kanell as the starting quarterback.
	   To make the playoffs for a second straight year, New York has to
win in Philadelphia next week, Tampa Bay (7-8) must lose in
Cincinnati and Arizona must lose next week.
 &UR; Panthers 20, Rams 13 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Steve Beuerlein's 68-yard
touchdown pass to backup tight end Luther Broughton with 2:44 left
gave Carolina its third victory of the season.
	   It marked the first time in 11 games this season that Carolina
(3-12) won after trailing after three quarters.
	   Beuerlein threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and the
Panthers forced four St. Louis turnovers and converted them into 10
points.
	   St. Louis (4-11) fell to 0-7 against NFC West opponents this
season.
 &UR; Bears 24, Ravens 3 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, third-string tailback James Allen, making his first
NFL start, did what first-round pick Curtis Enis and veteran Edgar
Bennett could not do for Chicago this season _ rush for 100 yards.
	   Allen got 135 of his 163 yards in the first half with bursts of
57 and 54 yards as the Bears routed Baltimore to end a six-game
losing streak.
	   In a game certain to have an impact on the coaching futures of
Baltimore's Ted Marchibroda and Chicago's Dave Wannstedt, the Bears
(4-11) bolted to a 24-0 halftime lead.
 &UR; Falcons 24, Lions 17 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Jamal Anderson rushed for 147 yards and scored two
touchdowns as Atlanta clinched its first NFC West title in 18 years
and a first-round bye in the playoffs.
	   It was just the second division title in team history for the
Falcons (13-2), who set a club record for victories in a season.
The Falcons have won eight in a row and 11 of their last 12.
	   Coach Dan Reeves, who was released from an Atlanta hospital
Friday after quadruple heart bypass surgery, missed the game but is
expected back in time for the playoffs. But he wasn't needed as the
Falcons, with defensive coordinator Rich Brooks acting as coach,
fought back from a 17-10 third-quarter deficit with two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter against Detroit (5-10).

China tries dissident amid tight security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Deploying scores of police to ensure tight
security, China put another prominent dissident on trial Monday,
the third in five days, accusing him of trying to subvert state
power by organizing an opposition party.
	   Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would
deprive the nascent China Democracy Party a potent organizer and a
moderate voice. He is the most influential dissident leader to be
tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members
detained or questioned.
	   Uniformed and plainclothes police cordoned off the Beijing
Intermediate Court in the city's western suburbs, preventing
journalists and other bystanders from approaching within 500 meters
(500 yards) of the building.
	   Asked the reason for the tight controls, one police officer said
``state security.'' Chinese in the neighborhood were surprised by
the police presence and said they didn't know about the trial or
Xu.
	   Three plainclothes police equipped with radios followed Xu's
wife He Xintong as she, spurning a police offer to drive her to the
court, took the long subway ride out.
	   For organizing the party and thereby challenging the ruling
Communist Party, Xu, 55, could face 10 years to life in prison.
	   To prevent supporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1
Intermediate People's Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues
Sunday and kept watch on the homes of at least two others, friends
and a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   As it was rounding up Xu's friends, China released into exile
Sunday a prominent labor rights campaigner in what appeared to be
an attempt to blunt international criticism of the crackdown.
	   Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and,
with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada and then
New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years.
	   Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before
the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother,
exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing.
	   His wife claimed for two years that Liu's health was worsening.
But only last month did authorities grant a comprehensive exam.
Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's
mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said.
	   Human rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release, the
latest in a string of high-profile dissident releases, as cynical
and manipulative.
	   Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the West, Beijing
signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for bringing its
spotty legal system closer to international standards. The ruling
Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views among
academics.
	   Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open
atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 14 provinces
and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and register
the China Democracy Party.
	   To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities have violated
recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the rights of
criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to
trial with less than four days notice given to their families,
instead of the 10 required by law.
	   Qin and a third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were also
denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared off prospective
lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses in separate
trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced.
	   The Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He
Xintong, suspects it is merely a formality in what she expects to
be a show trial.
	   ``He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to
represent my husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the
lawyer and his aide.
	   Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to
attend the trial, and He said she was given one pass, for herself.
	   Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he has
played the role of elder adviser to other dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party members and
exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.

	   In Irving, Texas, holder Eric Bjornson scored a touchdown on a
fake field goal and safety George Teague made a saving fourth-down
tackle late in the game, lifting Dallas past Philadelphia to win
the NFC East in Chan Gailey's first year as coach.
	   Gailey flipped the Cowboys around from a 6-10 record under Barry
Switzer to a 9-6 mark that enabled them to win their seventh
division title in eight years.
	   The Cowboys won 34-0 over the Eagles (3-12) in November, but

	   In Tempe, Arizona, Jake Plummer led Arizona on another
last-minute desperation drive, setting up Chris Jacke's final-play,
36-yard field goal to defeat New Orleans.
	   The Cardinals (8-7), who last made the playoffs in 1982 while
playing in St. Louis, can claim the final NFC wild-card berth with
a home victory over San Diego next Sunday.
	   The loss eliminated the Saints (6-9) from contention, leaving
only Tampa Bay and the New York Giants alive in the NFC. If the
Cardinals lose, they can still make the playoffs if Philadelphia
beats the Giants.
 &UR; Seahawks 27, Colts 23 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, the Seahawks, eliminated from playoff contention
earlier in the day, rallied in the fourth quarter on touchdowns
from Ricky Watters and Shawn Springs to beat Indianapolis.
	   The Seahawks (8-7) learned they had been eliminated from the
playoffs for the 10th year in a row in the first quarter when New
England beat San Francisco.
	   Watters, who set a career high with 178 yards on 32 carries,
scored on a 33-yard run with 9:19 to go to close Seattle to 23-17.
	   Then Phillip Daniels caused Marshall Faulk to fumble, and
Springs picked up the bouncing ball and ran 14 yards to the end
zone.
	   Todd Peterson added a 30-yard field goal with 1:57 left to
finish the scoring.
 &UR; Raiders 17, Chargers 10 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Wade Wilson, making just his third start since
1996, threw touchdown passes to James Jett and Tim Brown on
consecutive possessions in the second quarter, lifting Oakland past
San Diego.
	   The Raiders (8-7) snapped a four-game losing streak, but the
victory came much too late, and Oakland will miss the playoffs for
the fifth straight season.
	   The Chargers (5-10) lost their fourth straight game.
 &UR; Panthers 20, Rams 13 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Steve Beuerlein's 68-yard
touchdown pass to backup tight end Luther Broughton with 2:44 left
gave Carolina its third victory of the season.
	   It marked the first time in 11 games this season that Carolina
(3-12) won after trailing after three quarters.
	   Beuerlein threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and the
Panthers forced four St. Louis turnovers and converted them into 10
points.
	   St. Louis (4-11) fell to 0-7 against NFC West opponents this
season.

Natural riches still abound, but Russians abandoning Far East

<TEXT>
	   YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia (AP) _ When Vladimir Tribuk was
growing up on Sakhalin Island, a land filled with natural riches
but short on people, he believed the one guarantee his future held
was steady work.
	   But on a recent frigid morning, he reluctantly prepared to board
a flight to South Korea to join the growing ranks of Russians in
the Far East who have become migrant laborers.
	   ``I couldn't find any work here, and neither could my friends.
There is nothing here for us,'' said Tribuk, 23, who now has a job
at a Korean furniture factory.
	   Many of his friends have moved to the Russian mainland, or
headed off to Japan, Australia and the west coasts of Canada and
the United States in search of jobs.
	   This exodus has reversed the old Soviet trend of sending
generations of pioneers into the rugged, virgin lands of the Far
East, which served the political aim of settling every nook and
cranny of the world's biggest country.
	   But these settlements on remote islands, the frozen tundra and
isolated forests always relied on government subsidies and rarely
made economic sense. So the Soviet collapse left their descendants
stranded and broke in some of the most inhospitable corners of the
land.
	   Now, people are bailing out. The thinly populated Far East has
lost 10 percent of its residents this decade. Sakhalin Island, for
example, has gone from 720,000 people to barely 600,000 and is
still shrinking.
	   The entire Far East now has just 7.3 million people scattered
across a territory more than half the size of the United States.
Yet there still aren't enough jobs to go around and this winter
promises more hardship.
	   Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov speaks for most regional leaders
when he says the greatest threats this winter will come from power
shortages, not a lack of food.
	   ``We have big problems with energy throughout the island,''
Farkhutdinov said. ``The situation is really quite grave.''
	   Sakhalin and other remote regions took another blow when
Russia's latest financial crisis hit in August, leaving the
national government in Moscow with even less money to help
far-flung provinces.
	   Life on Sakhalin was never a picnic. Russia's czars used it as a
penal colony and the dour Russian writer Anton Chekov visited a
century ago and proclaimed it one of the most depressing places
anywhere in Russia.
	   But at least there was work. Sakhalin's young men used to labor
in the coal mines, pulp mills and fish factories that are now
abandoned and rusting victims of decades of mismanagement. At
Sakhalin's port of Korsakov, a short journey to the powerful
economies of China, Japan and South Korea, not a single foreign
ship is in sight, and the only working crane is chewing on a pile
of scrap metal.
	   ``People should only work in these hardship places for four or
five months a year when it's warm,'' said Yuri Yanitsky, the
general director of the Korsakov port and an extensive traveler
throughout the region.
	   ``The (Soviet) idea was to populate all these places because
they were part of the motherland. But the government should now
take these people out and resettle them.''
	   With the Soviet era aid gone, many people feel abandoned by
Moscow, more than 9,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) and seven time
zones from Russia's east coast.
	   ``When Moscow distributes resources, we are always last in
line,'' said Vladimir Sorochan, editor of the newspaper Sovetsky
Sakhalin. ``We don't receive financing for anything.''
	   Shortages are so acute at hospitals in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk that
surgery patients must sometimes bring their own canisters of
anesthesia to the operating room, Dr. Vladimir Kasanyuk said.
	   ``We are short of absolutely all medicines,'' said Kasanyuk.
	   He hasn't been paid since May, and makes his money driving a
taxi in his off hours. With a wife, two kids and two elderly
parents to support, he feels trapped on the island. ``People with
means head to the mainland, but I'm in no position to do that.''
	   For all its woes, Sakhalin is still faring a bit better than the
Far East's even more distant outposts.
	   In the southeast, some residents on the disputed Kuril Islands
are so fed up with Moscow's lack of help that they've signed
petitions to lease their land to neighboring Japan, which lost the
islands to the Soviet Union in the waning days of World War II and
still wants them back.
	   On the Chukotka Peninsula, which juts out toward Alaska in the
northeast, emergency officials evacuated more than 1,000 people in
November because it's too expensive to send in food and fuel. More
may follow.
	   The Arctic settlements must receive their winter food and fuel
supplies during the all-too-brief summer months, when enough ice
has melted to make the seas and rivers navigable.
	   But many boats didn't make the journey this summer because
shipping companies weren't getting paid. The ice has already frozen
over and many points are now reachable only by plane.
	   Most foreign investors have been driven off by the region's
daunting problems, and those who have set up shop have faced
endless hassles.
	   While Sakhalin's governor complains of energy shortages, the
building across the street from his office is filled with
executives from some of the biggest Western oil companies.

YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK: oil companies.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   They've been working for several years, and have already
invested hundreds of millions of dollars, to drill for oil off
Sakhalin's northern coast. The biggest and most advanced project,
Sakhalin-2, has anchored a state-of-the-art offshore rig designed
to withstand nasty storms, gigantic ice floes and periodic
earthquakes.
	   The first oil is expected to start flowing in the middle of next
year, and should bring with it the most promising economic
development since the Soviet collapse.
	   But the Western oil companies, including Shell, Exxon and Arco,
are waiting impatiently on Russia's cantankerous national
legislature to give them legal guarantees on how the oil will be
divided.
	   ``You can't have people investing billions of dollars without a
stable business climate,'' said Dinty Miller, chief representative
of Arco.
	   As Miller expounded on the difficulties of working in the Far
East, the building's lights went out. It's a daily occurrence, and
Miller didn't miss a beat. He whipped out a flashlight for a
visiting reporter and the interview continued in the dark.
	   ``I used to say this place had a future so bright that you
needed to wear welding goggles,'' Miller said. ``I'm still an
optimist, but I don't say that anymore.''

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Vladivostok's residents dreamed of
prosperity in 1992 when they opened themselves to the world after
being sealed shut for decades as a closed city under Soviet rule.
	   Foreign businessmen streamed in to explore the largest port on
Russia's east coast, and the city entertained such lofty hopes that
residents sometimes referred to Vladivostok as the ``San Francisco
of the East.''
	   But it would have to be a very foggy day in both cities for
anyone to confuse the two. Both are built on windswept hills
overlooking a bay, and that's where the similarities end.
	   A long-running feud between Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and regional
Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko has driven away most investors, exhausted
the patience of residents and left the city functioning
erratically.
	   Vladivostok's prime real estate still features sagging,
weather-beaten shacks that have long been the city's slums, because
water and other basic services are unreliable at the modest
heights.
	   Every trip on the chaotic, pot-holed streets is an adventure in
a city where roughly half the cars are left-hand drive Russian
models and the other half are right-hand drive Japanese vehicles.
All are supposed to travel on the right side of the street, and
sometimes they do.
	   It takes almost nine hours on a plane to get from Vladivostok to
Moscow, and this vast distance has always left residents feeling
cut off.
	   ``Moscow is the other side of the world. We don't care what they
do there,'' said Olga Bekhtereva, a tour guide.
	   What does raise hackles is the abysmal state of city services.
	   Last year, homes received hot water but no cold water for the
entire summer. This summer, there was only cold water.
	   Not surprisingly, Vladivostok has a cynical electorate.
	   There hasn't been a working city council for five years because
voters don't seem to care. There have been 14 elections to fill the
council, but not once has there been the 25 percent turnout needed
to make the voting valid.
	   And the winner of the mayoral election in September was ``none
of the above,'' when more than half the voters rejected all 12
candidates.

Vigil for MIAs overshadowed by showdowns with Saddam

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ For nearly eight years, the metal gate outside the
al-Rasheed family home has been left unlocked.
	   ``I don't want him to return and find it closed,'' sobbed the
mother of musician Abdul al-Rasheed, who left to buy bread for his
wife and six children on Jan. 3, 1991, during the seven-month Iraqi
occupation. He didn't return.
	   The symbolic hope of the open gate is in sharp contrast to the
family's cheerless reality: no answers and the tearful prospect
they may never learn his fate.
	   There are hundreds more similar stories around Kuwait, where the
government claims 605 people were detained or captured by Iraqis
and never accounted for after the 1991 Gulf War. Resolving the
cases is one point in the U.N. resolutions that ended the conflict.
But Western leaders, constantly wrangling with Saddam Hussein over
weapons inspections, rarely publicly press the issue of the MIAs.
	   It's generally been left to the Kuwaiti government and a
coalition of families to carry on the wrenching quest of seeking
those who never came home. Some were soldiers in the U.S.-led
coalition, said Kuwait's National Committee for the Missing and
POWs. Others were believed to be with the underground resistance
during the occupation.
	   ``I truly don't know why they took my son,'' said al-Rasheed's
mother, Naima Hassam Al-Salem, who last heard from freed Kuwaitis
in 1991 that her son was held in a southern Iraq jail. ``I can only
say that, God willing, someday he will walk through those gates and
come home. Maybe that will happen if Saddam ever falls.''
	   The Iraqi government, however, insists it is no longer holding
any prisoners from the occupation or war. Dozens of Red
Cross-mediated border meetings between Iraqi and Kuwaiti envoys
have failed to make headway.
	   Toppling Saddam could ``certainly expedite'' attempts to settle
the MIA cases, said Duaij al-Anzi, general manager of the national
committee for the missing.
	   ``The sky is the limit for our hopes,'' he said.
	   In a Kuwait City suburb, Amina Al-Kabsi touches her hand to her
chest, near the pin bearing the portrait of her only son, Ahmed.
	   ``I know in my heart that he is alive,'' she said. ``A mother
has these feelings. I know.''
	   Ahmed was 18 and just out of high school when the Iraqis
invaded. He was a religious youth, praying and reading the Koran
daily. He considered it was a sacred duty to remain in Kuwait
rather than flee to safety in Saudi Arabia _ as did hundreds of
thousands of other Kuwaitis.
	   Soon, Ahmed learned he was wanted, his mother said. The Iraqis
accused him of working with the resistance.
	   Ahmed's father had paid the equivalent of dlrs 10,000 and a
television and VCR to Iraqi soldiers to allow his son's passage to
the Saudi border, according to his mother. But Ahmed refused. In a
panic, his father dressed his son in the head-to-toe black covering
worn by some Muslim women. He was taken to his grandmother's house
in another part of the city.
	   The next day _ Oct. 26, 1990 _ about 150 Iraqi soldiers closed
in, his mother said. They blindfolded him and began dragging him
out. His grandmother wedged a piece of chocolate between his lips
before he was led away.
	   ``The other half of that chocolate bar is still in his
grandmother's refrigerator. It's waiting for him,'' said his
mother. ``I, too, keep his prayer rug and his Koran for him. These
are the little things we do to keep going.''
	   Ahmed's father spent five months in Iraqi detention and said he
was beaten and subjected to electric shock torture. He escaped with
other inmates during the failed anti-Saddam uprising in southern
Iraq. In 1992, other former prisoners told the family they saw
Ahmed in a cell near the southern city of Basra. There has been no
news since.
	   The Kuwaitis have adopted the U.S.-inspired yellow ribbon symbol
to draw attention to their vigil. A large photograph of Ahmed is
decorated with yellow satin.
	   ``This is a purely humanitarian issue,'' pleaded Ahmed's mother.
``This isn't a political thing like the weapons or whether Saddam
stays or goes. How can we live without knowing? But life must go
on. It just goes on missing a very important ingredient. Life for
me now has no flavor, no taste.''

Cairo's peaceful Metro contrasts with hell above ground

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Just a few steps beneath the madness of
Cairo's gridlocked and polluted streets lies a different world.
It's clean, quiet and efficient _ and it's where Egyptians,
uncharacteristically, obey the rules.
	   Cairo's Metro, with its elegant and air-conditioned stations, is
an escape from mayhem _ bumper-to-bumper traffic, armies of
jaywalkers, incessant honking and belching of noxious fumes by
aged, dented cars, trucks and buses.
	   In one of the world's most unworkable cities, travel time has
been reduced to a fraction for many people. Most striking is that
the subway trains, which arrive every five minutes in the busiest
hours, are on time. Fares run from 50 to 80 piasters, or about 15
to 25 cents.
	   Security men in white uniforms are deployed throughout the
stations to make sure regulations are respected.
	   The 1.7 million riders who use the subway daily are forbidden
from smoking, spitting, throwing litter or urinating in public _
all common on Cairo streets. Violators are slapped with 10-pound (
dlrs 3) fines, hefty for the average middle-class worker who earns
90-100 pounds (dlrs 26-29) a month.
	   Women, who have the first two cars of all trains to themselves,
are the staunchest supporters of the system launched 11 years ago.
They say they feel much safer in the subway and are less likely to
be harassed by men.
	   ``You can take your freedom under the best conditions _ it's
clean, air conditioned, fast, and smoking is prohibited,'' says
Nawal Seyed, a lawyer.
	   The Metro is the only subway in the Middle East and Africa. In a
city of 16 million people where many live in sprawling slums, it
has given Egyptians a sense of pride and a taste of the modern
world.
	   ``It makes us feel like we are a European country,'' businessman
Saber Seyed says. ``We're no longer part of the Third World.''
	   That pride is highlighted by the statues and bronze murals
depicting Egypt's ancient past that decorate the stations on the
43-kilometer (26 1-2 -mile) north-south line that opened in 1987.
	   A second, 19-kilometer (12-mile) line, inaugurated last year,
features modern art, lively colored tiled walls and matching seats.
Riders can watch television while they wait for trains.
	   A third line to Cairo University, going under the Nile River
through a 600-meter (1,980-foot) tunnel, is due in April. It's to
be extended to Giza near the Pyramids by 2000, and a line to
Cairo's airport is scheduled for 2003.
	   The Metro's efficiency is a contrast to the streets in the heart
of Cairo, which Transport Minister Suleiman Metwally once referred
to as the ``triangle of horror.''
	   There, just getting across the street is a trial. Cars speed
mercilessly toward jaywalkers. Decrepit buses, usually carrying
twice their capacity, tilt to one side as passengers dangle from
open doors. Despite their heavy load, the behemoths travel at
frenzied speed, terrorizing pedestrians and motorists.
	   It's easy to see why Metro riders are impressed with the
different attitude below ground.
	   ``What's not normal for Egypt is the discipline down here. The
chaos up there is a normal Egyptian thing,'' says Saydeh Adli, a
university student.
	   The contrast raises an obvious question: Why are Egyptians
willing to obey rules below ground and not above?
	   Alberto Granda, project manager of INTERINFRA, a consortium of
French companies involved in building the dlrs 7 billion Metro,
believes the strict rules are the key.
	   ``There is a certain discipline, a certain measure taken by
police,'' he says.
	   Of course, it's easier to enforce the law in the confines of the
Metro than to send armies of police officers onto the streets to
arrest litterers and other contributors to the chaos.
	   Mukhtar Adawi, owner of a juice shop outside the Shubra
el-Kheima Metro station in North Cairo, says his life has vastly
improved since the line opened last year. It cut his daily travel
time to downtown Ramses Square to buy fresh fruit to 10 minutes
from the 90 minutes it took by bus.
	   Although Adawi finds the Metro's cleanliness ``mentally
soothing,'' his own shop is filled with litter. He's too busy to
clean it, he says.
	   Asked about the dirty square outside _ where deafening pop music
and Koranic verses blaring from loudspeakers compete with honking
cars and buses _ he says simply: ``There are just too many of us.''
	   Mohammed Mitainy, a traffic consultant to the government, blames
Cairo's unruliness partly on laws that exempt ``important people''
_ various officials and legislators _ from punishment. Police are
reluctant to arrest anyone for fear of nabbing the wrong person, he
says.
	   There are no such exemptions in the subway, but, Mitainy notes,
``important people don't take the Metro.'' The system caters mainly
to the middle class. The rich have cars and the poor use the
cheaper buses.
	   So Metro riders see the rules at least are applied equally in
that quiet underground world.
	   ``We can obey rules,'' Mitainy says. ``We have the intention of
obeying rules, but only if they are applied to everyone. If not, we
prefer not to obey them.''

Thai sugar industry needs reform, study says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai sugar producers should stop
relying on government subsidies and concentrate on increasing
efficiency and yields to boost revenues, according to a report
released Monday by the country's top think tank.
	   The conclusions by the Thailand Development Research Institute
come as sugar producers have threatened to shut down mills unless
the government allows them to raise prices.
	   Thailand is one the world's largest producers of sugar, but
domestic sugar prices are controlled by the government, and
producers have complained bitterly during the past two years that
prices are too low. At one point, they held back sugar from the
market, creating a shortage.
	   The TDRI study said sugarcane growers have to improve
efficiency. A revamp of the industry based on its partial
liberalization is now needed, it said.
	   The industry is now faced with low yields, while production
capacity is too high, the study said. This leads to high production
costs, especially when compared with its main competitor,
Australia.
	   Thailand produced 42.2 million metric tons of sugarcane for
1997-98 crop year and is expected to produce 42.6 million tons of
sugarcane for 1998-99 crop season. The production capacity,
meanwhile, is as high as 80 million tons.
	   ``Cutting price controls will help to improve sugarcane prices
and, eventually, sugarcane growers' earnings,'' responded Kamthorn
Kittichotesap, secretary general of the Sugarcane Planters
Association Zone 7.
	   Retail sugar prices in Thailand were raised 0.50 baht (3 cents)
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) in February - the first price increase for
17 years - in order to deal with a local shortage.
	   However, Kamthorn said he didn't want domestic sugar prices to
be level with export or import prices. He wants the government to
create a special formula to regulate prices, and support the
industry when prices fall sharply.
	   The TDRI study said, however, that the government shouldn't
abandon its domestic sugar price controls because it would put too
much power in the hands of the producers and may affect consumers.

Dollar falls against yen on impeachment; Tokyo stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stock, bond, currency; ADDS trader
quote in 5th graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo
trading Monday morning after the U.S. House of Representatives
voted over the weekend to impeach President Clinton. Japanese
stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 115.20 yen as of late morning, even with its
price late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
115.61 yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 126.89 points,
or 0.89 percent, to 14,067.40 by the end of morning trading. On
Friday, the average closed up 67.30 points, or 0.48 percent.
	   The U.S. House's move Saturday to impeach Clinton hurt
confidence in Washington's ability to demonstrate leadership,
especially as the world economy reels from crises in Asia and
Russia.
	   ``The overall dollar sentiment is bearish. There is still
caution about Clinton's impeachment,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant
general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International
Trust bank.
	   Hours after the House vote, Clinton rejected calls for his
resignation and vowed to remain in office until he completes his
four-year term in 2000. His case has been sent to the U.S. Senate
for trial.
	   On the stock market, share prices fell following weakness in the
dollar and concerns about rising interest rates as the Japanese
government moves to issue more bonds to help pay for a record
budget deficit.
	   The Ministry of Finance decided Sunday to issue government bonds
totaling 71 trillion yen (dlrs 620 billion) next year, one-quarter
more than initially forecast.
	   Traders said that such a large issuance of government bonds
would drive long-term interest rates higher, raising borrowing
costs for Japan's already cash-strapped companies.
	   Making matters worse, the stronger yen was seen driving up the
prices of Japanese goods overseas, eroding profits at exporters,
which had been the recession-bound economy's one bright spot.
	   Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines
ahead of a national holiday on Wednesday in Japan.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 7.24 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,094.46. The
TOPIX closed up 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.330 percent from Friday's finish of 1.320
percent, driving its price down to 103.95 yen from 104.04 yen.

Can Iran's president win the battle with hard-liners?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Khatami's Charm, FEA-Katami's Future &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY393-394 &QL; 
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ It's an uphill battle, but President
Mohammad Khatami is doggedly pushing through liberal reforms over
the opposition of powerful conservative rivals.
	   His right-wing foes control Parliament, the courts and
prosecutors, radio and television, the Intelligence Ministry,
police and security apparatus, and the financial bodies at the
heart of the economy.
	   Most galling to his supporters is that the popularly elected
president can be overridden in any decision by Iran's supreme
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   ``Mr. Khatami is very alone,'' says Zahra Eshraqi, Khatami's
sister-in-law and granddaughter of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the father of the Iranian Revolution.
	   ``He's being treated unjustly and he cannot do anything about
it,'' she complains. ``They have literally tied his hands and
feet.''
	   But that is only half the story as Iranian life and politics
refashion themselves a year and a half into Khatami's four-year
term.
	   What's emerging, says Abbas Abdi, editor of the moderate
newspaper Salam, is that the country is being run by a special kind
of balance.
	   The conservatives challenge Khatami at every turn, but ousting
him from office ``isn't doable,'' Abdi says. Khatami's popularity _
he won an unprecedented two-thirds of the 30 million votes cast in
the May 1997 election _ holds back his right-wing foes.
	   ``To a certain extent, they stick to their boundaries and don't
exceed their limits,'' Abdi says.
	   So far, the balance has produced a steady battle of liberal
action and conservative reaction. Khatami urges freedom of the
press, and a raft of moderate newspapers open; conservatives try to
shut them down.
	   Khatami calls for a dialogue with America; street thugs
encouraged by his foes attack a bus carrying American tourists who
have heeded the president's plea for a cultural exchange.
	   And the mysterious deaths of five liberal writers in recent
weeks added to concerns that anti-Khatami forces are trying to
undermine his authority.
	   But many Iranians say this struggle is not about religion or
ideology. Khatami, like his foes, is a Shiite Muslim cleric; he
even wears the black turban as a descendant of Prophet Mohammed.
	   A popular joke has it that Iranians are really fighting over
whether to eat dizzi _ a traditional dish of lamb and chickpeas _
or pizza.
	   Iran's struggle is between the old and new, tradition and
modernity, isolationism and openness to the world.
	   Khatami draws his strength from controlling most of the major
Cabinet posts, support of about 100 deputies in the 270-seat
Parliament and _ most important _ his popular mandate from last
year's election.
	   His rivals hold much more power.
	   The national police, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is a
virtual army outside the army, and the Baseej paramilitary forces
that enforce strict religious values in neighborhoods are in the
hands of the right wing and report to Khamenei.
	   The most powerful ``Bazaaris,'' who control traditional business
and were largely behind the downfall of the monarchy in the 1979
Islamic Revolution, remain with the conservative clerics.
	   And Iran's huge economic foundations _ which have built a vast
business empire from the inherited wealth of the ousted shah _
oppose Khatami, fearing his push to turn Iran into an industrial
state within the world economy.
	   But even in these conservative power centers, the voters who
elected Khatami give him a base among a large corps of business
employees, lower-level government officials and soldiers.
	   For example, while the judiciary is headed by the
ultraconservative Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, many low-level judges
hearing everyday cases support Khatami.
	   Ali Movahedi Savoji, a cleric and hard-line member of
Parliament, claims Khatami also is increasing his power by
appointing his supporters to jobs at every level.
	   ``Right now power is completely in the hands of the
government,'' he says. ``Even school principals have been appointed
by the government.''
	   Some, including Savoji, also argue Khatami is not faced with an
implacable foe in Iran's supreme spiritual leader.
	   It has been suggested that Khamenei is not as strongly
conservative as many people think, that while he leans to the
right, he is basically trying to use his power as a balance between
moderates and hard-liners.
	   The struggle over Iran's future is carried out almost daily on
every level, from foreign policy to the rules of society.
	   In September, Khatami's government succeeded in renewing
relations with Britain by distancing itself from Ayatollah
Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against British author Salman
Rushdie, whose book ``The Satanic Verses'' was declared blasphemous
by Khomeini.
	   A conservative foundation that had placed a bounty of dlrs 2
million on Rushdie's head responded by increasing the reward to
dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Khatami's encouragement of freedom of speech and political
rallies is fought at every step. With hard-line clerics' tacit
consent, vigilantes armed with knives and clubs try to break up the
rallies. Police then arrest the rally participants _ not the
vigilantes.
	   But Khatami seems indefatigable. He keeps pushing his reforms
with subtlety and determination.

	   When a liberal newspaper is shut down, he arranges a license for
another. When Parliament impeached his interior minister for
allowing political gatherings, Khatami named him a vice president _
with special responsibility to broaden political participation.
	   In October, conservatives managed to annul the candidacies of
most moderates for a key assembly that appoints the supreme leader.
Many Iranians were angered, and it appeared voter turnout would be
embarrassingly low.
	   Khatami urged the public to vote anyway, if only for the least
objectionable candidates. The turnout was a respectable 18 million.
	   Khatami's pledges to the people and especially youth to permit
undreamed of freedoms _ to socialize in relative peace and express
their views _ are being kept. They can listen to music pretty
freely, and teen-age boys and girls are seen walking together in
public.
	   He has eased censorship, and many long-banned books and films
have been released.
	   Above all, Khatami has shattered people's sense of fear. Women
now go out showing more hair under their scarves, and young people
increasingly go to pro-democracy rallies, openly denouncing
conservative clergymen by name.
	   Savoji, the hard-line member of Parliament, contends Khatami's
political freedoms are popular only among the few rich youths. The
majority of Iranians are concerned with getting an education, jobs
and housing, he says.
	   Khatami supporters like Saeed Laylaz of the moderate Executives
of Construction Party answer that no matter how much the right wing
fumes, the president has created a momentum for freedom that is
irreversible.
	   ``The biggest achievement of Khatami's election is that
democracy has even seeped into the right. If the right wants to
survive, it has to go by those rules,'' Laylaz says.
	   But Laylaz also thinks Khatami and his backers need to get
beyond the day-to-day battles and take stronger steps toward
reform.
	   ``We have to hurry to reach our goals,'' he says. ``Otherwise,
what we fought for will collapse before our very own eyes.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Some of Mohammad Khatami's supporters worry
the president's constant battles with right-wing clerics may erode
his ability to lead.
	   They fear the constant struggling will so wear Khatami down that
he will be forced to compromise and deliver much less
liberalization than promised.
	   Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, editor of the now defunct liberal
newspaper Tous, compares the president to ``a runner with many
hurdles placed on his way.''
	   ``He may reach the final line, but I think he will be very tired
and exhausted,'' Shamsolvaezin says.

Iranian president captures hearts and minds of Iranian women

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ When 17-year-old Maryam Omi found President
Mohammad Khatami standing next to her at a recent book fair, she
broke into tears.
	   ``I felt I was under a tremendous force ... an attraction,'' she
said.
	   Omi is not alone in her feelings. In Iran, not only Leonardo
DiCaprio and Iranian movie actors are gaining a big female
following.
	   ``I simply adore him,'' said Golnaz Sajadi, 20, a university
student. ``He's so bright and clean, and attractive.''
	   The attraction is tempered by Khatami's role as a Shiite Muslim
cleric, however. As Sarah Taqani, another student, put it: ``I just
want to kiss him _ like a father.''
	   And it's not only the hearts of women that Khatami has captured,
but also the minds of women and men alike, particularly the young _
some of whom even carry his photo in their wallets.
	   Indeed, Khatami's election victory _ he won 20 million votes to
10 million for a hard-line rival in May 1997 _ was built on youth
and women.
	   Perhaps what appeals to many about the 53-year-old Khatami is
how different he is _ in looks and ideas _ from the more severe
demeanor of most Iranian clerics.
	   What sets him apart are his pleasant smile and fastidious
grooming _ his trimmed graying beard, the well pressed clerical
robe carefully matched with flowing cloak, his well-shined shoes.
	   Khatami's sister-in-law, Zahra Eshraqi, says Khatami is so
obsessed with tidiness that he nags TV camera crews not to wrinkle
his robe when they put a microphone on him.
	   Eshraqi calls Khatami's looks cozy. ``His face is pleasant to
look at. It's close to the heart.''
	   It helps Khatami's popularity, too, that he says what many
Iranians have long wanted to hear, promising freedom and civil
rights.
	   As the head of the National Library, Khatami spent six years
studying and lecturing about a different kind of Islam _ which
reconciles Islamic law and tradition with individual freedom, and
with Western ideas like the rule of law.
	   He has published two books. ``Fear of the Wave'' examines Shiite
reformers who sought to reinterpret Islamic law according to their
own times. ``From the World of the City to the City of the World''
is a long rumination on Western political thought.
	   ``He knows how to speak well when he travels abroad. He makes us
proud of him,'' said Taqani, the university student.

Europe looking to Kofi Annan to pick up the pieces after Desert
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ America's European partners are looking
to U.N. chief Kofi Annan to find a way to maintain arms controls
against Baghdad in the wake of the U.S.-British airstrikes against
Iraq.
	   In weekend speeches and television interviews, leaders of
several European Union countries spoke of the need to ensure the
Iraqis do not violate U.N. resolutions banning mass-destruction
weapons now that Baghdad has declared U.N. weapons inspectors will
not be allowed to return.
	   ``We trust that a political dialogue can be undertaken as soon
as possible, primarily with the involvement of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima.
	   The challenge facing Annan, however, will be to find a formula
for maintaining arms controls against Iraq that would satisfy both
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government and the United States
and Britain.
	   For nearly eight years, two U.N. organizations -- the U.N.
Special Commission and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency -- had been responsible for verifying whether Iraq has
destroyed its long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition Iraq must meet before the U.N.
Security Council will lift crippling economic sanctions imposed on
Baghdad in 1990 after Saddam invaded Kuwait, touching off the 1991
Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain launched the air strikes after the
head of the Special Commission, Richard Butler, said Iraq had
failed to cooperate with his teams.
	   But Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said the mission
of the Special Commission, or UNSCOM, ``is over.'' In New York,
Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, ruled out
any role for UNSCOM as long as Butler remains chairman.
	   ``Butler was coordinating, conspiring together with the people
in the (Clinton) Administration to try to bomb Iraq and to provide
the pretext for them,'' Hamdoon said Sunday on CNN.
	   In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said France would
support a ``new organization, new methods'' so that the United
Nations could maintain ``effective control on Iraqi weapons and
their eventual development.''
	   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said French diplomats
were already working on proposals for ``a new form of cooperation
between the United Nations and Iraq to restore the role of the U.N.
Security Council.''
	   The council meets Monday in New York to discuss the Iraq
situation. Vedrine gave no details, and it was unclear whether
those proposals would be acceptable to the United States.
	   In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said relations
between Iraq and the United Nations must be ``overhauled'' and
hinted that Italy wanted to see changes in the sanctions system.
	   Dini spoke of the need for ``introducing evolutionary elements''
in the ``sanctions regime.'' He did not elaborate.
	   But French and Russian diplomats at the United Nations have
suggested that Iraq should be offered incentives, such as phasing
out inspections of certain weapons systems such as missiles.
	   Any new formula must win the approval of each of the five
permanent Security Council members _ the United States, Russia,
China, France and Britain.
	   In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also called
Sunday for a new initiative to maintain arms control and to
``improve the conditions of the Iraqi people.''
	   German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said Russia should

Thai rubber farmers protest over lack of government support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About 300 rubber farmers blocked a
highway in southern Thailand this weekend demanding the government
prop up prices for their product, local papers reported on Monday.
	   Thailand is the world's largest producer of rubber, but the
industry is in its dying days, according to many economists,
because synthetic replacements are cheaper to produce.
	   The government is also attempting to liberalize several
industries and has been reluctant to prop up prices artificially as
a matter of general policy.
	   Aside from higher prices, the protesters were also demanding the
resignations of several government officials and said if their
demands are not met they will resort to unspecified tougher
measures, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The demonstrating farmers in Nakhon Sri Thammarat, 590
kilometers (366 miles) southwest of Bangkok, said they wanted the
government to set a price of 25 baht (71 cents) per kilogram (2.2
pounds) for third grade rubber.
	   The current price has fallen to a decade-low of about 15 baht
(41 cents).

China tries dissident amid tight security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES graf 3 with court officials refusing comment, comment

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Deploying scores of police to ensure tight
security, China put another prominent dissident on trial Monday,
the third in five days, accusing him of trying to subvert state
power by organizing an opposition party.
	   Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would
deprive the nascent China Democracy Party a potent organizer and a
moderate voice. He is the most influential dissident leader to be
tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members
detained or questioned.
	   Uniformed and plainclothes police cordoned off the Beijing
Intermediate Court in the city's western suburbs, preventing
journalists and other bystanders from approaching within 500 meters
(yards) of the building. Court officials contacted by telephone
declined to comment on the case.
	   Asked the reason for the tight controls, one police officer said
``state security.'' Chinese in the neighborhood were surprised by
the police presence and said they didn't know about the trial or
Xu.
	   ``Chinese people aren't allowed to know what's going on and
foreign reporters aren't allowed to go in. This is democracy,''
said a local resident, who gave only his surname, Zhang.
	   Three plainclothes police equipped with radios followed Xu's
wife, He Xintong, as she, spurning a police offer to driver her to
the court, took the long subway ride out.
	   For organizing the party and thereby challenging the ruling
Communist Party, Xu, 55, could face 10 years to life in prison.
	   To prevent supporters from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1
Intermediate People's Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues
Sunday and kept watch on the homes of at least two others, friends
and a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   As it was rounding up Xu's friends, China released into exile
Sunday a prominent labor rights campaigner in what appeared to be
an attempt to blunt international criticism of the crackdown.
	   Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and,
with his wife and daughter, put on a plane to Canada and then New
York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years.
	   Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before
the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother,
exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing.
	   His wife claimed for two years that Liu's health was worsening.
But only last month did authorities grant a comprehensive exam.
Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's
mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said.
	   Human rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release, the
latest in a string of high-profile dissident releases, as cynical
and manipulative.
	   Over the past two years, as China tried to woo the West, Beijing
signed two key U.N. rights treaties and won praise for bringing its
spotty legal system closer to international standards. The ruling
Communist Party relaxed some controls on dissenting views among
academics.
	   Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open
atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 14 provinces
and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and register
the China Democracy Party.
	   To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities have violated
recently revised laws that are supposed to protect the rights of
criminal suspects. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to
trial with less than four days notice given to their families,
instead of the 10 required by law.
	   Qin and a third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were also
denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared off prospective
lawyers, forcing the two to argue their own defenses in separate
trials on Thursday. No verdicts have been announced.
	   The Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He
Xintong, suspects it is merely a formality in what she expects to
be a show trial.
	   ``He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to
represent my husband?'' He Xintong said after talking with the
lawyer and his aide.
	   Authorities have turned down requests by Xu's colleagues to
attend the trial, and He said she was given one pass, for herself.
	   Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he has
played the role of elder adviser to other dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party members and
exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.

Finance Ministry proposes increased spending for next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GINNY PARKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Finance Ministry revealed a national budget
plan on Monday that would boost overall spending by a record 5.4
percent next fiscal year in an effort to jump-start the nation's
flagging economy.
	   Allocating 81.860 trillion yen (dlrs 710.6 billion) in
government outlays, the expansionary policy is a turnaround from
last year's austere budget of former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   In the new budget, public works spending would jump over 10
percent to about 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86.8 billion), the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Tax revenues are expected to plunge 19.5 percent next year to
47.119 trillion yen (dlrs 409.0 billion), reflecting massive tax
cuts planned for 1999 and the weak economy, the Finance Ministry
said.
	   Japan's budget deficit, already one of the highest in the
industrialized world, would surge as a result of the proposed
spending.
	   But in a nation suffering its worst recession since World War
II, the stimulus is essential for economic recovery, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   ``This budget was compiled with the view that, keeping in mind
the current extremely severe fiscal situation, we need to put all
of our efforts into ensuring an economic recovery,'' a ministry
official said.
	   The budget announcement comes a day after Japan set its economic
growth target for next year at 0.5 percent _ the lowest forecast
since the World War II.
	   To cover the sharp drop in revenue under the proposed plan, the
government would issue 31.050 trillion yen (dlrs 269.5 billion) in
new bonds, a 99.6 percent rise from this year's budget.
	   Total bond issues would be 71.132 trillion yen (dlrs 617.5
billion), up 22.8 percent.
	   Areas suffering cutbacks would include foreign aid, which would
slip 0.2 percent to 1.045 trillion yen (dlrs 9.1 billion). Defense
spending would also fall 0.2 percent to 4.932 trillion yen (dlrs
42.8 billion).
	   Cabinet ministers plan to negotiate over the budget draft during
the rest of this week, adopting a final budget proposal on December
25.
	   Parliament is then expected to approve the proposed budget in
its January session. The measures would take affect on April 1,
1999, the first day of Japan's fiscal year.

China to build better levees to control floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will build 16,200 kilometers (10,125 miles)
of ``first class'' levees along major rivers to help prevent
further devastation from disastrous floods that strike each summer,
official reports said Monday.
	   The new levees must be solid enough to withstand the worst
possible onslaughts from the flood prone Yangtze and Yellow rivers,
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, who spent a large part of the summer
overseeing flood relief operations, told a national conference,
state-run newspapers reported.
	   Repair of damage from this year's floods must be completed
before next summer's seasonal rains trigger further flooding, the
People's Daily and other newspapers cited Wen as saying.
	   China spent a record 20 billion yuan (dlrs 2.4 billion) on water
conservancy projects this year, but it was not enough to prevent
the worst floods in decades from ravaging many parts of the
country, killing more than 3,000 people, driving 230 million more
from their homes and causing dlrs 30 billion in damage.
	   During a tour of one flood-ravaged area, Premier Zhu Rongji
likened the quality of the levees to tofu, soft bean curd that
easily breaks, and accused local officials of stealing money meant
for flood control.
	   The government has allocated special funds and intends to finish
repairing and strengthening levees within three years, Monday's
report said.
	   China's 240,000 kilometers (150,000 miles) of levees protect one
half of its 1.2 billion population, one-third of its farmland and
70 percent of the nation's productive capacity, the report said.

 &UR; Lightning 2, Flyers 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Philadelphia, Wendel Clark scored at 10:39 of the third
period to give the Tampa Bay Lightning a tie with the host Flyers.
	   Clark deflected a shot from the right circle by Alexander
Selivanov past the stick side of Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall to
help Tampa Bay snap a two-game losing streak.
	   Rod Brind'Amour and John LeClair scored for the Flyers, who
extended their unbeaten streak to five (2-0-3). Sandy McCarthy also
scored for Tampa Bay, which had lost 14 of its previous 16 games
and had been outscored 70-28 in that stretch.
 &UR; Kings 4, Blackhawks 1
	   In Chicago, Donald Audette, playing his first game with Los
Angeles, scored on his first shift and the Kings got two goals from
Glen Murray to beat the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Audette, a 10-year NHL veteran right wing, skated in his first
game this season after holding out with the Buffalo Sabres. Los
Angeles acquired him Friday from Buffalo for a second-round 1999
draft choice.
	   Luc Robitaille also scored for the Kings, who snapped an
eight-game road losing streak and three-game slide overall. Alex
Zhamnov scored Chicago's goal as the Blackhawks' winless streak
reached five games (0-4-1).

China to send up balloon to monitor ozone layer

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China plans to launch a 30,000-cubic-meter
(39,000-cubic-yard) weather balloon on Jan. 1 to monitor ozone in
the atmosphere above the country, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported Monday.
	   The balloon will be stationed at 30,000 meters (18 miles) above
the earth as part of a program by the Institute of Atmospheric
Physics and an unnamed foreign refrigerant producer, the report
said.
	   China has pledged to gradually end production of refrigerants
and other chemicals that are thought to be destroying the ozone
layer.

SAS becomes first to pull out of Hong Kong's new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An international airline said Monday it will
end services to Hong Kong because Asia's economic downturn and
higher operating costs at the Chinese territory's new airport are
undercutting its profits.
	   Scandinavian Airlines System, which flies four times weekly to
Hong Kong, will stop services on March 1, said Per Mollen Jensen,
general manager in Hong Kong for the Stockholm, Sweden-based
carrier.
	   It will become the first airline to pull out of Hong Kong since
the U.S. dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok opened in early July to a
string of humiliating computer glitches affecting both passenger
flights and cargo handling.
	   Services have been back to normal, but airline officials have
been complaining about the steep landing and parking charges _
about 20 percent higher than before.
	   Jensen said the Hong Kong routes have been unprofitable for the
past two years because of fewer passengers, increasing competition
from other European airlines and higher costs to operate from the
new Chek Lap Kok airport.
	   ``It's quite expensive to use the new airport, and Hong Kong is
generally a very expensive place to operate,'' he said.
	   The number of passengers is off by about 20 percent from the
Airport Authority's forecast as Asian travelers, hit by the
regional financial contagion, stay home, said Chris Donnolley, a
spokesman for the government body running the airport.
	   Faced with the same problem, Singapore recently slashed landing
charges by 10 percent at the Changi Airport, Hong Kong's main
competitor.
	   The move is expected to save airlines U.S. dlrs 11 million next
year, officials said.
	   Donnolley said the authority has no plans to lower charges,
especially after it cut rents for retailers by 25-40 percent last
month. He said the authority is required by law to balance the
budget, ``which doesn't leave us a lot of room to maneuver,'' he
said.

Netanyahu faces show down in Knesset set to vote against him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs. Parliament debate set to begin at 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After two and a half years of balancing the
peace process against the wishes of his hawkish coalition, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reign of power may be coming to an
end.
	   On Monday, Israel's parliament will approve either a
no-confidence motion or a bill for early elections. Either way,
Netanyahu will be one step closer to facing the polls over his
hard-line peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu holds a one-seat majority in the Knesset amid
crumbling support from his coalition partners.
	   A successful no-confidence motion would mean new elections
within 60 days. Approval of the first of three readings of the
early elections bill would mean a vote could take place within six
months. A preliminary reading of the bill passed in July.
	   Netanyahu will decide before the Knesset convenes whether the
120-member house will vote for a no-confidence motion or for the
early elections bill. Politicians from both sides have suggested
April 27 as a possible election date, more than a year ahead of the
scheduled 2000 vote.
	   ``The big question is not whether or not the the early elections
law will pass, the question is how long,'' it will be, said said
Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party
and a close ally of the premier.
	   Netanyahu on Sunday made a last-ditch effort to garner support,
but on the eve of the vote, 65 Knesset members said they would vote
for early elections. The bill would then return to the Knesset law
committee for debate and then back to the floor for two more
readings before it would become law.
	   Netanyahu said last week he would call early elections if he
failed to muster enough support by Monday for a set of conditions
he has set for Israel to renew the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace
deal with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu froze implementation of the deal, which calls for
Israel to cede from war-captured West Bank territory, because he
said the Palestinians failed to live up to their commitments.
	   Both opponents of further concessions to the Palestinians and
doves in the Knesset opposition who want to accelerate the accords
have announced that they will vote against Netanyahu's policies.
	   New elections would likely put the peace negotiations on hold,
and Palestinian officials have accused Netanyahu of using his
latest political crisis to end the peace process.
	   Since taking office in May 1996, Netanyahu's administration has
been plagued with scandal and political infighting. Four Cabinet
ministers have resigned and his eight-party coalition has struggled
to stay intact despite differences on how to manage the peace
process, which has hit one crisis after another.
	   Several politicians have said they would challenge Netanyahu for
the premiership in the next elections. Opposition Labor party
leader Ehud Barak is consider the front-runner. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, a charismatic former armed forces chief-of-staff is
also expected to enter politics before the next race, either as
Barak's deputy or as part of a new centrist party.
	   Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said he was unconcerned about
polls that show Barak leading Netanyahu by a statistically
insignificant 5 percent.
	   ``All I can say is that Netanyahu started the campaign in 1996
being 25 points behind Peres,'' Bar-Illan said, referring to former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, beaten by Netanyahu in a tight race in
1996.
	   Several lawmakers from Likud, including Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, on Sunday called on Netanyahu and Barak to compromise
and join forces in a unity government. Barak has rejected the idea,
and Netanyahu has avoided it.
	   Other legislation up before the Knesset on Monday includes a
bill that would reverse the current electorate system of directly
electing the prime minister and government-sponsored legislation
which could effectively block the appointments of Reform or
Conservative Jews to local religious councils.

Laos, once bombed by US, disapproves of US bombing of Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The government of Laos, a country
heavily bombed by the United States during the Vietnam War, has
disapproved of the U.S. bombing of Iraq, the Vientiane Times
reported on Monday.
	   Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Pongsavath Boupha communicated
the government's disapproval to U.S. Ambassador Wendy Chamberlain
in a meeting on Dec. 17, the paper said.
	   He said the Lao government does not see eye to eye with the U.S.
on its decision to use force to solve the problem between the two
countries, the paper reported.
	   ``It is not in accordance with the common trend of current
international relations,'' Pongsavath said. ``All disputes between
countries should be cleared peacefully through negotiations.''
	   Laos is the most heavily bombed country in world history. The
country is still littered with unexploded bombs from a wave of U.S.
air assaults in the early 1970s aimed at eradicating North
Vietnamese military supply lines to the south, and Lao communist
guerilla forces.
	   Laos fell to the communists in 1975 and they have ruled ever
since.
	   U.S. officials are helping to train Laotians to remove the
unexploded ordinance scattered throughout the country.

Report: Indonesian students suspend protests during Islamic holy
</HEADLINE>
month

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student groups have promised to
suspend a campaign of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests
during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a news report said
Monday.
	   The decision follows calls from religious and government
organizations for peace during the month when Muslims are expected
to pray and fast. Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people
are Muslim.
	   The Indonesian Observer said the groups plan to conduct other
activities, such as distributing food to the poor.
	   However, a leading Muslim opposition figure Amien Rais has
called on students to keep staging peaceful demonstrations through
Ramadan so as to maintain pressure on the government to reform.
	   ``Without demonstrations, the status quo will reappear again. It
may even get stronger,'' the Observer quoted Rais as saying.
	   Rais, the former leader of Muhammadiyah, the country's second
largest Islamic group, said Muslims are permitted to protest during
Ramadan.
	   Thousands of students have been staging almost daily
demonstrations and street marches in Jakarta and other cities for
weeks to press their demands for greater democracy.
	   They also want former President Suharto to be sent to trial for
alleged corruption.
	   Suharto quit last May after a wave of student protests and riots
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   His successor and one time protege, President B.J. Habibie, has
promised some democratic reforms, including elections next year. He
has also ordered an investigation into Suharto's wealth.
	   However, students say Habibie's agenda for change is too slow
and too limited and have recently stepped up their protests against
him.
	   Last Thursday, at least 4,000 students attempted to storm the
Parliament building. Hundreds were injured when police and soldiers
fired on them with plastic bullets, batons and tear gas.
	   Some students attacked security personnel with bamboo sticks.
They also threw rocks and gasoline bombs.
	   Habibie has warned that the protests could lead to the breakup
of the sprawling Southeast Asian nation, the world's fourth most
populous country.
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic turmoil in
decades and has been plagued by political uncertainty as inflation,
unemployment and poverty rates climb.
	   Nine students were killed Nov. 13 in clashes with security
forces when protesters tried to march on the Parliament.

Singapore's key economic indicator down substantially in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government said Monday that Singapore's key
economic indicator _ non-oil domestic exports _ fell 6.5 percent in
November against the same month last year, presenting further
evidence that the city-state remains entrenched in its worst
economic downturn since independence.
	   The figure was lower than most analysts' expectations of a mild
November export contraction in this vulnerable economy, about two
thirds of which relies on trade.
	   Compared with the same periods in 1997, non-oil domestic exports
grew 5 percent in August and 1.7 percent in September before
slumping 5.2 percent in October.
	   Total non-oil exports in November equaled 7.52 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 4.56 billion), according to the Trade Development
Board. Total trade fell for the eighth consecutive month in
November, added the board.
	   Singapore has entered a technical recession, and looks set to
post only marginal overall growth for 1998.
	   The government has forecast an expansion of gross domestic
product this year between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, but has
warned that a full-blown recession might ensue next year.

	   In Minneapolis, Randall Cunningham threw three touchdown passes,
at least two with a broken left hand, as Minnesota clinched
home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs.
	   The win gave the Vikings (14-1) their first unbeaten record at
home since 1989 and just their second since 1976, the last time
they went to the Super Bowl.
	   Cris Carter caught his 100th touchdown pass, tying Steve Largent
for second place on the career list, Randy Moss tied an NFL record
with his 10th TD of at least 40 yards and Robert Smith ran for 101
yards after missing two games with a knee injury.
	   The 50 points against Jacksonville (10-5) gives the Vikings 530
on the season, 11 short of the record 541 scored by the 1983
Redskins.

China tries dissident amid taut security

 &UR; URGENT
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Xu sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for
subversion
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Underscoring the government's resolve to crush
dissent, a Chinese court on Monday sentenced a prominent dissident
to 13 years in prison, accusing him of trying to subvert state
power by organizing an opposition party, a human rights group said.
	   Xu's lawyer gave news of the harsh sentence to the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy in
China, said the center's director, Lu Siqing.
	   The trial was conducted in secrecy amid extremely tight
security. Xu's wife, who was told of the trial only on late Friday,
was the only person among his family and supporters allowed to
attend.
	   Xu's conviction deprives the nascent China Democracy Party of a
potent organizer and a moderate voice. He is the most influential
dissident leader to have been tried in a three-week campaign that
has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.
