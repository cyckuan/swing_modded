<HEADLINE> Roundup: Draft Accord on U.S. Private Container Terminal Faces Opposition in Bangladesh by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The draft agreement between the
Bangladeshi government and the Stevedoring Services of America Ltd.
(SSA) on a private container terminal in Chittagong Port has been
finalized recently, but further deepened the port crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 22 trade unions alliance at a meeting Tuesday
took a vow to go all out to resist the SSA in its bid to hold
ground at Chittagong Port side.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation on setting up the 500 million U.S. dollar
private container terminal in Chittagong Port lasted for about two
years. An agreement in this regard reached between the government
and SSA last year.
</P>
<P>
But due to the strong protest by the trade unions in the
Chittagong Port, the agreement could not been implemented.
Organized by 22 trade unions in the port, dock workers staged a
number of demonstrations and strikes in the past year protesting
the move for the installation of the container terminal by SSA.
</P>
<P>
In the face of resistance from some 20,000 dock workers of
Chittagong Port, the government started re-negotiation with SSA
recently and worked out new terms and conditions for a draft
agreement allowing installation of the private container port.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement contains the proposal for lease of 211
acres of land to the SSA for 30 years renewable to another 30
years, instead of previous proposition of 99 years' lease. The
revised draft agreement embodied a provision for a sort of
supervisory authority of the Chittagong Port Authority over the
SSA private container terminal.
</P>
<P>
The container port of SSA, if installed, will be equipped to
handle 600,000 containers annually.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong Port last year handled about 400,000 containers
against its capacity to handle about 200,000 containers annually
and its container cargo increased by 25 percent every year.

<HEADLINE> Applicants for Shanghai Housing Fund Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- As more and more members of the
Public Accumulation Fund for Housing Construction (PAFHC) of
Shanghai are applying for PAFHC loans, the city's PAFHC has to
rely on the municipal government for financial help.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai set up its PAFHC in May 1991, the first of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, PAFHC members applied for over 7.3 billion yuan (
about 880 million U.S. dollars) of loans, but only 5 billion yuan
(about 602 million U.S. dollars) is available. It was the
municipal government that help PAFHC to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city's PAFHC expects to collect 8 billion yuan (
about 964 million U.S. dollars), but only 1.5 billion yuan will be
available for loans. Once again, the municipal government is
taking effective financial measures to assist the PAFHC.
</P>
<P>
Sources with administration center of the PAFHC said individual
house buyers of this east China metropolis have got 20 billion
yuan (about 241 million U.S. dollars) of loans from the city's
PAFHC over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 260,000 households in the city have benefited from
the PAFHC, which enable them to buy apartment units with floor
space totaling 21 million square meters.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that "We have repeatedly said that whoever assumes
power in Taiwan, he is welcome to come to the mainland to hold
talks with us, and we can go to Taiwan as well, so long as he

Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the Taiwan issue and the complete
reunification of China are in line with the general trend of
events and the feelings of the people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The three Sino-U.S. joint communiques have stipulated correct
principles for properly handling the Taiwan issue, Jiang said,
adding that the U.S. should proceed from the general situation of
Sino-U.S. relations, adhere to the One-China policy in practice,
so as to lay a foundation for the healthy and stable development
of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urged to Train Nationals for Most Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of the United Arab
Emirates has been urged to train its nationals to enable them to do
most of the jobs currently done by expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by Khalid Zarroug, director of the
Institute of Administrative Development, according to the official
WAM news agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government encourage its nationals to be
more involved in the private sector, which he said is important for
the healthy growth of the rich-oil country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the UAE has the lowest percentage of nationals
in the country's work force, which is just 7 percent, while its
nationals account for only 38.9 percent of federal government
departments posts.
</P>
<P>
For the Gulf Arab region as a whole, nationals account for just
28 percent of the work force, whereas the remaining are expatriates
of various nationalities.

<HEADLINE> No Conflict but Competition Between Turkey and Russia: Turkish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
said on Thursday there is no conflict, but peaceful yet intense
competition between Turkey and Russia in Central Asia and Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks here on the first day of a conference of
Turkish ambassadors to countries in the region, adding Turkey has
put special emphasis on its relations with these countries where
many Turkish companies are pouring investments.
</P>
<P>
The minister paid a visit to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last
week.
</P>
<P>
The visits, in addition to the ambassadors' meeting, came amid
rising criticism within the country that Ankara has been neglecting
this neighboring region.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that following the collapse of the former Soviet
Union, there was an important opportunity for Turkey to assert
itself among the newly independent Turkic-speaking countries in the
region, but relations between Turkey and these countries have not
reached a "satisfactory" level.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes a 1,760-kilometers-long oil pipeline crossing
Georgia and linking the Azeri capital Baku with the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan will be pumping by mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
The Baku-Ceyhan pipeline deal was signed among the three
countries on the sidelines of Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit at Istanbul last November,
under the promotion of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moscow opposes the plan, arguing oil should run to a Russian
terminal for transport by tanker through Istanbul's Bosphorus
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that whether the line is finally built or not,
it's clear Russia sees Turkey as acting here as an instrument of U.
S. policy, in which Washington quietly wresting control of its
traditional sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of bringing Caspian rich oil and
natural gas resources to the world market, Cem said Turkey has been
willing to cooperate with all countries, including Russia, on
energy issues.
</P>
<P>
But he said Turkey will not allow the use of the Turkish straits
as a pipeline during transportation, citing that crashes of oil
tankers through the straits are endangering the life of 12 million
people at Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city, across the straits.
</P>
<P>
The minister viewed "ethnic separatism" and "radical religious
terrorism" as two major threats in Central Asia and Caucasus,
calling for increased cooperation on these security issues among
Turkey, countries in the region and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to enlist Russia to a "Caucasus Stability
Pact", aiming at forestalling a chaos it sees imperilling its
strategic economic and political interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The pact was raised by Turkish former President Suleyman
Demirel, a vigorous proponent of Turkish interests in the Caucasus
and Central Asia, during a visit to neighboring Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Pledges to Help Free Indian Peacekeepers in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has pledged "full cooperation" in seeking the release of over 250
Indian U.N. peacekeepers surrounded by rebels in Sierra Leone,
according to reports reaching here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Indian Prime Minister Anal
Bihari Vajpayee and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo have
requested Taylor to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"I have said to them that I will do everything within my own
strength and in whatever way I can," Taylor said at a press
briefing on Wednesday in the West African nation's capital
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone
have since early May restricted the movement of about 250 Indian
soldiers and military observers serving under the U.N. Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by surrounding their camps in Quivar and
Kailahun, near the border with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has helped win the release of about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers held hostage by the RUF rebels in early May.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Jordanians March Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Jordanians staged a
march in downtown Amman on Friday to demonstrate their solidarity
against drugs and to commemorate the World's Anti-Drug Day, which
falls on June 26.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Interior Awad Khleifat patronized the
launch of the march with the main theme of "hand in hand toward a
Jordan free of drug."
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials, including Minister of Education
Khalid Touqan and Public Security Department Director Dhahir Fawaz,
joined thousands of flag-waving and slogan-chanting people from all
walks of life in the procession.
</P>
<P>
Police officers taking part in the march said drugs are among
the primary concerns of the security authorities, as the kingdom
has been used as a major transit to European countries by
international drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The police launched a nation-wide campaign on Thursday and
Friday to crack down on drug addicts and traffickers, and seized
over 1,512 kilograms of heroine, cocaine and other drugs with a
street value of some 2.52 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers and addicts face tough penalties in the
kingdom, including imprisonment, hard labor or death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian Leader Chides Parliament for Anti-Russian Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus
on Friday criticized the country's parliament for what he
described as an attempt to undermine Lithuanian foreign policy,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus urged the lawmakers "not to shake the cornerstone of
Lithuania's foreign policy -- good relations with its neighbors,
first and foremost with Russia."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a bill passed 10 days ago that
was critical of Russia's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
"A threat from Russia is depicted as the main argument in favor
of Lithuania's joining NATO. It is a policy of old barricades,
negative and inflexible, running contrary to national interests,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"One should search for common interests in relations with
Russia,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Euroatlantic drive and good relations with Russia
are compatible things, although "lots of tough questions" have yet
to be settled, Adamkus said.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, the Baltic state's parliament adopted a bill
requiring Russian compensation for material damage inflicted on
Lithuania during the 50 years of Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
Moscow was angered by the bill and a delegation of the Russian
lower house, the State Duma, called off a visit to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian and two other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. The three
countries declared independence following the disintegration of
the Soviet Union in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Holds Talks with Azerbaijan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAKU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, held talks
with Azerbaijan President Geidar Aliyev to discuss bilateral
relations, the international situation and other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The talks proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere,
according to sources who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev first extended a warm welcome to Li, who is on an
official goodwill visit to Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said the Azerbaijan government, National Assembly and
people treasure their friendship with China, and the Azerbaijan
people always sympathized with the Chinese people even in the
times of the former Soviet Union. When China and the former Soviet
Union were at odds and China was treated with injustice, the
Azerbaijan people still held that truth was on the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, friendship
between the Azerbaijan and Chinese peoples has grown further, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said both Azerbaijan and China treasure independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations should grow at a higher speed, in a
broader scale and at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Li to convey his invitation to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to visit Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng conveyed Jiang's cordial regards to Aliyev, saying
China sets great store by its friendly relations and cooperation
with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with Aliyev on accelerating the growth of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said China stands for multi-polarization and goes against
uni-polarization.
</P>
<P>
He said uni-polarization means one or two countries can
practice hegemonism and power politics by the dint of their
strength, and can put their own interests above that of the
overwhelming majority of the countries in the world. Thus the
world can in no way enjoy peace and development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all countries constitutes the major contents of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China always maintains
that ethnic problems of a country are it's internal affairs and
should be solved by its own government and people, and no other
countries have the right to interfere, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said he agreed with what Li said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Azerbaijan adhered, adheres and will adhere
to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Aliyev and Li met with journalists and
answered questions raised by them.

The funds will be directed to studies of environmental
evaluation and to the modernization and updating of the plants,
said the consortium general manager Francisco Dulanto Swayne.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian firm and its German partner Oiltaking obtained
recently the concession for the operation of almost 2,000
kilometers of polypipes and 19 terminals that belonged to
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia (UPFB).
</P>
<P>
"This operation is very important, because GMP will take over
the operation of the fuels warehouses existing in Bolivia, which
can contain 600,000 barrels of hydrocarbons, added Dulanto.
</P>
<P>
This represents 60 percent of the distribution of fuel in the
country, said Dulanto, and with this concession the users will be
permitted free access to the terminals and ducts, avoiding in this
way the formation of monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The 12 million dollar bid made by GMP to the Peruvian
government surpassed the 11 million dollar auction base price.

<HEADLINE> Scientists to Announce Finishing of Decoding Human Genome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua ) -- Two separate research centers
are expected to announce on Monday that they have finished
decoding the human genome
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in the publicly funded Human Genome Project
and at the private company Celera Genomics Inc., will announce the
historic achievement, which is regarded as important as an man's
walking on the moon.
</P>
<P>
News conferences will be held in Washington, and announcements
are also expected in London at the Sanger Center, where some of
the decoding work is being conducted.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project, which was launched in 1990, will
report that it has completed a "working draft" of the human genome,
which contains the genetic sequence of an estimated 90 percent of
the sequence arranged in near perfect order on a genetic map.
</P>
<P>
Celera is expected to announce that it has assembled the 3.5
billion letters of genetic code into their natural order.
</P>
<P>
The genetic blueprint of the human body is like a string of
letters representing the four substances that make up every gene:
adenine, thymine, guanine and cystosine, referred to simply as A,
T, G and C.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that knowing the sequence of letters that make
up all DNA in humans opens an era in which the most fundamental
causes of disease can be understood and targeted treatments can be
developed.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project is an international consortium
supported mostly by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the
Wellcome Trust, a philanthropic organization based in London.
Celera Genomics Inc. is a private company based in Rockville,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
After completing the draft map of human chromosomes, scientists
will turn their work to annotation: learning the function of every
gene and how genes relate to one another.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Unhappy With Turkish President's Remarks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' government Friday expressed
its unhappiness with the uncompromising statements by Turkish
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer on the issue of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who Friday concluded his
two-day visit to Turkish Cypriot area in northern Cyprus, demanded
recognition of the Turkish Cypriot regime as the only way to settle
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot be optimistic when one hears statements of this
kind, nor can one see any prospect for the new round of talks,"
Cyprus' government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said at his daily
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the absence of a solution "is due to the
intransigence of the Greek Cypriot side."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, backed by Turkey, insists
on a confederal solution on the basis of "two separate states" in
the island, which is contrary to U.N. resolutions and decisions
calling for a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island, following a coup engineered by the
military junta ruling Greece at the time.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983 which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Greek and Turkish communities have already
completed two rounds of proximity talks under U.N. auspices in an
effort to find a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks is due to start on July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication that the Turkish side has changed its
policy but we cannot preempt the outcome of the talks nor can we
consider Mr Sezer's remarks as his final word," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus' government will evaluate the Turkish positions
as these will be presented at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"If Denktash insists on recognition of his so-called state as a
precondition for a solution, then there cannot be an agreed
settlement," Papapetrou stressed.

<HEADLINE> Syria Ready to Resume Peace Talks with Israel: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Syria is ready to resume peace
talks with Israel at any time on condition that such talks be based
on the pre-1967 border lines, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
said Friday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Bashar al-Assad assured (U.N. Secretary-General Kofi) Annan
on Thursday of Syria's readiness to resume the talks with Israel at
any time," Shareh told reporters at the Damascus International
Airport while seeing off Annan, who wound up his multi-leg Middle
East tour.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the border lines of June 4, 1967 are the basic
issue that allows for no bargaining," Shareh quoted Bashar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Thursday afternoon on a one-day visit to
Syria, met with Syria's new ruler Bashar al-Assad on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Bashar pledged to continue cooperation with
the United Nations, with a view to establishing a fair and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bashar also reaffirmed Syria's support to Lebanon's just demands
for full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territories. Syria is the
major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shareh recalled his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Cairo on June 7, during which Albright
asserted the necessity of resuming the stalled Syrian-Israeli
talks.
</P>
<P>
"She asked me clearly to convey to President Hafez al-Assad, who
passed away on June 10, that it was necessary to put the Geneva
summit between Assad and U.S. President Bill Clinton behind us," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We want a new start to help sustain the peace process between
Syria and Israel," Shareh quoted Albright as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton-Assad Geneva summit, held on March 26, failed to
make any breakthrough in restarting the Syrian-Israeli talks, which
broke off early January after two rounds of talks in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"We hope for the resumption of the peace talks on the basis of
the Madrid peace conference and the land-for-peace principle," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their peace talks last December in
Washington after a nearly four-year hiatus. However, the talks have
been suspended since early January due to differences over the
return of Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to regain the Golan Heights in full, but Israel
insists on retaining the northeastern part of Tiberias Lake
connected with the plateau.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges for Implementation of U.N. Resolutions 242, 338 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Friday the United Nations has taken a positive step toward the
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 425, and more
efforts should be made to enforce resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh before departure, Annan said the U.N. is interested in the
implementation of all its resolutions, especially those related to
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"We took a positive step toward the implementation of the (U.N.
Security Council) resolution 425," which calls for immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, "we have to make more efforts to enforce the
resolutions 242 and 338 and establish a fair and comprehensive
peace in the region on the basis of the land-for-peace principle,"
Annan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He promised to work together with the parties concerned to this
end.
</P>
<P>
"Syria enjoys firm and powerful institutions as shown in the
current smooth power transfer," Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
"Bashar told me that if there are serious and positive proposals
for peace, the freeze of the peace talks (with Israel) will end.
This is a very important message," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I leave Syria now after holding encouraging talks with Dr.
Bashar al-Assad at this crucial juncture of the peace process,"
Annan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Annan held talks here on Thursday with Bashar al-Assad, the
nominee for the Syrian presidency, on the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks and the Lebanese-Israeli borders.

During the talks, Bashar made it clear that Syria is ready for
the resumption of the peace talks with Israel at any time, Annan
said, adding "Bashar is aware of the historic opportunity for
playing a role to achieve peace. I'm sure he will play such role."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off early January due to
the dispute over Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. While Syria demands
for full Israeli withdrawal from the strategic plateau, Israel
insists on maintaining control over the northeastern coast of the
Tiberias Lake, Israeli's main sources of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Annan left here Friday afternoon after a one-day visit to Syria,
the last leg of his Mideast tour that has taken him to Iran,
Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi Friday welcomed Greece's entry into the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and praised Athens for its
efforts to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an event organized by the Athens University, Prodi,
who arrived here Friday, described Greece's EMU membership as an
historic decision.
</P>
<P>
Following six-year efforts made by the Greek government,
Greece was formally declared the 12th member of the EMU at the
European Union (EU) summit in Portugal on June 19 and will join
the euro zone on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
There was now a climate of stability and also a feeling of
confidence in Greek economic policy, he said, adding that the
Greek government-led by Costas Simitis gained this confidence
through the right combination of political measures and its
consistent application of convergence program, especially after
1995.
</P>
<P>
He urged Greece to continue its reform policy and meet the
challenges the country will face in coming years.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the spearhead of these challenges was
competitiveness and for this to be achieved, Greece had to make
structural reforms, reduce the size of its public debt and
interest rates as well as to restructure the country's social
security system.

<HEADLINE> Russia Voices "Great Regret" on Excluding Yugoslavia from Security Council Meeting on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday voiced "great
regret" on the Security Council decision not to allow Yugoslavia
to participate in the Council discussion of the Balkan problem,
and the Council discussion without the Yugoslav participation "is
nonsense."
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, the Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations, told the Security Council meeting that he was "
with great regret to evaluate what has just happened at the
Council."
</P>
<P>
"The policy of certain countries to isolate Yugoslavia from
participation not only in today's meeting, but on the whole in the
process of the settlement in the Balkans," he said. "This runs
against the spirit of the U.N. Charter, its purpose and principles
and the task facing the Security Council and the international
community."
</P>
<P>
"According to the Article 31 of the U.N. Charter, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) has a right to participate in this
discussion on the equal footing with other Member States of the
United Nations if they made request," he said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Article 32 of the U.N. Charter, even a state
that is not in the United Nations has a right to participate in
the consideration at the Security Council" of the situation where
that state is located, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, "the FRY is the country directly influenced by the
problem" under discussion at the Security Council Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To discuss the Balkan problem without Yugoslavia is nonsense,
" he said. "The meeting of the Security Council on the Balkans
without the participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
loses its practical meaning."
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned of the fact that the International Tribunal
for Former Yugoslavia continues to be used as a political
instrument," he said in firm opposition to what he called "the
destructive attempt to isolate the FRY."
</P>
<P>
Such an attempt will do damage to the settlement of the Balkan
problem and to the United Nations as a universal organization, he
said. "A very dangerous precedent" has been created when states
are excluded from the Security Council meeting "for political
reasons."
</P>
<P>
Covering up one's mouth is not the best way to discuss
international problems at the Security Council, he said. "Even a
defendant has a right to defend his or her position."
</P>
<P>
Russia, China, Namibia and Ukraine voted in favor of allowing
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, to participate at the Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, Canada, France, Malaysia, Netherlands, the United
Kingdom and the United States voted against, and Argentina,
Jamaica, Mali and Tunisia voted in abstentions.

<HEADLINE> NATO Links Weaponry Cache to KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Friday linked a large
cache of weapons found last week to the Kosovo Liberation Army(KLA)
. The weaponry cache included mortars, missiles, mines and machine
guns.
</P>
<P>
Major Scott Slaten, a NATO spokesman, said that documents found
at the cache site indicated that the weapons belonged to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, according to reports from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The documents contained names and other evidence as to
ownership of the weapons and would be investigated by the United
Nations, according to the major.
</P>
<P>
The weaponry stash was the largest found since the NATO-led
multinational peacekeeping force entered the Yugoslav province in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were found on June 16 near Klecka, about 20
kilometers southwest of Pristina, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Slaten said that there was no evidence that Agim Ceku, the
former Kosovo Liberation Army commander who now heads the Kosovo
Protection Corps, knew of the weaponry cache.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Protection Corps is an armed force set up by many
former Kosovo Liberation Army members under the auspices of NATO
and NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
If NATO established a link between Ceku and the weaponry cache,
demand would arise to have the ethnic Albanian removed from the
head position of the Kosovo Protection Corps.
</P>
<P>
Ceku himself denied knowledge of the weapons and he asserted
that his troops had turned in all the weapons as called for by the
Kosovo crisis settlement.
</P>
<P>
The weapons, stashed in several concrete bunkers near Ceku's
former headquarters, included large quantities of mortars, anti-
tank rocket launchers, missiles, mines, heavy machine guns and
boxes of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, NATO and NATO-led peacekeepers declared
that the Kosovo Liberation Army had complied with the order to
hand in all their weapons. On September 20, NATO agreed to
reorganize the Kosovo Liberation Army into what became known as
the Kosovo Protection Corps.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials suggested that some of the weapons could have
been used in recent attacks against the ethnic Serbs in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Russia Approves Draft Information Security Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Security Council on
Friday approved a draft doctrine on information security, the top
advisory body's secretary, Sergei Ivanov, said.
</P>
<P>
The document will be published after further improvement, the
Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin, who chaired a council meeting on the
topic in the Kremlin, stressed the great importance of information
technology at the threshold of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the morrow of the world politics and
economy will be determined by information resources," he said. "
The future of our country also depends on the solution of problems
in their sphere."
</P>
<P>
Putin also repeatedly emphasized the importance of observing
the principle of freedom of expression, which "is a major element
of democratic society," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Other major components of the doctrine call for support for
domestic producers and protection of state secrets against the
backdrop that "the state has lost the possibilities of informing
society," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the creation of an "appropriate state mechanism" to
deal with information security.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also called for"
appropriate information support for the country's "active foreign
policy."

<HEADLINE> Road Blockade Still Domestic Matter: EU  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on Friday
that the highway blockade was still a domestic matter of Austria
though it was blocking transit traffic between Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Austria has informed highway users of deviation routes after
members from a group called Transitforum Tirol massed on the
highway to prevent anyone from passing through the Brenner tunnel
on the border between Austria and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The road blockers were protesting against increasing traffic on
the highway that runs through a delicate Alpine environment.
</P>
<P>
The protest, that will last two days, coincides with the long
Roman Catholic holiday of Corpus Christi and several days prior to
the scheduled European Union transport ministers council that is
expected to discuss on highway tolls.
</P>
<P>
EU member states are supposed to abide by the community rule of
free movement of people and goods. Germany and Italy raised
concerns over the blockade on the ground that Austria is breaching
the free movement rule.
</P>
<P>
Austrian protesters are mad over an EU opposition to the
Austrian imposition of high tolls on the Brenner tunnel passage in
an effort to curb heavy-duty truck traffic.
</P>
<P>
The EU argued that the measure of imposing high tolls
discriminates against foreign carriers while the Transitforum
Toril group retorted that traffic of heavy-duty trucks has doubled
since 1990 affecting the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
Austria has increased passage tolls twice in the past 10 years
due to the pressure from the Tyrol province that claimed to have
monitored an increased traffic after non-EU Switzerland imposed
weight limits on long-haul trucks.
</P>
<P>
The same group also blocked the Brenner tunnel in 1995 and 1998
and complained about EU opposition toward local measures aimed at
protecting the environment and the quality of life in the Alpines.
</P>
<P>
The highway blockade could put Austria once again into a
political row that had soured the European Union summit by heads
of state and government at Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal, early
this week.
</P>
<P>
Austria, angry at the political sanctions imposed against it
due to its incorporation of the far-right Freedom Party into the
governing coalition, held out against a savings interest tax
package. Austria only agreed to a much-watered-down protocol
after the two-day summit was supposed to end on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Carry Out Plan to Substitute Illegal Cultivates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana
said Friday his government decided to carry out a plan to
substitute illicit cultivates in Colombia and effect social
programs, designed with the help of the communities.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to work with the communities within the 'Plan
Colombia," as we have proposed, and to design plans in which there
will be a direct participation to carry out these programs, said
Pastrana during a press conference at the presidential offices.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the 3.75 billion dollars to be invested
in the next three years will not solve the drug problem, if no
special importance is given to an alternate development and to
social investment programs.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana highlighted the "chains of productive development" as
a tool to recover the agriculture activity and the cultivation
that lost their importance in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Themes such as the productive chains, that are being
complemented with the Agriculture Ministry, will strengthen this
kind of projects for the rural workers to see a true alternate
project that will generate substantial resources," said Pastrana.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Pact to be Implemented in S. Africa in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The free trade agreement of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) could be
implemented by September this year, South African President Thabo
Mbeki said in the port city of Durban on Friday
</P>
<P>
"We expect that in South Africa it could go into force by
September 1 this year," Mbeki said, while addressing a large group
of local and international reporters attending the Southern
African Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said most of the parliaments of member states in the SADC
have already ratified the trade pact, which will allow for free
movement of people and goods and promote trade among countries in
the region.  He said there have been extensive negotiations
to finalize the agreement, which is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the pact started in the early 1990s and it was
signed in 1996 and ratified by South Africa earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The problems foreseen in the implementation are all practical
considerations, such as the translation of thousands of pages of
the agreement into Portuguese to accommodate the need of
Portuguese-speaking nations of Mozambique and Angola.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said
countries facing problems with the September implementation could
implement it later in January next year.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Opposition Supports Govt's Policy of Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Angolan opposition
Democratic Social Party (PSD) reaffirmed here on Friday that his
party will support without reserve the policy of pardoning the
repentant rebels offered by the Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
According to Bengui Pedro Joao, the president's position on the
policy once again showed the "democratic character" of the Angolan
policies and also an evidence that there does not exist radicalism
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is also a correct way leading to the reunion of the
Angolan peoples, Bengui Joao said in an interview with the Angolan
National Radio (RNA).
</P>
<P>
The president has mentioned the possibility of pardoning the
veteran rebel leader Jonas Savimbi when he made a speech in the
central coast Province of Bengo.
</P>
<P>
The president still called Savimbi the "principal responsible"
for the Angolan civil war. But, he said that all the savimbists
heading for the abandonment of arms will be well received by the
government, perhaps including "Savimbi himself."
</P>
<P>
Since the Angolan civil war recrudesced in mid 1999, the
Angolan government has decided not to deal with Savimbi any
longer, saying that the rebel leader had failed to keep his
promise made before the 1992 general elections and then refused to
fulfill the Lusaka protocol signed by the two sides in 1994,
according to local analysts.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Attend OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will attend the summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) due to be held
in Togo from July 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation Leonardo Simao, the Noticias, a Mozambican leading
newspaper, reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Simao as saying that Mozambique does not see
any reason to boycott the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has previously urged the OAU member
states not to attend the forthcoming meeting in Lome, the capital
of Togo, on the account that the Togolese government supported the
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi, violating the resolution of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Simao said the Angolan government may have its own reasons, but
 "we should take into account of the overall interests of African
countries." "At present," he said, "We should avoid the
split-up of OAU."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed, "What we should do is to "ensure
the full implementation of the U.N. sanctions on UNITA instead of
triggering new contradictions among African countries".
</P>
<P>
Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chicote said on Tuesday
that his country will not attend the OAU summit , if it is to be
held in Togo. He denied that his government's position could be
described as a boycott, saying: "it is not a boycott".
</P>
<P>
Angola has also asked member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to boycott the Lome summit.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, only Namibia and Cape Verde have responded to
Angola's call, refusing to attend the OAU summit.

efforts of the mixed commission for advancing cooperation, said
Georgy Mamedov,the deputy Russian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is Russia's key economic partner in South America, and
the two countries take a similar approach to the system of
international relations in the 21st century, the Interfax news
agency quoted Mamedov as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Putin expressed the hope that bilateral
trade turnover, which stood at 1 billion U.S. dollars last year,
could be doubled, Mamedov said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Brazil supports the U.N. General Assembly
resolution on keeping the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM)
in place.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been seeking to revise the ABM to allow
for its plan of building a national missile defense system. The
plan has encountered staunch opposition from around the world,
including Washington's European allies.
</P>
<P>
Maciel arrived here Wednesday to co-host the first session of
the joint commission on high-level cooperation. He signed a
partnership accord with Russian Prime Minister Kasyanov on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China Voices Deep Regret Over Excluding Yugoslavia from Security Council Meeting on Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China Friday voiced its "
deep regret" over a decision by the U.N. Security Council not to
allow the head of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations to
speak at the Council meeting on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council took a vote on whether to allow
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, to take part in the Council discussion on the
Balkans. Four voted in favor, seven against and 4 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told that Council meeting that "We'd like to
express our deep regret with regard to the decision just made by
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation is of the view that the FRY (Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia) is an important country of the Balkan
region, it is also a direct state concerned and it is also a party
to the Dayton Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter whether we agree or not agree with the
policy of the FRY," he said. "However, to isolate to exclude the
FRY in the Security Council, and not to allow the FRY to take a
floor in the Security Council will not contribute to the solution
of the Balkan problem."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should not deprive a sovereign state of
its right to state its position at will," he said. "This kind of
action runs counter to the spirit of the United Nations Charter."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party Official Refuses to be Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- National Treasurer of Zambia's
ruling party Ben Mwila said here Friday that he cannot be
suspended by the party's National Secretary Michael Sata without
being summoned to the National Executive Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
Ben Mwila, an influential figure in the Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), was suspended Thursday on account of
violating party regulations.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, also environmental minister in the government, told a
news briefing that he has not been suspended because the party's
constitution states that any member of NEC should be summoned to a
NEC meeting where views could be heard.
</P>
<P>
"I am actually not suspended. The MMD constitution states that
I have to be summoned to the meeting of NEC because I have a right
to air my views before they can suspend me," he said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Sata has no right to suspend any person who has
been elected by the convention.
</P>
<P>
"We have started on a wrong note. The constitution is clear and
 straightforward," he added.
</P>
<P>
The party treasurer said the constitution empowers the national
 secretary to suspend ordinary members not NEC members and "in my
case it's the NEC which should suspend me".
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, this suspension technically speaking is not on
because I have not flouted any NEC decisions or directives at
all," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the allegation that he has been suspended from the party
for printing duplicate party membership cards to influence the
electoral college, Mwila said the allegation is "fake" and the
only issue which could have led to the suspension is his
declaration to stand for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would consider resigning from his ministerial
post, Mwila said he could not do so, as he does not have any
problem with his colleagues in the government.
</P>
<P>
Mwila has 10 days to exculpate himself, according to a
disciplinary letter on June 22 signed by Sata.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Sata charged that in the past 18 months, Mwila
has been involved in anti-party activities that has greatly
destabilized the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidacy for the MMD presidency on May 26,
paving the way for him to run for the country's presidency in the
general elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest persons with a business
empire covering manufacturing, construction, finance and
fertilizers, helped incumbent President Chiluba defeat former
President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections. Now, he is seen as
a leading candidate to rival Chiluba in next year's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba indicated that he would ensure that Mwila does not
become the president and MMD said it is not the time now to start
the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> France to Mint Colored Coins to Commemorate Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- France will mint its first colored
coins to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the legendary
writer and pilot Antoine Saint-Exupery, said the Monnaie de France
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three coins include two 10-franc pieces made partly of
silver, one with a colored portrait of the hero of Saint-Exupery's
novel "the Little Prince" on it and the other with a head portrait
of the writer himself on it.
</P>
<P>
The third coin is a 100-franc piece made partly of gold, which
has also a figure of "Little Prince" on it.
</P>
<P>
Written in 1943, "the Little Prince" is Saint-Exupery's best
known novel and one of the most translated literary works in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central city of Lyon, which is the hometown of
Saint-Exupery, will organize a grand festival from Saturday till
next Thursday to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Considered as one of France's greatest writers in the 20th
century, Saint-Exupery was born into an old noble family in Lyon
on June 29, 1900. He died in unclear circumstances during a
reconnaissance flight into Nazi-occupied France on July 31, 1944.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of aircraft and hot air balloons, including the
Mirage 2000, Jaguar and Rafale modern combat aircraft, will
present flying shows in Lyon during the anniversary ceremony,
which also features films, exhibitions, dramas and book shows.

<HEADLINE> Former Canadian Diplomat Arrested on Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A former Canadian diplomat was
arrested in Toronto on Thursday on charge of drug smuggling, the
Global and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Wardle, 42, was charged with trafficking 8.5 kilograms
of cocaine with a street value of more than one million Canadian
dollars (about 677,200 U.S. dollars) into Israel while traveling
with a diplomatic passport, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The former diplomatic administrative officer, who is now
employed by a technology firm in Toronto, may have concealed the
drugs in a secure diplomatic bag, the paper quoted police and
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Wardle will face a possible life sentence, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The charge, first ever of its kind in Canada, came after a
joint probe of three and a half years by police in Canada, Israel
and the Netherlands in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of the United States.

<HEADLINE> France Not to Send More Peacekeepers to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- France will not send more troops to
join the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), said
the French Foreign Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Today, it is no," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret when she was asked if France would participate in a
reinforcement of UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
She quoted sources of the United Nations as saying that the
United Nations will add no more than 900 soldiers to UNIFIL, which
now has 4,500 soldiers including 249 from France.
</P>
<P>
But France will send a team of "specialists" to UNIFIL, Agence
France-Presse quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has agreed to send 650 soldiers to UNIFIL and Sweden is
also considering contributing troops, according to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL will be re-deployed in Lebanon's border area with Israel,
which was evacuated by Israeli troops on May 24.
</P>
<P>
France has insisted that Lebanon must deploy its government
forces in the border area before a re-deployment of UNIFIL can be
done. Lebanon's border area with Israel is now controlled by the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah Shiite Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S. Interference in Domestic Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday condemned the U.S. Congress for what it described as
continued "blatant interference" in Russia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry made the condemnation in a statement apparently in
response to a resolution passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives on the freedom of speech in Russia, reported the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. resolution uses "hackneyed allegations, used since the
times of Cold War" to accuse Russia of regular intimidation of
journalists, pressure on the independent mass media and censorship,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. lawmakers, while displaying such care for
Russia's mass media, did not show any concern over the fact that
the United States virtually kept mum about conclusions of such
organizations as the Amnesty International on NATO military crimes
in Kosovo and had no comments on unending U.S. air raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Russian leadership will consistently protect
its national interests.

<HEADLINE> China Says to Abide by WTO Rules While Enjoying Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The balance between rights and
obligations is the fundamental principle of China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's top negotiator said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO is a rule-based multilateral trade organization, and
China is willing to abide by WTO rules while enjoying its rights
as a WTO member," Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation,
told the 10th session of the Working Party on China's WTO
accession.
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept further requests that China should
undertake obligations exceeding those for ordinary WTO members,
nor will we allow the rights that we should enjoy to be impaired
or even deprived of," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that WTO members must respect China's rights in the
WTO if they expect China to fully honor its commitments. When
China is able to enjoy all the normal rights as a WTO member,
China will effectively enforce its commitment under the WTO
agreement and the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Long thanked WTO members, especially those from the developing
world, which believe that the WTO agreement should apply to China
on a normal basis. "Their position will help safeguard the
multilateral trading system and to defend the principle of
fairness and equity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he agreed to the summary made by chairman of the
Working Party on China, Jean Pierre Girard, that important
progress had been made on the multilateral process of China's WTO
entry during the current session, adding that a good momentum had
emerged from the multilateral negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
After this session, Long said, China will continue its
consultations with the few WTO members yet to conclude bilateral
talks with China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the next Working Party meeting in
July will accelerate the work on drafting all the multilateral
documents so as to realize "the common objective of China's
accession to the WTO".

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Okays Bill on Upper House Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) on Friday approved a bill tabled by President
Vladimir Putin on restructuring the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill, clearing the State Duma by a vote of 308-86 with
three abstentions in the third and final reading, is expected to
face a tough struggle in getting approval from regional governors
in the upper house, the Federation Council. The governors would be
deprived of their seats in the upper house if it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
Although it is predicted that the Federation Council will
reject the bill, the Duma can override the upper house vote with a
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
However, some observers believe that a two-thirds majority in
the lower house might be unrealistic because that would risk the
support of regional leaders for the house.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the legislature and governor of each region
will choose two people to represent them in the Federation Council,
while under the current system, the upper house is consisted of
governors and legislative speakers themselves.
</P>
<P>
The bill is one of three proposals aimed at strengthening the "
vertical power structure" which separates the legislative and
executive branches as regional leaders will no longer be allowed
to double as federal legislators.
</P>
<P>
The other two bills, which will grant the president the right
to dismiss governors who violate federal law and will hand
regional governors similar power over mayors, will be debated in
the second reading in the State Duma next week.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council, to convene next week, has 14 days to
review the bill which will be automatically passed if the upper
house fails to take it up by the deadline.

<HEADLINE> 18 Killed in Kashmir As Fierce Encounters Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fierce encounters" continued at various places in north
Kashmir for the third day on Friday as security forces and local
police stepped up their efforts to flush out militants across the
militancy-torn northwestern state, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine people were killed in Kashmir from Wednesday night
to Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Four army personnel, including a major, were killed when
militants ambushed an army search party in Hafruda forest in the
frontier district of Kupwara on Thursday evening, the PTI quoted
official sources in Srinagar, capital of Jammu and Kashmir, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The troops fired back and killed three unidentified militants
in the gun-battle, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Hafruda forest, a major target for security forces' combing
operation, also witnessed a fierce encounter from Saturday to

<TEXT>
<P>
Banepa, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A two-day photo show of the
cultural and natural heritage of China kicked off Friday in Banepa,
about 25 km east of here.
</P>
<P>
The photo show was organized "in order to further deepen the
Nepalese people's understanding of China, especially of China's
cultural and tourist resources", said Zhang Tiegen, counselor of
Chinese Embassy, at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"With the mutual understanding between the two peoples growing
stronger and deeper, the foundations of our friendship will be
more and more consolidated," said Zhang Tiegen.
</P>
<P>
On display are 50 photos that demonstrate the natural and
cultural landscapes in China from different aspects. Besides, some
Chinese folk handicrafts such as woven straw patchworks and shell
pictures are also on show.
</P>
<P>
Two documentaries on China's scenic sites and cultural
traditions and two feature films representing the life of
contemporary Chinese people are to be shown to introduce the
Chinese culture to the Nepalese people from several aspects.

<HEADLINE> War in South Asia Must Be Avoided: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Parvez Musharraf Friday said that war in the region must
be avoided as no sane person can think of war in this modern age.
</P>
<P>
"The war should be avoided through potent deterrence and
diplomacy and we should engage India on the issue of Kashmir for
bringing permanent peace in the region without compromising our
sovereignty", Musharraf declared while delivering a speech
enunciating his views on Pakistan's foreign policy at the Pakistan
Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) here.
</P>
<P>
He identified five determinants which shapes the foreign policy
of Pakistan, including security of Pakistan, its economic
interests, international concerns including CTBT, its own
ideological interests and upholding of principles on issues like
Kashmir with which, he said, "we are concerned since our
independence".
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the security issue is the primary concern of
Pakistan, he said "there is a threat to Pakistan from India. The
threat is not Kashmir alone. It goes little beyond that". "As far
as Kashmir is concerned, the issue is not only a threat to our
security interest but also upholding of our principles," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Continent Hopeful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The on-going Southern African
economic summit gives a strong message to the world that there is
hope for the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the summit, which is being held in Durban under
the aegis of the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, derided
criticism that Africa has become a "hopeless continent".
</P>
<P>
The summit came against the background that a new flurry of
civil unrest, war, famine, AIDS, poverty and floods has fuelled
international perceptions that the future of the African continent
is at stake.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, there are so many reasons for "Africa fatigue" or
"Africa pessimism". The continent, with 10 percent of the world's
population, produces only 1 percent of its GDP, and the
backwardness is worsened by persistent conflicts, which in turn
flare up because of poverty. The situation is complicated by the
rapid spread of AIDS, corruption and environmental catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Hence the question: how can this vicious circle be turned
around to realize South African President Thabo Mbeki's vision of
a genuine "African Renaissance"?
</P>
<P>
And, to drive this renaissance, can Africa mirror the success
of East Asia's "Tiger economies" with its own "Lions"?
</P>
<P>
The summit, which brought together over 1,000 delegates from 50
 countries for three days to discuss the region's future, offered
Africa an opportunity to underline its plight, while demonstrating
to the world that "lions" of Africa would ultimately sit up and
roar.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, speaking at the opening of the summit on Wednesday,
called on African countries to capitalize on the mood to favor
"extraordinary and sustained measures" to promote development and
growth on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Africa should not disappoint those in industrial countries who
want to see it succeed, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Africa is not a land of despair and further work is needed to
change its image and create a different view of the continent and
the wide array of opportunities available -- this is the view
echoed by many participants.
</P>
<P>
Participants pointed to the fact that some African "lions" had
already begun to roar. In the past five years, countries such as
Ghana, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire and even Mozambique have recorded
average growth rates well over 5 percent, topping global league
tables.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Senegal, Mali and Mauritius are models of African
political stability and economic development which have attracted
a large amount of foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Continent Hopeful (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the appalling problems left by apartheid, South
Africa's developing "Lion economy" is indeed poised to roar.
</P>
<P>
Britain's minister for Africa Peter Hain noted that successful
African "Lion" economies have a common agenda of economic reform
and modernization, good governance, eliminating corruption,
improving public services and working to overcome the problems of
small scale through regional and global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 30 years ago when the countries of East Asia
started on their spectacular growth, the present global markets
for goods and capital are considerably larger and more integrated,
so Africa's future "Lion" economies have a wider range of markets
to export into and a deeper pool of international capital to draw
upon, Hain stressed.
</P>
<P>
African countries could not afford to let the opportunity slip
through their fingers. As a result, participants took advantage
of the summit to boost regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One of the outstanding achievements was the signing of the
historic Lubombo trans-frontier trilateral protocol, which will
see borders between Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland
relinquished in support of a socioeconomic upliftment and
improving regional ecosystems management. The agreement was lauded
as an important step in regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As Africa is geared up to catch the global trend of
development, the international community is coming to Africa's
rescue, although slowly and far from enough.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed at the summit that Britain is leading the
international field in seeking up to 100 percent debt forgiveness
for the poorest countries, most of them in Africa.
</P>
<P>
As part of the debt-relief effort, the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank pledged to write Zambia off 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
The United States also reportedly offered to write off millions
of dollars of African debt, although under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Also at the summit, the first phase of a European Union
1.6-billion- dollar development program for poverty relief and
infrastructural improvements in South Africa was launched.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from developed countries agreed that the rich world
cannot afford to abandon Africa and should rise to the challenge
together with Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In partnership with the rest of the global community, Africa's
leaders can make their 'Lions' roar," Hain asserted.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Receives Inquiry Report on Police Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday received an inquiry report on police corruption at the
State House, according to a press release from the President's
Office.
</P>
<P>
The report was handed over to the president by Justice Julia
Sebutinde of the Uganda High Court who headed the probe team into
the police force.
</P>
<P>
The 754-page report is a result of a year's investigation into
corruption accusations at the Uganda Police Force, said the
release, but giving no details.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that corruption is very serious in the police
force of the east African country. The Ugandan authorities have
tried to crack down on corruption in the police and the country as
a whole, but achieved little over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Ukraine Discusses Chernobyl Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 23 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer held talks Friday with Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor
Yushchenko on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and
on ways of improving bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Possible German financial aid for the closure of Chernobyl was
top on the agenda of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also discussed the preparatory work for a donor
conference of the Group of Seven most industrialized nations on
Chernobyl, scheduled for July 5 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the talks, Fischer said Ukraine's
decision to shut down Chernobyl by December 15 this year is
important for the success of the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
The international community is willing to help settle issues
left over by the closure of Chernobyl and subsequent energy
shortage, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by experts, the cost of closing the
Chernobyl power plant will be 768 million U.S. dollars. Ukraine
has received cash or commitments totaling 693 million dollars,
still lacking 75 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Germany and Europe back Ukraine's positive turn in
its direction of development and that his country is willing to
help Ukraine resolve difficulties encountered in reform and
economic development. Ukraine is a major partner of Europe, said
the German foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, who took part in the
talks, told the same press conference that Fischer and Yushchenko
discussed matters concerning the Leipzig summit between Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on
July 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk said Ukraine and Germany are ready to boost bilateral
economic and trade relations so as to forge constructive and
pragmatic bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Kiev on Thursday for a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington Reaffirm Role of U.S. Troops in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States on
Friday reaffirmed the vital role of U.S. Korea Forces (USKF)
despite the fact that last week's historic inter-Korean summit
eased tension on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It is premature at this stage to talk about the withdrawal or
reduction of the 37,000-strong USKF, said U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who arrived here Friday afternoon for a two-
day trip.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with South Korean Foreign Affairs
and Trade Minister Lee Joung-binn, Albright stressed that the
presence of the USKF is very important for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has repeatedly
urged Washington to pull its troops out of South Korea, saying
Washington had been the major obstacle to the reunification of the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In an article on June 16, one day after the inter-Korean summit,
the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper demanded the United States "
no longer stand in the way of the independent and peaceful
reunification of Korea."
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea should be
the first step to be taken by the U.S. to help the Koreans achieve
the reunification of Korea," the official Korean Central News
Agency quoted the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Albright on Friday admitted that last week's summit came at a
very important time and it is expected to bring about far-reaching
significance to stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
held their first ever summit in Pyongyang on June 13-15, and
signed a five-point joint declaration that calls for
reconciliation and envisages reunification.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed the hope that the agreement between Seoul
and Pyongyang such as the reunion of separated families will be
implemented, saying Washington strongly supports Seoul's
engagement policy toward Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will do everything to make the agreement
between the two Koreas carried out," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said "although the outcome of the recent inter-
Korean summit is hopeful and its outlook is also bright, all
problems are not resolved yet."
</P>
<P>
On Washington's proposed national missile defense (NMD) shield,
she said although the DPRK recently reconfirmed its moratorium on
missile launch tests, all problems related to the DPRK are not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"President Bill Clinton will later determine on the system in
consideration of four conditions including all threatening
situations in the world, technology, cost and the effect of arms
build-up," she said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's plan to develop the NMD shield sparked widespread
criticism across the world, including its allies in Europe, such
as France and Germany. It is feared that such a program would
trigger a new round of arms race around the world.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Albright hinted the possibility of her
meeting DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun at the ASEAN Regional
Forum in Bangkok late next month.
</P>
<P>
"You can expect it as though we have to wait and see it," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Lee Joung-binn echoed Albright's opinion on the USKF, saying
the troops are necessary as a stabilizer for peace in Northeast
Asia even after the establishment of peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he and Albright shared views on the principle of
solving the Korean affairs in an independent manner as stipulated
in the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said Seoul and Washington, in full support for the
outcome of the inter-Korean summit, agreed to closely consult each
other for the settlement of peace on the peninsula and inter-
Korean reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Albright early Friday, President Kim Dae-
jung briefed Albright on his summit talks with Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
President Kim stressed that the cooperation among South Korea,
the United States and Japan played a great role in making the
summit successful.
</P>
<P>
Close cooperation between Seoul and Washington should be
continuously maintained to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula
and to develop inter-Korean relations, Kim said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pinghu Oil and Gas Field, the
first offshore oil and gas field to go into operation in the East
China Sea, is expected to provide a daily gas supply of 400,000
cubic meters for Shanghai, the country's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established oil and gas field, close to Shanghai, is
co-funded by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the China National

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Border Encroachments to be Resolved by Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's encroachments on Lebanon's
border will be terminated by Friday, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the revelation after a second and
unscheduled meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Jerusalem on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Barak was followed by 90 minutes of talks in
Damascus with Syria's new ruler Bashar Assad in the same day.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed a reactivation of the Lebanese-Israeli joint
Armistice Commission of 1949 to handle future border problems
between the two countries, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary General wants to clean up the Lebanese-Israeli
disputes before he leaves the Middle East," Annan's spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters after the second meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed military teams from the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Israeli army will tour the
contested locations of the border to verify and remove any
violations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting was held at Annan's request and the talks
focused on the Lebanese-Israeli border because the final shaping of
the map is still causing problems, Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL command will submit a report to Annan by the end of
Friday to confirm whether or not Israel has terminated the 14
border encroachments Lebanon is complaining about, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If the report confirms the termination of the transgressions,
Lebanese army and UNIFIL teams will check on the 14 locations later
to ascertain from the Lebanese side of the border that violations
have been corrected.

<HEADLINE> Manila Keeps Communication Lines Open With Hostage Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it continues to keep the lines of communication open
with the Abu Sayyaf as it works to ensure the safe release of 21
hostages in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Press Undersecretary Mike Toledo
said chief government negotiator Secretary Robert Aventajado
remains hopeful that he can resume negotiations with the hostage
takers soon.
</P>
<P>
"Emissaries are talking to each other, parties are talking to
emissaries. The purpose of this constant opening of communication
lines is to ensure that lines are open and to get a feel of what
each party is feeling right now," Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Aventajado would not say where or when the next
meeting would take place, but noted that Aventajado is optimistic
that "it will be quite soon."
</P>
<P>
What is important, he stressed, is that communication lines are
still open.
</P>
<P>
Toledo also said Aventajado belied reports that the Abu Sayyaf
has threatened to kill some of the hostages if the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC), that is said to convene later this month
in Malaysia, will not give thorough attention to their case.
</P>
<P>
"He would like to make it clear that so far, based on our own
sources, we have not received reports that the Abu Sayyaf has
threatened to execute some of the hostages if and when the OIC
will not give full attention to the situation in Mindanao," Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
The 21 foreign hostages were abducted by the rebel group of Abu
Sayyaf from Malaysia on April 23 and moved to the southern
Philippine island province of Sulu on April 24.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Energy Sector Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's highly prospective
energy sector has attracted nearly one billion U.S. dollars in the
past four years as the sector has opened up a new horizon for
future possibilities.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Observer Friday attributed the success to two
policy decisions made by the present government: approval for
independent power generation by private sector and model
production sharing contracts with foreign oil giants for
hydrocarbon exploration.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. entrepreneurs and embassy officials in Dhaka said the
currently direct American investment alone stood at 750 million
dollars since 1995 while the amount was only 25 million dollars in
the previous 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The amount is likely to go up by several times in the next few
years, Forrest E. Cookson, president of American Chamber of
Commerce in Bangladesh, announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since June 1996, a total of 1,
256 megawatt (mw) power was added to the national grid with the
installation of seven new plants and rehabilitation of the
existing public sector plants.
</P>
<P>
Construction of seven more plants were underway and due to be
completed at different times by next year when another 1,069 mw
electricity would be added to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994-95 fiscal year, per capita electricity production
in the country was 92 kilowatt per hour (kwh), and it rose to 110
kwh in the 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The present government has so far signed agreements with four
international oil giants for gas exploration in eight out of 23
blocks while nine others have already been allocated to foreign
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Two major gas fields, Bibiana and Maulyibazar fields in Sylhet,
278 kilometers northeast of Dhaka, were discovered recently where
the deposit is yet to be assessed. But the foreign companies
believe the exploitable reserve in these fields, particularly at
Bibiana, was likely to be very high to bring about a massive
change in the country's energy sector scenario.
</P>
<P>
According to Petrobangla, the current proven reserve of gas all
over the country was 23 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of which 13 TCF
was recoverable. American company Unocal said that according to it
's estimates, in the eastern region alone, Bangladesh had a
deposit of between 30 to 50 TCF while there are huge potential in
the yet-to-be explored western region.
</P>
<P>
Yet the gas sector remained as the most politically sensitive
and debatable economic issue as politicians and experts are split
on the question of the use of the valuable natural resource.
</P>
<P>
The foreign companies and donors are constantly pursuing the
government to allow gas export for quick return of their
investments.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said Bangladesh would
decide on the export issue only after confirming 50 years of
deposit for its own consumption.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Air Passenger Rights Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A poster publicity campaign is
under way among European Union (EU) countries to increase air
travelers' awareness of their rights, reports said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, starting from Italy, enables air travelers to
have a much better understanding of their rights: under what
conditions they can complain, whom they can complain to and
whether there is a good chance of obtaining reasonable
compensation for inconvenience or for loss of time, money or
possession.
</P>
<P>
The poster, to be placed in airports, offices of airlines and
travel agencies throughout the 15-member bloc, is based on a
charter on air passenger rights in four main areas -- information
about flights and reservations, overbooking, compensation in case
of an accident and air travel as part of a package holiday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, launched by the European Commission, the
executive body of the EU, aims to make air passengers better
understand their rights under the community law and help them
exercise these rights more effectively, said EU Transport
Commissioner Loyola de Palacio.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that even with increasingly fierce
competition in the air transport market, the quality of service is
not satisfactory as many people often complain about flight delays,
overbooking and other problems.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than half of the scheduled commercial flights
within the European Union were delayed and lots of air travelers
could not board the planes they had booked due to overbooking.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Super-Jumbo Jet to Create 10,000 Jobs in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the Airbus super-
jumbo jet, A3XX, will bring 10,000 jobs to France, said French
Minister of Equipment, Transport and Lodgement Jean-Claude Gayssot
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus consortium announced on Friday that it will begin
later this year the construction of A3XX, whose body will be
assembled in Toulouse, southwest France, while its interior parts
will be fixed in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Airbus consolidates the position of Toulouse as
the center for assembling airplanes in Europe, said Gayssot.
</P>
<P>
He also said the launching of A3XX will create more jobs in a
number of European countries.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Camus, co-president of the European Airspace, Defense
and Space Company (EADS) which owns 80 percent of Airbus
consortium, said that A3XX will provide jobs for 160,000 people in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France considers the establishment of an independent
private company, Airbus Integrated Company, as an important step
in strengthening Europe's aeronautics industry, said Gayssot.
</P>
<P>
"The integrated company gives Airbus a better structure and a
more efficient organization, allowing it to give Europe a
competitive aeronautics industry," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An anti-narcotics symposium was
held here today at the Great Hall of the People, on the eve of the
International Drug Control Day, which falls June 26.
</P>
<P>
Xu Shanyan, a senior official from the China Association for
Science and Technology, made a speech at the symposium, calling on
departments concerned to adopt various methods, such as popular
science books and films, to educate Chinese citizens about the
danger of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was jointly sponsored by the China Medical
Foundation, the China Association for Science and Technology, and
several other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Ministry of Public Security shows that
China had 680,000 registered drug addicts in 1999, a rise of 85,
000 over the figure for 1998. And the number of drug addicts aged
between 17 and 35 stood at 530,000, or some 78 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Shas Leader Expected to Accompany Israeli PM to 3-Way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas
party leader Eli Yishai is expected to accompany Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to any three-way summit meeting in Washington, Israel
Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shas' decision-making body, the Council of Torah Sages, decided
that Yishai, also the minister of labor and social affairs, must
closely study the demands Israel makes in the negotiations and
brief the rabbis when he returns to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the largest ruling partner of Barak's One Israel with 17
seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament), withdrew its decision
to leave the coalition government on Thursday, putting an end to a
dragging coalition crisis that also beset Barak's efforts to push
ahead peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
One Israel promised full Shas partnership in the peace-process
decisions as one of the conditions for Shas' continued stay in the
government. Yishai met with Barak in Tel Aviv on Friday to discuss
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Construction and Housing from the National Religious
Party (NRP) Yitzhak Levy and Interior Minister Natan Sharansky from
the Yisrael Ba'aliya have not responded to Barak's invitations to
travel with him to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky met U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross on Friday. Ross
arrived in the region Thursday for another round of shuttle
diplomacy to assess the chances for an Israeli-Palestinian final-
status agreement and a summit meeting between Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky said he believes it is still too early to convene a
three-way summit to conclude a final-status agreement. He holds
that Israel must first reach consensus on what its "red lines" are
for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The NRP and Yisrael Ba'aliya, also ruling partners of One
Israel, voted for the early-elections bill calling for the
dissolution of the 15th Knesset in its first parliamentary reading
to protest Barak's intended transfer of three Arab villages near
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shas has agreed to help sink the bill as a result of the
political horse trading with the prime minister. An Israel Radio
reporter said that Yisrael Ba'aliya still intends to support the
first reading of the early-elections bill due next week.
</P>
<P>
In another development, officials at the Prime Minster's office
expect that a three-way summit in Washington would settle the
territorial dispute with the Palestinians, but it would be
difficult to solve the Jerusalem and the refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they believed the mechanism to take care of these
problems could be assembled.
</P>
<P>
Ross met Barak on Thursday night. He is scheduled to meet the
leaders of the Palestinian delegation Friday to discuss the interim
and the final status agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister wants to hold the three-way summit in
Washington immediately after July 4 as he thinks the negotiations
with the Palestinians have been exhausted.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament to Convene Saturday as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Although not all 200 senators were
elected, the House of Representatives of Thailand will be convened
Saturday as scheduled, with the deliberation of the 2001 budget
bill topping the agenda, the Thai government announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej endorsed a decree Friday calling
for the reconvention of the parliament, paving the way for the
opening of the parliamentary session Saturday after a three-month
cessation, the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled with a vote of 12 to one
Thursday that the government can issue a decree to open the
session.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was based on the Article 90 of the Constitution that
the parliament can be either jointly convened between the house
and the senate, or be separately convened, said a spokesman of the
Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the court ruled that the newly elected senators could
not convene a senate meeting until all 200 senator were elected,
citing the Constitution that the parliament consists of both the
house and the senate, leading to a political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Thailand held its first senatorial election on March 4, but so
far the 200 seats are still not fully filled because of unfair
means adopted in the election. The fourth round of senatorial
election is expected to be held soon to find the last four
finalists and enable the new senate to function.
</P>
<P>
The government hinted Thursday that it would dissolve the house
in October after the budget bill was passed and call the next
general election in December.
</P>
<P>
The six-party ruling coalition, taking power in late 1997,
enjoys a majority of 237 seats in the 385-member parliament and
must call a general election before November when its term expires.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Launches Health Program in Pasay City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
launched Friday the government's health passport program in a bid
to give the masses a better opportunity to avail themselves of
quality health care.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony here to launch the program, Estrada said
these passports allow their bearers to avail themselves of health
services in both government and private hospitals through a health
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
He said the program has three objectives: to expand the
membership of the National Health Insurance Program, expand
medicare's benefits, and make sure the health services offered are
of high quality.
</P>
<P>
"Today we present to the nation the launching of a just system
of health care. This will start with the health passport program,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added he plans to launch the health passport program in
other parts of the country in the following months, and to make
sure it goes full blast before his term ends in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The president led officials of the Department of Health in
launching the health passport program in Pasay City, Metro Manila,
where they ceremonially distributed health passports to 10
families.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 families from Pasay City were among the initial
beneficiaries of the program.
</P>
<P>
Distributing the passports were Health Secretary Alberto
Romualdez, Philippine Health Insurance Corp. head Enrique Zalamea
and Pasay City Mayor Wenceslao Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that his commitment to provide the poor
with primary health care has become more imperative since health
services are becoming more expensive, with the masses finding it
more difficult to obtain quality medical care.
</P>
<P>
While the rich avail themselves of the best health services
from the best hospitals, the poor often have to go into debt, or
rely on the kindness of others, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No person is immune from sickness. But it is indeed sad to
learn that there are two standards of health care in our country.
One is for the rich and the other is for the poor," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe's Ruling, Opposition Parties To Rival In Elections (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans will go to the polls on
Saturday and Sunday to choose their fifth parliament, which is
undoubtedly the most eye-catching election in this southern
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous elections, President Robert Mugabe's ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) this
year faces stiff competition from the labor backed Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai, who is former
General-Secretary of the Congress of the Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
In this year's election, at least 550 candidates from 15
political parties and 92 independent candidates will fight it out
in the 120 contested constituencies. Under the constitution,
Mugabe chooses 30 non- constituency members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only Zanu-pf and MDC have fielded candidates in every
constituency for the election in which one of the two would emerge
the victor.
</P>
<P>
The election has drawn much attention from the international
scene with many foreign organizations willing to come and observe
it.
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf Deputy Secretary for Publicity and Information Chen
Chimutengwende, who is also Information Minister of the
government, said the MDC and its allies are only bent on removing
Zanu-pf from power rather than dealing with the country's social
and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe, who is also Zanu-pf's first Secretary, said
that his party would not be fighting MDC in the election, but
would be squaring against the British.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "Britain is sponsoring the MDC." "The MDC has no
history. It is unknown to the people and has no track record. The
people of Zimbabwe who have seen a revolution unfolding cannot
vote for these insignificant nobodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf which has been in power for 20 years is seeking yet
another mandate to make up for its shortcomings especially on the
land issue.
</P>
<P>
The party also pursues an indigenization policy so that more
blacks would own factories, mines and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to its election manifesto launched by Mugabe in May,
Zanu-pf's theme is that "Land is the economy and economy is the
land".
</P>
<P>
In order to get more support from people in the rural areas,
the Mugabe administration issued a preliminary notice early this
month to compulsorily acquire 804 white farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The government requires 5 million hectares of land to resettle
thousands of its landless people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe's Ruling, Opposition Parties to Rival In Elections (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The MDC, which was formed nine months ago, said Zanu-pf's bad
rule had resulted in widespread unemployment. It will create more
jobs should it win the election.
</P>
<P>
The Zanu-pf has been the ruling party since independence from
Britain in 1980. It has made great achievements in the fields of
health, education and social welfare for the majority of poor
Zimbabweans over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
But these gains have since been affected by economic reforms
introduced in the early 1990s under the encouragement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). This led to steep rise in the
cost of living which has left many people suffering.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Zanu-pf is facing serious economic difficulties
because the World Bank and the IMF refuse to offer aid to it. To
grave the situation, all donor countries followed suit.
</P>
<P>
In the past four parliamentary elections, Zanu-pf got most of
the support from people in the rural areas. It has expressed the
hope to draw support from the same group of people in the
elections at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
But its popularity in cities and towns has declined because of
the country's poor economic situation. The MDC is expected to take
advantage of this to gain more votes in the cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Out of a population of 12.5 million people, 5.1 million are
registered, among which about 70 percent live in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Zanu-pf began armed struggle in the 1970s, which finally
led the country to independence. It initiated a massive
construction program after independence, which saw many hospitals,
schools and dams built.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here predict that the Zanu-pf will win the
election while the MDC will become the largest opposition party in
the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
They added that the new Parliament would have to make radical
decisions to solve problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the likely change to its composition, the new
Parliament is expected to deal first with the controversial land
issue. It also needs to see to boosting the country's economic
development, fighting corruption and political violence.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Eases Border Entry Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has ordered
to ease entry control of people from member states of the Economic
Community of the West African States (ECOWAS) in line with a new
protocol on free movement of citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian press Friday quoted the Comptroller-General of the
customs service Uzomaka Nwizu as saying that customs officials
should from now on jettison the old practice of detaining
foreigners at entry points.
</P>
<P>
Nwizu said, "Our ECOWAS brothers and sisters are now allowed to
come in and stay for three months without being molested."
</P>
<P>
"Our usual mode of control is to catch them (foreigners) at the
point of entry. With the treaty now in place, our duty is to
monitor aliens in our midst," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's unemployment rate
dropped to 4.8 percent on June 1, down 16 percent from the same
time last year, the state labor bureau reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said there were about 40,000 unemployed people in
Mongolia at the time, 53.7 percent of them women.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 percent of the unemployed had received secondary or
higher education, 24.5 percent had been skilled workers, and the
remaining 59.5 percent had received no vocational training at all.
</P>
<P>
About a third of the unemployed were under 34 years old while 6.
6 percent were 45 years or older.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the drop in unemployment was attributable to
increased new jobs created by foreign-funded companies and the
trend was likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,400 foreign-invested companies in Mongolia,
most of them operating in labor-intensive sectors like garment
making, building materials and catering.

<P>
According to the new law, a driver will be prohibited from
holding the mobile phone by hand or between head and shoulder when
the motor vehicle is in motion. And the law will apply no matter
the driver is communicating or not.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Friday that the use of other
similar hand-held telecommunications equipment such as radiophones
by drivers while vehicles are in motion will also be banned from
July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Using a mobile phone while driving distracts drivers and
affects their driving performance, in particular their reaction
time in emergency or unexpected situation," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, if there is a real need to use the
mobile phone during driving, motorists are advised to install
hands-free kits in their vehicles. A breach of the new law can
lead to a maximum fine of 2,000 HK dollars (256 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bank Financing for SMEs Inadequate in Hong Kong: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The survey released by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Friday
showed that SMEs in Hong Kong have difficulties to get adequate
bank financing in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This is evidenced by their heavy reliance on personal savings
as the major funding source for starting up and expanding business,
" according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The SMEs surveyed found that banks generally adopt conservative
lending policies and rely mainly on the availability of collateral.
The fall in property prices during the Asian financial crisis made
it difficult for these companies to obtain bank finance.
</P>
<P>
In line with the views expressed by SMEs regarding banks'
credit policies, the banks interviewed acknowledged that they had
adopted a more conservative lending stance toward SMEs than toward
large companies because of a number of unfavorable characteristics
of the loan market.
</P>
<P>
Banks and SME associations appeared to be somewhat more
optimistic during the March survey about the short-term prospects
for an increase in bank credit than were the companies represented
in the survey carried out in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
The difference may mark some turnaround in the financing
situation of SMEs as time passed, although the different
composition of the samples may also have had an effect.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to note that banks interviewed in the March
survey indicated a neutral to positive attitude in their future
lending stance.
</P>
<P>
Some banks revealed that they were aware of the difficulties
faced by SMEs and had already taken active steps to improve
services to them. They had either started increasing their lending
to SMEs since last year or set up dedicated business units
focusing on the SME loan market.

Great Hall of the People.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, today said Iranian President Seyyed Mohammad
Khatami's advocacy of dialogue between civilizations as "far-
sighted."

<P>
This call accords with the trend of time, and has therefore

community, said Li when he met with Khatami this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Civilization features diversity, and every civilization is well-
grounded for its existence and development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that different civilizations have diverged or
clashed with each other over thousands of years of human history,
the mainstream for them is exchanges, learning from each other and
merging with each other, Li added.
</P>
<P>
At the moment when all civilizations, without exception, are
faced with the question of improving and developing themselves, it
is a pressing and necessary task for different civilizations to
expand exchanges and promote dialogue between them, he added. (

<HEADLINE> China to Air More Homegrown Cartoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's TV stations will broadcast
more homegrown cartoons, Beijing Daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From the second half of the year, China's homegrown cartoons
should make up 60 percent of all cartoons aired in China,
according to the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television.
</P>
<P>
China's cartoons are not able to meet the need of the growing
domestic market both in quantity and quality, said deputy
director of the administration Zhao Shi at a conference held last
week in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Some 360 million viewers under 17 in China make up a huge slice
of the market. China's total production of cartoons made up some 6,
000 minutes last year.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say the need for cartoon programs of one domestic TV
station alone is about 7,300 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the most favorite cartoon figures of
Chinese children are imported ones and eighty-five of cartoons
available in China are imported.
</P>
<P>
Besides cental TV stations and some provincial ones, most local
channels only put on imported cartoons, contributing to the high
cost and low quality of Chinese-made cartoons.
</P>
<P>
"It is good to stimulate the domestic cartoon industry," said
Liang Xiaotao, director of the Animation Department of the China
Central Television, who is worried that China's TV stations are
going to have a tough time to meet the 60 percent figure.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Curb Radioactive-related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health
announced today that it will organize a nationwide inspection of
radioactive sources late in the year, to prevent redioactive-
related accidents from occurring.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the ministry, China
reported 159 radioactive incidences between 1994 and 1999, ten
times more than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
From January to May, localities in the country reported ten
cases, including radioactive source losses. China has more than 48,
000 radioactive sources under supervision. Of the total, 11,000
are idle or retiring.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some money-losing or bankrupt enterprises
failed to exercise effective control of their radioactive sources,
said Zhu Baoduo, vice chief of the ministry's department of health
law and supervision.
</P>
<P>
According to an analytic report by a lab under the ministry, 84.
5 percent of the radioactive-related accidents resulted from poor
management and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese people know little about the danger of radiation,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health will launch a campaign to popularize
danger symbols and radio-active protective measures.

<P>
WUHAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven people aboard a boat by the
southern bank of the Hanjiang River were killed during Thursday's
air crash in the suburbs of this capital of Hubei Province,
according to latest reports.
</P>
<P>
The seven people, all workers from the Wuhan No.2 Brick Plant,
located near the crash site, were installing generators on the
vessel, when the aircraft hit it.
</P>
<P>
So far, 49 people, including 42 aboard the aircraft, are known
to have been killed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingtao, a local fisherman, said that he had been working
together with the victims on the vessel before the accident. He
only escaped death because he left earlier to go to hospital, he
said. When he returned, he could not find his co-workers, and
called "110", the emergency hotline.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-made Yun-7 passenger aircraft of Wuhan Airlines en
route from Enshi City in the province to Wuhan yesterday afternoon
crashed near Sitai Village shortly before landing, killing all
four crew members and 38 passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the plane was struck by lightning during
its descent, and then exploded in mid-air.

<HEADLINE> Western Thai Border Villagers Help Block Drugs Influx  by Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAE HONGSON, Thailand, June 23 (Xinhua) -- With the assistance
from the Thai army, villagers along the western Thai border have
helped the country to successfully block the influx of illegal
drugs, a senior anti-drug official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Without the cooperation of the local villagers, we can not
fulfill our duty to suppress the cross-border drug smuggling,"
Tavatchai Wattana, deputy chief of an anti-drug taskforce deployed
along the western border told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The villagers in the border area now not only regularly report
the information of activities of drug dealers, but also have the
ability to defend themselves from any attacks of drug dealers, "
he said at the Ban Mae La Na village, west border province of Mae
Hongson, about 950 kilometers northwest of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Starting from some 15 years ago, the government has taken
measures to gain the support from the west border villagers to
battle illegal drug smuggling, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
One measure is to make the villagers understand the importance
of participating in the drug suppression operation.
</P>
<P>
"Now, all the villagers here, even small children, know the
danger of the illegal drugs," the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Another measure is to give the villagers the necessary military
training and equipment, so that they can defend their villages and
patrol along the border to find out suspicious activities.
</P>
<P>
"In the vast, mountainous west border areas, it is difficult
for the government troops alone to carry out anti-drug mission,"
he remarked, "that is why we need the help from those villagers."
</P>
<P>
Last month, with the help of the local villagers, the
taskforce cracked down a cross-border drug smuggling gang, and
seized some 100,000 methamphetamine pills.
</P>
<P>
"We feel very encouraged about this news, and we will continue
to participate in the drug suppression operations," Phrom
Khamkheauu, a local village leader told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The village authorities here also have taken measures to teach
and organize the villagers to join anti-drug activities, such as
teaching children about the danger of the illegal drugs,
exhibiting pictures about drug suppression, and helping drug
addicts to quit the habit, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Debt relief was the first
step to win the war against poverty, South African President
Thabo Mbeki said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Africa could not expect to make progress in fighting killer
diseases such as malaria and AIDS when millions of people were
living in abject poverty, Mbeki said in a panel discussion on
issues affecting the African continent at the World Economic
Forum's Southern African summit in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said to win the fight against AIDS, malaria and other
killer diseases, Africa first needed to win the war against
poverty. But if without debt relief, the continent would not
succeed in reducing poverty, Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the issue of debt relief for Africa would be tackled
as a matter of urgency during the G8 meeting in Okinawa, Japan,
toward the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and the presidents of Algeria and Nigeria will represent
both the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned
Movement at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Africa's total debt currently stands at about 350 billion U.S.
dollars, exceeding its total GDP by 65 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruiz, a hot favorite at the U.S. Olympic trials, jumped from
fourth to first in the 3-meter springboard with his last dive
Thursday night, a perfect reverse, 3 1/2 somersault with a half-
twist.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, 21, received a 10.0 from one of the judges, 9.5s and 9s
from everyone else. His score of 98.70 was the best of the night.
He finished with a total of 1,130.67 points to earn his first trip
to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Dumais claimed the other spot on the Olympic team with 1,120.32
points -- even though he arrived at the pool less than two hours
before the competition because of kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
Pichler, the leader going into the finals, held his advantage
most of the night. But he over-rotated on his entry into the water
from the reverse, 3 1/2 somersault. His scores gave him a total of
1,113.68. He plummeted from first to fourth.
</P>
<P>
Pichler will have another chance to make the team beginning
Saturday on the 10-meter platform.

<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Thursday appointed a new board of directors for the Athens 2004
Olympics Organizing Committee after Managing Director Costas
Bakouris was sacked earlier.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman

</P>
<P>
Bakouris would be replaced by Synadinos, who is also the
Merchant Marine Ministry's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the reshuffling of the committee was not a
personal attack on Bakouris, but a step towards achieving more
effective results.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the reshuffle represented an
undoubted strengthening of Angelopoulos-Daskalaki's position in
the organizing committee.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages More Sino-foreign Cooperation in Offshore Oil Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is seeking a great deal more
foreign cooperation in developing the country's vast offshore oil
resources, though it already had over 143 contracts with 18
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Wei Liucheng, president of the China National Offshore Oil Corp
(CNOOC), told Xinhua here today that China has huge offshore oil
and gas resources, estimated at 25 billion tons and 14 trillion cu
m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, proven offshore oil and gas reserves in China account
for only five percent of the country's total estimated resources,
said Wei.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by dramatically increasing Sino-foreign
cooperation in the offshore oil sector, can China accelerate the
development of this sector. This will obviously provide huge
opportunities for overseas investors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Maluku Province Closed to Outsiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Friday that the government has decided to close
the country's Maluku province from the outsiders in a bid to calm
down situation there.
</P>
<P>
"Now we ban other people from outside Maluku to enter the
province, because in fact rioters (there) came from outside Maluku,
" the president said, adding that they (rioters) came from Jakarta,
capital of the province, who want to maintain the "status quo."
</P>
<P>
But the president refused to mention the names who were
allegedly involved in the communal bloodshed in the province which
has killed more than two thousands people and injured thousands of
others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono suspected that
the ongoing violence across the country, including in Maluku, has
something to do with the prosecution against the former President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"There are some groups in Jakarta that have sent their men to
incite riots everywhere ahead of the Assembly's general session (
scheduled for August)," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that it was not easy to safeguard
Maluku province which has witnessed a communal bloodshed for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
But Wahid warned "the people of status quo" to stop inciting
riots (in Maluku).
</P>
<P>
"I warned them that their actions have been too far. Watch out,
if we lose our patient (we'll take actions)," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will take stern measures against
the provocateurs of the riots.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said that until Friday afternoon, the death
toll in fresh communal bloodshed erupted on Wednesday in Ambon has
risen to 15 people.
</P>
<P>
It seems that sectarian conflict involving Moslems and
Christians in the Maluku province and the neighboring province of
North Maluku shows no signs of abating.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five days at least 167 people have been killed in
the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Produce World's Biggest Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European aeronautics consortium
Airbus Industrie announced Friday that it will produce the world's
biggest jumbo jet A3XX and will restructure itself into a private
company by January 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus said in a communique that A3XX will be assembled in
Toulouse, France, and its interior parts will be fixed in Hamburg,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The biggest passenger plane ever to serve in the world's civil
aviation will be put into service at the end of 2005, said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Some air companies, including Air Emirates, Singapore Airlines,
Air France and Virgin Airlines owned by British billionaire
Richard Branson, have expressed their interest in buying the new
giant plane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Airbus will be from now based around a new company
baptized Airbus Integrated Company (AIC), which will be chaired by
the current administrator and manager of Airbus, Frenchman Noel
Forgeard.
</P>
<P>
The European Aerospace, Defense and Space Company, which groups
France's Aerospatiale Matra, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace and
Spain's Casa, will hold 80 percent of the stake of AIC, while the
British BAE will hold 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BAE has the option to sell its stake in the market either
through cash or through shares, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that by turning itself into a private company,
Airbus will have more flexibility and more transparency in its
management.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to save an estimated 350 million euros (332.
5 million U.S. dollars) in costs from now till 2004.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is the world's second largest plane-producer after the U.
S. Boeing and is now trying to replace Boeing as the world's
number one.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 it sold more planes than Boeing and is penetrating into
the U.S. market, mostly with its popular A320 which is the rival
of Boeing 747 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
Airbus sold 16.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of planes in 1999
and is now having 2,200 planes in service.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Builds Outlet to Southeast Asia (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the railway sector, Yunnan has completed a feasibility study
for a railway line that will link Kunming with Singapore. Two
schemes for the proposed railway line are now under consideration.
</P>
<P>
The proposed railway line has got the support of southeast
Asian countries and the Asian Development Bank. It will play an
important role in transporting goods among southeast Asian
countries and accelerating the economic development in the Mekong
River valley.
</P>
<P>
Since the railway line linking Yunnan with Viet Nam resumed
operation in 1996, goods transported has increased with each
passing year. The railway line handled 80,000 tons of cargo in the
first quarter of the year, doubling the figure of the same period
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has four rivers which flow into other Asian countries.
The Lancang-Mekong River offers a very promising prospect. More
than 150,000 tons of goods were transported from Yunnan to
southeast Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement recently signed by the governments of China,
Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, the Lancang-Mekong river will become a
commercial route next year and vessels of these countries are
allowed to sail between Simao in China and Luangprabang in Laos.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the air-water-land international channel
leading to southeast Asia has greatly promoted economic and trade
in Yunnan, said Ma Shuhong, deputy director of the Southeast Asian
Research Institute under the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports in Yunnan with southeast Asian countries
account for 30 percent of all Yunnan's total imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is the second largest trade partner of Yunnan, Ma added.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian President Seyyed
Mohammad Khatami said here today that different civilizations and
cultures in Asia should conduct more dialogue and strengthen
contacts.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Beijing University, the president said that
various civilizations in Asia started to carry out dialogue and
exchanges long ago. Today, different thoughts, cultures, languages,
and knowledge in the world are undergoing changes, thus urgently
demanding more dialogue among civilizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Asian civilizations need to further mutual
understanding, adding that more channels should be explored to
promote dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to bring about common prosperity of different
civilizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue is not only a way to solve disputes between different
countries, but also an approach to improve human life, Khatami
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that dialogue among different civilizations
is helpful to the enhancement of regional cooperation and to the
building of mutual understanding among the governments of
different countries.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Administration of Grass-roots Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is to adopt strong
measures to improve the overall quality of the judges at the grass-
roots courts, China's top judge Xiao Yang said today.
</P>
<P>
"Intensifying the building of grass-roots courts and ensuring
justice are of vital importance to social stability and economic
development," said Xiao, president of China's Supreme People's
Court, at a national meeting.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, grass-roots courts at the county-level and below
handled 5.53 million cases, making up 89 percent of all the cases
of the country. They also enforced 2.48 million court orders in
response to requests of litigants, accounting for 93 percent of
all court orders.
</P>
<P>
According to an ambitious reform plan advocated by the top
judge, an open and fair nationwide examination for judges will be
held to enroll new judges. Those who are not enrolled according to
relevant stipulations will be removed from courts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2001, the judges will be held independently
responsible for cases they handle, and their judgment will no
longer be subject to approval by court officials, Xiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a classified management system will be established
soon to facilitate the administration of different personnel in
courts such as judges, secretaries, administrators and police.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Urges U.S., Britain to "Stop Killing Iraqis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A major daily of the United Arab
Emirates on Friday urged the United States and its British ally to
stop "killing and maiming innocent Iraqi people".
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Gulf News said it was high time that the United
Nations and the world community made concerted efforts to halt this
mayhem and save innocent Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. insisted that its war planes patrolling the
two unilaterally-declared no-fly zones in Iraq do not target
civilians, "Washington is hardly in a position to say that its
missiles have not killed and maimed innocent Iraqis," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi regime might have exaggerated the civilian casualties,
the paper noted, however, there is no denying that hundreds have
lost their lives as a result of the pointless strikes.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the U.S. policy towards Iraq has
failed to achieve its objectives, as Saddam Hussein still remains
in power, U.N. inspectors are still not allowed into Iraq and
criticism against the air strikes and U.N. sanctions is growing by
day.
</P>
<P>
Over half a million Iraqi kids have died as a direct result of
the decade-old sanctions, but the U.S. is not moved although the
rest of the world sees this policy as cruel and inhuman and two U.
N. humanitarian envoys have resigned in protest, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Jutta Burghard, former head of the World Food Program (WFP) in
Iraq, resigned from the post in mid February, saying she could not
see that the U.N. Resolution 1284 on Iraq can be implemented for
its humanitarian target.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came less than one week after the resignation of
Hans von Sponeck, former top U.N. humanitarian official in Iraq, in
protest against what he called "a human tragedy" caused by the
sanctions and amid pressure from the U.S. and Britain for his
criticism of the crippling U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also called for a re-think of the whole issue,

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Spain Urged to Stop Toxic Waste Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Spanish Greenpeace
campaigners are pressing both governments to ensure the return to
Spain of a toxic waste cargo, owned by the Spanish company
Dragados, now held in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The cargo of toxic ashes is currently being held at the Turkish
southern Mediterranean port of Iskenderun since its illegal entry
into the country in May, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Spanish Environment Ministry, the Greenpeace
office in Spain referred to a Turkish court verdict, which ruled
that the toxic waste must leave Turkish waters since the necessary
scientific analysis confirmed that the cargo is hazardous.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace stressed that unless the Spanish authorities call
back the waste cargo, the bad precedent will be followed by more
than 2,000 tons of toxic ashes likely to be dumped into the
Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The toxic ashes, which left the Spanish port of Aviles between
December of last year and February 2000, were bought by Dragados
and shipped to Algiers, Algeria, for use in the construction of a
dam.
</P>
<P>
However, after the company's refusal to accept the cargo, for
which no reason was disclosed, the toxic waste was discovered in
Turkey, where legislation bans the importation of such waste.
</P>
<P>
Heads of Greenpeace Spain clearly pointed to Dragados as the
owner of the waste since it was originally destined to reach its
sub-company in Algiers, urging the government to force the company
to return the waste safely to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace campaigners in Turkey said that "this is not the
first toxic waste trade case in Turkey and it seems not the last
one, unless the government takes it seriously and tighten control
at the borders."
</P>
<P>
In 1989, hundreds of Italian toxic waste barrels were washed
onto the Black Sea coast, the suffering is still felt now by
Turkey, a country ringing the sea in the north.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Greenpeace members condemned that the rejected cargo had
left Spain in the first place, saying that the Spanish government
is accountable.
</P>
<P>
They also demand that the Turkish authorities step up efforts to
stop the repeating of such cases.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's industrial production expanded by about 10
percent on annual basis during the month of March, according to
figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 2000, industrial production is up 12
percent on an annual basis. This follows a similar rise during the
second half of 1999. Exports constitute about 30 percent of
Israel's industrial production.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli company Click Software raised 28
million U.S. dollars in New York Stock Exchange on Thursday and two
other Israeli firms plan to go public on the Wall Street next week
as the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Wall
Street, which went into hibernation during April and May, is
beginning to show signs of revival.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel is one of the 15 most likely centers for
money laundering, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force on
Money Laundering, an international body established by the G-7,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In December 1999, Commander Yossi Sedbon of the Israel Police
Investigation Division warned of Israel being turned into an
international center for money laundering. He claimed that Israel's
strong banking system, high interest rates, rising real estate
prices, and large diamond exchange offer good channels in which
dirty money can be invested.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Three international consortia will be invited to
submit their best and final offers for the approximately 1-billion-
U.S. dollar Izmir Bay Crossing Project.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Minister of Public Works and Housing Koray Aydin said
Thursday the three bidders, AJTC, IBKO and BV, are requested to
file their offers in the next 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Turkey put up a tender back in 1995 for the major transport
scheme under a build-operate-transfer model.
</P>
<P>
The 50 kilometer-long dual three-lane motorway scheme will
include a suspension bridge or combination of bridges and is part
of the 440-kilometer Istanbul-Izmir highway in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted
Turkey's yearly average consumer price inflation to be at 46.5
percent this year, compared to a government projection of 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the May 2000 edition of its World Economic Outlook report,
the IMF said Turkey's yearly average consumer price index (CPI)
would be 17 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
IMF forecasts put Turkey on top of the list of developing
countries' inflation rates, followed by Ecuador, Venezuela, Sudan
and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year stand-by deal with the IMF, Turkey had aimed
to curb CPI inflation to 25 percent at the year-end of 2000, down
from the current 63 percent, and to single digit by the end of
2002.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Bulgarian company Ramstore Bulgaria A.D., a
subsidiary of Turkey's leading retailer Migros, will sign a 12.76-
million-dollar deal with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD).
</P>
<P>
As a result, Migros said in a statement to the Istanbul Stock
Exchange that it will sign a sponsoring support and guarantee
agreement with the EBRD.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Plays Down U.S. Warning on Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials on Friday played
down a warning from the United States embassy in Amman that U.S.
citizens and the embassy itself might be potential targets of
terrorist attacks in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Akel Biltaji described the
embassy warning as "routine alerts" issued by U.S. embassies in
most regions of the world, and that there was nothing new in terms
of threats to justify such a statement in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Biltaji and other Jordanian officials renewed their confidence
in the ability of the security and intelligence forces to protect
Jordanian citizens and foreigners in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy posted the warning on Thursday on its Internet
homepage, saying the U.S. government had information concerning
terrorist targeting of the embassy in Amman, and possible attacks
on American targets in other venues could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The statement asked U.S. citizens travelling or residing in the
kingdom to exercise prudence, review their security practices,
avoid crowds, keep a low profile and vary routines and time of all
required travels.
</P>
<P>
After the warning, Jordanian security forces have apparently
beefed up the security of the already heavily guarded U.S. embassy
in the affluent Abdoun area in southern Amman.
</P>
<P>
Similar warnings were issued by the U.S. government and the U.S.
embassy in Amman last december, when Jordanian police rounded up 14
suspected terrorists who allegedly sneaked into the kingdom with
forged travel documents to sabotage new millenium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said the suspects, believed to have links with
Afghanistan-based Saudi-expelled billionaire Osama Laden, had
planned attacks on American and Israeli targets during the new year
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Laden is the most wanted suspect by Washington which has accused
him of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, killing over 200 people.
</P>
<P>
However, no serious attacks on American targets were reported in
Jordan in recent memory.

<HEADLINE> Mob Breaks Into Ammunition Warehouses in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A mob has occupied a police post
and has broken into two ammunition warehouses during communal
clashes in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
according to chief of the provincial police Brig. Gen. Dewa Astika.
</P>
<P>
The mob has looted various kinds of guns, ammunition and police
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly a crime," Astika was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the stolen ammunition could be used to launch
another attack. He said the police have been working closely with
the Pattimura regional military command in controlling the riots
and recovering the stolen ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Fresh communal clashes broke out in Tantui village in Ambon on
Wednesday after two unidentified men attacked three people, one of
whom shot dead.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Tantui have spread to three other villages,
bringing the death toll to 11 persons, five of whom military
officers.
</P>
<P>
"Security officers have tried to anticipate the situation by
deploying more troops," Astika said, noting however that they have
failed to stop the unrest from spreading as the mobs were using
the same guns as the police's.
</P>
<P>
He said the police post was occupied by families of provincial
police officers.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the motive of the attack, Astika said he is
investigating it.
</P>
<P>
"We will take legal measures, whether criminal or political
motives were behind the attack," he said, adding that they will
also investigate the possible involvement of police personnel in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
"If we find police personnel to be involved in it, we will take
stern measures against them as they have betrayed the police and
their duty to protect the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed nearly two
years of religious and ethnic violence involving Muslims and
Christians. The number of people killed and wounded in both
provinces now runs into thousands.

<HEADLINE> Regional Information Network Launched In Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Local officials in the southern
Philippine city of Zamboanga has launched a program that will link
policy makers with people in the rural areas through the Internet,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as the E-Regional Information Network Center (E-RINC),
the computer program will link regional line agencies with rural
communities for an exchange of information and open discussion on
development policies, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Zamboanga City Mayor Clara Lobregat, also head of the Regional
Development Council of Western Mindanao, was quoted as saying that
the E-RINC would connect data bases of various line agencies and
make it available to all stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
"The E-RINC is a mechanism that will mainstream our rural
development efforts in the electronic highway and make government
planners more accessible to the people," she said.
</P>
<P>
The E-RINC, a project costing about 600,000 pesos (15,000 U.S.
dollars), is partly funded by the Electronic Networking for Rural
Asia/Pacific program of the International Fund for Agricultural
Development.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) said the project is
part of the implementing support mechanism of the 600 million
pesos (15 million dollars) Western Mindanao Community Initiatives
Project being implemented by the department in the region.
</P>
<P>
DAR Secretary Horacio Morales said the project will give people
in the countryside an opportunity to participate in the
development planning process of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Rural development stakeholders can freely exchange ideas and
information with government through the E-RINC," he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Indonesia's Economic Recovery Not Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) denied here Friday that the economic recovery process in
Indonesia is sluggish, saying that the growth of the country's
economy has been strong.
</P>
<P>
"And now the emphasis is to make sure the growth continues.
This is the most important point," IMF Asia Pacific Director Anoop
Singh told reporters after meeting with Speaker of the Indonesian
parliament Akbar Tandjung.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has targeted the economic growth at 3
to 4 percent in the current fiscal year and expects the growth to
increase by between 5 to 6 percent in the medium term or in 2004
and 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of the (Indonesia's) economy is quite high in the
last two quarter. The challenge is to keep it strong. That is the
challenge. And further challenge is to intensify implementation of
(economic reform) programs and to intensify restructuring (and
raise) the value of assets by IBRA (Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency) and put the assets back in the private
sector," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the continuing fall of the rupiah, the country's
currency, Singh said, that is because the market sentiment is weak,
but the government is taking steps to improve it by accelerating
the implementation of the (economic reform) programs.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Media Locked in Debate on "Off-the-Record" Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean media is locked on
debating on which is first, national interest or the people's
right to know, after two vernacular newspapers reported a piece of
"off-the-record" confidential news.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the South Korean presidential press office
decided to bar reporters of JoongAng Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo
indefinitely from entering the press room of the presidential
palace Blue House as the two dailies broke a promise to keep the
confidential news "off the record."
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the two dailies' reports said
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Il
agreed to amend the clause of the DPRK Workers' Party charter,
which seeks communization of South Korea, at his summit with South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang last week.
</P>
<P>
The two dailies said they got the information from Lim Dong-won,
director of South Korean National Intelligence Service, who
disclosed the information on condition that "it must be kept off
the record."
</P>
<P>
The presidential press office and its press corps argue that
JoongAng and Chosun both violated the agreement by reporting in
detail what Lim said.
</P>
<P>
However, the two dailies contend the government does not have
the right to restrict the people's right to know.
</P>
<P>
JoongAng protests the presidential office's decision on grounds
that it uncovered the information from a source other than Lim
while Chosun's defense is what Lim said was no longer a secret by
the time it published the report.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, JoongAng said open information is a
prerequisite to democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, some dailies say the criteria in such a decision
should be guided by whether a press report would bring positive or
negative results.
</P>
<P>
If the reports can cause a negative impact, then it would be
right to go along with the government's request for
confidentiality, they argue.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Builds Outlet to Southeast Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
is building a land-water-air transportation network linking
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will allocate 180 billion yuan in the
next 10 years for highway construction, a principal component of
the network. A great part of the investment will go to eight key
highways including the four roads, leading to Thailand, Viet Nam,
Myanmar and Laos, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Investment for new highway roads will be 10 billion yuan this
year, 620 million yuan more than the amount in 1999, said Li
Yuguang, director of the Yunnan Provincial Communications Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Every year an estimated 2,500 km of highway roads will be built,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Located in southwest China, Yunnan Province shares 4,000-km
border lines with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Chinese primary
products, manufactured goods and traditional Chinese medicine of
Yunnan compete on southeast Asian markets. However, many products
for export can't be shipped out of Yunnan as mountains cover 94
percent of its area. Poor accessibility prevents Yunnan from
developing at a rapid pace and promoting economic and trade
relations with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by China, Laos and Thailand,
they will build a 1,800-km-long highway road linking Kunming with
Bangkok, which is scheduled to be completed in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications and Yunnan Province will
allocate 20 billion yuan to upgrade the 704-km-long Yunnan section
on the Kunming-Bangkok highway.
</P>
<P>
Work on the expressway between Dali and Baoshan is well under
way. When it opens to traffic, it will serve as part of the trunk
line linking China with south Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Land Law Must Be Strictly Observed: Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China should observe the land law
strictly so as to protect arable land, said a senior Chinese
lawmaker here today.
</P>
<P>
"Land is an indispensable to everyone. China is definitely
short of land with a large population," said Zou Jiahua, vice-
chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress, the country's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt a sustainable development strategy and improve
efficiency in land exploitation," he said at a gathering of
painters and calligraphers with the theme of valuing land and
protection resources.
</P>
<P>
He suggested any illegal use of cultivated land be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
The senior lawmaker also called for more publicity on Law of
Land Management which was adopted on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China has 130.7 million hectares of cultivated land, roughly 0.
1 hectare per person on average.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments tend to sacrifice land for short-term
economic benefits by launching more construction projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The council of governors of Arab central banks and
monetary agencies will hold a meeting in Abu Dhabi on Saturday to
discuss a number of topics related to the banking and monetary
sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jassim Al Mannai, director general and board chairman of the
Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), will present a report on the council's
activities.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Several agency agreements between companies in the
private sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Canada have
been concluded during the National Petroleum Show and the World
Petroleum Congress held recently in the northern Canadian province
of Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, which were signed by 25 representatives of UAE
firms in the oil and gas sector, are related to some projects in
sour gas production and treatment, horizontal drilling, pipeline
technology, instrumentation, IT software products and services and
recruitment of professionals.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Italy signed on Thursday an agreement on
prospecting oil and natural gas in southern Egypt by an Italian
company.
</P>
<P>
The deal allowed Italy's Ayok company to prospect oil and
natural gas in an area of more than 34,000 square kilometers in a
period of seven years.
</P>
<P>
The company will spend a minimum of 8.5 million U.S. dollars in
geological research and three-dimension seismic surveys.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The regional branch of Coca-Cola, the Coca-Cola Near
East, will be moved from Nicosia, Cyprus, to Beirut, Lebanon, next
month in part of its global policy to be "in the region where its
markets are."
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not about cost, infrastructure or better
communications, but the company's policy is to think local and act
local to be closer to your market," Coca-Cola Near East public
affairs officer Antonie Tayyar said.
</P>
<P>
The company served Jordan, Yemen, Lebanon and non-Coca-Cola
drinking countries where it hopes to expand soon, such as Iran,
Iraq, Syria and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus government has officially invited tenders
for 81.3 percent stakes in the Cyprus Tourist Development Company.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has sent a tender call to the Cyprus Stock
Exchange (CSE) and taken out advertisements in the local press
announcing its intention to sell its 2.4 million shares in the
company which owns the building rented to Hilton International
since 1967.
</P>
<P>
The rent paid is 27 percent of the net profits from the
operation of the hotel. Tenders must be submitted by July 14.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Tourist Development Company was delisted on May 15
because it failed CSE share dispersal criteria. The Cyprus
government, rather than reducing its stake, decided it would sell
out altogether.

<HEADLINE> No Arab Town Transfer Before Summit Date Set: Israeli Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The village of Abu Dis near
Jerusalem will be transferred to full Palestinian control only when
the date of a summit meeting between Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
leaders is set, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Abu Dis has not been discussed lately...but the
village will be transferred "only when a summit is announced,"
Ha'aretz quoted a senior Israeli political source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Direct contacts between Israel and the Palestinians have greatly
slowed down recently, as the two sides wait for the convening of
the three-way summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. president Bill Clinton,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The source said Israel hopes that Arafat, who is presently
against the summit, will eventually agree to attend the summit on
July 5 in Washington, the date proposed by Barak.
</P>
<P>
According to the Prime Minister's Office, July 5 is the final
date on which Clinton will be able to devote 10 consecutive days to
the summit meeting before the U.S. presidential campaign moves into
higher gear.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Middle East special peace envoy Dennis Ross returned to
the region Thursday to conduct shuttle talks between Barak and
Arafat and to prepare for the visit of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross met Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran shortly after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Following her visit, Albright will report to Clinton on whether
the conditions are ripe for the summit. The Americans are making
the summit conditional on sufficient progress in the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the visits of Ross and Albright, the Palestinian side
has agreed to a two-week postponement of Israel's third troop
redeployment in the West Bank, which should have taken place Friday
and is now rescheduled for July 7.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, a committee to find additional Palestinian security
prisoners who fit the criteria for release from Israeli jails is
continuing its work. But the source said that Israel can not
release so much Palestinians as the Palestinian side asked for.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has submitted a list of 270 to the Israeli
side, asking it to release them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet and Knesset (parliament) have approved the
Abu Dis transfer on May 15, but the handover has been delayed till
now.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday he now has a
government which will give him the support he needs to wrap up a
framework permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians,
following the ultra-Orthodox Shas party's decision to stay in the
coalition and Meretz's pledge to back the peace process even
outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas agreed with Barak's One Israel bloc on ending the coalition
crisis after the resignation of the three left-wing Meretz cabinet
ministers, especially party leader Yossi Sarid as Education
Minister, on Wednesday night, following a months-long fight over
funding Shas' education network.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A majority is emerging in the Israeli security cabinet for
the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to withdraw from 90 percent of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip in return for a permanent agreement
that will declare the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between Israeli negotiator
Yossi Beilin and his Palestinian counterpart Abu Mazen, the
withdrawal will be 90 to 95 percent of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. About 130 settlements will remain under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Eliyahu Suissa
expressed cautious optimism Thursday about importing water from
Turkey to meet Israel's emergency needs. He said any such decision
would require cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Suissa directed the national Mekorot Water Company to prepare a
tender for transporting water from Turkey. The minister said any
importation of water from Turkey would be for an interim period
until a desalination plant is built.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross arrived in the region
Thursday for another round of shuttle diplomacy, during which he
intends to assess whether and when a summit between Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton
could be convened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States Thursday approved the overall
foreign aid bill without cutting aid to Israel. Israel, at 2.8
billion U.S. dollars, remains the largest single recipient of U.S.
aid.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, Ross will remain in the region
until Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives here on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Drug Eradication Effectiveness Elusive: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major-General Soe Win, secretary of the Myanmar Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control, said this Friday at the country'
s 14th destruction ceremony of seized narcotic drugs here.
</P>
<P>
He said, "However much drug seizures, destruction of poppy
fields, treatment and rehabilitation activities were carried out
and continuously stepped up, effectiveness and success seem to
have eluded us."
</P>
<P>
Soe Win pointed out the weakness in the narcotic drug laws
enacted in the past and shortcomings in the government departments
concerned.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the ineffectiveness mainly to insurgency
problem resulting in security restrictions, saying that the
principal areas that cultivate opium poppy and produce heroin are
in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country where access
is difficult and once ruled by anti-government armed groups.
</P>
<P>
He called for speedy control of the poppy cultivating areas by
rooting out the armed groups.
</P>
<P>
He also put the blame on the cease of assistance from the
international community including the United States in 1988 when
the military government took over.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the international assistance is still not
forthcoming when Myanmar is in an opportune moment to be rid of
this problem, disclosing that the government has since 1989 spent
over 18 billion kyats (56.25 million U.S. dollars) in programs for
the development of border areas.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that Myanmar, in cooperation with the U.N. drug
control program, is implementing alternative development projects
and illicit crop monitoring programs in the poppy cultivation
areas.
</P>
<P>
Due to these efforts, he said, cultivation and production of
opium have gradually decreased.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that there are over 80,000 drug users in
Myanmar, quoting a baseline survey conducted in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, he said, seizures of opium and heroin
declined significantly, but seizures of stimulant and ephedrine
have been on the increase.
</P>
<P>
He further disclosed that after Myanamr's Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substance Law was promulgated in 1993, 14 death
sentences, 84 sentences for unlimited number of years, 35 life
sentences and 7 above twenty years sentences have been passed on
drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar's future drug eradication, he said the country has
begun implementing programs using 150 million U.S. dollars plus 33,
588.14 million kyats (105 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
He vowed that Myanmar will carry on with its own efforts and
resources for the total eradication of narcotic drugs whatever
kinds of accusation may come on whichever quarters.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Moves to Control Environmental Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will restrict
livestock keepers by allocating them with permanent grazing areas
in order to control environmental degradation and eruption of
conflicts, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye as
saying that animal husbandry is crucial for the development of a
large section of the population, but the sector is experiencing a
serious problem when animal keepers move from one place to another
in search of water and pasture.
</P>
<P>
"We are obliged to take measures in a short time to enable
livestock keepers to have permanent grazing land and, whenever
possible, enable each of them to own his piece of land and develop
it for grazing," he told the National Assembly in central town of
Dodoma on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that at present many animal keepers have no fixed
abode and wanton grazing have caused conflicts between farmers and
resulted in serious environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
On agriculture in general, the prime minister said four major
problems have been identified, which include general economic
policy reforms, little use or non-use of modern farm implements,
cheap prices for farm produce and lack of reliable market and poor
management of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The government, in collaboration with the World Bank, is
preparing a special program to revamp agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on every farmer to ensure adequate food storage so
that Tanzania could withstand a forthcoming shortage of 680,940
tons of food.

NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has called on investors to venture into fruit processing,
especially mangoes and oranges which are produced in large
quantities in various parts of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to protecting private investment
and will do what it can to ensure local and foreign investors feel
secure and free to engage in business activities," local
newspapers quoted Moi as saying on Thursday when speaking at Del
Monte premises, the international food processors in Thika,
Central Province.
</P>

He said the reform program initiated by his government since
the last decade has opened diverse opportunities for the business
community to invest in telecommunications, road and rail, water
and sanitation as well as power generation.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to improve the investment climate
in Kenya and maintain an opened dialog with the private sector,"
Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He told Kenyans to be wary of leaders out to incite them to go
on strikes or invade farms owned by foreigners, pledging to ensure
that privately-owned farms are not invaded.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for all Kenyans to uphold peace and
respect for the rule of the laws which are a must for national
stability and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Palace Found Underground In Modern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The main structure of a palace
belonging to a Marquis during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), was
confirmed by archeologists to be located under an amusement park
for children in this capital of southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials at a meeting today, the
amusement park and some local residents will be displaced to make
way for the project. Relocation costs are estimated to be one
billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuhuan, director of the Guangzhou Cultural Bureau, said
the excavation of the main hall of the palace may take up to two
years. A museum will also be built at the site.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed some parts of the Nanyue Palace,
including corridors and rain drainage systems.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qingzhu, director of the Institute of Archeology under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the find of the
palace proves that Han culture reached the southern part of China
some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A 500 sq m pit was dug at the archeological site, where roads
laid with cobblestones covered with large squares of sealed bricks.
Experts said that this exquisite road often lead to the main
residence of the palace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese imperial families made strict rules on
the use of building materials and architectural layout according
to their social status.
</P>
<P>
The unearthed part of palace showed that the architecture was
modeled like the structure of the imperial palace of the Western
Han Dynasty in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province in northwest China. But the
palace was most likely larger than the imperial palace, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
So far, the excavation area has expanded to 5,000 sq m. The
city government has designated another 40,000 sq m as a protected
relic area.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, a great number of ruins and cultural relics from
ancient dynasties have been found around the site, including an
exquisite garden, precious figurine seals made of ivory and
handicrafts made of crystal and glass, dating back to Tang Dynasty
(618-709). Experts say that some relics were imported goods
brought to Guangzhou via maritime trading, which flourished during
the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the southern region was
integrated into a united empire during the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC)
. The Qin government sent a marquis to rule the southern region
which is in present-day Guangdong.

<HEADLINE> China to Enforce Labor-safety Standards in enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health (MOH)
plans to carry out an inspection nationwide this year focusing on
small and medium-sized businesses that are occupational hazards
and have poor work environment facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Baoduo, deputy director of the MOH's
department of health law and supervision, at a press conference
here today, workplaces are increasingly becoming occupational
hazards in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the MOH showed that 218 poisoning cases
were reported last year, in which 759 people died or fell in ill
because of work-related poisoning, a rise of 15 percent and a rise
of 47 percent respectively over the figures in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Death tolls from industrial poisoning in May nearly doubled the
number of the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide poisoning in a coal mine in northeast China's
Jilin Province claimed six lives on March 6, this year. Six miners
died and three were poisoned due to sulfureted hydrogen leakage in
a strontium mine in Sichuan Province on May 18.
</P>
<P>
He added that many workers are unaware of the dangers caused by
long-term exposure of dangerous chemicals such as chemical glue
used in shoe-making industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said there are inadequate laws and regulations which have
seen occupational hazards growing rampant in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Without laws, it is neither possible to enforce labor-safety
standards in enterprises, or to force factory owners to take
responsibility in protecting the health of workers," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, Zhu said, "some will have their
licenses suspended or even be forced to close down if they fail to
meet labor-safety standards."

<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Thursday that he
was relieved as the Turkish military expressed no objection to the
cancellation of the capital sentence.
</P>
<P>
The military's statement would pave the way for a new initiative
to end the death penalty in Turkey, as was required by the European
Union for the country's accession to the European club.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States supported on Thursday the wrathful reaction
of Turkey at the EU for being excluded from the European Security
and Defense Identity, saying that Turkey and the U.S. were sharing
the same view on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey threatened to boycott the EU-led operations, allowing no
use of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities on its
territory for the European club.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Mesut Yilmaz, leader of ruling partner Motherland Party, was
cleared of corruption charges at the parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will disperse the black clouds over the tripartite
coalition cabinet led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- It was reported that Israel would not import water from
Turkey on the grounds that the price is high.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation which was visiting Turkey replied
negatively about the import of Turkey's Manavgat water. There is a
strong lobby in the Jewish state against importing water from
foreign countries due to both strategic and technical reasons.

<HEADLINE> Whites in Zimbabwe Flee to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of white families in
Zimbabwe have in the past two days been leaving the country for
South Africa, saying they would return after the Parliamentary
elections on Saturday and Sunday, The Herald newspaper reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials confirmed that most of them are British
passport holders but there are also some Zimbabwean passport
holders.
</P>
<P>
"They are leaving with their families. Most of them have
withdrawn their children from school," said Principal Immigration
Officer at Beitbridge Dennis Chitsaka.
</P>
<P>
He said the upsurge in the departures was noticed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not sure what will happen but this is such a beautiful
country and I am definitely coming back to live here," said one
white man who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
The man, who was with his wife and two children, said in the
event of violence, he would not want his children to be caught up
in the cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
"Children, both black and white, do not know anything about
this. If it wasn't for them I would stay and witness the events,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
White Zimbabwean passport holders leaving the country said they
were not keen to vote, although some said they were registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
Most of them were optimistic that the election would be free
and fair and were confident there would be no post-election
violence.
</P>
<P>
It is normal in any country to have pre-election violence, they
said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has ordered police in the country not to use live bullets
improperly when quelling riots.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation, a major newspaper in Kenya, Friday quoted Moi as
saying that the mandate of police is to serve Kenyans and not to
kill.
</P>
<P>
"Police are not allowed to shoot to kill -- that is why people
are accusing the government, for your mistakes," Moi said on
Thursday when sending a message of condolence to the families of
two tea farmers shot dead by police in a riot on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of opening fire on rioters, police should use the
skills they learnt from the training to subdue the suspects, Moi
stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at Xiamen in east
China's Fujian Province have found that the number of people
attempting to take more money in cash out of the country than what
is legally permitted has increased this year.
</P>
<P>
From January to May, Xiamen customs officers uncovered 29 such
cases involving a total of 4.56 million yuan (about 549,000 U.S.
dollars) at airports. Most of the people implicated in these cases
were domestic or Singaporean passengers.
</P>
<P>
In one instance, a passenger attempted to take 685,000 yuan (
about 82,500 U.S. dollars) of cash out of China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs regulations that a Chinese citizen
can leave the country with at most 2,000 U.S. dollars and 6,000
yuan; The limit for a foreigner is 5,000 U.S. dollars and 6,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
A customs official warned that anyone who took excessive
amounts of Chinese and foreign currencies and certain securities
out of the country without declaration would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
As currency limit violations have increased, the customs are
tightening checks at airports.

<HEADLINE> China and Russia to Enhance Economic Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Russian experts have
forecast that Sino-Russian economic cooperation is expected to
climb to a higher level in 10 to 15 years as a number of key
projects have been launched.
</P>
<P>
They include the construction of the Tianwan Nuclear Plant, the
biggest Sino-Russian cooperative energy project, in October last
year, as well as the operation of the Russian-made generators in
the Shuizhong Power Plant, China's largest power plant.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the trend is encouraging, and is likely to open a
new chapter for economic cooperation between the two nations,
which share the longest borderline in the world.
</P>
<P>
Currently Russia ranks ninth among China's trade partners.
Bilateral trade volume reached 5.73 billion U.S. dollars last year,
up 4.4 percent over 1998. In the first quarter of this year, trade
increased by remarkable 26.7 percent to reach 1.42 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qin Xuanren from the China Economic and Trade
University estimated that the growth will continue and bilateral
trade volume will reach a record 6 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia established a close economic tie in the 1950s,
and many people have noted that abundant natural resources and
huge markets would benefit both sides if they continue the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, their economic cooperation lags far behind their
political relationship. To reverse this trend, leaders of the two
countries have reiterated that they should cooperate in every
specific area and lay a solid foundation for their strategic
cooperative relationship.

<P>
In recent years, subcommittees of the Sino-Russian premier-
level regular meeting committee have been exploring cooperative
channels in the areas of economy, trade, science and technology,
energy, transportation, and the nuclear and space programs. Focus
will be on big projects such as energy and power exploration, as
well as the peaceful use of outer space.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, energy departments of the two countries
discussed the possibility of transporting oil and natural gas from
Russia's Siberia to China. Russian experts say if the job is done,
Russia will provide China with 35 billion cubic meters of natural
gas annually through 2010, and the volume of oil transported to
China would rise from the current one million tons to 20-30
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the strong growth of the Chinese economy will
inevitably require a large amount of oil, which is abundant in
Russia. The experts believe joint efforts done in the energy area
will be the most powerful engine to push forward Sina-Russian
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the two countries agreed they will set the
development of the industries of energy and high-technology as
their priority.
</P>
<P>
More good news came in June, when Russians announced they have
participated in China's ambitious development program in its
western region. Russia's plan includes building an enterprise in
Xinjiang to produce electricity equipment, digging mines and oil
in Qinghai and Xinjiang, providing machinery for the west, and
helping China transport natural gas from western to eastern
regions.

Li Jingwen, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and a foreign scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences,
says that Sino-Russian cooperation will see positive results when
the advantages of history and geology as well as industrial
structures are considered.
</P>
<P>
"Russian experiences and technologies can be directly used by
our Chinese," he says. "If Russia's political situation is
stabilized, its economy will grow, and the cooperative potential
will become a real force."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the Russian economy rebounded from a decade-long
downturn to see a 3.2 percentage growth rate. Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, has announced his goal of letting the
Russian economy grow by 8 to 10 percent in the next century.

committee of the Russian Duma, Russia's parliament, said that the
Russian government has decided to place priority on the

<HEADLINE> China to Add One Million On-Line Enterprises in One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China will connect more than one
million enterprises with the Internet within one year, in an
effort to sharpen the competitive edge of these companies in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
Included will be one million small enterprises, 10,000 medium-
sized enterprises and 100 large firms, according to a grand plan
mapped out by the Ministry of Information Industry and the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The plan will be officially kicked off after a national
teleconference at the end of this month, sources say.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the number of on-line enterprises will
double in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second step in China's three-step campaign to
accelerate information construction and enter the Internet society,
following a governmental on-line project, authorities noted. The
third step is to increase the number of families on-line.
</P>
<P>
The SETC officials said that by joining the Internet,
enterprises can promote management, set up a modern enterprise
system, and become more competitive in the market.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China's telecommunication departments will
speed up the pace of basic network construction and multi-media
telecom networks, provide a safe, reliable and fast network
environment, and encourage enterprises to use e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few famous domestic conglomerates, in the sectors of
oil, automobile, iron and steel, film, air-conditioners, and
aircraft manufacturing, will be the first on-line enterprises.

<HEADLINE> IKEA Wins Back Domain Name in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Second People's
Intermediate Court Wednesday announced the illegality of the
domain name, "www.IKEA.com.cn", registered by a local company.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fanwu, the judge presiding over the intellectual property
rights division of the court, said the Guowang Information Co. had
infringed upon the trademark rights of the world famed furniture
manufacturer, IKEA, by registering the domain name.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered Guowang company to stop using the website
immediately and nullified the registration Guowang company made in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Netherland-based Inter IKEA Systems B.V. sells a wide range
of home furnishings items worldwide. The IKEA Beijing and Shanghai
stores that opened in 1998 are two of the more than 140 IKEA
chains in 29 countries around the world, IKEA said.
</P>
<P>
By forestalling IKEA in registering the domain name, Guowang
company was obviously trying to mislead Internet users into
thinking there is some relationship between its website and the
renowned trademark, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in China that a court has branded a
foreign trademark as "reputed".
</P>
<P>
"The court's decision indicates that China has caught up with
the developed world in so far that it now offers legal protection
of trademark rights in not only traditional fields, but also on
the Internet," Wang added.

<P>
"Over 90 percent of these emissions came from the energy sector,
including transport and electricity generation," Hodgson said in
the report.
</P>
<P>
"Our energy efficiency in this country is poor and improving it
must be the first step in containing the growth in emissions.
</P>
<P>
"That said, clearly New Zealand must also take further action
to reduce emissions if it is to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitment.
Developing an action plan for that is the job of the ministerial
committee on climate change that I chair," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson will leave New Zealand tomorrow for Warsaw, Poland, to
represent New Zealand at an international ministerial meeting on
climate change. The meeting is one in a series of
intergovernmental meetings concerned with formulating the rules
and requirements under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

<HEADLINE> 15 Confirmed Dead in Northeast Australia Hostel Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people, believed to be
young overseas tourists, died after fire tore through a
backpackers hostel in northeast Australia, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Terrified residents of the Palace Backpackers hostel in
Childers, 250 kilometers north of Brisbane, capital of the
Qeensland state, fled the 100-year-old timber building at 0:30
Friday morning (local time).
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said fire investigators and police had
confirmed that the death toll had risen to 15 with more occupants
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Police said there were 86 people staying at the hostel Thursday
night, with nine now treated in the local hospital for smoke
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
Police urged survivors to contact relatives, while a hotline
number was set up for concerned families and friends.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ruling Party Hints at December Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is likely to
dissolve the House of Representatives in October and call the next
general election in December, the Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sathit Wongnongtoei, spokesman of one of the six-party ruling
coalition Democrat Party, was quoted as saying that the house
would be dissolved after the budget bill for fiscal 2001 passed
through parliament, which he expected around September.
</P>
<P>
He shrugged off a decision by the opposition New Aspiration
Party (NAP) to have its members of parliaments (MPs) resign en
masse on Saturday to force the government to call a snap election.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat spokesman also said the decision by House speaker
and parliament president Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, a NAP MP, to quit
his posts was also part of what he called a "political game."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Wan Nor submitted his letter of
resignation on Thursday, saying that it was not appropriate to
stay on since he was now secretary-general of the NAP.
</P>
<P>
Sathit said government MPs would continue to work as there were
at least two "major missions" left for the House of
Representatives -- to deliberate the budget bill and to consider
amendments to the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Democrat MP Marut Bunnag, formerly a House speaker, said
parliament could continue performing its duties even if the
opposition MPs resigned.
</P>
<P>
The coalition enjoys a comfortable majority of 237 in the 385-
member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Government chief whip Jurin Lakasahavisit, meanwhile, compared
the opposition threat of mass resignation to hijacking.
</P>
<P>
"They (the opposition) are trying to force the captain to bring
his plane down before arriving at the scheduled destination. This
action will eventually hurt the public," said Jurin, also minister
of prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
He doubted other opposition parties would join the mass
resignation.
</P>
<P>
NAP leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said on Thursday that his
party's executive board had yet to make a final decision on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
However, NAP deputy secretary-general Paichit Srivorakhan said
that there was a "99.99 percent chance" the NAP MPs would resign
en masse.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition took power in late 1997, and it must
call a general election before November when its term expires.

<HEADLINE> Bird Leaves Pacers and NBA for "at Least a Year" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird on Thursday left the
Indiana Pacers and the NBA for at least a year, for what he said
to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
Bird, who this season coached the Pacers to their first NBA
Finals appearance in their loss to the Los Angeles Lakers,
insisted before the season that this would be his last as coach,
and in February said he was "90 percent" certain he would retire.
</P>
<P>
"After taking time to think about it, I have decided not to
return to the Indiana Pacers or the NBA in any capacity for at
least a year," Bird said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
Bird, who lives in Naples, Florida, said, "I want to take some
time off to rest, spend time with my wife and kids, then decide
what to do."
</P>
<P>
The Pacers still tried to persuade Bird to remain in the
organzation, presumably as head of basketball operations, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
Pacers president Donnie Walsh said the club tried to keep Bird
but, after long discussions, failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers were 147-67 under Bird's instruction, including a 56-
26 record this past season.
</P>
<P>
Without any previous coaching experience, Bird was named NBA
coach of the year in 1997-98 after guiding the Pacers to a 58-24
record and the seventh game of the Eastern Conference finals,
where they lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Bird was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year
of eligibility after a brilliant 13-year playing career with the
Boston Celtics from 1979-80 to 1991-92. He led the Celtics to
three NBA titles, was the league's MVP for three straight years
and a 12-time All-Star.

<HEADLINE> UPDATE: Five More Bodies Recovered From Air Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Five more bodies were salvaged this
morning from the Hanjiang River, a tributary of the mighty Yangtze,
following Thursday's air crash on the riverbank near the suburbs
of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The bodies have not yet been identified, said sources from the
air crash site.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-made Yun-7 passenger aircraft of Wuhan Airlines
departed from Enshi city to the provincial capital of Wuhan
yesterday afternoon, and crashed shortly before arrival, killing
all four crew members and 38 passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
The sources believe the plane was struck by lightning during
its descent, and then exploded mid-air and crashed near Sitai
Village outside of Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The dismembered bodies of the passengers were swiftly packed
into body bags and sent to an unidentified location where they
will be held for further identification.
</P>
<P>
Only one of the plane's two black boxes has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway, and
recovery efforts are continuing, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven local people who were on the ground at the
time of the accident were reportedly swept into the river by the
crash impact. No further details were available from the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the requirements of the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, all of Wuhan Airlines'
six other Yun-7 planes will be suspended from service until the
cause of the crash is determined.

<HEADLINE> Security Situation Worsening in Kosovo, Says UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The security situation in Kosovo
continues to worsen, with an increasing number of murders, attacks
on individuals and arson cases occurring, according to Makissino
Hara, a U.N. spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Hara, spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), made the remarks at a press conference in
Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The lack of freedom of movement, and a decreasing number of
public installations, including medical and educational facilities,
are all concerns in Kosovo, she added.
</P>
<P>
With the security situation in Kosovo worsening, it is not yet
the right time for non-Albanian refugees to return to their homes
in Kosovo, Hara noted.
</P>
<P>
She also said that as an effort to improve the security
situation in Kosovo, the Office of UNHCR, joined by the Mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to Kosovo,
will set up a regional institution to provide more public services,
mainly in the educational area. Common education policy, multi-
national classes, and a multi-lingual policy will be pursued.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will continue to provide food and other
daily necessities to the residents in Kosovo, and to help
establish links between Serb communities, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A flood alert was declared
Thursday for central China's Hunan Province, situated on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Heavy storms pounded most of this central Chinese province on
June 20 and 21, driving up the water level in three major local
rivers to an alarming level, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
By 8 a.m. June 21, the water level of the Yangtze River
monitored at Chenglingji, located on Dongting Lake of Hunan, was
28.95 meters, 1.68 meters higher than average for the same period
of previous years.
</P>
<P>
More concentrated areas of rain are expected in the province in
late June, according to weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan government issued a circular urging the Party and
government officials at local levels to go to the front-line areas
and to supervise flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urged that patrols be increased on reservoirs
and lakes, relief materials be collected, and a task force formed
in case of a flood emergency.

Sources from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation said that the Chinese Government plans to build
Manzhouli into a free economic cooperation zone. The state may
adopt more preferential and flexible policies concerning taxation,
capital and use of land to support the development of such a zone,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Nanquan, director of the European Research Institute under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the Manzhouli
free economic cooperation zone is expected to become a "bright
spot" in the opening up and economic development of China in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Erenhot, the second largest port city in Inner Mongolia, is also
applying to be included in the plan for constructing frontier
special economic zones. The city, bordering Mongolia, was an
important commercial passage connecting Europe and Asia in the
10th century.
</P>
<P>
In Baotou, the largest city in Inner Mongolia, an international
container transfer station with an annual handling capacity of 17,
000 TEUs, funded by the World Bank, is under smooth construction.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Regional Government each issued a notice on
further developing border trade, and a decision on the development
of border banners, counties and cities in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has 18 ports along the borders with Russia and
Mongolia. The region is expected to play an important role in
developing trade with Russia and Mongolia, and will also serve as
a bridge connecting East Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenghai, an official from the regional foreign trade and
economic bureau, said that the total amount of cargo handled by
the region's ports reached 6.4 million tons in 1999, 11 times that
of 1950. Border trade volume amounted to 700 million U.S. dollars
last year, more than 600 times the figure for 1983, Wang said.

<P>
HOHHOT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the border areas
between north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Russia
has changed dramatically as old hostilities between the two sides
have vanished.
</P>
<P>
The forts of the former Soviet Union still stand on the Russian
side, but their guns no longer point at China. Soldiers of the
Chinese frontier forces stationed at Manzhouli, northeast Inner
Mongolia, welcome Russian tourists to the Chinese city, no weapons
in hand.
</P>
<P>
In the years when relations between China and the Soviet Union
were at a low point, Manzhouli, even the whole Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, became a battlefront against the former Soviet
Union. There were no large-scale investment projects in the region
at that time.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the Chinese Government aims to turn the region
into a leading open economic zone in north China.
</P>
<P>
In today's Manzhouli, the horizon is lined with high-rise
buildings, and busy taxis swim through the wide streets. The
Manzhouli-Baikal Trade Zone, the first Sino-Russian transnational
trade zone, has attracted a number of businessmen from both China
and Russia since it opened four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trade with Russia at Manzhouli, the
largest land port of China, reached 130 million U.S. dollars in
the first quarter this year, up 43 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Yang Hanzhong said that at present, nearly 10
million tons of cargo are transported annually from the city via
the Siberian railway to Russia and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998 China has invested heavily in the construction of
highway and railway ports in the city. Their combined handling
capacity rose from less than 10 million tons to more than 13
million tons annually, equaling the total of other Chinese
frontier ports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The residential housing loan
business of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) has experienced
sharp rise over the past year, with market shares going up
considerably.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the outstanding amount of residential
housing loans granted by the ABC had exceeded 75.5 billion yuan (
about 9.68 billion U.S. dollars), compared with the corresponding
figure of 5.48 billion yuan at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bank said that the ABC's newly increased
housing loans have maintained fairly good quality.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the bank's housing loan management
level has been steadily improved, the electronic processing of
individual loans has started and staff performance has improved,
creating favorable conditions for further development of the
housing loan business.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year the ABC's housing loan business will
focus on the increase of high-quality market shares, stressing
individual housing loans and real estate development loans.
</P>
<P>
Attention will also be paid to product innovation, professional
management and the development of a quality client base, so as to
make the housing loan business one of the bank's best business
species.
</P>
<P>
This year the bank plans to increase individual housing loans
by 20 billion yuan, while real estate development loans will be
increased by 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Picking, Trade in Sand-Fixing Wild Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has banned
the picking and trade of wild algae and excessive digging of
licorice and Chinese ephedra in northern China in a bid to protect
the fragile ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
In a recent circular, the State Council, the highest governing
body, said the wild and sand-fixing plants are listed under State
protection and management, as they play an important role in
protecting the eco-environment, particularly grass.
</P>
<P>
But rampant picking and digging of the wild plants in recent
years has resulted in the deterioration and desertification of
grassland, serious damage to the ecological environment, and had a
negative impact on the production and life of farmers and herdsmen
in the affected areas, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged local governments at all levels to stop
local residents from picking and digging the wild plants, and take
necessary measures to ban the trade of the plants.
</P>
<P>
It said checkpoints should be set up to block entry into the
growing areas for those wild plants.
</P>
<P>
Algae, a black hair-like plant, has been popular as the Chinese
pronunciation of the word is similar to "facai," which means "
making a fortune" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The circular called for licensed digging and monopolized trade
of licorice and Chinese ephedra, and demarking areas where digging
is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The circular also called on local governments for similar
control of picking, digging and trading of other sand-fixing wild
plants, such as ramee and Chinese caterpillar fungus.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Bank Governor Detention Not to Affect LoI: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) said the detention of Indonesia's central bank governor
Syahril Sabirin will not affect the letter of intent (LoI) signed
by the Indonesian government and the fund.
</P>
<P>
"The LoI will not be affected although Indonesia is facing so
many problems, including the arrest of Syahril Sabirin," IMF
Director for Asia Pacific Anoph Singh was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Indonesia would be able to implement
the programs in accordance with the agreement as outlined in the
LoI.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin has been put under custody for 20 days for corruption
charges at the Attorney General's Office on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He has been allegedly involved in the country's Bank Bali
scandal and was named as suspect early this month for allegedly
violating the central banks' prudential principle in its policy to
reimburse interbank loans guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around Bank Indonesia's reimbursement of
904 billions rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in defaulted loans
to other banks. Some 546 billions rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
of the money was then paid to PT Era Giat Prima for helping Bank
Bali recoup the money. There is suspicion that a large portion of
the money went up to help bankroll then president B.J. Habibie
renomination bid.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis of Switzerland was
gifted a semi-final berth at the Den Bosch Trophy tennis
tournament in Den Bosch, Netherlands, on Thursday when her quarter-
final opponent Cara Black withdrew from the tournament with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
The top seed has so far had only 36 minutes on court at the
tournament after receiving a first-round bye and then dropping
only two games in her second round match against Canada's Jana
Nejedly.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Sandrine Testud from France lost her quarter-final
encounter over eighth seeded Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir 2-6, 6-4,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
In a second round match, reigning champion Kristina Brandi
upset sixth seeded Australian Jelena Dokic 6-0, 6-1 in a fixture
carried over from Wednesday. The American later in the day
eliminated Australian Nicole Pratt.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Australia's two times U.S. Open
champion Patrick Rafter, the third seed, beat Sjeng Schalken from
the Netherlands in straight sets. Second-seeded French Nicolas
Escude fought hard before winning Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 7-5, 6-
2.
</P>
<P>
But Netherlands' former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek,
the seventh seed, lost 6-3, 7-2, 6-4 to to Czech Martin Damm.

<HEADLINE> Drought Continues To Affect Summer Sowing in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Almost two weeks of blistering
temperatures in north China has seriously affected summer planting
in drought-stricken areas in the port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Only one fifteenth of 200,000 hectares of farmland has been
sown up to now. Water pumps and other equipment have been used to
irrigate the land with little progress. The lowering underground
water level in the city can only irrigate 96,000 hectares of
farmland, or 27 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts encourage farmers to use water-saving
equipment and grow crops not needing large amounts of water.
</P>
<P>
Droughts have plagued north China for the last four years. The
most serious drought this year also saw a rapid increase of
locusts in north China.

<P>
WUHAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China will use 9.7 million U.S.
dollars of loan from the World Bank (WB) to build a flood control
model on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The model will include the models for the study of the 400-km-
long course of the river from Zhicheng to Luoshan on the
mainstream of the Yangtze, and of the Dongting Lake area, the
erection of two hangars for experiments, and the construction of
ancillary institutions.

embankments and to build the flood control model, said Wu Zhiguang,
deputy-president of the Yangtze River Academy, an organization

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government unveiled a
list of 225 projects with preferential policies for foreign
investors, with the aim of attracting foreign investment to
western and central regions.
</P>
<P>
The list, contained in a circular endorsed by the State Council
on June 16, was made public yesterday by the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC), the State Development Planning Commission
and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
.
</P>
<P>
As a key step in developing China's central and western regions,
the circular listed 225 projects as potentially profitable in 20
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The projects range form agriculture to high-tech sectors,
focusing on tourism, stockbreeding, agriculture, food processing,
environmental protection, electronic equipment manufacturing and
technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors will enjoy tax exemption for importing
related equipment and the exemption of value-added tax if they
invest in projects listed in the circular.
</P>
<P>
"Through channeling in foreign capital, we expect to bring in
novel ways of scientific management and state-of-the-art equipment,
which we believe will tremendously boost the development of these
provinces," today's China Daily quoted Wang Wanbin, vice-minister
of SETC as saying.
</P>
<P>
To create a favorable environment for foreign investment, China
has decided to upgrade seven provincial special economic zones to
State level, namely those in Zhengzhou, Changsha, Hefei, Chengdu,
Kunming, Guiyang and Xi'an.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications, a pioneer of China's financial reforms, plans to
expand its presence in the global market as part of its effort to
strengthen its presence in the competitive and growing financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in China, will open
a new branch in Los Angeles before the end of this year, today's "

</P>
<P>
"The detailed preparations are running very smoothly and we are

So far, the bank has had six international branches or
representative offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Singapore,

The bank pledges it will put more energy into the growth of the
business in the overseas market, major cities in central and
western areas and large enterprises.

The set-up of branches in western areas is also under
consideration, said Huang Zuling, general manager of the bank's

<HEADLINE> Trees Planted to End Erosion Along Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Most grain-growing land on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River that used to suffer water and
soil erosion have now been turned into forest or grassland.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.1 million hectares of such slope lands above 25
degrees, upon which farming is prohibited by existing laws on
water and soil conservation, have been taken out of cultivation
since 1989 thanks to an erosion-control program, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The program was carried out on a massive scale in the worst
eroded areas of more than 100 counties along the upper reaches of
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Of the infertile land that has been taken out of cultivation,
600,000 hectares, or more than 70 percent of the total have
already been covered by trees and grasses.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year erosion-control campaign has promoted the
improvement of local ecology and environment and helped rural poor
residents out of poverty, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Minister Vows to Protect Land: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Land and Resources
Minister Tian Fengshan vowed yesterday that the country will
strictly protect its cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
China has altogether 130.7 million hectares of cultivated land,
roughly 0.1 hectare per person on average.
</P>
<P>
Tian made the remarks as a prelude to a nationwide publicity
campaign scheduled on Sunday, China's 10th National Land Day,
which carries the theme "For a beautiful tomorrow, protect
cultivated land."
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that to stimulate domestic demands by
encouraging infrastructure construction does not mean the
government would win economic gains at the cost of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
His ministry will watch over, closer than ever, the disposal of
arable land while providing enough field for major infrastructure
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
He warned any responsible parties involved in the field case
will be punished seriously.
</P>
<P>
Tian said the seizure of cultivated land has been quite
alleviated since the adoption of the Law of Land Management on
January 1, 1999 by citing that 199,899.9 hectares were
supplemented while 205,369.3 hectares were occupied by
construction projects that year.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister still considers it a tough task to
further protect the country's arable land.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments still tend to sacrifice land for short-
term economic benefits and their subordinated grassroots land
administrations could not effectively stop this, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
If the efficiency in land exploitation is improved, most cities,
towns and villages will not need to seize any more land in 10
years, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson stressed
that he does not care about the public's perception of him, adding
that he enjoys hurting people.
</P>
<P>
The boxer's admission came as it emerged that his team was
preparing legal action against a number of newspapers, including
the Daily Record, over certain statements made, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
A less than talkative Tyson said he was in the business of
hurting people and that he enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
The former world heavyweight champion's visit to Scotland has
been shrouded in controversy with politicians and women's rights
groups adamant that he should not be allowed into the country on
acount of his conviction for rape.
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference since arriving in Britain, Tyson
responded to most questions with brief answers, though he became
more animated towards the end.

He said: "It'll be a great fight. I'm pretty much in shape."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the friend whose funeral he attended last week,
which delayed his arrival in Britain, he added: "He would have
wanted me to fight. He was a fan as well as a friend."
</P>
<P>
He played down talk of a possible future world title fight,
saying he would take each fight as it came.
</P>
<P>
But it was a question concerning his public image which
provoked the most startling response.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy what I do. I enjoy hurting people. I'm in the
hurting business and I enjoy it. You guys enjoy coming to watch,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not care about the public's view of him,
saying: "I don't like myself sometimes so I can understand why
they don't like me."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a London jeweller is taking court action against
Mike Tyson and promoter Frank Warren after the boxer bought 400,
000 pounds worth of jeweller y, without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
Bond Street firm Graff Diamonds issued a writ after Tyson and
Warren each claimed the other was responsible for picking up the
bill for the jewellery bought by Tyson on his last visit to
Britain.
</P>
<P>
That prompted reports in some newspapers that there had been an
alleged incident between the boxer and his promoter.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, one of Frank Warren's team said: "
Sports Network is issuing writs against the Daily Record and other
newspapers over various statements."

LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
West Ham have signed veteran defender Nigel Winterburn from
Arsenal on a two-year contract.

The 36-year-old left-back, a member of the famous Highbury back
four which Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is slowly breaking up, has
joined the Hammers after moving for an undisclosed fee.

Winterburn, capped only twice by England, joined Arsenal for
407,000 pounds from Wimbledon in 1987.
</P>
<P>
He went on to make over 550 appearances for the Gunners and won
the league title three times with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon title holder Lindsay
Davenport of the United States suffered a major setback ahead of
the All England Championships when she was knocked out of the
Eastbourne women's tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The top seed was despatched 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 by Belgian Dominque
van Roost, as fears her fitness was not up to Grand Slam standards
came back to haunt her.
</P>
<P>
Davenport was taken the distance by German qualifier Jana
Kandaar in the first round, but insisted a troublesome back injury
was no longer causing problems.
</P>
<P>
However, she struggled to find her rhythm against the player
who despatched her in the opening round at the French Open last
month.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Fourth seed Anna Kournikova also bowed out, her
fragile serve again proving her downfall against American Chanda
Rubin, who won 7-5, 0-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Number three seed, South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, also failed
to book her berth in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
She lamely succumbed 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 to Luxembourg's Anne Kremer,
who will now face Van Roost in the last four.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final match, Rubin will meet France's Julie
Halgard-Decugis who beat second seed Nathalie Tauziat 6-4, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> No EPO Test in Tour de France Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A new drug test developed to detect
the banned hormone erythropoietin (EPO) and planned for use during
this year's Tour de France has not been approved, the
International Cycling Union (UCI) announced in Lausanne,
Switzerland, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UCI may now be forced to give up plans to use the test
developed by a French laboratory after a three-member panel failed
to agree on its reliability.
</P>
<P>
The UCI said it would examine the panel's findings in the next
few days but with the Tour set to start on July 1, there is little
hope a test will be ready in time.
</P>
<P>
The UCI had attempted to fast-track the test, developed by a
French research laboratory, through a validation process that it
admitted was far less stringent than International Olympic
Committee requirements, in order to have the procedure in place in
time for the Tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Oscar Camenzind became the first
Swiss in six years to win his home tour cycling race on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though Camenzind finished more than seven minutes behind the
day's leader Stefano Zanini of Italy over the 178 km 10th and
final stage from Herisau to Baden, his 14-second overall advantage
over Italy's Dario Frigo remained intact.
</P>
<P>
He was the first home rider to win the Tour of Switzerland
since Pascal Richard in 1994. It was also his first major success
since he captured the world road race title in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The final stage was led by a five-man break after 62 km when
Zanini, compatriot Ellis Rastelli, Swiss Marcel Strauss, Dutchman
Marc Lotz and Austria's Thomas Muhlbacher opened up a 12-minute
gap.
</P>
<P>
The field was mostly uninterested in the escape because none of
the leaders was in a position to threaten the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Zanini claimed the stage in the final 100 meters when he beat
Muhlbacher and Strauss at the line.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official Criticizes "Selfish" Multinational Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel on Thursday lambasted multinational
companies for inflicting poverty on Africa through "selfish"
policies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary session at the Southern African Economic
Summit being held in South African port city of Durban, the
minister said multinationals are transferring wealth from poor to
rich countries.
</P>
<P>
"If multinationals write off Africa's debt, it will change the
face of this continent. We must lobby for this.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have selfishness in the world, Africa will
remain poor. As long as multinationals actually don't care, Africa
will not have a chance," he told the summit held under the auspice
of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
South Africa accepted the need for accessible world trade, but
it also accepted the need for fair trade, Manuel said, noting that
many African countries have privatized what ultimately is their
only source of revenue, resulting in a flow of funds from the
continent to rich countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Minister of State for African
affairs Peter Hain told the plenary session the international
community need to do much more to ensure Africa's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only an issue of morality, but it is also in the
rich world's interest to support Africa. It is after all the rich
world which strangled Africa with huge debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 40 percent of Africa's earnings ended up in countries off
the continent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rich countries should also work towards opening up their
markets to African countries, Hain said.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants Strike Paralyzes Nigeria' s Lagos State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Government institutions in Lagos
state, Nigeria's economic hub, were paralyzed on Thursday when a
strike by the state's civil servants to demand a pay rise entered
the second day and workers at government hospitals and schools
joined the action.
</P>
<P>
The strike, only a week after the settlement of a nationwide
stoppage sparked by a 50 percent petrol price hike, broke out on
Wednesday despite an injunction given by the state's high court.
</P>
<P>
Police Thursday were deployed at state government buildings to
stop harassment on the clerks who were willing to go back to their
offices.
</P>
<P>
Ayodele Akele, chairman of the Council of the Industrial
Unions, organizer of the action, said Thursday at a public rally
that the state government remained tough in its negotiations with
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, the federal government announced 7,500 naira (about
75 U.S. dollars) monthly minimum wage for its employees, but most
states in the country have since then refused to pay its employees
according to the same standard on grounds of insufficient funds.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Economic Recovery of Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced Friday
the approval of two loans amounting to 161.5 million U.S. dollars
to Ecuador to support the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The structural adjustment loan of 151.5 million dollars will
support fiscal reforms, improve public sector financial management,
and restore confidence in the financial system, through the
restructuring of corporate debt and recapitalization of the banks,
in a context of transparency and strengthening of the bank
supervision.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, this loan will help maintain adequate levels
of spending on social services and programs for the country's most
vulnerable people, as well as helping to improve the effectiveness
of social expenditures. This effort will include investment
projects to create jobs for low-income people, including
indigenous groups, and to develop education, health, and other
services.
</P>
<P>
The 10-million-dollar supplementary technical assistance loan
will strengthen the Superintendency of Banks, increasing the
efficiency of its regulation and supervision of the banking
industry. It will also support the Deposit Guarantee Agency by
modernizing its legal framework and operational procedures.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that these loans will help Ecuador resolve
its financial crisis, restore economic growth, and protect social
programs to ease the impact of the crisis on the poor," said
Andres Solimano, World Bank country director for Colombia, Ecuador,
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Both loans are part of the World Bank's country assistance
strategy for Ecuador, which provides for 425 million dollars in
financing up to 2002. This strategy, an updated version of which
was also discussed Friday by the bank's executive directors, forms
part of the 2-billion-dollar international aid package announced
last March.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Receive With Caution U.S. Court Decision on Elian </HEADLINE>

<P>
HAVANA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Cubans received with caution the
decision of the Atlanta Court of Appeals announced Friday to
reject an appeal from the relatives in Miami of Cuban boy Elian
Gonzalez, retained in the United States since November last year.
</P>
<P>
An official note from the Cuban government published by all the
communication media of the island a little after the decision
announcement told the Cuban people that the Atlanta Court of
Appeals "had published its decision to reject the recourse of
appeal of the mafia lawyers and would not review the case."
</P>
<P>
The official note said that the judges rejected "the request of
a new interdiction (a legal recourse that barred the return of
Elian to Cuba) before the Court of Appeals."
</P>
<P>
A full U.S. appeals court rejected Friday a request by U.S.
relatives of Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez to grant him
a political asylum hearing, CNN reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals deals the
second blow in one month to the case brought by the six-year-old's
Miami relatives, who are anxious to prevent the boy's return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the same court rejected the relatives'
asylum hearing petition on June 1, agreeing with immigration
authorities that only the boy's father can speak on his behalf on
immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
The father wants to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The relatives are now likely to take their request to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio
Friday urged economic reforms if Italy is to take advantage of
economic recovery and close the competitiveness gap with its
rivals and partners.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual general assembly of the Italian Banking
Association (ABI), Fazio called for "structural reforms" and a "
more intense" use of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
As for the banking system, the necessary reforms including
streamlining and passing control from foundations to core
shareholders should take two or three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fazio stressed that banks' operating costs actually rose last
year, and called for more risk-taking and higher productivity.
</P>
<P>
In other points, Fazio said it was essential to start
attracting more direct inward investment from abroad and to keep
Italian savings from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Italian investors were going for foreign investments
because of the "insufficient development of our financial market."
</P>
<P>
Fazio also said it was necessary to eliminate national
differences in how savings are taxed in order to avoid distortions
in investment patterns.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary agreement on getting rid of these national
differences was reached at the European Union summit in Portugal
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Accept Deal to Close Nuclear Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Greens party Friday at
its congress in Muenster city accepted a government consensus to
gradually close the country's nuclear plants in coming two decades.
</P>
<P>
By accepting the deal, the Greens party avoided split with its
senior ruling partner, the Social Democrats (SPD) led by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Some two thirds of the 660 Greens delegates voted in favor of
the agreement after three hours of heated debates, while the rest
voted for a counter proposal of the radical wingers for a faster
pullout.
</P>
<P>
Shutting off nuclear stations was a basic demand of the Greens
party, but the SPD had been pressing the Greens to accept a slower
closure.
</P>
<P>
Greens members in the cabinet also urged the party to accept
the compromise signed by Schroeder and the energy industry on June
15.
</P>
<P>
The compromise stipulated for Germany to close each nuclear
power plants after it finished the 32-year operating period.
</P>
<P>
But the radical wingers in the Greens party, most anti-nuclear
activists in 1970s and 80s, said nuclear energy should be phased
out "immediately", and called the compromise a "cheating package."
</P>
<P>
Before the congress, party co-chairwoman Gunda Roestel quitted
for her disagreement on the deal. And another party leader,co-
chairwoman Andje Radke, also spoke out against the consensus at
the party congress.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on the future of nuclear energy should be"open,
" and no definite date should be set for any nuclear station to
close, Radke told the congress.
</P>
<P>
Other leading Greens politicians hailed the congress'
agreement "a great success."
</P>
<P>
The compromise was "a historic achievement, which was
impossible without our Greens," said the Greens Environment
Minister Juergen Trittin.
</P>
<P>
The consensus to shut down nuclear stations until 2020s is"
historic," said Trittin.
</P>
<P>
Joschka Fischer, the prominent Greens Foreign Minister, also
celebrated the deal as "successful."
</P>
<P>
Nineteen nuclear power stations in Germany presently provide
more than 30 percent of the electricity energy of the world's
third largest economy. The last one will be closed before year
2021.

<HEADLINE> Ireland May Send Peacekeeping Troops to Ethiopia-Eritrea Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An Irish legislator hinted
here on Friday that Ireland could provide troops to U.N.
peacekeeping force to be deployed in the buffer zone inside
Eritrea along the disputed Ethiopian- Eritrean border.
</P>
<P>
David Andrews, member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Irish Parliament, said during his visit to Ethiopia that he will
be discussing the matter with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
"We will be speaking about the possibility of Irish troops
participating in the maintaining and monitoring of the border
areas," said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
The former Irish foreign minister said that the invitation has
to come through the Organization of African Unity (OAU), under
whose auspices Ethiopia and Eritrea signed the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement in Algiers on June 18 to end a two-year
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We have an outstanding record in peacekeeping. We have a
strong tradition of bringing our experience of peacekeeping in
some regions of the world," the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Andrews is here with an Irish delegation to see the
humanitarian crisis caused by the drought and to visit development
projects financed by Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Irish assistance to Ethiopia has increased by more than
ten-fold over the last six years, from 1.3 million Irish pound
(about 1.55 million U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 14.2 million Irish
pound (about 16.89 million U.S. dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA Strives to Boost Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Qiaoyan
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has called for making regional and
national strategies and policies to revamp the agriculture sector
which has been on the decline in some of its member countries.
</P>
<P>
The just ended Second Meeting of the COMESA Committee on
Agricultural Cooperation held in Lusaka stressed that the
strategies should accord the highest priority to the attainment of
food self-sufficiency in the countries.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, the member states have agreed to rationalize
agriculture production with a view to promoting specialization,
complementarity and sustainability of national agricultural
programs in order to ensure that a common agricultural policy is
developed and regional food self-sufficiency is attained," a
statement released on Friday by COMESA center said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed the challenges and opportunities of
the Free Trade Area (FTA) due to be launched on October 31 this
year for sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
According to a report titled "Challenges and Opportunities of
the COMESA Free Trade Area: An Agenda for Sustainable Agricultural
Development, 2000", which was released during the meeting, the
major challenge for the sector is to overcome the vicious trap of
food insecurity, necessitating huge food imports at an estimated 4
billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The region's cereal production is 60 million tons or 3.2
percent of world total cereal production of 1,900 million tons.
</P>
<P>
With 380 million or some six percent of the world population,
the region imports about 30 million tons or 14 percent of world
cereal exports annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COMESA has also seen a lot of opportunities for
agricultural production: abundance of natural resources, fertile
lands, rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Others include increased attraction to international investment
capital due to economies of scale presented by the huge COMESA
market, a powerful lobby for access to global markets and
potential for a large pool of regional expertise and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Most COMESA countries have implemented economic and agriculture
sector adjustment programs with a view to creating conducive
macro-economic environment and fostering agriculture-led economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have also implemented measures to diversify
their economies in order to avoid dependency on mono-crop farming
systems.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most member states have adopted poverty
alleviation as their primary goal, and have developed and
implemented a number of programs and projects in this regard.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a document on COMESA Rice Production
Development was presented.
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the document are that rice production in the
world has limit and there is no room for expansion in Asia,
America and Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, Africa in general and COMESA region in particular has
a good potential for rice production as it is estimated that more
than 100 million hectares of land suitable for rice production is
lying idle.

<HEADLINE> British Police Charge Two More After Smuggling Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British police on Friday charged
two Chinese, a man and a woman, in connection with the deaths of
58 illegal immigrants who were found suffocated in the back of a
lorry at Dover.
</P>
<P>
"Two people were charged at eight o'clock tonight with
conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry into the United Kingdom,"a
police spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
You Yi, a 38-year-old chef from South Woodford, East London,
and Ying Guo, 29, an interpreter of the same address, were
arrested on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
They have been charged with conspiracy to facilitate illegal
entry into the United Kingdom of the 58 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The pair are expected to appear before Dover Magistrates on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an inquest heard how the immigrants had desperately
tried to raise the alarm as their oxygen supply ran out.
</P>
<P>
They banged on the side of the container with their shoes after
an air vent was closed shortly before the lorry arrived at
Zeebrugge, in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
They died from a lack of oxygen and a build up of carbon
dioxide in the airtight container.
</P>
<P>
Police said the 54 men and four women would have died between
an hour and a half and five hours after the vent was closed.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch driver of the lorry, who was accused of the
manslaughter of the 58 immigrants, has been remanded in custody
for seven days.
</P>
<P>
Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, Holland, faces one count of
facilitating the illegal entry into Britain of two people, and one
count of attempting to facilitate the illegal entry of 58 people
as well as 58 counts of manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Satisfies Negotiations with China on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Vice Foreign Trade
Minister Anabel Gonzalez expressed Friday her satisfaction with
the conclusion of negotiations with China within the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"These negotiations are very important for Costa Rica, for the
very high customs tariffs applied to its products because it has
no diplomatic relations with China and because that country does
not belong to the WTO," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations concluded Friday in the WTO headquarters in
Geneva are part of the process for the admission of China in that
organization, and permitted Costa Rica to have an average
reduction of 47 percent in the custom duties applied to its
products in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that Costa Rica obtained "relevant conditions for
86 tariff fractions," most of them of agriculture products like
bananas, coffee, and sugar, but also for some industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The tariff reduction will go in force when China concludes its
negotiations with all the interested countries and it enters the
WTO. Gonzalez said that those negotiations could conclude in
September, or in any case, before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican bananas currently pay a 40 percent custom tariff to
enter China. With the negotiations, that tariff would drop to 10
percent, making it possible to compete with the Ecuadorian bananas
exported to that country.
</P>
<P>
Including Costa Rica bilateral agreements between China and
other WTO members has been completed with 33 countries. Still
outstanding were final accords with Mexico,Ecuador and Switzerland.
