<HEADLINE> Aikman Knocked Out of Dallas Opener  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman was knocked
out of Sunday's season opener with a concussion, and whether he can
return for next week's game was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was released from a hospital Sunday night after tests
revealed no serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was hurt when sacked for the fourth time, by Hugh Douglas
and James Darling, about three minutes into the second quarter. He
was replaced by Randall Cunningham, and the Cowboys went on to lose
41-14.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ninth career concussion for Aikman, who is in his 12th
season. He missed two games midway through last season after
sustaining two concussions in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said he wasn't sure when a decision
would be made concerning Aikman's future playing time. Dallas plays
at Arizona next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The injury woes mounted on the last Dallas possession when
Cowboys receiver Joey Galloway was carted off the field with a
sprained left knee. He will undergo an MRI on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys acquired Galloway in an offseason trade with Seattle
to be the big-play receiver and basically serve as the replacement
for Michael Irvin, who was forced to retire because of a neck
injury. He was also listed as the emergency third-string
quarterback behind Aikman and Cunningham in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was 0-for-5 passing with an interception, finishing
without a completion for only the second time in his 155 career
starts. The other time was Dec. 23, 1990, also against
Philadelphia, when he attempted only one pass before separating his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, signed by the Cowboys as a free agent during the
offseason, played the first 11 of his 15 NFL seasons for
Philadelphia. After missing much of training camp with soreness in
his throwing shoulder, Cunningham completed 13 of 26 passes for 135
yards with one touchdown and one interception -- and was sacked only
once.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty much getting zoned into what we do now, and
starting to get along with the system,'' said Cunningham, who
suffered a sprained right thumb in the game. ''I don't have the
timing and everything, but it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys carried only two quarterbacks on their opening
roster, undrafted rookie Clint Stoerner is on the practice squad.
Stoerner played most of the final preseason game for Dallas after
beating out Paul Justin as the apparent third stringer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys gave up two first-round draft picks and a
seven-year, $42 million contract for Galloway to catch passes -- not
throw them. He did have four catches for 62 yards, including a
4-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Lose Aikman, Galloway  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Dallas Cowboys' season went sour in a hurry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While en route to a 41-14 defeat at home to Philadelphia,
quarterback Troy Aikman was knocked out of Sunday's season opener
with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was released from a hospital Sunday night after tests
revealed no serious problem, but it was unclear if he would play
next Sunday night at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was hurt while being sacked for the fourth time, by Hugh
Douglas and James Darling, about three minutes into the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham replaced Aikman and completed half of his 26
passes for 135 yards. Aikman was 0-for-5 with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ninth career concussion for Aikman, who is in his 12th
season. He missed two games midway through last season after
sustaining two concussions in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The injury woes mounted on Dallas' last possession when receiver
Joey Galloway, who scored the Cowboys' only touchdown, was carted
off the field with a sprained left knee. He will undergo an MRI on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Lance Schulters, a Pro Bowl safety last season,
was knocked out of the game on the first play from scrimmage in the
second half of the 49ers' 36-28 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A pile of players rolled into Schulters' left ankle. X-rays were
negative, but he will undergo an MRI on Monday to determine if the
injury is more serious than a sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay running back Warrick Dunn left the Buccaneers' 21-16
victory at New England after hurting his right shoulder with five
minutes left in the first half. He returned early in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals left tackle L.J. Shelton sprained his right knee on
the first play from scrimmage against the New York Giants and did
not return. Arizona fullback Joel Makovicka left in the fourth
quarter with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Giants safety Sam Garnes, who left the game in the third quarter
with cramps, sustained a concussion with 2:57 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McKenzie, Green Bay's top cornerback, left with a bruised
quadriceps in the second half, and the New York Jets exploited his
absence in the second half for a 20-16 victory over the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers played the final three quarters of their
16-0 loss to Baltimore without run-stuffing linebacker Levon
Kirkland, who sprained an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego defensive end Al Fontenot was helped off the field at
the half against Oakland with what appeared to be a sprained left
ankle. The Chargers already lost DE Raylee Johnson for the season
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City guard Dave Szott went out early in the first quarter
against Indianapolis with a sprained right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville tight end Damon Jones sprained his right knee on
the second play from scrimmage against Cleveland and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Chris Liwienski made his first start at left guard
in place of Corbin Lacina, but was replaced by Brad Badger after
spraining his right knee. Liwienski is expected to miss up to three
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Rich-Poor Gap Wide in Latin America  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Sambil shopping mall in eastern
Caracas is Latin America's largest. It boasts 450 stores, two movie
theaters, an amusement park, a 30,000-gallon aquarium -- and a
McDonald's where Big Macs cost a half day's pay for the average
Venezuelan worker.
</P>
<P>
   A slum just a few miles to the west has open sewers running
alongside tin shacks perched on unstable hillsides, flies buzzing
in uncollected garbage and idle young men nursing bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Blanca Vera, 65, lifts her baby granddaughter's blouse to reveal
blotches on her tiny stomach. ''This is from the pollution,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 12 heads of state who met in Brazil's capital last
week for the first South American summit, even those whose
countries have experienced spectacular growth have been unable to
narrow the gap between shiny mall and poisonous slum.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of economic decline in the 1980s was only partially
reversed in the 1990s, and the World Bank estimates nearly 40
percent of the region's population -- or some 175 million people --
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all bad. Absolute poverty in most Latin American
nations appears to be falling, with key indicators such as infant
mortality, literacy and life expectancy showing improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inequality of wealth and opportunity is a huge obstacle
to development in Latin America. The existence of so many have-nots
threatens to undermine the success of the region's two great
experiments of recent years: democracy and free markets.
</P>
<P>
   On average, half of each nation's income goes to the wealthiest
15 percent of the population, the Inter-American Development Bank
says.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, the highest-paid 6 percent of workers get 30 percent
of salaries, while 75 percent of workers get just 4 percent,
according to the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the richest 10 percent of the population accounts for
46 percent of the wealth, while the poorest 50 percent accounts for
just 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. income gap is not much different from Latin America's,
but the magnitude of poverty south of the border is much greater.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the growing inequality on globalization. Thousands of
workers have been laid off in privatizations of state enterprises,
and international competition often drives down wages for
low-skilled jobs and raises pay for jobs requiring greater skills.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, as in most Latin American nations, overall poverty went
down during the 1990s. But Oscar Ugarteche, a Peruvian economist
and author, says that cuts in subsidies and higher utility bills
from privatized telephone and energy sectors have driven up the
cost of living for Peru's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's trickle up, not trickle down,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most economists say the real culprit is not globalization
but misguided state policies that deprive the poor of a decent
education, fail to collect taxes and encourage corruption.
</P>
<P>
   There's another factor that's harder to define but likely is
just as real: a culture of elitism that regards poor people as
unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't operate in a globalized economy with a narrow, tiny
elite sector that has absolutely no connection or appreciation of
the vast majority of people in society,'' said Michael Shifter, a
Latin America specialist at the Washington-based Inter-American
Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the elements widening the gap between rich and poor in
Latin America, inadequate education is probably the most
destructive. Public schools are in decay from Mexico to Argentina,
perpetuating the advantages of the wealthy who almost always send
their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most Latin American countries have directed precious state
resources to universities at the expense of primary and high
schools. John Scott, an economist in Mexico City, notes that in
Europe there's an average gap of two to four years in education
levels between the richest 10 percent and the poorest 10 percent of
the population, while in Mexico the gap is 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that two of the region's most forward-looking
leaders, President-elect Vicente Fox of Mexico and Chilean
President Ricardo Lagos, have made investing in basic education a
cornerstone of their policy platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Having embraced free-market economic reforms, most of the
region's policy-makers are now looking for ways to bridge the
wealth gap -- concluding that aggressive government action is needed
to ensure poor people benefit from the increased productivity,
income growth and technological advances that accompany
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans have taken that conclusion a step further, electing
as president a leftist former coup leader who rails against the
wealthy and promises to restore dignity to the masses. Venezuela's
vast oil reserves -- the largest outside the Middle East -- let it
avoid many of the free-market reforms that swept the rest of Latin
America in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have money in this country,'' said Xiomara Tortosa, a
Venezuelan activist who helps organize poor communities in Caracas.
''But there is no policy that directs resources to where they're
needed most.''
</P>
<P>
   Persistent poverty and inequality have turned Venezuela into
fertile ground for a populist like President Hugo Chavez. Many
wealthier Venezuelans fear Chavez's statist bent will prevent their
country from competing in the modern world, but the poor still see
him as their best hope.

<HEADLINE> Mom, 2 children killed in apartment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - A 28-year-old woman and two of her young
children were killed in their apartment early Sunday morning, The
Journal News reported.
</P>
<P>
   A third child, a 9-year-old boy, was hospitalized but was
expected to live, said Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro, who declined to provide details on what police found at the
first-floor apartment at 55 Maple St.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old man, possibly the woman's boyfriend, also was
hospitalized with apparent stab wounds, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, Patricia Torres, 28, Ashley Dominguez, 4, and
William Santiago, 7, were found shortly before 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old boy was in critical condition at Jacobi Medical
Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can imagine, a homicide scene with a mother and two
children is very disturbing,'' said Pirro, the district attorney.
''We are doing everything we can to make sure the case we put
together, if it is prosecuted, is a solid one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yonkers police declined to release information.
</P>
<P>
   Iklass Ibrahim, the landlord and owner of 55 and 57 Maple St.,
said that the 23-year-old man is Torres boyfriend and that the two
had a stormy relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a nice tenant, but she had a lot of problems with
him,'' Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said that the couple lived together with the children
and that she had received many complaints from tenants who called
to inform her that Torres and her boyfriend were fighting or
playing music loudly.
</P>
<P>
   No other information was immediately available.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Submarine Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- In the wake of a Russian submarine
disaster, NATO on Monday begins its largest live submarine search
and rescue exercise ever off the southern coast of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Sorbet Royal 2000 was scheduled long before 118 seamen died
in the Russian submarine Kursk three weeks ago. But NATO
authorities say the catastrophe illustrates the need for
international cooperation to conduct a rapid and timely rescue of
submariners in similar accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was criticized for delaying the arrival of foreign rescue
teams at the Kursk site.
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO's ability to react to a submarine accident and execute a
rescue operation will be put to the test in the exercise,'' said
spokesman Capt. Serdar Dulger.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 4-13 exercise will involve searching for a submarine
in distress, as well as rescuing sailors from a submarine lying 480
feet under sea level using a minisubmarine, submarine rescue
chambers or atmospheric diving suits.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvers will be carried out off the Mediterranean port
city of Mersin.
</P>
<P>
   Participating will be the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine USS
Dallas, along with four other submarines from Turkey and Italy, as
well as six rescue systems and seven surface vessels. Israel,
Argentine, Chile, Singapore and NATO partner Sweden are sending
observers.
</P>
<P>
   The British Navy canceled its participation because it
dispatched its LR5 minisubmarine to help the Kursk, which sank
following two explosions that tore the hull open Aug. 12 in the
Barents Sea off northwestern Russia. The LR5 was not used after
Norwegian and British divers opened the submarine's hatches and
found it was too late to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO exercise has been conducted every three years since
1986. The Sorbet Royal 2000 exercise was originally scheduled for
1999 but was postponed after an earthquake killed some 17,000
people in northwestern Turkey last summer, Dulger said. The quake
devastated Turkey's largest navy base in Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
   The last Sorbet Royal was conducted in Vestfjorden, Norway, in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Folger Library Features Shakespeare  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shelved among some of the world's finest and
rarest books in the vaults of the Folger Shakespeare Library, one
scuffed and waterstained volume stands out, not for its pedigree
but for the life it has led.
</P>
<P>
   The faded flyleaf inscription on an otherwise quite ordinary
copy of the comedies of William Shakespeare tells the story: ''This
volume left for California March 15, 1849 via the way of the plains
and arrived home, the 17th of May, 1857.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold was discovered in California in 1848. The next year, scores
of thousands of Americans followed the golden lure west. The book's
owner (she signed herself ''Boneta,'' but her full identity is
unknown) chose Shakespeare's comedies as a companion on the
difficult trek across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the water stains,'' says Georgianna Ziegler, reference
librarian at the Folger. ''This book has obviously been through
things. It's part of the story of the way west. I think it's a
great piece of Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, published in Hartford, Conn., in 1834, is also a
symbol of the world's attachment to the plays and poetry of a 16th
century English writer whose work has caught the imagination of
every era and circumstance, no matter how unlike his own.
</P>
<P>
   Situated just a glance away from the House and Senate, the
Folger library is one place on Capitol Hill that ignores politics
and the dance of legislation. It lays claim instead to the ''most
brisk and giddy-paced times'' of Shakespeare's England.
</P>
<P>
   Among its 250,000 books the Folger shelters the world's largest
collection of Shakespeare First Folios, 79 of the 240 known to
exist. It holds 150,000 English and European books printed between
1475 and 1800, including volumes on law and economics and social
and political history. It highlights theatrical history with
drawings, paintings, promptbooks and playbills of Shakespearian
productions over four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The library attracts some 200,000 visitors a year to its dark
wood Elizabethan exhibit hall and to dramatic and musical
performances in its Elizabethan theater. About 1,000 scholars use
its resources each year.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1991 visit, Queen Elizabeth II came face to face at the
Folger with a portrait of her distant cousin, Elizabeth I, the
British monarch of Shakespeare's times.
</P>
<P>
   To get some idea of the breadth of the Folger's holdings, just
pull one thread in a large, complex and multicolored tapestry, in
this case Shakespeare's link to America.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler reaches into a gray-metal cart and places a small red
volume on the table next to the Shakespeare that went west with the
Forty Niners. The inscription from President Franklin D. Roosevelt
reads: ''... given by me to my mother Sara Delano Roosevelt around
1900 and was in her room at Hyde Park until her death in 1941 when
it came back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is an 1864 Shakespeare published in Cincinnati and
presented in 1865 at the end of the Civil War to Clara Barton, the
future founder of the American Red Cross, for ''services rendered
to the sick and wounded at the Flying Hospital 10th Army Corps in
front of Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an 1825 Shakespeare owned by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.,
one of the best-loved American poets of the 19th century. It was
given to the library in 1931 by his son, Supreme Court Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said he remembered it from his
boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   There is a leather-bound promptbook from a London production of
Othello that belonged to actor Paul Robeson, who played the title
role but as a black man was barred by America's color line from
playing opposite a white actress in a U.S. theater.
</P>
<P>
   The library owes its existence to a chain of events that began
to form when the aging Ralph Waldo Emerson lectured at Amherst
College in 1879 and stirred the interest of a student named Henry
Clay Folger.
</P>
<P>
   Folger, who was to become president and chairman of the Standard
Oil Co., paid 25 cents for a ticket to hear Emerson speak. What the
philosopher had to say about Shakespeare caught fire in the
student's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, Emerson, summing up the influence of Shakespeare
on the 300th anniversary of his birth, wrote a sentence that Folger
was to take to heart:
</P>
<P>
   ''Genius is the consoler of our mortal condition, and
Shakespeare taught us that the little world of the heart is vaster,
deeper and richer than the spaces of astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Folger's passionate study of Shakespeare and determination to
create the definitive collection of the bard's works grew parallel
to his business success. He died in 1930, soon after the
cornerstone was laid for the building he had envisioned as a
permanent home for his collections and as a major center for the
study of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The vision has been maintained.

Bush Agrees to 3 Debates With Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As Republican George W. Bush announced he had accepted
three prime-time sessions, presidential candidates squabbled over debate
schedules Sunday. Democrat Al Gore rejected the plan, saying the formats
proposed by Bush could limit the audience and amount of face-to-face debate
time. Bush proposed debating Gore as soon as next week, or Sept. 12, during a
special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press;'' Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's
''Larry King Live;'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis. The
proposal also includes two vice presidential debates: Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and a later forum yet to be decided, Bush said.

Lieberman Urged To Drop Senate Bid

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The senator in charge of getting Democrats elected to the
Senate wants Sen. Joseph Lieberman to quit his re-election campaign and deny
Connecticut's governor the chance to give his seat to a Republican if Lieberman
wins the vice presidency. Connecticut Democrats nominated Lieberman at their
state convention July 14, three weeks before Democratic presidential candidate
Al Gore chose him as his running mate. Lieberman said Sunday that replacing him
by committee now would cause ''a lot of chaos'' for the party. ''The U.S. Senate
seat is too important to be filled on the run,'' he said. As chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is
leading the party's drive to win the seats necessary to overcome the
Republicans' 54-46 advantage in the Senate.

Studies Support Moderate Exercise

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harder exercise is better, but even moderate regular
exercise can reduce a man's risk of heart disease -- and the exercise doesn't
have to be done in one burst, new research shows. The findings, from a long,
large ongoing project, show a benefit that lasts over decades. And they support
federal recommendations that people should do 30 minutes a day of at least
moderate exercise, in at least 10-minute segments, most days of the week. ''What
we didn't know is, by adhering to this pattern of exercise, that translated into
long-term benefits,'' said Howard D. Sesso of Harvard School of Public Health.
He worked on two studies that were reported in Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association.

SUV Crash Kills 1; Tire Tread Split
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ENCINAL, Texas (AP) -- A sport utility vehicle overturned and landed on its
roof off an interstate in southern Texas on Sunday, killing a 10-year-old and
injuring six other people. The tread had clearly separated from one back tire.
Authorities didn't know if the tread separation had contributed to the accident
or was a result of the vehicle skidding off the highway and rolling. Jose
Martinez, deputy chief of the Webb County Sheriff's Department, said a shredded
tire on the vehicle possibly was related to the recent Bridgestone/Firestone
recalls and that it would be investigated further. The vehicle was a Ford
Explorer with Firestone tires.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and union leaders remaining
tight-lipped about their ongoing contract negotiations Sunday, it remains
unclear just how much the tire maker's recent high-profile problems have
affected its position at the bargaining table. A union spokesman denied that
last month's recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and a government
investigation into accidents allegedly related to the tires have changed the
nature of the contract discussions, which have been ongoing since March. ''The
negotiations started a long time before any of these issues arose,'' said John
Duray, spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America.

   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills got their revenge against the
Tennessee Titans, but lost starting quarterback Rob Johnson to a left leg injury

U.S. Open: Norman Beats Mirnyi
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Storms came and went, day turned to night, and after more
than eight hours of playing, waiting and playing again in brutal energy-sapping
humidity, Magnus Norman barely escaped the biggest exodus of top seeded men in
U.S. Open history. His red shirt soaked as if he'd been swimming in it, Norman
fell to his knees and pumped his fist over and over to the feverish fans after
the final point Sunday night in a 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) comeback
against an inspired but drained and cramping Max Mirnyi.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Lieberman Focus on Workers  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman are pulling out
all the stops in a sleep-deprived, six-state dash aimed at sending
a jolt of energy into their political base.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing it to honor your work,'' Vice President Gore told
workers repeatedly as the two tried to grab voters' attention with
a Labor Day blitz taking the Democratic ticket to the dawn hours
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   They sounded sharply populist themes as they greeted
construction workers and watched a little football at a pub in
Philadelphia and shook hands with workers changing late-night
shifts in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Michigan, they were greeted by a couple of hundred
cheering backers and continued their theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the labor movement were a religion, and in some ways it is,
Flint, Michigan, would be a holy city,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is going to work its heart out for the hardworking
middle-class families of America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the aim was ''to focus on Labor Day what we ought to
focus on, and that's the families who are paying the bills and
making ends meet.'' He paid homage to workers who, he said, ''are
building the future in this country and making America what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are what this campaign is all about,'' the presidential
nominee repeated at appearances that went deep into the night.
''You are what America is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman delivered sandwiches to construction workers
in Philadelphia, then greeted hospital workers at a late-night
shift change in Michigan at the start of a 27-hour, nonstop
campaign marathon. The campaign swing would take them to some of
the most important battleground states in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In Flint, Gore and Lieberman sipped coffee in a hospital
cafeteria with workers to push their health care proposals.
</P>
<P>
   They were sounding sharply populist messages, and making the
point that it makes a difference for workers who wins the election
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were headed for Florida for an early morning
visit to a bakery and breakfast with firefighters. The two were
splitting at that point, with Lieberman attending a Labor Day event
in Detroit and Gore appearing at a a picnic in Pittsburgh and a
rally outside a speedway in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to keep going to talk to folks who are at work on
Labor Day, like yourselves,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the marathon took an occasionally madcap tenor. A
sudden downpour in Philadelphia drenched the entourage as it tried
to leave the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign staffers were getting into the spirit of things,
debuting a new song they wrote about the closing days of the
campaign and passing out T-shirts bearing the message ''I survived
Joe and Al's Hard Days Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of the marathon swing was tightly focused, making
the case that Gore and Lieberman are hard workers who understand
the concerns of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man has the concerns of working people in his blood,''
Lieberman said of Gore. He also joked with union workers about the
frantic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm beginning to think that the vice presidential candidate
should have collective bargaining rights,'' said Lieberman. ''This
guy is working me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys have suggested Gore has gained in recent weeks, and
the campaign was clearly trying to build on that momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Republican rival George W. Bush was working just as hard to
blunt that momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He was kicking off his fall presidential campaign with a
weeklong tour through states where the race remains wide open.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Urged To Nix Senate Bid  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph
Lieberman says he won't end his Senate re-election effort despite a
colleague's warning that staying in both races risks letting
Connecticut's Republican governor appoint a GOP successor.
</P>
<P>
   The note of caution came Sunday from Sen. Robert Torricelli of
New Jersey, who as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee has a key role in the party's drive to win the seats
necessary to overcome the Republicans' 54-46 advantage in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If indeed the prospects of the Gore ticket get better and
better as the weeks go by, which I think they will, and (Lieberman)
sees the real prospect of a Democratic majority in the Senate,
which I think will become clearer, then Joe Lieberman has to make a
personal decision,'' Torricelli said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a difficult decision. I'm glad I don't have to make it.
... I trust Joe Lieberman to make the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that decision would be to get out of the Senate
race, Torricelli said: ''Well, it would from my perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Democrats nominated Lieberman at their state
convention July 14, three weeks before presidential nominee Al Gore
chose him as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, campaigning Sunday, said that replacing him by
committee now would cause ''a lot of chaos'' for the party. ''The
U.S. Senate seat is too important to be filled on the run,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state party's 72-member central committee would meet to
select a new candidate if Lieberman did withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal
''would clearly win the seat'' if the central committee named him
to replace Lieberman even as late as Oct. 27, the last day for
Lieberman to quit the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at his home, Blumenthal said he does not expect the
senator to abandon the race. ''I think he has made the absolutely
right decision -- to stay in the Senate race -- and will continue to
do so,'' Blumenthal said. He said most Connecticut voters want
Lieberman as their senator.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls reflect an extremely tight race with the
Gore-Lieberman ticket holding an edge over Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Joe Lieberman cares as much about a Democratic Senate
as I do,'' Torricelli said, and for that reason will leave the race
''if indeed it is clear he's going to be elected vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Sunday, Lieberman told reporters he ''consulted with
a lot of people in Connecticut and in the Connecticut Democratic
Party'' after Gore chose him. ''The consensus was that I stay in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutterings of dissent have appeared in recent days among
Connecticut Democrats. Councils in two towns have passed
resolutions urging Lieberman to withdraw from the Senate race, and
Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz said Thursday she was ''a little
disappointed'' by his decision to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Should Lieberman stay in the race, then win the vice presidency,
Connecticut law would allow Republican Gov. John Rowland to appoint
a replacement until 2002, the next statewide election. Democrats
control the state legislature, however, and their leaders say they
could call a special election next year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the course Lieberman suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is ... I'm going to stay in as a candidate,''
he said Sunday. Asked if there is a chance he will change his mind,
he said: ''I don't see any, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not the only politician in recent decades to run
for both a Senate seat and the vice presidency. Lyndon B. Johnson,
the Senate majority leader, did in 1960, when he became President
Kennedy's vice president.

<HEADLINE> Some Conservatives Eye Lieberman  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent criticism of Joseph Lieberman's
expressions of faith has placed religious conservatives in the odd
role of defending the Democratic vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist William Bennett said Sunday there is a
national tradition of politicians speaking about religion and there
is worse discourse in popular entertainment and media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids are not really being overcome by piety,'' Bennett
said on CBS' ''Face the Nation. ''This is not the major problem in
American life.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson said he found the
statements by Lieberman refreshing after President Clinton's
personal trials. Since becoming Vice President Al Gore's running
mate, Lieberman, who is Jewish, has often talked about religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels this deeply and that's why the religious
conservatives like him a lot and they like Orthodox Jews,''
Robertson said on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''They like people who will
stand up for their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Television evangelist Jerry Falwell also sided with Lieberman,
saying on CNN's ''Late Edition:'' ''To limit someone's expression
of free speech on any subject, including religion, is a violation
of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   In talking about faith, Lieberman has used language more
identified with conservative evangelicals, including his contention
that the Constitution does not demand ''freedom from religion,''
but only freedom ''of'' religion. He recently celebrated
accomplishments of the Clinton-Gore administration by comparing
them to the parting of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk drew criticism last week from the Anti-Defamation
League, which warned Lieberman that his repeated expressions of
religion risked alienating some voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman defended himself Sunday in a conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''My own expressions of last week were really meant to be
inclusive and tolerant, including tolerant of that minority of the
American public that does not believe in God,'' he said before
joining Gore on a 24-hour Labor Day campaign sprint through five
states.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives may respect Lieberman, they saw a political
calculation in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett alleged that Democrats were taking advantage of
Lieberman's tendency to speak about religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''As natural as that is to him, I think the political
calculation is the most natural thing to the Gore campaign. I'm
sure they're seeing how this is playing and they're saying, 'Stay
at it, Joe,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson worried that Lieberman's sincerity could attract
members of the religious right and former Democrats had who drifted
away from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a Republican, I'm not particularly pleased because he's
gaining a lot of votes for Al Gore,'' Robertson said. ''This is a
brilliant strategic move and the Democrats are chortling
enormously.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Ticket Starting Campaign Tour  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A parade in suburban Chicago and a stop at a
Michigan peach festival led George W. Bush's Labor Day itinerary as
he kicks off his fall presidential campaign with a weeklong tour
through states where the race is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee plans to visit nine cities in Illinois,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio, states that
represent 107 electoral votes, or about 40 percent of the 270
needed for victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton handily won each state except Indiana in 1996,
but four years later they are considered toss-ups. Polls show Bush
and Vice President Al Gore in a dead heat in most of the states,
where millions of independent voters who tend to swing between the
two major parties will probably decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's schedule Monday put him in two major media markets --
Chicago and Detroit. He and running mate Dick Cheney were taking
part first in a parade in Naperville, Ill., a GOP-friendly suburb
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The two were to split up later in the day, with Bush flying to
Romeo, Mich., north of Detroit, for the state's annual peach
festival and Cheney attending a Polish food fair in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will focus on Medicare, the economy, taxes, defense
readiness and Social Security during the multistate tour, his
campaign said. He is expected to announce a proposal for providing
prescription coverage for seniors on Tuesday in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush's Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, and
running mate Joseph Lieberman were campaigning around the clock on
Monday, visiting five battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day is a symbolically important landmark in the election
season. Political observers believe many Americans who have not
paid much attention to the presidential race over the summer start
tuning in after the holiday, so the parties switch into high gear,
running more ads and putting candidates on the road full time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee began airing an ad over the
weekend that features Gore's 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple and
his 1999 claim to have created the Internet. Both parties are
running ads touting dueling approaches for providing prescription
drug coverage for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are also jousting over debates. On Sunday, Bush
said he had accepted three invitations to debate Gore on prime-time
television, including one on Sept. 12 during a special edition of
NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and two in October.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wouldn't agree to the schedule, saying it could limit the
audience and the amount of face-to-face debate time.

<HEADLINE> Bush Agrees to 3 Debates With Gore  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- George W. Bush is standing by his offer for three
presidential debates, including one as early as next week, ignoring
rival Al Gore's quick rejection of his terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've laid out the debates we're going to do,'' Bush told
reporters late Sunday at an airport news conference here. ''He's
got his chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But few in either party expected Republican Bush's overture -- or
Democrat Gore's refusal -- to be the final word on debates as the
campaigns jockeyed for advantage. They were maneuvering to arrange
terms that best play to respective strengths of each candidate
while exploiting the rival's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   After a difficult two weeks that had seen Gore's poll numbers
rise, Bush strategists sought a way to steal attention from the
vice president's round-the-clock Labor Day tour.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with a hastily arranged news conference on Sunday
afternoon in Austin, Texas, with Bush proposing the first debate
next week -- on Sept. 12, during a special prime-time edition of
NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be followed Oct. 3 in Los Angeles on CNN's ''Larry King
Live'' and Oct. 17 at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a simple message: Let the debates begin,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the events he accepted -- the final one in St. Louis
-- was proposed by the bipartisan commission that has overseen
presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush proposal also includes two vice presidential debates:
Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and a later forum yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was disappointed by Bush's terms, saying such a
format would limit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's needed is to respect the right of the American people
to see these debates on all networks in prime time, the way it's
been done since 1988,'' Gore said in Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   His campaign chairman, William Daley, was blunter, saying: ''We
reject George Bush's plan to shortchange Americans by cutting tens
of millions of people out of the presidential debate audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides retorted by noting that both CNN and NBC had offered
to make the program available to the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they emphasized that both the CNN and NBC debates
on their list had previously been accepted by Gore -- who accepted
dozens of debate invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the vice president to keep his word,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ''This is a fundamental question of
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore said he would debate the governor any time, any
place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a seasoned debater and his campaign had already accepted
the Commission of Presidential Debate's proposal for three
90-minute sessions, all in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, by contrast, was looking for a more informal
setting with a single, preferably noncombative, moderator.
</P>
<P>
   The commission-arranged debates tend to be ''very structured,
very rigid,'' said Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ''No candidate should arrogantly insist on debating only where
and when it best suits him,'' Daley, Gore's campaign chairman,
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, President Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign
balked at the three debates the commission scheduled between him
and Republican Bob Dole -- and as a consequence, only two were held.
Dole had proposed four.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying for advantage between the two camps almost always
precedes presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore maintains that the three events proposed by the commission
will reach the widest viewing audience, and suggests Bush is trying
to duck the high-profile meetings in the final weeks of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said the debates Bush agreed to
would occur during prime viewing hours and that both CNN and NBC
have agreed to make video feeds of the events simultaneously
available to the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were important criteria for us,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said the debates would be carried on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At his Chicago news conference, Bush was asked what the next
step would be -- given the Gore campaign's rejection of his
proposal. ''I've still got confidence he'll keep to his word'' and
accept any and all debates, he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican officials said Sen. Judd Gregg of New
Hampshire has been tentatively chosen to play the role of Gore in
practice sessions for the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, said Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio
has agreed to stand in as Democrat Joseph Lieberman in practice
sessions for the vice presidential debates. ''He'll do a good
job,'' Cheney said, adding, ''It would be interesting to know who
Joe's going to use to get me.''

<HEADLINE> Concord Inquiry Focuses on Metal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines said it is working with
French authorities to determine if a 17-inch strip of metal found
on a runway after July's fatal Concorde's crash is from a
Continental DC-10.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said the piece of metal may have gashed a tire
on the Air France Concorde, triggering the chain of events that
brought the supersonic aircraft down in flames in the town of
Gonesse, killing 113 on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   An inspection Saturday by Continental, the Federal Aviation
Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and French
officials revealed that a strip similar to the one found on the
runway was missing from a space between a fan and a door on the
right-wing engine of a Continental DC-10.
</P>
<P>
   According to Continental, the same DC-10 was operating the day
of the crash between Charles de Gaulle Airport, where the ill-fated
Concorde took off, and Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators said they were unable to conclusively
determine if the metal piece -- called a wear strip -- was the same
piece that was missing from the Continental aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call placed to Continental late Sunday by The
Associated Press was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Computer Helps Children With Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The lump in 8-year-old Tyler Callahan's chest is
ground zero for the cancer treatments that have weakened his body,
stolen his hair and reduced his weight to less than 55 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's here, through a complex of tubing, that doctors take blood
samples and feed Tyler's veins with chemotherapy drugs whose names
are too long for him to remember.
</P>
<P>
   For the doctors, the treatments offer Tyler his best hope for
survival. For Tyler, they mean pain -- the worst of his short life,
pain that made him thrash around on a hospital gurney so violently
it took a nurse and his mother to hold his skinny frame down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't stand to see him go through any more,'' said his
mother, Lisa Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   So a team of researchers tried to make Tyler forget the pain by
turning his cancer treatments into a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Using experimental virtual reality software being tested at an
Atlanta children's hospital, the boy doesn't see the gruesome lump
on his chest or the twisting tubes of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He sees gorillas, or at least computerized images of them.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyler turns his head to the right, the image moves to the
left. And if he gets too close to the apes -- by using a joystick
that controls his forward and backward moves -- they roar back at
him.
</P>
<P>
   It takes sophisticated, clunky equipment -- earphones, a large
headset, joystick and a cartful of computer hardware and wiring --
costing about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvering around with controls and becoming absorbed in a
computerized world for fun is nothing new for Tyler, a video-game
fanatic who owns both a Nintendo and a PlayStation system.
</P>
<P>
   But for researchers, it's a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Similar virtual-reality software is already being used to treat
mental disorders. Researchers are using simulated situations for
everything from helping people get over fear of spiders to
diagnosing children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The software for children with cancer, developed by
Atlanta-based Virtually Better Inc., is the first to help people
handle the anxiety of physical pain, researchers there claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''They get really involved with the program, and they forget
what's going on around them,'' said Jon Gershon, a Virtually Better
researcher who works with Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the software's scope is limited. It is intended only
for children at least 8 years old, and the gorilla landscape --
developed with help from Zoo Atlanta -- is the only option for what
shows up in front of the children's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers hope to expand the program for younger children,
who might be frightened by gorillas, and for teen-agers and adults,
who might rather watch a rock concert or a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, you're providing a distraction,'' said Dr.
Stephen Lauer, medical director of the cancer center at Children's
Healthcare of Atlanta, the hospital where the software is being
tested. ''It has to absorb the player such that they become
minimally or not aware of what's going on around them at all.
You're kind of hypnotizing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers concede there are still unanswered questions about
using virtual reality to ease the pain and anxiety of cancer
patients. They wonder, for example, whether hospitals will invest
in virtual reality, which is likely to be too expensive for
individual patients to afford.
</P>

   ''Somebody's got to pay for this,'' Lauer said. ''All these
electronic things are expensive, and somebody's got to fix them all
the time.''

<P>
   Regardless, Virtually Better plans to try the gorilla software
on 50 patients at the Atlanta children's hospital in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes most of the children will react like
8-year-old Tyler, who said he actually looks forward to his
treatments now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it,'' he said. ''You just walk up on something, and
you're on top of it. You just walk up to the gorillas. That's
pretty cool.''

<HEADLINE> Bills 16, Titans 13  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Miracles, like lightning, apparently
can't strike twice. But it was close.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Christie hit a 33-yard field goal with 35 seconds left and
the Buffalo Bills hung on for a 16-13 victory over Tennessee on
Sunday night, avenging their stunning loss to the Titans in last
season's AFC wild card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Sunday's game came close to being a carbon copy of
''Music City Miracle'' in which Kevin Dyson -- courtesy of Frank
Wycheck's home-run throwback -- ran back a last-second kickoff 75
yards for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, there was no Tennessee throwback, and the
Bills managed to tackle kick returner Derrick Mason at midfield.
The game ended when punter Craig Hentrich's 60-yard field-goal
attempt fell short and left.
</P>
<P>
   It was still enough to put a familiar scare into the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt like that game all over again, but we didn't want to
live that out,'' Bills defensive end Marcellus Wiley said. ''It
was, 'Here we go again,' especially when he kept running. Everybody
was like, 'You've got to be kidding me.' But lightning doesn't
'strike twice and I don't think they deserved two miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bills safety Keion Carpenter: ''As long as (Mason) didn't
get to the end zone, we got the defense out there and did our
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills won despite losing starting quarterback Rob Johnson,
who said he injured a nerve in his lower left leg, limping off the
field with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Alex Van Pelt took over with the game tied at 13.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bills' final possession, Van Pelt sparked the winning
drive when he hit Eric Moulds for a 36-yard gain with 50 seconds
left, to set up Christie's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans didn't know what to make of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the Titans dropped two sure catches, with
Wycheck letting the ball slip through his hands in the end zone in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a play a professional has to make. There's no excuse
for a dropped ball like that,'' Wycheck said. ''It's a tough loss.
It's going sting. And it should sting. We haven't been in this
position for a long, long time. But you have to look at the overall
picture. It's the first game, and there are 15 more.''
</P>
<P>
   Added coach Jeff Fisher: ''When you play a team like Buffalo,
you've got to catch balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The usually sure-handed Eddie George also dropped an easy pass
in the third quarter, when Steve McNair found him wide open at the
Titans' 45. The pass hit George in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills defense did the rest, limiting the Titans to 172 net
yards, and a mere 55 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   McNair finished 17-for-31 for 152 yards, while George carried
the ball 17 times for only 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills offense didn't' play much better, accounting for 266
yards, but it was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Van Pelt played down his performance, instead crediting Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me being up here is kind of silly the way Rob played,'' Van
Pelt said during the postgame news conference. ''He earned it. I
made a 3-yard pass to Eric and he did the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who expects to play next week, put in a remarkable
performance. He threw for 107 yards and one touchdown. He also
showed his poise and courage as he ran for 60 yards on six carries,
directly helping set up two of Christie's field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would've liked to have come back in,'' said Johnson, who was
sacked five times and took numerous licks from defensive end Jevon
Kearse. ''Obviously, after three-and-a-half quarters of getting
kicked, you'd like to be there in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Pelt's performance: ''I knew he would do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Peerless Price had a 15-yard touchdown reception and Christie
hit two other field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Newman had two sack for the Bills, and Carpenter had an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   George scored on a 2-yard plunge, and Al Del Greco hit two field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills led the entire way until George tied it on a drive set
up by a 41-yard pass-interference call against Ken Irvin. He got
his hands on Carl Pickens to break up what appeared to be a sure
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Titans tight end Michael Roan, carted off the field five minutes
into the third quarter, broke his left fibula.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Doug Flutie was activated as the Bills' third
quarterback, returning earlier than expected from a torn groin
muscle. Flutie, who did not play, suited up for practice Wednesday
for the first time since he was injured during the first week of
training camp on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kearse was not credited with a sack, ending an eight-game
streak. He had eight tackles and one assist. ... The Titans have
allowed only one 100-yard rushing game their last 22 outings. ...
The Bills, who have consistently played a 3-4 defense, changed up
their scheme, going to a four-man line by inserting Pat Williams as
an extra nose tackle on occasional first-down plays.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes in Russian Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A bomb exploded Monday in a market in the central
Russian city of Ryazan, killing two people and wounding several
others, an emergency official said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast tore through the market at about 8:30 a.m. in the
small industrial city about 120 miles south of Moscow, said Marina
Ryklina, a spokesman with the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate information on a possible motive, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion followed an Aug. 12 bomb attack in a crowded
underground passageway in Moscow which killed 12 people and wounded
more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   The blast Monday came on the first anniversary of an apartment
bombing in Buinaksk in southern Russia that killed 64 people.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities blamed Chechen rebels for the Buinaksk bombing and
three other apartment explosions last September that killed a total
of about 300 people and resulted in Russian forces moving into
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Mom, 2 young children killed in apartment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - A 28-year-old woman and two of her young
children were killed in their apartment while music blared Sunday
morning, The Journal News reported.
</P>
<P>
   A third child, a 9-year-old boy, was hospitalized but was
expected to live, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro said. A 23-year-old man, possibly the woman's boyfriend, also
was hospitalized with apparent stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro declined to provide details on what police found at the
first-floor apartment at 55 Maple St. in the Nodine Hill section.
Yonkers police released no information.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, identified as Patricia Torres, 28, Ashley Dominguez,
4, and William Santiago, 7, were found shortly before 8 a.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old boy was in critical condition at Jacobi Medical
Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can imagine, a homicide scene with a mother and two
children is very disturbing,'' said Pirro, the district attorney.
''We are doing everything we can to make sure the case we put
together, if it is prosecuted, is a solid one.''
</P>
<P>
   Iklass Ibrahim, the landlord and owner of 55 and 57 Maple St.
for the last six years, said that the 23-year-old man is Torres'
boyfriend and that the two had a stormy relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a nice tenant, but she had a lot of problems with
him,'' Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said that the couple lived together with the children
and that she had received many complaints from tenants saying
Torres and her boyfriend were fighting or playing music loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said they heard loud music at the apartment
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Squillante, 56, who lives down the block, said he heard
screams from the yard at 7 a.m. Sunday. He said the victims were
discovered by another of Torres' children, an 11-year-old boy who
lives with Torres' parents at 53 Maple St.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw them bring him out through the front on a stretcher,''
Squillante said, referring to 7-year-old William.
</P>
<P>
   The dead woman's parents, Rodolfo Torres, 65, and Sergia Torres,
61, sat somberly at their kitchen table Sunday. Rodolfo Torres
occasionally ventured outside his home to smoke a cigarette and
silently pace the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in too much pain to speak,'' said Norman Doblado, 32,
the dead woman's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Hector Ortiz said Patricia Torres' boys used to come
over to play video games with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes they come here, when I make a party for my kids,''
he told The Journal News. ''They're nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after dark Sunday, at least a dozen children played on the
sidewalk outside the building. Two police officers guarded the
entrance to the crime scene.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Discuss Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori opened talks on Monday on a World War II
peace treaty delayed by a territorial dispute over four islands
north of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet troops occupied the four Kuril Islands, known in Japan as
the Northern Territories, during the closing days of the war. Tokyo
has insisted on a deal on the islands as a condition for concluding
a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope our talks will develop in a good direction,'' Mori was
quoted by Kyodo News agency as telling Putin at the outset of talks
at the State Guesthouse in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Russia are trying to wrap up a peace treaty by the end
of this year. Tokyo and Moscow established diplomatic relations in
1956, but have never signed a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are still far apart. Tokyo is demanding
recognition of its territorial claims. But before he left Russia,
Putin told the Interfax news agency that he would not bargain the
islands away.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute session Monday morning, Mori reiterated Tokyo's
1998 proposal of continued Russian administration of the territory
in exchange for recognition of Japanese claims on the islands, the
Japanese Foreign Ministry said. Moscow has not accepted that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Mori also repeated the goal of concluding a treaty this year, a
ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, however, was quoted as saying that while the Tokyo
proposal did not match Moscow's thinking on the issue, his
government was committed to continued talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders were to meet again in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Another top discussion item in the two-day talks is economic
ties. Russian and Japanese officials plan to sign a dozen
agreements, including a program on developing trade and economic
relations and a separate document on joint efforts to aid the
economic development of the Kurils.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Putin and Mori are expected to sign agreements on
cooperation in energy, Japanese assistance in dismantling Russian
nuclear arsenals and strengthening cooperation between the two
nations' border guards.
</P>
<P>
   Putin arrived in Japan on Sunday. Monday's meeting was Putin's
third with Mori this year and his second visit to Japan as
president. He attended the Group of Eight summit of world leaders
in July.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Party Faces Election Test  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   XALAPA, Mexico (AP) -- After stunning losses that cost it the
presidency and a key governorship, Mexico's ruling party appeared
Monday to be doing well in municipal elections in a core support
state.
</P>
<P>
   As results trickled in from Sunday's elections in Veracruz
state, election officials said the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, won back three key mayorships held by the leftist
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the vote counted in Minatitlan, Coatzocoalcos
and Orizaba, three of the most important cities in Mexico's oil
industry, the PRI won all three mayorships that had gone to the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position on the political landscape isn't for nothing,''
said the PRI's leader in Veracruz, Raul Ramos. ''It is owed to
intense work on the part of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, only 5 percent of the vote was counted, so it was
impossible to determine the PRI's fortune in most of the 210
mayorships and 45 state congressional seats up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was low -- 40 percent, according to estimates by two
major parties. Officials blamed heavy rain and a lack of
campaigning for many of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   There was also scattered violence in the south of the state.
Three people were arrested and at least 10 opposition activists
were injured in clashes at several polling places, election
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI needed a strong showing in Veracruz to prove that it
retained strength in at least one of its strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Recent elections have seen the party's power erode since Vicente
Fox's stunning victory July 2 that booted the PRI from the
presidency after seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the PRI lost the strongest of its strongholds --
the state of Chiapas, where an opposition coalition won the
gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI started losing its hold on Veracruz in 1997 when
opposition parties won 107 of the 210 counties. Many had speculated
opposition parties would gain more ground Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders accused the PRI of resorting to old tactics
to maintain power, and election officials admonished state
government officials for touting public works projects in the media
before the polls opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''This takes away from the transparency of the elections by
stooping so low,'' said Uriel Flores, a Democratic Revolution
representative.
</P>
<P>
   The state is governed by one of the ruling party's hard-liners,
Miguel Aleman, a powerful, former top executive of Mexico's
Televisa TV network and son of an ex-president whose last name
recalls an era when the party ruled almost without opposition.

Bush Stands by Debate Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- George W. Bush is standing by his offer for three
presidential debates, including one as early as next week, ignoring rival Al
Gore's quick rejection of his terms. ''I've laid out the debates we're going to
do,'' Bush told reporters late Sunday at an airport news conference here. ''He's
got his chance.'' But few in either party expected Republican Bush's overture --
or Democrat Gore's refusal -- to be the final word on debates as the campaigns
jockeyed for advantage. They were maneuvering to arrange terms that best play to
respective strengths of each candidate while exploiting the rival's weaknesses.

the piece of metal may have gashed a tire on the Air France Concorde, triggering
the chain of events that brought the supersonic aircraft down in flames in the
town of Gonesse, killing 113 on July 25.

Connecticut's governor the chance to give his seat to a Republican if Lieberman
wins the vice presidency. Connecticut Democrats nominated Lieberman at their
state convention July 14, three weeks before Democratic presidential candidate
Al Gore chose him as his running mate. Lieberman said Sunday that replacing him
by committee now would cause ''a lot of chaos'' for the party. ''The U.S. Senate
seat is too important to be filled on the run,'' he said. As chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., is
leading the party's drive to win the seats necessary to overcome the
Republicans' 54-46 advantage in the Senate.

Studies Support Moderate Exercise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harder exercise is better, but even moderate regular
exercise can reduce a man's risk of heart disease -- and the exercise doesn't
have to be done in one burst, new research shows. The findings, from a long,
large ongoing project, show a benefit that lasts over decades. And they support
federal recommendations that people should do 30 minutes a day of at least
moderate exercise, in at least 10-minute segments, most days of the week. ''What
we didn't know is, by adhering to this pattern of exercise, that translated into
long-term benefits,'' said Howard D. Sesso of Harvard School of Public Health.
He worked on two studies that were reported in Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association.

Negotiators Continue Tire Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- With Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and union leaders remaining
tight-lipped about their ongoing contract negotiations Sunday, it remains
unclear just how much the tire maker's recent high-profile problems have
affected its position at the bargaining table. A union spokesman denied that
last month's recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and a government
investigation into accidents allegedly related to the tires have changed the
nature of the contract discussions, which have been ongoing since March. ''The
negotiations started a long time before any of these issues arose,'' said John
Duray, spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America.

Bills Defeat Titans 16-13

   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills got their revenge against the
Tennessee Titans, but lost starting quarterback Rob Johnson to a left leg injury
in the process. Backup Alex Van Pelt hit Eric Moulds for a 36-yard gain with 50
seconds left, setting up Steve Christie's 33-yard field goal as the Bills pulled
out a 16-13 win over the Titans on Sunday night in a rematch of last year's AFC
wild card playoff.

U.S. Open: Norman Beats Mirnyi
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Storms came and went, day turned to night, and after more
than eight hours of playing, waiting and playing again in brutal energy-sapping
humidity, Magnus Norman barely escaped the biggest exodus of top seeded men in
U.S. Open history. His red shirt soaked as if he'd been swimming in it, Norman
fell to his knees and pumped his fist over and over to the feverish fans after
the final point Sunday night in a 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) comeback
against an inspired but drained and cramping Max Mirnyi.

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Opening day was a tough one for NFL quarterbacks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one winning QB, Jacksonville's Mark Brunell, passed for 300
yards, and it got quite ugly for several others.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leaf twice left the game with injuries and returned, but
gave up three interceptions and fumbled twice in San Diego's 9-6
defeat at Oakland. Jon Kitna was intercepted four times and lost a
fumble in Seattle's 23-0 loss at Miami. And Jake Plummer of Arizona
threw three interceptions and lost a fumble in Arizona's 21-16 loss
to the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody had a worse day than Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas QB was 0-for-5 with an interception that was returned
for a touchdown, and he left with the ninth concussion of his
career after he was sacked for the fourth time in the first half.
The Cowboys went on to lose to Philadelphia 41-14 at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was Washington 20, Carolina 17; Atlanta 36,
San Francisco 28; Detroit 14, New Orleans 10; Indianapolis 27,
Kansas City 14; Tampa Bay 21, New England 16; Baltimore 16,
Pittsburgh 0; Minnesota 30, Chicago 27; Jacksonville 27, Cleveland
7; New York Jets 20, Green Bay 16; and Buffalo 16, Tennessee 13.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is at St. Louis on Monday night. Cincinnati had a bye.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing debut for Dallas coach Dave Campo and his new
offense was made worse by Aikman's concussion. Aikman was taken to
a hospital for observation, then released.
</P>
<P>
   Also hurt was Dallas' new $42 million receiver, Joey Galloway,
who was carted off the field with a sprained knee in the game's
final minutes. Earlier, he provided the Cowboys' lone highlight by
catching a 4-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything good that could happen for them, did. Everything
bad that could happen for us, did,'' linebacker Dat Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   Duce Staley ran for 201 yards and a touchdown and had another 62
yards receiving for the Eagles, becoming the Eagles' first 200-yard
runner since Steve Van Buren in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The game kicked off in 109-degree heat -- 171 on the artificial
turf -- which would've seemed to favor the Cowboys. Eagles coach
Andy Reid, however, even had an answer for that: a combination of
water and pickle juice, a cocktail suggested by an Iowa State
trainer during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We loaded them up last night, before the game and during the
game,'' Eagles trainer Rick Burkholder said. ''We don't know why it
works, but we only had one cramp.''
Dolphins 23, Seahawks 0:
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Smith ran for 145 yards in his Miami debut, and the
Dolphins forced six Seattle turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   While Kitna struggled, Dolphins QB Jay Fiedler went 15-for-24
for 134 yards, with no turnovers.
Raiders 9, Chargers 6:
</P>
<P>
   Andre Rison caught a 10-yard scoring pass from Rich Gannon with
2:53 left for Oakland, which manhandled Leaf in his first NFL
regular season appearance in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf led the Chargers on 15-play, 80-yard drive to Robert
Chancey's 3-yard touchdown run with 9:41 left, giving the Chargers
a 6-2 lead. No one scored until midway through the third quarter,
when Darrell Russell tackled Chancey for a safety.
Giants 21, Cardinals 16:
</P>
<P>
   Plummer threw two touchdown passes to make a game dominated by
New York finish closer than it looked.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber ran for career-best 144 yards and two touchdowns,
including a 78-yarder, and rookie Ron Dayne ran for 78 and a TD in
a game delayed 23 minutes in the third quarter by a storm over New
Jersey.
Bills 16, Titans 13:
</P>
<P>
   At Buffalo, the Bills won the rematch of the ''Music City
Miracle'' against Tennessee as backup QB Alex Van Pelt set up Steve
Christie's 33-yard field goal with a 36-yard pass to Eric Moulds in
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Peerless Price had a 15-yard touchdown reception and Christie
hit two other field goals as the Bills opened the season avenging
their 22-16 playoff loss to the Titans, who won on Kevin Dyson's
75-yard home-run throwback touchdown return of a kickoff in the
dying moments.
Redskins 20, Panthers 17:
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing to a nine-year contract worth about $90 million,
Stephen Davis rushed for 133 yards and revived a sputtering
Washington offense at home.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's offense, ineffective most of the game, scored its
only touchdown on Steve Beuerlein's 20-yard pass to Wesley Walls
with 1:52 to play. However, the Redskins recovered the onside kick,
Davis took the next handoff and ran 33 yards.
Buccaneers 21, Patriots 16:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Alstott ran for two touchdowns, and Tampa Bay held on to
win at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun King passed for the other touchdown for the Bucs, who
ruined the debut of Bill Belichick as Patriots coach by holding
them without an offensive touchdown for nearly 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay sacked Drew Bledsoe four times in the first 15
minutes, but he came back to make it close with a TD pass to Terry
Glenn. The Patriots had a final chance to win, but Bledsoe threw
four straight incompletions, the last into the end zone on the
final play, after the Patriots reached the Bucs 22.
Colts 27, Chiefs 14:
</P>
<P>
   Edgerrin James ran for 124 yards and scored two touchdowns, and
Jeff Burris' fourth-quarter TD off an interception sealed the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Burris picked off an off-balance throw by Elvis Grbac and sped
27 yards for a score early in the fourth quarter.
Jets 20, Packers 16:
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown and caught a
2-yard TD pass from Vinny Testaverde with 3:30 left at Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre tried to engineer a comeback, but Victor Green made
an acrobatic interception at the 9 with 1:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, playing for the first time in a month after missing three
preseason games with a sore elbow, was just 14-of-34 for 152
yards.
Ravens 16, Steelers 0:
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's defense didn't allow Pittsburgh to cross midfield
until the second half and handed the Steelers their first
season-opening shutout loss at home since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Banks found Qadry Ismail on a 54-yard touchdown pass in the
first quarter. Banks was 18-of-32 for 199 yards in a turnover-free
Ravens offense.
Lions 14, Saints 10:
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Howard returned a punt 95 yards for Detroit at the
Superdome, where he returned a kickoff 99 yards for Green Bay in
the 1997 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit managed only a pair of field goals before Howard grabbed
a punt with 2:06 left in the third quarter and rambled downfield,
giving the Lions the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, with Stoney Case at quarterback for injured Charlie
Batch, had only 187 yards in total offense. Case was 13-of-25 for
100 yards.
Vikings 30, Bears 27:
</P>
<P>
   At Minneapolis, Daunte Culpepper ran for three touchdowns as
Chicago left the middle open to cover Randy Moss and Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th overall pick of the 1999 draft, who took just six snaps
last season, rushed for 78 yards. He also had a 66-yard pass to
Moss to set up a score.
Jaguars 27, Browns 7:
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brunell was 24-of-34 for 301 yards and one touchdown in
Jacksonville's win at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell completed eight straight to open the second half, when
the Jaguars scored 10 straight points following a crucial fumble by
Browns rookie tight end Aaron Shea.
Falcons 36, 49ers 28:
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson caught seven passes for 148 yards, while Ashley
Ambrose returned an interception 36 yards for a touchdown as
Atlanta won a shootout at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson, back from a knee injury, carried 24 times for 77
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Morten Andersen tied a career high with five field goals, all in
the first half, and broke Mick Luckhurst's team record for most
career field goals.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Attack Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Government troops launched a massive
attack on Tamil rebels in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, killing at
least 230 combatants on both sides, military officials and rebels
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops advanced on five fronts on the peninsula
Sunday, but faced tough resistance from the separatist guerrillas
during the 12-hour battle, said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. The group is fighting for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka, an
island country in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Eight army officers and 63 government soldiers were killed and
479 soldiers were wounded, military spokesman Sanath Karunaratne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil rebels claimed more than 100 government soldiers were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels did not mention their own casualties, but Karunaratne
claimed about 160 rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The military launched the offensive to boost its defense of
Jaffna, the former rebel capital that has come under government
control. The guerrillas have been trying to recapture Jaffna since
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Facing superior fire power from land and from air, the LTTE
combat formations are putting up fierce resistance inflicting heavy
casualties on the government troops,'' the rebel statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed thrust by government troops broke a four-month lull
in fighting on the peninsula. The rebels fired mortars Wednesday at
government defenses in Meesalai, 12 miles east of Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
   No independent confirmation is possible, as journalists are not
permitted in the war zone. Media censorship was imposed in May
after the military lost several battles to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil rebels seek an independent homeland in the country's
north and east, claiming widespread discrimination in education and
jobs by the majority Sinhalese. The government denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,000 people have died during the 17-year war.

<HEADLINE> Children With Bad Hearts Go to Camp  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOWLANDS LANDING, Calif. (AP) -- Four months after her
transplanted heart briefly stopped beating, 14-year-old Carina
Gonzales pulls herself up a 20-foot wall at summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   John Klymshyn, whose heart condition keeps him out of P.E.
class, snorkels and kayaks in the ocean off Santa Catalina Island.
And Adam Loyd, after eight surgeries and counting, burns up the
dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   For five days each summer, children with broken hearts can
forget about their cardiac problems and become regular kids at a
Catalina Island camp organized by volunteer doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just having so much fun I don't think about being sad,''
said Carina, an Arizona girl who may soon be listed for another
heart transplant because of the rejection of her first.
</P>
<P>
   Camp del Corazon -- ''of the heart'' in Spanish -- was founded in
1995 by a pediatric cardiologist and nurse who realized that more
than surgery and pills were needed for children who have lived most
of their lives in the shadow of death.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the program comprises two five-day sessions separated
by Labor Day. More than 200 children ranging in age from 7 to 17
paid nothing to camp with three doctors, more than 20 nurses and
dozens of volunteer counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Though some campers have overcome their heart problems, others
like Carina face more transplants, surgeries and other health
hurdles. A few must be fed through tubes; one a few years ago had
to be carried in a wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their medical conditions, most have never been to
camp before, said Dr. Kevin Shannon, one of the co-founders and a
pediatric cardiologist at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not different from a regular summer camp other than the
nurses, the medication and the medical backup,'' he said. ''We
consciously try to avoid trying to make this have anything to do
with the fact that they have heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly any child with a heart condition is welcome. Most enjoy a
full range of activities including volleyball, music, hiking,
kayaking, crafts and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon and cardiology nurse Lisa Knight started the camp after
a young patient said he was embarrassed by scars from three
operations. After Knight made a few phone calls, they were
organizing the first session for 49 campers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be good if he could meet other kids with
heart disease,'' Shannon said. Only a handful of other camps around
the nation cater to children with heart disease, and very few are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, individuals and organizations fund the program, with
a budget of more than $150,000. Doctors and nurses from UCLA and
nearby hospitals donate their time -- as do the counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon says the challenges are significant: Parents have to be
convinced the camp is safe, money must be raised and arrangements
made for medical equipment or helicopters to airlift sick children
when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's seasickness while ferrying the children to the
sheltered island cove 22 miles off the coast of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first year, everybody got sick. I was terrified,'' Shannon
recalled. ''All these children with heart disease getting
dehydrated, their electrolytes abnormal. I was thinking someone's
going down on this. But everybody did fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no children have died or even become seriously ill at
the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp infirmary, which rivals a hospital emergency room, is
loaded with boxes packed with pills and thick binders of medical
histories. It also has three beds, a defibrillator and other
equipment to keep hearts pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a lot closer to medical care than they would be if
they were ... playing in their back yard,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the medical staff and counselors do not focus on heart
problems, the topic arises among the campers. At night, Shannon
said he hears campers talking about having chest tubes removed and
other procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But the children seem more excited to talk about the climbing
wall or ''eagle's perch,'' where they are harnessed before leaping
off a pole suspended high off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the true camp experience, there are no soy
burgers or fruit cups here. ''We roast marshmallows. We eat bacon.
We salt our eggs,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The camp attracts volunteers like Linda deBeaumont, a
42-year-old mother who heard about the program while awaiting her
own heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of what I've paid to send my kids to camp,'' she said,
''and I know they don't get half of what these kids get out of this
-- a chance to just be kids, to get away and to not even think about
being sick.''

<HEADLINE> Sylvan Beach reopens, Verona Beach still closed after spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYLVAN BEACH, N.Y. (AP) - A swimming ban at Sylvan Beach has
been lifted, but the Verona Beach State Park remains closed over
health concerns following a sewage spill last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, officials said the discharge from the city of
Oneida's wastewater treatment plant into Oneida Creek, which flows
into Oneida Lake, was less than first thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 100,000 to 150,000 gallons was an initial estimate,''
plant Chief Operator Steven Skowron Jr. said. ''(Our best) estimate
now is that less than 50,000 gallons of untreated wastewater
spilled into the creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Verona Beach State Park and the village of Sylvan Beach
voluntarily closed their beaches last week on the advice of the
Oneida County Health Department. The health department advised
people avoid using water from any part of Oneida Lake for any
reason.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible Verona Beach could reopen later Monday,
officials said they won't be able to determine that until two
consecutive tests show up negative for fecal coliform.
</P>
<P>
   One set of tests showed significantly high levels of coliform,
said a health department Supervising Sanitarian Nick DeRosa.

<HEADLINE> Entertainment lawyer Robert Montgomery Jr., 77, dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. (AP) - Robert Montgomery Jr., an entertainment
lawyer to Andy Warhol and Marilyn Monroe and the trustee of the
Cole Porter Musical and Literary Property Trusts, died Saturday of
lung cancer. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   He was a partner at the Manhattan law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton &AMP; Garrison, where his career spanned 40 years. Among his
other clients were composer Andrew Lloyd Weber and director Louis
Malle.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery worked with Cole Porter before the composer's death
in 1964. He became the trustee for the property trusts in 1977, and
his job was to protect the integrity of Porter's work.
</P>
<P>
   He was credited with the current ''Kiss Me, Kate'' revival
because he toiled for many years in search of a producer for the
Porter show.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery was head of his law firm's entertainment division,
which he expanded to include clients from motion pictures and
television.

<HEADLINE> Crown Princess Victoria confirms she has boyfriend in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Crown Princess Victoria is going steady
with a New York City university student, but she's not ready to
talk about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old princess is dating Daniel Collert, 25, stepson
of prominent Swedish banker Goeran Collert and a student at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, it's correct, it's correct,'' the princess told the daily
tabloid Expressen when asked if Collert were her steady boyfriend.
''But all those rumors about marriage and such things are rather
ridiculous to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The court never directly comments on the royal family's personal
affairs, but spokeswoman Elisabeth Tarras-Wahlberg confirmed the
information published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The princess has been correctly quoted,'' Tarras-Wahlberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The princess and the student have known each other for seven
years, according to Expressen.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria, the eldest child of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen
Silvia, plans to visit New York next week to attend the Sept. 12
opening of the U.N. General Assembly. She will return to Sweden a
couple of weeks later to continue her royal duties as the heir to
the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria has studied at universities in Angers, France, and in
Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Closed Today  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial markets in the United States are
closed today in observance of Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks closed higher Friday in lackluster trading ahead of the
holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism was only slightly
dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.68 at 11,238.78,
after gaining 112 points on Thursday. Friday's gain helped the blue
chip index rise 46.15 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which also rose more than 100 points
Thursday, was up 27.98 at 4,234.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 3.09 at 1,520.77. The Nasdaq jumped 191.65 for the week,
while the S&AMP;P 500 rose 14.32.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investor hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets in recent
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped lift the Dow index
Friday. Vodafone Airtouch PLC rose $3.19 to $44.31 and IBM climbed
$1.56 to $133.63.
</P>
<P>
   But investors continued to slam Internet portal site Yahoo!
following an analyst's warning earlier this week that the company's
second-half earnings could fall off in the face of an expected
decline in advertising revenues generated by Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s stock, which has lost about 10 percent of its value
this week, was down $7.56 on Friday at $113.94.
</P>
<P>
   Internet parts and services companies accounted for much of the
Nasdaq's gains. Global Crossing rose $5.06 to $35.13, Commerce One
gained $3.47 to $66, and Lycos was up $3.63 at $74.63.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 3-to-2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 948.81 million
shares, well below Thursday's pace and one of the lowest figures
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index closed up 4.02 at 541.91.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.72 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.78 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.84 percent.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Waste Weed-Treatment, 1st Ld-Writethru,0233  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX, N.Y. (AP) - A common weed found along the roadsides of
upstate New York could save this village $1 million if used for the
treatment of waste water sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Under a recent village board proposal, solid sewage filtered out
by the waste water treatment plant would be placed in sand beds
containing phragmites, or ditch weed, whose reeds would absorb
moisture and nutrients from the material. The decomposed sludge
would be hauled from the beds at the plant to a landfill once every
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system - seen by officials as too expensive -
sludge is laid out to dry over sand beds and then brought to the
Oswego County Landfill, two or three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   That operation hasn't been cost efficient. Village officials
estimate that 80 percent to 85 percent of the disposed sludge has
been water, even in the warmer months.
</P>
<P>
   With the weed bed system, water would make up less than 3
percent of the sludge's moisture. The village of Phoenix would save
a substantial amount of money if the material is dried more
thoroughly before it goes to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   The village currently dumps more than 100 tons of sludge
annually in the county landfill, which charges $50 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation is
considering the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Former owner of Ott Chemical site not responsible for cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) - A California company that once owned the
former Ott Chemical facility will not have to pay the cost of
cleaning up pollution at a defunct manufacturing plant in Dalton
Township.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Douglas W. Hillman has approved a consent
decree that absolves Aerojet General Corp. and its local
subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Co. of Michigan, of $100 million in
cleanup costs at the Ott/Story Superfund site in Muskegon County.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman's ruling means another former owner of the Ott facility,
BestFoods Inc., could get stuck with more than $90 million in
cleanup costs not funded by the state of Michigan. If that company
succeeds in its legal battle to avoid paying, however, taxpayers
will get the bill, The Muskegon Chronicle reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before BestFoods can be ordered to pay for the cleanup, the
government must prove that the Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based company
was involved enough in the operation of Ott Chemical in the 1960s
to make it liable for environmental problems caused by its Muskegon
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at BestFoods, formerly known as CPC International
Inc., could not be reached for comment by the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Peden, site manager for Cordova Chemical at the former Ott
facility, called the court ruling ''thoughtful and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It serves to validate our record of exemplary corporate
environmental performance,'' Peden said. ''The road (to this
ruling) has been long and expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 24 ruling, Hillman said the consent decree proposed
by Aerojet/Cordova, the state of Michigan and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency was ''fair and reasonable'' and
will ''promote the efficient cleanup of the site.''
</P>
<P>
   BestFoods lawyers had challenged the proposed deal, suggesting
it was unfair and the result of collusion between Aerojet and the
government agencies. BestFoods is expected to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman dismissed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am satisfied that the government's assessment of
proportional responsibility and amount of damages is rational,'' he
said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Previous court rulings determined that the principle source of
contamination at the site was the use of unlined lagoons for
chemical waste disposal from 1959 to 1968. CPC International owned
Ott Chemical during part of that period, Hillman said; Aerojet did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and EPA officials have been trying since 1981 to make
BestFoods and Aerojet pay for the cleanup. In a case that went all
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal government claimed
BestFoods and Aerojet were responsible for contamination at the Ott
site because they controlled subsidiaries that owned the facility
at the time pollution occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Supreme Court ruling in that case limited the
government's ability to hold parent corporations liable for
cleaning up pollution caused by their subsidiaries. That ruling
forced the government to test its case against the court's new
standard for corporate environmental liability.

<HEADLINE> Frat brothers steal ''souvenirs'' from pop star's bus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Two Syracuse University students accused
of trying to steal some souvenirs were charged with burglarizing
pop star Christina Aguilera's bus.
</P>
<P>
   Collin Lynch, 22, and Adam Higgins, 20, who live at the Alpha
Tau Omega fraternity house, were charged with grand larceny,
second-degree burglary and third-degree criminal possession of
stolen property, all felonies, Sgt. Joe Sweeny of the Syracuse
police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, Higgins and other fraternity members were partying with
Aguilera's crew members on the singer's tour bus Saturday night
while it was parked outside a hotel on campus where the crew was
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera was in Syracuse to perform at the New York State Fair
Sunday, but she had to postpone her concert when she developed
laryngitis. The concert was to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The party on the bus broke up about 3 a.m. and everyone left,
Sweeny said. However, the crew members apparently forgot to lock
the bus and Higgins and Lynch decided to return for some mementoes,
Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Golf clubs, pyrotechnics and a gym bag worth more than $1,000
were stolen from the bus. The items were recovered at the
fraternity house, Sweeny said. None of the items belonged to
Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   The two students were being held without bail until arraignment
Monday in Syracuse City Court.

<HEADLINE> Investigators: missing Continental part matches one that gashed Concorde tire </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) - French investigators said Monday a stray metal
piece that gashed a tire of a supersonic Concorde in July - causing
a fire in the fuel tank and dooming the flight - apparently came
from a Continental Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Continental DC-10 took off from the same runway minutes
before the Concorde, which caught fire and crashed into a hotel,
killing 113 people, said France's Accident and Inquiry Office. The
Continental plane was bound for Newark, N.J., The Star-Ledger of
Newark reported in Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   A Continental DC-10 had a missing part ''which appeared to be
identical to the metal piece found on the runway after the July 25,
2000, accident,'' said a statement from the office, known by the
French acronym, BEA.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA's preliminary report on the accident, made public
Thursday, showed a picture of a bent metal piece 16 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   The statement Monday said a BEA official in Washington noted the
absence of the Continental part to the National Transportation
Safety Board and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The part was found to be missing from a space between a fan and
a door on the right-wing engine of a Continental DC-10, it was
learned earlier in Houston, where Continental is based.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA statement said a piece was missing from a hood on a
thrust reverser of the DC-10. It was not immediately clear whether
the two pieces referred to in Houston and Paris were the same.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have all along speculated that the part came from
another airplane. The picture shows a bent part, reddish on one
side and greenish on the other, with rivet holes.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA was convinced early on that the metal part destroyed a
left forward tire. Huge chunks of rubber were then thrust at high
velocity toward the fuel tanks in the Concorde's delta-shaped
wings, causing a fuel leak and a huge fire.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, filled with German tourists, dived into a small
hotel, less than two minutes after takeoff. It was the first
accident by the supersonic Concorde since it entered commercial
service 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The only two existing Concorde fleets - in France and Britain -
were both officially grounded in August until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde, which flies across the Atlantic at Mach 2, twice
the speed of sound, has been the most sophisticated form of
commercial trans-atlantic air travel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the BEA, Continental officials were cooperating
totally with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making no further comment,'' Catherine Stengel, a
Continental spokeswoman in Houston said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, BEA director Paul-Louis Arslanian
expressed hope that an airline would discover that one of its fleet
was missing a part.
</P>
<P>
   Runway 26, from which the Concorde took off, had not been fully
swept for more than 12 hours before the flight. The BEA statement
did not say exactly how soon the Continental flight took off ahead
of the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the time lapse amounted to ''several
minutes.'' That would eliminate pointing a finger at airport
officials for having postponed a cleaning to allow for a fire drill
on the runway. The postponed cleanup was briefly mentioned in the
75-page preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   The final report on the accident is not expected out for at
least a year.

<HEADLINE> Boring? N.J. man wrote the book  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - This is a boring story.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the son of a certified public accountant, a
62-year-old man who lives at home with his mother, spending most of
the day in front of his computer or reading books, waiting for
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   He's very excited about an upcoming study on how U.S.
Congressmen voted on issues concerning national sovereignty, runs a
public relations business out of his home, and doesn't like to go
to parties.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains a web site called ''The Boring Institute,'' a spoof
on boring things, places and people (see: ''Buttafuoco, Joey'').
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Forrest Gump, boring is as boring does. But don't
dare call Alan Caruba boring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a boring person,'' insists Caruba, a former newspaper
reporter and editor. ''I do well over 1,000 radio interviews a
year. I wouldn't be asked back week after week if what I had to say
on various topics was boring.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should know boring, it's Caruba. His ''Boring
Institute'' web site gets nearly 100,000 hits a month. On it, you
can find everything from the most boring celebrities of the year
(Hillary Clinton took top honors, followed by disc jockey Don Imus,
Bill Bradley and shirtless soccer player Brandi Chastain) to the
most boring films of the year (''Eyes Wide Shut'' and ''The Blair
Witch Project'') and a veritable potpourri of other boring things,
including the presidential conventions.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1984 when Caruba, a former reporter with the Daily
Record in Morris County, realized how many pop culture lists were
popping up in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were an awful lot of very predictable lists of 'Who's
hot and who's not' and 'Who's in and who's out,' '' he said. ''I
thought the one list that was missing was, 'Who cares?' ''
</P>
<P>
   So he put together a list of the most boring celebrities of the
year, topped that year by Michael Jackson, Andy Rooney and Walter
Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a lark, I sent it to AP and UPI and Reuters, who instantly
picked it up and put it around the world,'' he said. ''The reason
there's a Boring Institute is you just can't have Alan Caruba
saying these people are boring; you needed an organization to do
it. Since most people have never paid attention to my opinions on
any subject, I've had to rely on these organizational facades.''
</P>
<P>
   But then a weird thing started happening: People started
e-mailing Caruba for advice on how to beat boredom, sharing
complaints about their lives and asking for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''People started taking me seriously,'' he said. ''I got so many
requests for information about boredom and how to beat it that I
sat down and wrote my own guide.'' (Nursing homes are a big
customer, he said, displaying letters from senior centers to prove
it.)
</P>
<P>
   His advice is all his own ''common sense,'' although he did say
he ran his suggestions on beating boredom past a psychologist, who
approved. Tips include reading a lot, doing routine chores with a
positive attitude, and getting out and doing something different.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone take him too seriously, Caruba decided to run
for president this year as the candidate of the Boring Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've actually had people call me up and ask if I've registered
with their county elections board, which I think is hilarious,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign slogan: ''Elect me, and ignore me.'' The first
thing he plans to do after being inaugurated is install a pool
table in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried about splitting the boring vote with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's elected, I'm predicting mass suicides because Al Gore
is so unmercifully boring that the prospect of having to listen to
him lecture us as if we were 3-year-olds, stopping to pause between
each word, for four years is enough to make you want to kill
yourself,'' Caruba said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the great benefit of George Bush, who is interesting
because even he doesn't know what's going to come out of his mouth
at any given time,'' Caruba said. ''That makes him fun.''

<HEADLINE> Store owners: Pennsylvanians cross state line for liquor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRIMOS, Pa. (AP) - Out-of-state liquor store owners and buyers
aren't sure if state Liquor Control Board agents are enforcing
Pennsylvania's strict law against buying liquor in neighboring
states, but the PLCB leaves no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, we're out there. We're looking,'' said PLCB
enforcement agent Sgt. Stacy Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The border patrols work on a regular basis. There is no set
pattern but we do it on a regular basis. We might set up once and
then do it again two weeks later, or we might do it twice in one
week,'' said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   David Trone, co-owner of Liquor World in Claymont, Del., isn't
convinced. He said the state has given up on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zero effort is being made because Pennsylvania has finally
realized that it doesn't make sense to be known as a state that
arrests its innocent citizens for buying a product in their own
country. We live in one country, not 50,'' said Trone.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor World, a 20,000-square-foot store just over the state
line from Lower Chichester, is one of dozens of liquor stores on a
popular sales-tax-free strip in Claymont that seems destined to
attract Pennsylvanians. It even advertises in Pennsylvania
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania state liquor stores are the only place residents
can legally buy wine and spirits for their homes. The commonwealth
taxes the price of liquor with an 18 percent liquor tax and a 6
percent sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Stores outside the state often beat those prices, even though
the Pennsylvania state store system is the largest purchaser of
alcohol in the world. Delaware, for example, has no sales tax,
although it has a tax of $3.75 per gallon of liquor that is more
than 25 percent alcohol. Spirits less than 50 proof have an excise
tax of $2.50 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Buying liquor outside of Pennsylvania and bringing it back
across state lines can be fined in one of two ways.
</P>
<P>
   A violation of the Malt Beverage Tax Act is worth a fine of $10
per can or bottle of beer and $25 for each bottle of wine or
spirits. Violators who default on paying the fine are subject to
not more than five days in jail for each infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Violators can also be cited under Pennsylvania's Liquor Code 491
for violating liquor license laws, which requires a court
appearance and has a sliding fine, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the state has changed its enforcement methods, no
longer stopping violators in unmarked vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll go into Delaware or Maryland and monitor a liquor store.
We'll watch and follow people back into Pennsylvania,'' Marshall
said. ''We do not stop anyone until they're across state lines. We
keep them in eyesight until a state police trooper stops and cites
the individual violating the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Harmer, owner of Weaver's Liquors in Elkton, Md., said he
hasn't seen the PLCB since Maryland passed a law requiring agents
to register with the county sheriff's office two weeks before
staking out a liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't notified the sheriff's office in years. The last
time they were supposed to watch my store they never showed up,''
Harmer said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Haddonfield students seeking sponsors for college education  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) - Two Haddonfield teens are willing to
sell their bodies for a college education.
</P>
<P>
   Luke McCabe and Chris Barrett are offering to be walking
billboards for companies that will sponsor them and contribute
toward their tuition, room and board.
</P>
<P>
   The pair say that as ''spokesguys'' they'll put corporate logos
on their clothes, wear a company's sunglasses, use their golf
clubs, eat their pizza, drink their soda, listen to their music or
drive their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where we go, you go!'' they pledge on their Web site in a
pitch to potential advertisers. ''Sponsor us. We will eat your
cereal even if we're not hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Say, Pepsi were to sponsor us,'' Luke said in an interview
last week. ''We'll get everyone drinking Pepsi, or at least
watching us drink Pepsi. We'll have Pepsi parties.''
</P>
<P>
   They are willing to promote any products that are geared toward
college students, except alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they would be the first corporate college
''spokesguys'' in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who will be seniors this year at Haddonfield Memorial
High School, came up with the idea while touring potential
colleges, and realizing how expensive they are.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Diego is the first choice
for the friends, who would like to go to the same school. Tuition,
room and board there for out-of-state students costs $22,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Luke lives in Haddonfield and Chris lives in nearby Cherry Hill
- both pricey Philadelphia suburbs. They acknowledge that they're
not poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a handout,'' said Chris, 18. ''We could go out and
get a student loan or scholarship, but we wanted to try something
new and innovative. We'll be able to work for (the) company while
we're working on our degrees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Diego offers several
corporate scholarships, said spokeswoman Pat JaCoby. ''They don't
have to go out and find their own corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Luke's Web site offers a ''tour'' showing the various
ways the two could advertise for a company while at college. It
begins with pictures of them visiting ''Extremely Expensive U.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair is seen boarding a plane with the headline, ''We will
fly on your planes. We are always going somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later they're seen heading out surfing, with the words ''Your
Logo Here'' superimposed on a surfboard. Another photo shows them
in a shiny, blue sports car with the promise that ''Your ad will
have prime placement.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke, 17, has agreed to get a tattoo with a company's logo, but
Chris isn't willing to go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kaufman-Scarborough, an associate professor of marketing
at Rutgers University-Camden, said their idea is ''wonderfully
creative,'' but not without potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suppose I'm Domino's Pizza and I sponsor them, then Weight
Watchers come in,'' she said. ''Oftentimes when companies use
someone as a corporate spokesperson, they're very careful that they
represent a certain kind of image.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Luke said so far, eight companies have expressed an
interest. Most are ''dot-com'' companies from California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we get enough offers we'll see what company it would be
easiest to advertise for, first of all,'' said Luke. ''Then we'll
see the offers and money they want to put out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to put our cards on the table and see what we can do
for the companies,'' said Chris.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman-Scarborough said companies that want to sponsor the
students would need to draw up very careful agreements with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could get a lot of publicity, which would be advantageous
for the company, but the downside would be control possibilities,''
she said. ''Has everything really been thought through?''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were the student, would I be willing to conform my life
to whatever the corporate wishes of the company would be? Maybe
they wouldn't want me to be in a frat, or would want me to have a
certain major,'' she said. ''They need to think about conformance.
It's almost like the corporation would become the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, everyone is looking to have their education
financed. It's wonderfully creative,'' said Kaufman-Scarborough.
''If all the issues can be ironed out, there's a possibility
there'd be really good benefits on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Luke said their parents think the idea is innovative.
''But also we'll be saving them lots of money,'' said Chris, ''so
who wouldn't be happy?''

<HEADLINE> Saudis Behead Convicted Murderer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- A Saudi man convicted of murder was
beheaded Monday, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Khair Abdullah al-Harbi was executed in the western city
of Jiddah for murdering Ahmed Makhdoor al-Harbi by running him down
with a car, the ministry said, offering no other details.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's execution brings to at least 93 the number of people
beheaded in the kingdom this year. At least 99 people were executed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Executions are carried out with a sword in a public square.
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law, which
prescribes death sentences for murder, rape, drug trafficking and
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The executions have been criticized by human rights
organizations, which say Saudi Arabia often fails to give the
accused fair trials and point out that Islam calls for limiting the
use of execution as punishment.

<HEADLINE> Pope Defends Beatification  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II defended his newly
beatified predecessor on Monday, describing Pope Pius IX as a
misunderstood man who ''never failed to be indulgent toward his
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The noble-born, 19th-century Pius took delight in preaching ''as
a simple priest'' and going about to ''meet the people on the
streets of Rome,'' John Paul told pilgrims who lingered in Rome
after Sunday's beatifications.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul beatified Pius alongside the 20th-century's
much-beloved Pope John XXIII and three other church figures before
an estimated 100,000-strong crowd in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification, the last step before possible sainthood,
officially sets the subjects as models for the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups, an Israeli Cabinet minister and others protested
the recognition of Pius -- many calling it a misstep in the progress
John Paul's own 22-year papacy has made in Catholic-Jewish
relations.
</P>
<P>
   History's longest-serving pontiff, Pius was a rigid
traditionalist who maintained restrictions on Jews in Rome's ghetto
and condoned the taking of a Jewish-born boy, 6-year-old Edgardo
Mortara, who had been baptized without knowledge of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center kept up the protests Monday, saying
the beatification followed other, recent Vatican actions that upset
Jews, including the 1998 canonization of Edith Stein, a Jewish-born
nun who was killed in a death camp. Some Jewish leaders charged
that Catholics were denying Jews' disproportionate suffering in the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely worried about this direction,'' said Shimon
Samuels, the Jewish organization's director of international
relations in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''It violates the spirit created by His Holiness' pilgrimage to
the Holy Land and of other statements made by John Paul that in
this Jubilee year the slate should be cleaned of all controversies
in the Catholic-Jewish relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul visited Israel and Palestinian territories in March, a
highlight of a papacy that has seen the Holy See open diplomatic
relations with Israel and John Paul apologize for the historic
wrongs of Catholics toward Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-pontiff did not directly respond Monday to the
criticism of the beatification.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say that Pius IX was ''particularly attentive about
the Holy Land,'' and had wanted to re-establish the Roman Catholic
patriarchate in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In greeting the present-day patriarch, Archbishop Michel Sabbah,
the pope said he recalled ''with affection and gratitude the holy
places and the people I met during my recent pilgrimage in the Holy
Land.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's remarks on Pius' beatification Sunday stressed his
predecessor's service to the faith during a difficult and often
violent time of growing nationalism and anti-clericalism.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Monday of Pius' indulgence in the face of ''attacks and
slander.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews and other critics recall Pius in far different terms. They
cite contemporary accounts in which Pius allegedly referred to Jews
as ''dogs'' and quelled Jewish leaders' protests of the taking of
6-year-old Edgardo by threatening to force them ''back into their
holes.''

<HEADLINE> China Suppresses Political Dissent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Two years ago, a band of dissidents tried to form
China's first legal opposition party under communist rule. Now, its
34 leading members are in jail, prisoners of a ceaseless campaign
to prevent challenges to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   The China Democracy Party's surprising emergence and quick
suppression underscores China's scant political progress despite
two decades of free-market reforms and loosening social controls,
New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a report for release
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report was timed to coincide with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's five-day visit to New York for a U.N. summit. At the
summit, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has encouraged world
leaders to pledge to ratify basic U.N. covenants, human rights
agreements among them, if their countries have not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ''As President Jiang is feted as an economic reformer during his
visit, admirers should remember that in China, promoting political
reform remains a hazardous occupation,'' Sydney Jones, Human Rights
Watch's Asia director, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of a brief period of political tolerance and a
China visit by President Clinton, a group of dissidents publicly
launched the China Democracy Party in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, when the government jailed its most prominent
leaders, the party attracted 200 members and had organizations in
24 provinces, Human Rights Watch said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous attempts to form political parties, China
Democracy Party members tried to register openly with authorities,
appealing to rights under China's constitution and U.N. treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers included veteran dissidents, who combined their
organizing skills with the Internet to publicize the group.
</P>
<P>
   One founding member, Wu Yilong, made a 16-day nationwide
recruiting tour that the report called instrumental in setting up
provincial party groups.
</P>
<P>
   Wu did not use phones to contact potential members, often known
dissidents, for fear of police taps, and he did not sleep in hotels
because police routinely check registers, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government quickly signaled its intolerance and
tightened rules on registering social groups.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang vowed in December to eliminate groups fomenting
instability -- a euphemism for challenges to party rule -- demanding
they be ''nipped in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of trials that began in December 1998 and continued
into this year, courts jailed 34 China Democracy Party members for
subversion, Human Rights Watch said. Four others fled into exile,
it added.
</P>
<P>
   China has 200,000 social groups officially registered with the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, but not one independent political party,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch urged Beijing to release the 34 party
members, rescind laws that undermine freedoms of association and
expression and ratify two U.N. covenants on political and economic
rights that China has already signed.

<HEADLINE> For spot movement Mon. Sept. 4 for Tues. Sept. 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newcomb is a scenic, but sleepy Adirondack Mountain community
that is little more than a dot on the map between other dots on the
map like Long Lake and Winebrook Hills.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unlikely place, then, for a case that could have
ramifications throughout New York for both the way municipalities
tax property owners and how school districts spend taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   The Newcomb Central School District has had to defend in court
its plans to build a $1.2 million indoor swimming pool. The
proposal for the six-lane, competition-sized pool is one phase of a
$3.3 million expansion plan that includes improvements to the
school's gymnasium, stage and lockerrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other districts around the state, Newcomb
Central wants to take advantage of a soon-to-expire state program
which boosts the state's portion of building construction aid by 10
percent. In January, voters in the school district approved the
building plans, 158-101.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Finch, Pruyn and Co., which owns 53,000 acres of mostly
forestland in the town of Newcomb. The Glens Falls-based paper
company cuts timber on the land for its mills and also rents the
property to hunting and fishing organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, Pruyn argued in court that a $1.2 million swimming pool
for a school with 71 students in grades kindergarten through 12 is
''excessive and lavish.'' The company also is suing the town,
contending that its homestead tax provisions are rigged so that
residential property owners pay little tax and the few commercial
interests in town pay an unfairly high share of tax.
</P>
<P>
   A homeowning resident of Newcomb will pay about $22 a year for
the pool, Finch, Pruyn spokesman Mark Behan said. The company, by
comparison, will pay $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, Pruyn said it challenged the pool in court after it
became clear to the company that town and school district officials
would not budge on their pool plan. School leaders say the pool
will not only be invaluable at teaching youngsters in a town filled
with lakes and waterways to swim, but can also be used by adults in
town as a recreational facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We proposed alternatives - it would be less expensive to buy
every child a membership in a local YMCA for 10 years and to
provide transportation for that child than it would be to do that
project,'' Behan said. ''This is an excessively expensive way to
provide that service (teaching youngsters to swim).''
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court justice rejected the company's arguments,
saying an appeal the Finch, Pruyn filed before the state's
education commissioner questioning the appropriateness of the
Newcomb expenditure should be decided first. But Finch, Pruyn says
it will appeal the Supreme Court justice's determination to the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kearns, the superintendent of the Newcomb district, said
school officials throughout the state should be worried because if
Finch, Pruyn is successful in Newcomb, any corporate entity could
follow its lead and challenge public appropriations in the
communities in which they pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, once the will of the people has been
expressed legally, can you go over their heads and say what is
lavish and extravagant?'' she said. ''Who defines lavish?''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent said Finch, Pruyn is pursuing the case with a
deeper purpose in mind, to try to claim for ''big business'' the
right to oversee a government entity's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not unusual to try these cases in very small, vulnerable
districts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has cost the district more than $30,000 to fend off
the Finch, Pruyn challenge, money the superintendent said would be
better spent on educating students.
</P>
<P>
   Kearns said Finch, Pruyn (pronounced PRYNE) is misrepresenting
itself as shouldering the brunt of the school's budget. In fact,
the company paid 4.5 percent of the budget for the 1999-2000 school
year - about $90,000 - or roughly the same amount as the town's
residential taxpayers, according to the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New York, which has 62,000 acres of land in the
town, paid about $1.7 million or 85 percent of the school's budget,
Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, Pruyn also has asked state Education Commissioner Richard
Mills to overturn the results of the January election authorizing
construction of the pool. The commissioner has the power to throw
out the results of elections which are not properly conducted, but
Kearns said she doubts Finch, Pruyn can show that either the budget
balloting was improper or the proposed expenditures inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department spokesman Tom Dunn said no decision is
expected from the commissioner until late October or early
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Council, an environmentally minded lobbying group
in Albany, said it is watching the Newcomb case closely because of
its ramifications both inside the Adirondack Park and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The state School Boards Association is also keeping an eye on
the case, its spokesman David Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To permit one taxpayer in a district to overturn, in effect, a
vote by a majority of taxpayers or to nullify what they approved
would not be in the best interests of children,'' Ernst said.
''They say 'swimming pool,' but who's to say it couldn't be any
expenditure that some taxpayers are unhappy about?''

<HEADLINE> Monmouth University freshmen move into hotel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - Unexpectedly high enrollment and a
shortage of dormitory rooms has forced Monmouth University to look
to a nearby hotel to house incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The 120 students - about 10 percent of the incoming first-year
class - moved into their rooms at the Esplanade Hotel on Sunday,
and feelings were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accommodations here are much better, but I am a little
disappointed I am not on campus,'' Nicole Sagui told the Asbury
Park Press of Neptune for Monday's editions. ''I'd rather be in a
dorm, and my campus experience may now be a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a computer room, a pool, maid service, air
conditioning, and each room has a private bathroom. The
university's 13 dormitories, lack most of that - including air
conditioning - and students share a common bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unconventional housing, university spokeswoman Susan
Doctorian said Monmouth is doing what it can to make sure the
freshmen at the Esplanade have a first-year experience comparable
to their on-campus counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   She said the students, most of whom will have to remain there at
least through the first semester, will pay the same housing rate as
students on campus. They are the only occupants of the 100-room
hotel, which is slated to become an assisted living facility.
</P>
<P>
   A shuttle service will run during the week as late as 11:30 p.m.
Twenty-four hour security also has been provided, and the school is
planning to hold special events to keep students active.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response from both students and parents has been
overwhelmingly positive. Once they saw the accommodations, they all
responded in a positive way. We have had no complaints,'' Doctorian
said. ''Actually, we feel the students may really bond here and not
want to move back to campus, which might not be a good thing
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Incoming freshman Jackie Chafe said her main concern is the
distance to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It bothers me just a little to be living out here,'' she said.
''It's nice, but I feel I might be missing out on some of the
action and life on campus.''

<HEADLINE> Parole hearing scheduled for John Lennon's killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The man who shot and killed John Lennon
outside his New York City apartment in 1980 is scheduled to have
his first parole hearing next month.
</P>
<P>
   A parole board is tentatively set to interview Mark David
Chapman at Attica state prison sometime in October, state Division
of Parole spokesman Tom Grant said Monday. Chapman is serving a 20
years-to-life sentence at Attica for killing the former Beatle.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman gunned down Lennon outside the Dakota, a famous
apartment building in Manhattan, on Dec. 8, 1980, when the musician
and his wife, Yoko Ono, were coming home from a late-night
recording session.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, 45 is eligible for a parole hearing because he is
approaching the end of his minimum sentence of 20 years. If parole
is approved, Chapman could be released in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, a clerk in the prison's law library, has been
disciplined for only minor infractions behind bars. He also has
expressed remorse for killing Lennon, telling an interviewer in
1990: ''It was an end of innocence for that time. And I regret
being the one that ended it.''
</P>
<P>
   But inmate advocate Robert Gangi of the Correctional Association
of New York predicted there was ''not a chance'' of Chapman getting
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each case should be handled individually,'' Gangi told the
Daily News, ''but anyone convicted of the murder of a famous person
is probably unlikely to ever get parole.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ono will likely offer a victim-impact statement before the
hearing, according to her spokesman, Elliot Mintz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure she will have something to say on the subject,''
Mintz told the Daily News.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suspends Kosovo Jail Director  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The chief U.N.
administrator of Kosovo announced Monday that he had suspended the
director of a detention center after 15 Kosovo Serbs escaped from
the facility and warned that other U.N. personnel could also be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ''The escape is under heavy investigation,'' Bernard Kouchner
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easy to come from the international community and not be
responsible,'' said Kouchner, addressing past criticism of lax U.N.
performance in Kosovo. ''They will be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said he felt, ''humiliated, frustrated and guilty,
really guilty'' about the escapes Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, a local Serb leader, said that several of the
prisoners who escaped from the detention center in northern Kosovo
after overpowering the guards reportedly had fled out of Kosovo,
which remains a Serbian province despite U.N. and NATO
administration, and into Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Kosovo Serbs, most of them facing charges of genocide or
crimes against humanity, fled from the U.N. prison in the primarily
Serb part of the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica. Two were
caught quickly, but the other 13 remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt Monday to transfer the remaining Serbs from the jail
in Kosovska Mitrovica stalled after angry Serbs blocked the road
leading to the facility.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. police loaded about 15 Serb prisoners into vans for
transfer to an undisclosed detention facility. But the effort ended
after about 100 Serbs gathered outside, blocking NATO and U.N.
police vehicles inside the jail yard.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was defused after Serb civilians volunteered to
ride with U.N. police in the empty vans so they could be driven out
of the city without fear of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, hundreds of NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N. police used
dogs to track the escapees through a wooded area near the jail.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel called the incident ''extremely
serious'' and said it would damage the reputation of NATO-led
peacekeepers and the United Nations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The men had been held since NATO-led troops took over the
southern Serb province and have been awaiting trial as U.N.
officials struggled to organize a justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidence of the Serb people in the justice system in Kosovo
is exceptionally low. Those who have been sentenced prematurely
will resort to desperate means, do anything to escape an unjust
verdict without a fair trial,'' Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and NATO peacekeepers have controlled Kosovo
since June 1999, since the end of a 78-day air war that forced
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The escape occurred when a U.N. policeman was returning a
prisoner to his cell after the man made a phone call. The man's
cellmates overpowered the policeman, beat him and threatened him
with a gun that had been smuggled into the prison, a U.N. statement
said. They snatched the guard's keys and freed detainees from other
cells.

<HEADLINE> American Tourist Killed by Elephant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- A wild elephant killed one American
tourist and injured another during a wildlife tour in remote
northwestern Namibia, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hall was killed instantly and Dr. A. Said was hurt when a
rare desert elephant charged a group of tourists trying to
photograph it in the Huab River Valley on Saturday. No ages or
hometowns for the men were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports indicated the tourists had left their
vehicle and walked between two groups of elephants from the same
herd, said Ben Beytel, a senior official with the Ministry of
Environment and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Moving between the two groups could appear threatening to the
desert elephants, a rare subspecies that has adapted to the arid
conditions of the Namibian desert, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall died within minutes of the attack and Said suffered a
broken arm and a knee injury, said a medical air rescue worker who
spoke on condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's body was turned over to the U.S. Embassy, and Said left
Sunday night for San Francisco, said Dave van Smeerdijk, managing
director of Wilderness Safaris, the global outfit which led to
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour group got psychological counseling, van Smeerdijk said,
but most of the travelers continued with the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Beytel said Hall's death was the third in the region in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is the tourists forget that the animals are wild,
and that they are often spooked by people coming to close to
them,'' he said. ''We do not see the elephant cow as a problem
animal yet.''

<HEADLINE> Army Asked To Fight Mosquito Virus  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- In a sealed laboratory, scrub-suited Army
scientists are probing the mysteries of mosquitoes that spread the
West Nile virus, including one that could be especially adept at
transmitting the sometimes deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the U.S. outbreak of West Nile, which has killed
seven people and sickened scores more since it first appeared in
the country last year, depends partly on entomologist Michael
Turell and his six-person team at the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Disease at Fort Detrick.
</P>
<P>
   Their subjects include Aedes japonicus, an Asian mosquito
species relatively new to this country. Although the main culprits
so far have been common backyard mosquitoes in the Culex family,
scientists say japonicus may be more capable of carrying the virus
far from the New York City area, where all the U.S. deaths so far
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question it is going to be a player,'' Turell
said. ''But is its role going to be the 10th most important
mosquito or the second most important mosquito? That we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does it breed? When does it feed? What does it bite? Those
are the questions the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention wants answered.
</P>
<P>
   The agency asked the Army to join the West Nile fight shortly
after the virus appeared for the first time in the Western
Hemisphere last September, said Stephen Ostroff, West Nile
coordinator at the CDC. Scientists at Fort Detrick develop defenses
to germ warfare, but they also have battled outbreaks of Ebola and
other exotic diseases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The role that they are playing is a very important one,''
Ostroff said. The more the CDC knows about the mosquitoes that
transmit the virus, the better it can advise the public on how to
reduce the risk of infection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Rutgers and Fordham universities also are studying
links between West Nile and mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers call the mosquitoes ''vectors'' -- organisms that
transmit the virus by feeding on infected animals, especially
crows, and then biting uninfected ones, such as humans. Some
mosquito species are more competent vectors than others, and Turell
has found that Aedes japonicus is among the best.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests, japonicus has been four to five times more
effective than Culex pipiens in transmitting West Nile from
infected chickens to virus-free chickens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't necessarily mean japonicus is a competent
vector in the wild. Scientists know it breeds in old tires, which
puts it close to people, and that it feeds in the daytime. But they
don't know if it feeds in the evening, when crows are roosting, or
even if it feeds much on birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem of trying to find a fed mosquito in the middle of
a forest is extremely difficult,'' Turell said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, researchers found the West Nile virus in a few
swarms of japonicus mosquitoes in New York's Westchester County,
where one of the West Nile deaths happened. The virus also has been
found in at least five other mosquito species.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are intrigued by findings that japonicus and West
Nile share much of the same U.S. territory. In the past two years,
they have found the mosquitoes for the first time in most of the
seven states -- Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island -- where infected birds have
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty rapid spread for a mosquito in only two
breeding seasons,'' Ostroff said. ''If it continues to move at the
pace it appears to have been moving, the potential to carry the
virus farther afield is a cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are less concerned, though, about japonicus' ability
to transmit the virus to humans -- mainly because the evidence is
scanty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time West Nile and japonicus have ever been
in the same place at the same time,'' Turell said. He said the
mosquito isn't found in Romania or southwestern Russia, the sites
of other recent West Nile outbreaks. And in the Far East, where
japonicus is common, West Nile fever is rare.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff said he was gratified that while the virus appears to be
spreading among wild birds and insects, there has not been a rapid
increase in human infections. Seven cases of human infection have
been reported so far this year -- six in New York and one in New
Jersey -- with no deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always acknowledged there isn't any way to prevent 100
percent of human illness, but what we could do is work to minimize
the amount of human illness that we would see,'' Ostroff said.
''I'd like to believe we're actually accomplishing some of that.''

<HEADLINE> Philippines Won't Heed Rebel Demand  </HEADLINE>
By KOMAKO AKAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine officials said Monday
they will not replace the chief negotiator trying to gain release
of a U.S. hostage despite threats by Muslim rebels to boycott the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels rejected the government's selection of
Vice Gov. Munib Estino of southern Sulu province because he is a
local official. They demanded someone from the national government
be sent to negotiate the release of U.S. hostage Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 24, from Oakland, Calif., has been held for a week in
a jungle camp on Jolo Island, in Sulu, 580 miles south of Manila.
He is in a tightly guarded bamboo hut, rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is under full security. His hands are tied because two days
ago he tried to escape,'' Sabaya told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview arranged by the Mindanao Radio Network.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is on a hunger strike but is drinking water, Sabaya
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya also demanded that police free a suspected guerrilla --
whom Sabaya said was his grandfather -- before the group will begin
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday they had arrested a 73-year-old man suspected
of belonging to Abu Sayyaf and accused him of taking part in
kidnappings on the island of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   Sabaya claimed many anti-American groups have offered to pay the
rebels not to release Schilling, with the goal of embarrassing the
Philippine and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans should remember that it would be humiliating if
they get Schilling already a cadaver. It's better to talk in a nice
way, and they should not insist that the local government talk to
us,'' he said in an interview with the radio network.
</P>
<P>
   Pesidential press secretary Ricardo Puno said Estino will be
retained as negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that it is the Abu Sayyaf's option to determine
who the government will select as its negotiator,'' Puno said.
''The government feels that at this point the Sulu vice governor is
the best man in the situation to bring this process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, a Muslim convert, was taken hostage Aug. 28 when he
visited the Abu Sayyaf's camp on Jolo. The rebels kidnapped him
after he angered them in a debate about religion and politics, a
newspaper reported Sunday. The group is seeking an independent
Islamic state in the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's mother, Carol, said he has been living in Zamboanga
since March with a Muslim Filipino woman, Ivi Osani. The couple was
married in a Muslim ceremony, Osani said.
</P>
<P>
   Osani, who is Sabaya's second cousin and the widow of another
rebel, said she and Schilling were invited by Sabaya to visit the
Abu Sayyaf camp.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had planned to live together in California, according
to Schilling's mother.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 tourists and workers from Malaysia's
Sipadan diving resort on April 23. Some were released, reportedly
for a huge ransom paid by Libya and Malaysia, but the rebels still
hold four from the Sipadan group, two French journalists and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who came to pray for the hostages in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for a military attack on the rebels has grown. Puno
said the government ''is still interested in pursuing a peaceful
resolution'' but that ''other options will be considered'' if the
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was abducted by a more militant Abu Sayyaf faction
responsible for kidnapping about 50 schoolchildren and teachers in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Two teachers were beheaded after the United States refused the
group's demand for the release of several Arab terrorists from U.S.
jails. The faction also killed a Catholic priest.

<HEADLINE> Dietary Supplements No Substitute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nutritionists call the survey alarming: More
older Americans -- the people most at risk of cancer -- say they're
popping unproven dietary supplements in a quest for tumor-fighting
nutrients than trying to eat more cancer-protective foods.
</P>
<P>
   Add this newest trend to those hot fad diets and the nation's
rising obesity, and cancer experts are increasingly worried.
Americans don't seem to heed the warnings that what you put on your
plate day after day can truly influence whether you'll get cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Eating more fruits and vegetables just must not be a sexy enough
message.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why the food supplements industry is worth $40 billion
and why the (profit) margin on vegetables and fruits is so small
they don't even get advertised,'' Dr. John Potter of Seattle's Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center says in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   There's no proof yet that pills and powders prevent cancer, and
some supplements may actually increase tumor risk, Potter notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is of real concern. We need people to focus more on
factors we know are cancer-preventive,'' adds nutritionist Melanie
Polk of the American Institute for Cancer Research, which conducted
the recent survey of 1,010 people. More than half of respondents
over age 55 took vitamins specifically to lower their cancer risk --
and a quarter took additional supplements like garlic or fish oil --
yet just 39 percent preferred the proven method of changing their
diet.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday, the AICR launches a major campaign to teach
Americans what a cancer-protective diet literally looks like:
Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and/or beans should cover
two-thirds of the dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   That's not rocket science. But who even considers cancer when
they're deciding between a high-fat bacon cheeseburger or the
lower-fat grilled tuna? Or measures if that's a reasonable 1 cup of
spaghetti or a whopping 3 cups? Or knows a serving of green beans
is the size of half a baseball, or admits they count french fries
when asked how many vegetables they eat?
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention those high-protein fad diets. They do cause rapid
weight loss, Potter says. But ''we don't even know what the
long-term consequences are,'' he cautions. In contrast, cancer
experts recommend meat servings the size of a deck of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors play a role in cancer. Lung cancer, for example, is
the world's leading cancer killer and tobacco is almost always the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   But bad diets -- continually bad, not the occasional indulgence --
are a culprit, too. People could cut their risk by one-third simply
by eating more fruits and vegetables, concludes an exhaustive
scientific review led by Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Why? They're low in fat while high-fat diets are a risk for many
cancers. They're low in calories; being overweight significantly
increases cancer risk, too. Plant foods are full of vitamins,
minerals and phytochemicals that help the body defend itself
against malignant cells.
</P>
<P>
   A single tomato, whether fresh or brewed into sauce, contains
hundreds of phytochemicals like the antioxidant lycopene, linked to
reduced prostate and other cancers. Berries are high in fiber and
ellagic acid, another cell-protective substance. Carrots are full
of beta carotene; spinach has that antioxidant plus vitamin C and
folic acid. Cherries have quercetin, another potent antioxidant.
Grapes are rich in flavonoids that seem to fight heart disease as
well as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Add in whole grains like wheat and oats, rich in substances that
seem to impair cancerous cells' ability to invade healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't pills substitute? Food's magic seems to be the complex
interactions of dozens of phytochemicals, Polk explains.
</P>
<P>
   While 190 solid studies prove the fruit-and-vegetable benefit,
supplements have only a smattering of evidence, Potter says. Some
ultimately may prove to be cancer-fighters -- Fred Hutchinson is
about to test that in a study of 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But too much of one nutrient, or taking it without its companion
nutrients, can be dangerous, Potter notes. Beta carotene pills have
actually increased smokers' risk of lung cancer, and startling
research recently concluded cancerous tumors absorb vitamin C,
raising questions about megadoses.
</P>
<P>
   So what do cancer experts eat? Choices at an AICR meeting last
week: grilled tuna, high in ''omega-3 fatty acids'' that fight
heart disease and show promise against certain cancers. Couscous,
for high-fiber grain, with tomatoes and asparagus. Brown rice salad
with dried cherries, raisins, apricots and walnuts. And for
dessert, berry-filled tarts.

<HEADLINE> Diet Tips To Stave Off Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Just how many fruits, vegetables and whole grains
does a
cancer-preventive diet entail? And what size should each serving
be?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Institute for Cancer Research launches a major
consumer-education campaign Tuesday to answer those kinds of
questions. Among the advice:
</P>
<P>
   --Americans eat 148 more calories a day today than they did 20
years ago, contributing to the nation's obesity problem. Learn what
a proper portion size is by spending one day measuring certain
foods. Fill a measuring cup with cereal and remember how much room
it takes up in your breakfast bowl. A cup of pasta the size of your
fist could save 300 calories over a 3-cup plate. If you're used to
eating 3 cups, eat a little less each day to inch down to proper
serving sizes.
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure two-thirds of your plate is filled with fruits,
vegetables, grains and beans and only one-third is devoted to meat,
poultry or fish. Ask for a doggy bag up front in a restaurant, so
you take home the extra instead of feeling obligated to eat the
expensive meat.
</P>
<P>
   --Look for trade-offs. A fast-food burger at lunchtime is OK if
dinner is healthy. Or opt for a regular-size burger instead of the
quarter-pound version and save 160 calories right there.
</P>
<P>
   --Sneak in servings of fruits and vegetables. Buy pre-washed,
precut carrots and other vegetables at grocery store salad bars --
throw them in a stir fry or bring them to work as snacks. Slice a
banana onto cereal. Ask for extra tomatoes and greens on a deli
sandwich. Instead of a cookie, keep a bowl of berries on hand.
</P>
<P>
   --For a copy of ''The New American Plate'' diet brochure, call
1-800-843-8114, ext. 22, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT, Monday
through Friday. Or check http://www.aicr.org on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Census Gets Ready To Crunch Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Let the number crunching begin.
</P>
<P>
   With a survey of 314,000 households near completion, the Census
Bureau's focus now shifts from urging people to return
questionnaires and tracking down recalcitrant households, to
weaving together the statistical portrait of America it produces
once a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians will sift through data to check its accuracy,
while demographers analyze the numbers to search for trends. Are
people still fleeing cities for the suburbs? Will the minority
population continue to grow?
</P>
<P>
   The answers will tell new stories about the American population,
determine the redistribution of federal dollars and decide
political power among and within the states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably, the American public doesn't understand how massive
the processing effort is. The processing effort over the next
several months really is going to take up trillions of
calculations,'' Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bigger story lines is the nation's racial and ethnic
makeup. Estimates released last week showed that growth in the
country's minority population outpaced that of whites in the 1990s,
especially Asians (up 43 percent) and Hispanics (up 38 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The white population, meanwhile, grew 7 percent during the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Census 2000 data is expected to back up those estimates with
actual numbers for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very dramatic change in the makeup of the country,''
Prewitt said. ''I think Census 2000 is going to be extremely
important as this country holds up a mirror to itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The first results to be released -- the actual head count of the
nation's population -- must land on President Clinton's desk by Dec.
31. The Supreme Court last year ruled those figures must be used to
reapportion the 435 seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Population figures, adjusted by using a statistical method known
as ''sampling,'' are scheduled for release by April 1. That second
population total will be based on the survey of 314,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling has and will continue to face political scrutiny in the
months to come, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for people missed in
prior counts, especially the poor, minorities and inner-city
residents -- segments of the population that tend to vote
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling left open for states to decide whether
to use sampled data as the basis for drawing new political
boundaries. GOP leaders fear sampled numbers could lead to
districts with higher concentrations of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Other data will be released in waves in the months and years
following.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 million, or 66 percent, of the country's 120 million
households returned census forms, reversing a decades-long decline
in participation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people ... really committed themselves to the
census,'' Prewitt said. ''All of that effort really paid off in
terms of a good census.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans aren't quite as enthused.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, most vocally House census subcommittee chairman Rep.
Dan Miller, R-Fla., have questioned whether procedural errors in 15
offices may have affected the accuracy of data collected. And a
handful of former census employees have said they felt rushed to
complete their task of gathering answers from some of the 40
million non-responding households.
</P>
<P>
   One internal report concluded there were no problems in the
offices, while agency officials say data quality is never
compromised for speed.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also says 150,000 homes had to be recounted, including
64,000 in the Hialeah, Fla. area after quality control checks
revealed problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Miller has complained of the agency's lack of
cooperation with congressional overseers, and called for
investigations after several census workers in Los Angeles
participated in an event -- tied to the Democratic National
Convention -- designed to mobilize black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt has vehemently denied that agency employees acted with
any partisan intentions in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism ''is a necessary price the Census Bureau has to
pay to prove it is a transparent census and is a transparent
issue,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Iranians arrested in paint throwing incidents near the U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Four Iranians were arrested for throwing yellow
paint and another for disorderly conduct in separate incidents near
the United Nations, one involving the Iranian president, police
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests by a joint city and federal terrorist task force
came as more than 150 heads of state began arriving for this week's
UN Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Reza Eskandari, 44, was arrested at 4:10 p.m. Sunday for
throwing yellow paint at a car carrying Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami and Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda. The attack happened
at 53rd Street and the FDR Drive, shortly after the delegation's
motorcade left the United Nations building, said Det. Madeleine
Galindo, a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Police Officer Guy Braun said that in a second incident, Sedigh
Hamid, 42, and Mohammed Reza, 44, were arrested at 5 p.m. Sunday
for throwing yellow paint inside the lobby of the United Nations
Plaza Hotel, Braun said. The Iranian delegation is staying at the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In a third incident, 44-year-old Akbar Parizanani was arrested
soon after for throwing yellow paint in a plastic balloon at the
outside of the hotel, Braun said. Parizanani was caught by a police
officer, who suffered minor injuries in the ensuing scuffle.
Parizanani was taken to Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric
evaluation because he appeared to be emotionally disturbed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth disturbance near the hotel Sunday, Hojjat Hassany
was arrested for disorderly conduct after he got into an argument
and scuffle with several people at 44th Street and Second Avenue.
Police said they did not know Hassany's age.
</P>
<P>
   Charges in the incidents were not immediately known, Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know the significance of the yellow paint, but a
spokesman for the National Council of Resistance of Iran said
yellow is ''the color of dismay, the color of disapproval. It shows
the hatred of people against him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Khatami is so hated in Iran and outside of Iran because of his
abhorrent record of human rights,'' council spokesman Alireza
Jararzadeh told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He denied any involvement by the Paris-based group, which bills
itself as Iran's parliament-in-exile. But the group sent a press
release about Sunday's paint attacks to the AP in Switzerland,
where similar paint attacks on Iranian officials were carried out
earlier this year at a gathering of world leaders in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The council organized U.N. protests last year at which eggs were
thrown at the Iranian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Khatami was at the United Nations meeting with
several hundred Iranian-Americans. A call seeking comment about the
paint attacks from the Iranian mission to the United Nations was
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the other incidents, there were also three
separate bomb threats against the hotel, but the suspicious
packages were found to be harmless, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 91 demonstrations are planned for the gathering of
world leaders. The Sept. 6-8 summit is expected to attract more
than 150 heads of state and government - the largest number of
world leaders ever gathered in one city in history, said Police
Commissioner Bernard Kerik.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say they are confident the 41,000-strong
department - the largest in the nation - can handle any situation,
and they say there will not be a repeat of last fall's WTO
gathering in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Abdullah Seeks Mideast Peace Role  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- As far as Israel is concerned, Jordan is no
longer the Arab friend it was under the late King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein's son, King Abdullah II, ascended to Jordan's
throne last year, he quickly chose more Arab-leaning policies than
the late king, who had been famously friendly with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears, Abdullah has decided his choice was a mistake.
A trip to Israel last month gave the first hint of a move to bring
Jordan off the sidelines, back into Israel's good graces -- and back
into the thick of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether his efforts to switch gears
are sufficient and in time to protect Jordan's interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jordan feels that it has been marginalized with Egypt, Israel
and the Palestinians being the key players in Middle East
peacemaking,'' said Jordanian political scientist Labib Kamhawi.
''Therefore, Jordan is trying to make an entry through Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has legitimate reasons for wanting a role in the process.
Abdullah's kingdom is home to 44 percent of the 3.5 million
Palestinian refugees who have lost property and business in Middle
East wars since the creation of Israel in 1948. If violence erupts
in the West Bank over the snail-paced peace process, it could spill
over into Jordan's predominantly Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah spoke to the editors of Jordan's four daily newspapers
before heading on a foreign trip that was to include talks with
President Clinton at the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York. In a
transcript the papers published, the king said Jordan has ''vital
interests'' in the refugee issue and would ''cling to their right
to return and to compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jordan's ruling Hashemite family, descended from Islam's
Prophet Mohammed, is traditional caretaker of Muslim holy shrines
in east Jerusalem -- the main sticking point blocking a final
Palestinian-Israeli accord. And Jordan has the longest Arab border
with a would-be Palestinian state and must share an already
inadequate regional water resources with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When Abdullah visited Israel, he became the only Arab head of
state to go to the Jewish nation since the collapse of the
Israeli-Palestinian summit at Camp David. His visit was a bold move
reminiscent of his late father.
</P>
<P>
   But his trip drew a cool welcome from Israelis. For Abdullah is
not Hussein, the man whose frequent visits and personal attachment
to the Israeli people and their leaders allowed him to broker at
least two interim Israeli-Palestinian peace accords and sign a
peace accord of his own with Israel. In fact, some Israelis
perceive Abdullah's policies as pro-Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Days after visiting Israel, Abdullah sent his prime minister
after hard-line Jordanian unionists affiliated with Muslim
fundamentalist and leftist groups opposed to peace with Israel. The
prime minister, Ali Abu-Ragheb, warned the unionists in a public
meeting on Monday that he will not tolerate their anti-Israel
rhetoric, saying it ''violated the law'' and harmed the ''peace
treaty which we respect and are keen to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Jordan is an important pillar of the peace process and when we
talk about a comprehensive peace, Jordan must be incorporated,''
Abu-Ragheb told foreign media correspondents last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since ascending to the throne in February 1999, Abdullah has
kept Israel at arm's length while trying to restore Jordan's ties
with its erstwhile Gulf Arab bankrollers. They ostracized the
kingdom for its perceived pro-Iraq tilt during the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Abdullah was responding to concerns that Hussein's
alliance with Israel brought cash-strapped Jordan few economic
dividends. A recession is exacerbating Jordan's economic woes
stemming from $7 billion in foreign debt, the loss of its Iraqi
trade partner in 1990 and the end of donations from oil-rich Gulf
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   These days Egypt -- the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty
with Israel, in 1979 -- is the main Arab peace mediator. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has tilted toward Egypt because of its
historical support for the Palestinians and because the most
populous Arab country has considerable sway over Middle East
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has visited Egypt at least six times since the collapse
of Camp David on July 25 but has made no stops in Jordan. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak did visit Jordan, but just once. And
Clinton visited Egypt, but not Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Bride content with TV wedding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORAVIA, N.Y. (AP) - At least Melanie Nelson can say she picked
her own groom, even if all the other parts of her upcoming wedding
were determined by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 27, of Moravia in the Finger Lakes area and Peter
Ginsberg, 28, of Long Island will wed Wednesday on the NBC Today
Show. As winners of a 12-part series ''Today Ties The Knot,'' every
aspect of their estimated $45,000 wedding has been chosen by
viewers via the Internet and paid for by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind losing control of my wedding,'' she said. ''One
of our mothers would have taken control anyway ... and we're
getting the royal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC teamed up with TheKnot.com to orchestrate the wedding and
bring more users to the NBC and TheKnot Web sites. Nelson and
Ginsberg found out they won the wedding contest on June 27. More
than 1,000 couples applied.
</P>
<P>
   A different aspect of the wedding has been decided every week by
viewers. Everything but the honeymoon has been decided - and that
will be decided this Tuesday and announced Wednesday at the
wedding. Nelson is hoping the audience chooses Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who called the wedding series a ''fairy tale,'' said the
Today Show viewers have good taste and voted for the majority of
her favorite picks. She loves everything, she said, but would have
preferred different invitations and a different cake, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson doesn't have cold feet about getting married to Ginsberg,
she said, but stage fright is setting in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the normal jitters,'' she said. ''Am I going to trip
and fall? Am I going to stumble on my vows?''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is getting her master's in psychology at Columbia
University and Ginsberg is a trial lawyer in New York City. Money
is tight for them, Nelson said, so the free wedding and honeymoon
are a blessing.

<HEADLINE> China's President Heads to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Emboldened by President Clinton's decision to
delay deploying a national missile shield, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin intends to keep pressuring Washington to scrap the defense
system at a U.N. summit this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Friday that deploying a national missile
defense should be left to the winner of November's presidential
election came after China's most public diplomacy in decades: an
18-month campaign with Russia to rally world opinion against the
weapons system Beijing and Moscow view as a security threat.
</P>
<P>
   China's small community of arms control experts, which backed
the campaign in rare agreement with the politically powerful and
hard-line military, showed relief.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who wants stable ties with the United States but cannot
afford to look weak at home, left for New York on Monday in a
better position for talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton decision will put Jiang Zemin in a stronger
position'' -- not only at the United Nations but in a one-on-one
meeting with the U.S. president, said Yan Xuetong, an international
security scholar at China's elite Tsinghua University.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day U.N. summit, which opens Wednesday, and a
smaller but important Security Council gathering Thursday, Jiang
will confer with Russian President Vladimir Putin and lobby other
world leaders to oppose the U.S. defense plans.
</P>
<P>
   He will also court U.S. business leaders, whose investment is
crucial to keeping China's economy growing.
</P>
<P>
   As on his previous trips to the United States, Jiang will be
shadowed by groups protesting Chinese human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement plan
demonstrations of their yoga-like meditation exercises during
Jiang's stay in New York to highlight China's suppression of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his last U.N. summit five years ago when a crisis
over Taiwan produced a frosty meeting with Clinton, Jiang will put
on display a China more confident of its rising world stature and
its ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the U.S. national missile defense, or NMD, and a
more limited version for East Asia illustrates that change.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing fears that the anti-missile shields will render useless
its growing arsenal of missiles and force China into a costly arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed East Asian system, if extended to Taiwan, would
bolster the island against Chinese pressure to unify, China's most
sacred foreign-policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The apparent Chinese strategy is to whip up international
opposition in an effort to get the United States to cancel its
NMD,'' said Evan Medeiros, an arms control researcher at the
Monterey Institute of International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control tops the agenda for the Clinton-Jiang meeting,
their first in a year, Western diplomats in Beijing said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will try again to persuade Jiang that the missile
shields are not directed against China, the diplomats said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also preview the upcoming U.S. Senate debate on
China's entry to the World Trade Organization and hopes to persuade
Jiang to renew a dialogue on human rights, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the heat over missile shields, Jiang is expected to
try to advance the businesslike relationship he and Clinton have
tried to forge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on missile defense, China knows its influence over
Washington is limited and that the battle is not won. Clinton's
decision merely delayed deployment, and his possible successors --
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush -- are committed to
some form of national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a political decision,'' said Yan, the Chinese
scholar. ''No one can stop this project.''

<HEADLINE> Haiti Embraces New Fast Food Joint  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETIONVILLE, Haiti (AP) -- From the burst of air conditioning to
the bright walls of yellow, blue and red, Food Planet stands out
like an island of light in the gathering gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never traveled. But when I come here, I feel I'm in
another world,'' said Sandra Cayo, 30, a regular customer since
Haiti's first American-style fast-food restaurant opened a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a country besieged by social, political and economic
miseries, where many people can't afford to eat every day,
businesswoman Nelda Villard's decision to get into pizzas and
burgers indeed seems otherworldly -- an affirmation that all
appearances aside, hope is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, before opening for business, 35-year-old Villard
and her staff gather in a circle for a prayer: ''We offer the day
to God, and pray that Haiti will become the Pearl of the Antilles
that it once was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you love your country, you have to do something for it,''
said Villard, surrounded in her office by computers and monitors.
''If everyone overcame his fear, stopped complaining and invested,
things would improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Lebanese immigrant and Haitian mother, Villard
is from one of Haiti's more established families. That helped her
get a bank loan and to build on family-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the economy in shambles and the situation unstable,
it's a risk few would take. Many small Haitian businesses have
closed or laid off employees, victims of the political volatility
and violence that plagues the Caribbean nation of 8 million people
seven years after American troops invaded to restore democracy.
Studies show most Haitians would seriously consider leaving -- if
only they could.
</P>
<P>
   Food Planet employs 35 people working six days a week in
seven-hour shifts for 2,000 gourdes ($95) a month -- about triple
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except water and soft drinks is imported from the
United States. The sole concessions to Haitian traditions are a
side dish of rice and beans, and the island music that keeps
everyone swaying.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place of convenience in a land of bare subsistence;
parents can eat in peace while children clamber up a ladder to a
blue tunnel slide, ride hobbyhorses and eat on picnic tables
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The prices are beyond most people's reach. A medium
pepperoni-and-mushroom pizza costs $6.90 and a ''steack'' submarine
sandwich $3.60. Still, the restaurant has room for 100 people and
gets about 300 customers a day, Villard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is as good as in the States,'' exclaimed Jean-Claude
Filien, 53, a cell-phone engineer who has lived in New Jersey,
Florida and New York City. For his children Claude, 13, and Mindy,
14, the $2.60 cheeseburgers brought back memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's free parking and security,'' marveled Filien.
</P>
<P>
   Two red-bereted security guards with shotguns were posted
outside, a measure against growing street crime.
</P>
<P>
   Villard knows people who have been gunned down in daytime
robberies. Two years ago, a vengeful former employee of her mother
attacked Villard while she drove; blood ran down her face from the
forelock he yanked out of her scalp. Her 7-year-old son, who was in
the back seat, still has nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Villard hopes to repay her loan in two years -- but potential
pitfalls abound.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of her imported materials rises as Haiti's currency
loses value. In mid-August, cooking gas went up 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Petionville, a Port-au-Prince suburb of 200,000, gets only three
or four hours of electricity a day because the government can't
afford fuel for the power plants. So Villard installed two
expensive diesel generators that cool the air by day and keep the
lights on at night.
</P>
<P>
   Her phone doesn't always work, but her optimism is undimmed; she
plans to offer home delivery soon.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Repulse Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Fighter jets pounded Sri Lanka's
northern Jaffna Peninsula and government troops repulsed a Tamil
rebel counterattack Monday in a massive government offensive. At
least 344 combatants have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 other soldiers and rebels were wounded in the
government offensive that began Sunday around the city of Jaffna,
which the rebels have been trying to take since April and make the
capital of a Tamil homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The military said its offensive had succeeded. It said the
rebels were pushed from areas they captured in April and May in the
insurgents' offensive that brought them within miles of Jaffna city
before they were halted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aim behind our operation ... is to regain areas that we
had lost to the terrorists and also to create a bigger buffer zone
to protect the city of Jaffna,'' military spokesman Brig. Sanath
Karunaratne told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have achieved our aim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The army said that 114 soldiers had been killed and 766 wounded
since Sunday in the assault, led by MiG-27 jets, meant to increase
the security around Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   More than 230 rebels were killed in the army's ''Operation
Sunrise'' and at least 300 were wounded, military officials said,
citing intercepts of rebel radio conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has killed 1,380 combatants on both sides since
April.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fighting erupted as the army tried to consolidate newly
captured areas, said Karunaratne. The rebels attacked the new army
defenses twice, but ''failed to dislodge the security forces,''
Karunaratne said.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops faced tough resistance as they advanced
simultaneously on five fronts in the peninsula. But troops were
able to retake an area several miles east of Jaffna city, said
Karunaratne.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is the fiercest since May, when the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels began a drive to take Jaffna and
forced the military to withdraw into the city, which the rebels
controlled from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The military launched Sunday's attacks about 15 miles east of
Jaffna to dislodge rebels from their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said on their Web site that they resisted the attack,
but did not give their casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Independent accounts of the fighting are not available as
neither side allows journalists into the war zone. The government
imposed media censorship during the rebel advance in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels have fought
government forces since 1983 to carve out a Tamil homeland. More
than 62,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's battle forced thousands of civilians to flee their
homes to escape artillery fire, rebel sources said, quoting reports
from Jaffna. One source said at least 15,000 civilians had left the
area as of early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the army said civilians had vacated the region during the
April-May battles.

<HEADLINE> Poor Haitians Get More Bad News  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETIONVILLE, Haiti (AP) -- For Ghislaine Leveque there's going to
be less light, and for her children, no school.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-percent increase in gas and kerosene prices announced
Friday has Haitians anticipating the damaging social and economic
consequences in a country that political dictatorship and
instability has kept among the poorest on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last straw. I can't make ends meet any more,''
said Leveque, 36, throwing up her hands in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   She sells cups of rice, beans and cornmeal from open baskets on
the unpaved roadside in Petionville, a Port-au-Prince suburb where
broken down hovels rub up against mansions and the fancy shops
sprouting up to serve the elite.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Leveque's children will get to eat at any of
the new fast food restaurants in the same community where they
attended school last year. A medium pepperoni-and-mushroom pizza at
the new Food Planet costs $6.90. But for Leveque, new school
enrollment fees are too much. Costs have gone up from $36 to $48,
alongside the fees for school supplies and uniforms. Bus fare has
also risen.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, the beginning of the new school term, Leveque's
children stayed home, like many others across the country who
cannot afford the higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll lose passengers, but that's not all. If kids can't walk
to school, they'll just bum around and turn into delinquents,''
said bus driver Frantzy Baho, 41.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haiti is in a stranglehold,'' President Rene Preval said last
month, when he announced his cash-strapped government was ending
the bus subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke as Haiti's major donors -- the United States, Canada and
France -- threaten to cut aid because of alleged fraud during
elections that gave Preval's predecessor and mentor, former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, an overwhelming majority in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide is expected to win presidential elections in November.
Boycotting opposition parties say such a win could set the
Caribbean country back on the road to dictatorship, six years after
the United States sent troops to dislodge the military from power.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases and end to subsidies comes as Haitians are
at their most vulnerable, borrowing and scraping together money to
try to buy their children the education that they believe is the
only way to save them from poverty. Minimum wage has remained
unchanged at $1.70 since 1991 while the gourde has slumped from 7.5
to 21 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of Haiti's 8 million people live in absolute
poverty, half the work force is jobless or gets by with odd jobs
and the vast majority live with constant hunger pangs. Figures are
hard to come by, but the average income is estimated at $250 to
$400 a year.

<HEADLINE> Mom says inoculations against religious beliefs, judge to decide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge will decide whether a
5-year-old girl can claim a religious exemption and enter
kindergarten without required immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Turner filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a judge to
prevent the Liverpool School District from denying her daughter
Victoria's entrance into kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a member of the Congregation of Universal Wisdom,
claimed medications are against her religious beliefs and that the
district was violating her constitutional rights to religious
freedom. The state requires inoculations for schoolchildren, but
allows an exemption when there's a sincere religious belief against
them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frederick Scullin signed an order last week
allowing Victoria to go to school at least until the case is argued
in court Sept. 11. Classes begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool officials contend that Kelly Turner does not belong to
a legitimate religion and cannot use the religious exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the district's opinion that your belief is based on
science and/or philosophy, and not on religion,'' Liverpool
Superintendent John Cataldo wrote in a letter to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Cataldo said ''the Congregation of Universal Wisdom is formed by
a chiropractor, requires no real training for its ministers, its
members do not have regular contact with the leaders, and there is
no indication that it provides religious services for its
members.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For the district to pass judgment on the legitimacy of Kelly
Turner's religion is very problematic,'' said Samuel Young,
Turner's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the law is clear that when someone's beliefs
''embrace concepts of a higher power and are the type that one
would put ahead of one's own self interests, they are religious
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the Congregation of Universal Wisdom preaches that
the injection of any medication or other man-made substances into
the body would be a violation of the sanctity of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man-made medicine claims to heal, and to put my faith in a man
to heal me would be to turn from God and lose faith in God, and
that's sacrilege,'' Turner told school district lawyers at a
hearing in February. ''Nothing is to be injected into our bodies.
... That can result in physical, spiritual, emotional illness or
disease, or your natural balance will be off. Your openness to the
receiving of God will be interfered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said she has never given either of her two daughters any
medications. The girls have been treated with the laying on of
hands ''several hundred times,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner asked the district last year for permission to let her
daughter attend school without being immunized. Cataldo denied the
request and his ruling was later upheld by the Liverpool school
board.

<HEADLINE> Ruling adds caution to anti-smoking laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A handful of New Jersey towns considering
developing local smoking bans may have second thoughts after last
week's court ruling striking down Princeton's broad anti-smoking
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will certainly put a damper on and intimidate the
(communities considering new local smoking restrictions) from
moving ahead,'' Regina Carlson, executive director of the
anti-smoking nonprofit New Jersey GASP, told The Times of Trenton
for Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Bans are in place already in several towns, but none of the
existing anti-smoking ordinances are as sweeping as the one in
Princeton, which would have been the strictest in the state. It
prohibited lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces,
restricting smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors. Violators
faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 64-page ruling, Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda R.
Feinberg said the Princeton Regional Health Commission did not have
the authority to enact the ban for fire-safety purposes. The judge
also held that the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said a few New Jersey towns - including Cherry Hill and
Ocean City - had considered implementing a similar ban, but were
waiting for the outcome of the Princeton case.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City Mayor Henry Knight said the proposed anti-smoking
measure there likely will be dropped following the advice of the
city solicitor.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University law professor Robert Williams said the future
of anti-smoking laws in other towns depends on whether the decision
last Tuesday is upheld on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only one judge's decision until there's a more
authoritative decision from an appeals court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The health commission has not yet decided whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Create Blockades  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truck drivers angry about rising fuel prices
blocked oil refineries and fuel depots throughout the country in
protest Monday, triggering shortages and delays at many gas
stations as customers rushed to fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Striking truckers, who were joined by farmers, taxi drivers and
ambulance drivers in many areas, met with officials at the
Transport Ministry. But talks ended with no breakthrough, and
protesters, who are pressing the government to cut fuel taxes,
vowed to continue the blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll continue all night, tomorrow, until (the government)
makes propositions that address the seriousness of the problems
faced in the profession,'' said Laurence Del Chiaro, a spokeswoman
for the National Federation of Truck Drivers.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, thousands of vehicles had joined the protest
that affected 80 facilities throughout France, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With depots blocked, many service stations were running out of
fuel. In the area surrounding the southern port city of Marseille,
30 to 40 percent of gas stations had run dry, the regional police
headquarters said. In eastern France, many drivers headed to
neighboring countries to buy gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is chaos. Everyone's getting aggravated,'' said
Jean-Pierre Virtral, a gas station attendant in the southeastern
city of Cannes who said supplies were dwindling quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Only one refinery in the Paris region was affected by the
strike. At least one facility, a Total refinery in Lamede in
southern France, was under police guard at local authorities'
request. In the Mediterranean city of Nice, protesters blocked the
airport to prevent refueling of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Unions said the protest could last several weeks. With the
specter of a resulting nationwide fuel shortage, France's leftist
coalition government moved into action.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot met with the leaders of
each of the unions behind the protest, but the discussions failed
to ease the conflict. The National Federation of Truck Drivers
issued a statement saying it was more determined than ever to keep
protesting.
</P>
<P>
   French truckers say the cost of diesel fuel has risen 40 percent
in the past year to about $2.55 per gallon, compared to a current
average of $1.58 per gallon in the United States. After Britain,
France has the highest fuel taxes in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was inspired by a similar movement by fishermen last
week. After fishermen blocked many ports for days, the Agriculture
Ministry on Thursday promised to offset the rising costs of their
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fishermen, farmers and taxi drivers, truck drivers
receive little compensation for fuel taxes. They say fuel costs
them 7 percent of their revenues, when it should amount to only 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a profession that, today, is strangled,'' said Yvan
Battisatel, a truckers' federation representative.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Addressing Women's Rights  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's military-led government
has pledged to scrap discriminatory laws against women, combat
violence against them and promote female literacy, but hitting
these targets remains an uphill task in this poor South Asian
nation.
</P>
<P>
   A new national commission has started work this week to end
gender discrimination and protect women's rights, Shaheen Sardar,
the commission's chief, said from the northern border city of
Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's conservative Northwestern
Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing laws that are particularly harsh toward women and
implementing reform will require a lot of hard work and political
will, she said in an interview on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new government has been empowered by Pakistan's
Supreme Court to amend the constitution and enforce new laws --
without having to secure the approval of a parliament. The
parliament has been suspended since last October, when the military
seized power in a bloodless coup. The commission includes senior
government officials, rights activists and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top items on the commission's agenda is to curb
so-called honor killings of women by their relatives. In a country
where centuries-old tribal and feudal traditions hold sway --
especially in rural areas -- this will not be simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a most dishonorable act. It's a murder and nobody would
be allowed to get away with it,'' said Sardar, who taught law at
Peshawar University before joining the military government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike the past governments, we will take a firm stand against
the honor killings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 women were killed in Pakistan last year, either
for marrying men against the will of their families or for flimsy
reasons like talking to a man other than a relative, human rights
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   These killings are based on a ''suspicion of immorality on the
part of the victim,'' independent Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan says.
</P>
<P>
   Most such killings occurred in the Northwestern province, which
borders Afghanistan. Afghanistan is ruled by the orthodox Taliban,
who bar women from work and education and force them to wear veils.
</P>
<P>
   Several Islamic groups, especially in Pakistan's tribal region,
advocate a Taliban-like system.
</P>
<P>
   Foqia Sadiq Khan, a human rights activist, said the military
government's tone regarding women's issues is positive compared to
the previous government. ''But this regime has a record of bowing
to the pressure of religious groups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the military withdrew a plan to try to curb
abuses of the controversial blasphemy law, which carries the death
penalty for insulting Islam or its prophet, Mohammed. Since then,
aid workers say religious groups have been emboldened and stepped
up threats against people working for women and minorities' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giving lip service to women's causes is not enough,'' Khan
said. ''The issue is whether the government wants to take practical
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also aims to boost female literacy, which stands
at 24 percent compared to the national average of 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sardar said that in rural areas, where female education is the
lowest, people equate education with westernization. ''We have to
dispel this notion and convince people that depriving a girl from
education is against Islam's teachings.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Seeks U.S. Money Backing  </HEADLINE>
By JAVIER BAENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's finance minister traveled to
Washington on Monday to seek U.S. support for a $1.2 billion bond
offering needed to cover government expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The trip follows a request during President Clinton's visit last
week for U.S. tariff exemptions on Colombian textiles and clothing
as a complement to a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has argued it needs economic help in addition to
military aid to successfully combat drug trafficking -- the top U.S.
policy priority in the South American country that produces 90
percent of the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos was scheduled to meet
Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and request his
help in convincing lenders including the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank to back the planned bond sale.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. nod of approval will help ''dispel doubts in
international markets about Colombia's ability to pay its future
debts,'' Santos told the local Caracol radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The trip aims to ''restore confidence'' among international
organizations in the Colombian economy, said a statement released
Monday by Santos' office.
</P>
<P>
   A severe recession in Colombia has cut into tax revenues, and
some analysts believe the government will be unable to pay some of
its estimated 800,000 workers by the end of the year without new
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-led congress, however, opposes tax increases,
public pension cuts and state-owned enterprise selloffs proposed by
President Andres Pastrana, claiming these would unfairly punish the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Amid escalating violence in a 36-year guerrilla conflict,
Colombia has seen its currency sharply devalued during the past
year, foreign investment shrink and the country's debt ratings
downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. political support was critical to Colombia obtaining $6.9
billion in credits a year ago from the IMF, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's one-day visit, Pastrana said U.S. tariff
exemptions on Colombian products would create thousands of jobs for
workers who might otherwise find employment in the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> 'Bring It On' Lifts Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The peppy cheerleading flick ''Bring It On''
continued to make noise at the box office even as Hollywood quietly
ended a less-than-spectacular summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bring It On,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, took in $14.5 million
during the four-day Labor Day holiday to remain the No. 1 movie for
the second straight weekend, according to studio estimates Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The movie raised its total take to $37 million in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fun movie for back to school. It gets people into that
mode,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which
released ''Bring It On.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers held the other top spots, with ''The Cell'' in second
place with $9.1 million, ''Space Cowboys'' in third with $8.3
million and ''The Art of War'' in fourth with $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two new movies opened in fairly wide release. ''Highlander:
Endgame,'' with Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul in the latest
saga of the sword-fighting immortals, debuted at No. 5 with $6.4
million. The movie averaged $4,115 a theater in 1,543 cinemas,
compared with $6,017 in 2,410 cinemas for ''Bring It On.''
</P>
<P>
   The bawdy sex comedy ''Whipped,'' starring Amanda Peet, opened
well out of the top 10 with $2.7 million, averaging a weak $1,735
in 1,561 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Another holdover, the marijuana comedy ''Saving Grace,''
expanded from 255 theaters to 875 and did a healthy $2.9 million to
finish at No. 12. The movie pushed its total gross to $6.7 million
after four previous weeks in limited release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving Grace'' was one of the more expensive film deals from
last winter's Sundance Film Festival, with Fine Line paying nearly
$4 million. The movie stars Brenda Blethyn as a widow who grows
marijuana to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The film turned out to be a good buy, catching on with college
crowds and the over-35 audience, said Steven Friedlander, Fine
Line's executive vice president for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty equal between the younger audience that's into the
pot humor and the 35-plus couples,'' Friedlander said. ''You really
do get two separate audiences and two separate words of mouth from
people talking about the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the top 12 movies grossed an estimated $76.3 million,
down 16 percent from Labor Day weekend last year, when ''The Sixth
Sense'' still ruled the box office.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth straight weekend that revenues were down
compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   This summer finished down about 8 percent from the record $3
billion season Hollywood had last year. With higher ticket prices,
movie attendance likely was down 10 percent to 15 percent from
summer 1999, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office
tracker Exhibitor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're finishing summer on more of a whimper than a bang,''
Dergarabedian said. ''The summer paled in comparison to last year
but was still a solid summer. You just didn't have the overall
movie excitement necessary to generate a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Final
figures are to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Bring It On,'' $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Cell,'' $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Space Cowboys,'' $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Art of War,'' $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Highlander: Endgame,'' $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Original Kings of Comedy,'' $5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Replacements,'' $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''The Crew,'' $3.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Iran Considers Amnesty for Exiles  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A bill that would grant amnesty to Iranians
who fled the country because of anti-government activities or ties
to outlawed political parties is aimed at promoting national
reconciliation and attracting badly needed investments, a lawmaker
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow such Iranians to return without fear of
prosecution or punishment, said Elyas Hazrati, one of 40 lawmakers
who signed the bill. Only those who have used violence against the
state are excluded from the amnesty deal.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was submitted to the parliament, or Majlis, on Sunday.
To become law, it requires a majority vote there and ratification
by the hard-line Guardian Council, which acts as an upper chamber
of parliament. A Majlis vote is expected in November, after
committee debate, Hazrati said.
</P>
<P>
   Hazrati, a reformist lawmaker, said general amnesty legislation
has been a goal of the reform movement led by President Mohammad
Khatami. It wasn't clear whether it would become another point of
contention between reformists and hard-liners, whose control of the
Guardian Council could block the bill even if the
reformist-dominated Majlis approves it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill seeks to promote the culture of reconciliation and
not revenge, something that our country badly needs,'' Hazrati
said, adding that ''our national interests require us to facilitate
the return of expatriates.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the estimated 3 million Iranians who fled Iran
following the 1979 Islamic revolution were top scientists,
university teachers and wealthy individuals whose return could
bring tens of billions of dollars in investments as well as
technology to help Iran develop.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraq-based armed Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen
Khalq, which seeks the violent overthrow of Iran's Islamic
government, is excluded from the bill. The group fought against
Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and still carries out strikes on
Iranian soil from bases across the border in Iraq.

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It was a weekend pop star Christina
Aguilera would sooner forget.
</P>
<P>
   First, she lost her voice, forcing her to cancel a scheduled
appearance at the New York State Fair on Sunday night. Then
souvenir-hunters stole golf clubs, pyrotechnics and a gym bag worth

</P>
<P>
   Two Syracuse University students who had been partying with
Aguilera's crew members on the bus while it was parked outside a

said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the items belonged to Aguilera.

   Aguilera, whose hits include ''Genie in a Bottle'' and ''I Turn

<HEADLINE> Ike, Churchill Differed on D-Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Winston Churchill and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
were the best of friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Churchill's grandson recalled one disagreement between the
two leaders that became part of his family lore. To Eisenhower's
consternation, the prime minister announced that he wanted to be
aboard the lead destroyer going to the Normandy beaches on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eisenhower spoke to my grandmother, who invoked the king, who
wrote: 'My dear Winston, if you insist on going, I shall also feel
compelled to go as commander-in-chief of my forces,''' he
recounted. ''So that ended it.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's grandson -- also named Winston Churchhill -- and Mary
Jean Eisenhower, granddaughter of the late U.S. general and
president, met Monday in Britain's underground wartime headquarters
where much of the Allied war effort was directed.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower presented Churchill with a plaque inscribed with the
eulogy Eisenhower delivered at Churchill's funeral in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, 60, an author and former lawmaker, was honored for
his contributions to People to People International, an
organization founded by the late president to promote international
understanding. Eisenhower, 45, now heads the Kansas City, Mo.-based
group.

<HEADLINE> At Least 60 Dead in Burundi Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYENE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- At least 60 people have died in
fighting between Hutu rebels and government soldiers in the week
following the signing of a peace agreement to end Burundi's
seven-year civil war, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence continued Monday, a military official said: Rebels
ambushed two passenger buses, killing one person.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gabriel Gunungu, governor of Burundi's southern Makamba
province, said seven people were injured in the morning attack in
the area near the Tanzanian border. Rebel activity has been on the
increase in the past week in the area about 90 miles south of
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 30-31, at least 20 rebels and four
government soldiers were killed in a clash in the area, said an
official source who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the
Kanyosha region southeast of the capital, local authorities said
about 40 people had been killed since Aug. 31 in cross fire between
rebels and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, unidentified gunmen killed two civilians and wounded
two others on Sunday night just north of Bujumbura, local official
Janiver Rwimo said. Also Sunday, rebels and troops clashed in an
area 12 miles south of Bujumbura, local official Emmanuel Buragiye
said. He did not have any reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy fighting has been reported for the last two weeks in the
area, known as Bujumbura Rurale. An estimated 5,000 people have
fled.
</P>
<P>
   Military authorities declined to comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the fighting that erupted in October 1993 after the
assassination of Burundi's first democratically elected president,
a member of the majority Hutu community. Tutsis, who are in the
minority, have run the tiny central African country for all but
four months since independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence comes in the days after the country's Hutu
rebels and four of its 10 Tutsi political parties refused to sign
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was brokered by former South African President
Nelson Mandela, and the Aug. 28 signing was witnessed by President
Clinton. Burundian President Pierre Buyoya, who signed the accord
with misgivings, was joined by members of his government and the
National Assembly as well as Hutu political parties and six Tutsi
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya is to travel Tuesday to Gitega, Burundi's second-largest
city, to explain the peace accord to the public. He has repeatedly
called it ''an important step to peace,'' but criticized its lack
of a firm cease-fire arrangement as well as its failure to name the
person who would lead a three-year interim government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has called on representatives of Buyoya's government and
the main rebel groups to meet in Nairobi, Kenya, on Sept. 20 to
work out details. The four Tutsi parties that did not sign have
said they are willing to reconsider.

<HEADLINE> Russian Shell Parts of Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes and artillery on Monday
pounded suspected rebel positions across Chechnya amid indications
that the insurgents may launch large-scale attacks in the next few
weeks, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian jets and helicopter gunships bombed and rocketed
suspected targets in the south of the region, but there were no
indications of rebel casualties, said the officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Military units across Chechnya were put on increased alert
because of warnings that the guerrillas could mount major
offensives during the first half of September, the officials said.
Vehicles were given thorough checks at military checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has given repeated warnings in recent
months that the rebels are planning major attacks, but the
offensives have not materialized. The rebels mount almost daily
hit-and-run attacks on Russian outposts and convoys, causing a
steady stream of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Two servicemen from Russia's Federal Security Service, successor
to the KGB, were seriously wounded when their vehicle was fired on
after it ran over a mine near the town of Tsotsin-Yurt in eastern
Chechnya, military officials said. Twelve suffered slight wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials claimed they killed seven rebels in the
ensuing gunfight, but such claims are difficult to confirm and both
sides exaggerate the others' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, a school principal, her parents and her
sister were killed by unknown attackers at their home in Grozny,
the Interfax news agency reported Monday. The report gave only the
name of the teacher, Olga Klimova, and said her husband had been
abducted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops returned to Chechnya last fall to suppress the
republic's separatist government after being driven out at the end
of a 1994-96 war. The Russian military controls large areas of
Chechnya, but appears to be far from defeating the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Defends Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Myanmar's military government cracked
down on the opposition National League for Democracy and raided its
headquarters because of concerns it might be linked to
anti-government ''terrorists,'' a top official told foreign
diplomats Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Response from the party was not available because all its
leaders were being held incommunicado at their homes. But the top
U.S. diplomat in Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- characterized an
earlier government suggestion of the opposition party's ties to
terrorists as a fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win made the terrorism
suggestion at a series of meetings at the foreign ministry to give
the government's version of its latest confrontation with the
National League for Democracy. The standoff began Aug. 24, when
government security forces stopped opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi and 14 of her colleagues from traveling to the countryside to
do political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats provided accounts of the meetings to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At one of Monday's foreign ministry briefings, the government
accused an ethnic rebel group, the Karen National Union, and an
exile opposition group, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front,
of conspiring with National League for Democracy youths. It said
the groups were trying to smuggle five remote-controlled bombs into
the capital to carry out terrorist activities in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   The statement indicated that a dozen ''terrorists'' who came
from the area of the Thai border were still at large. It said that
to prevent possible acts of terrorism, the National League for
Democracy office had to be temporarily closed to carry out
necessary investigations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Charge d'Affaires Priscilla Clapp, contacted from Bangkok,
Thailand, said the charge that the NLD is linked to alleged
terrorist groups is ''a malicious fabrication.'' She pointed out
that the party has been carrying out nonviolent political
activities for more than a decade, and that Suu Kyi won the 1991
Nobel peace prize for such work.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD's most recent confrontation with Myanmar's iron-fisted
government began when the security forces barred Suu Kyi from
proceeding past a suburb of the capital, Yangon. Suu Kyi and her
group refused to return to Yangon and camped out for nine days in
their two vehicles in a muddy, mosquito-infested field.
</P>
<P>
   One of those involved in the roadside confrontation, party
Deputy Chairman Tin Oo, said Saturday that authorities had forcibly
returned the group to the capital the night before. Police chased
away reporters and sealed off his house before he could provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as they were returned to the capital, all members of the
party's central executive committee were locked in their homes and
the party's headquarters was raided. The headquarters remained
closed and occupied Monday by security personnel who have been
removing documents.
</P>
<P>
   Although sealed off from visitors, Suu Kyi is in good health
inside her Yangon compound, a party member said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has led the opposition movement in Myanmar since 1988,
when the military quashed pro-democracy demonstrations and asserted
its authoritarian rule. She has invited foreign pressure on the
military regime and has been rebuffed repeatedly in attempts to
hold a dialogue with Myanmar's rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The military held an election in 1990, but refused to allow
parliament to convene after the NLD won a landslide victory. Since
then, the party's members have been arrested and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Clapp said police have barred diplomats from even approaching
the homes of the NLD party leaders, whose telephone lines have been
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government says it's not house arrest, but to us it looks
like house arrest,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> NYPD officer's son dies from gunshot wound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) - Police were investigating whether the
5-year-old son of a New York City police officer fatally shot
himself after grabbing his father's revolver from the top of a
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   David Reveille died Sunday after being shot in the stomach in
his family's home 50 miles northwest of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Police in New Windsor said Monday they were investigating
reports that the boy used a stool to reach up to the top of the
family's refrigerator, where his father had placed his loaded
off-duty weapon, a .38 caliber revolver.
</P>
<P>
   The father, 38-year-old David Reveille, is an eight-year veteran
of the city police. He reportedly placed the weapon on the
refrigerator after returning home from a night shift.
</P>
<P>
   Police were told the boy's father was sleeping in an upstairs
bedroom and that his mother was upstairs working when the gun went
off in the first-floor living room area. The boy's wound appeared
to be self-inflicted, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not disclose whether the boy's three sisters - aged
2, 4 and 6 - witnessed the shooting. The investigation was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers called to the scene helped airlift the boy to
Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, where he was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   The family was greeted at the hospital by New York City police
officers and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said Veronica
Barton, administrative supervisor for Good Samaritan Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Wins in Lebanon Election  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- When Rafik Hariri resigned as prime
minister just two years ago, the Lebanese people were sick of the
construction tycoon they accused of spending the country into debt
and economic hard times. Now, they want him back.
</P>
<P>
   Official results released Monday showed a landslide victory for
Hariri in Sunday's nationwide parliamentary elections, making him
the top prospect for prime minister -- an appointment requiring a
Syrian endorsement Hariri likely would get. Hariri has said it is
too early to comment on whether he will seek the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri-backed candidates also won overwhelmingly, ousting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss and three members of his Cabinet from
parliament and bolstering Hariri's chances to regain the
premiership. And in south Lebanon, the results indicated that
residents rewarded Hezbollah and Amal for their guerrilla war
against nearly two decades of Israeli occupation that ended in May.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Hoss failed to deliver on pledges to deal
with Lebanon's recession. That made Hariri -- whose wealth, status
and charisma make him a powerful force in Lebanon even without
political office -- look more appealing than when he resigned in
1998 following a power struggle with President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is energetic, a construction magnate with powerful contacts
abroad,'' said Violette Balaa, an economic analyst with the leading
An-Nahar newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Voters had hoped Hoss would put a stop to the ''spending and
money squandering'' under Hariri, Balaa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That did not happen,'' she said. ''Many trust that Hariri
learned from his mistakes and would restore investors'
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria, the ultimate guide of Lebanese politics and policies,
essentially approves any premier in neighboring Lebanon. But that
shouldn't provide any problems for Hariri, a friend of Syrian
President Bashar Assad with professional ties involving vast
economic investments in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri made his fortune in construction in Saudi Arabia. He is
said to have played a key role in arranging a meeting between Assad
and French President Jacques Chirac last year and, this year, in
introducing the new 34-year-old president to other Arab leaders.
Hariri also handled construction of a Syrian presidential palace
during the lengthy rule of Assad's father, the late Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday evening with the British Broadcasting
Corp., Hariri downplayed Syria's role in deciding Lebanon's
political future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unfair ... to say they will have a say,'' he
said. ''We have institutions, we have a constitution and it has to
be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hariri emphasized he was not saying Damascus should
have a lesser role in Lebanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saying that we just made an election and there are so many
deputies and it is up to them to decide who is the prime
minister,'' he said. ''And this is the wish of Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Hariri's office refused interview requests with The Associated
Press, saying he would address the press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring his desire for the premiership could set up a clash
with President Lahoud, who must name the prime minister after
polling legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud, who was hand-picked for the presidency by Syria two
years ago, vehemently opposes Hariri. Lahoud had backed Hoss, but
he appears to have little option but to appoint Hariri if Hariri
seeks the post and his legislative allies continue their support.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement published in newspapers Monday, Lahoud said he
will abide by the constitution and consult with the newly elected
legislature on naming a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his 1992-98 tenure as premier, Hariri launched a
multimillion-dollar reconstruction program to rebuild Lebanon
following the 1975-90 civil war. The program initially revived the
economy, but he was criticized harshly as his tenure wore on for
saddling the country with $20 billion in debt and wasting public
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese had hoped the stagnating economy would improve under
Hoss, a veteran politician and U.S.-educated economist. Instead,
the recession deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss said Monday he would accept the election results, but he
told reporters he lost because ''money was spent to influence the
course of the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   In the BBC interview, Hariri called Hoss' accusations
''unfortunate. He lost the election, so I'm not going to comment
about what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Hariri also defended himself against the corruption accusations
that blemished his previous stint as premier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe there was corruption. ... We had to build the
infrastructure, we had to strengthen the army,'' he said. ''All
this costs money, which we don't have. So, we had to borrow the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In south Lebanon, an election coalition that included Christian
candidates, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's pro-Syrian Amal group
and its Shiite Muslim rivals of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah won
all 23 parliamentary seats. The Amal-Hezbollah alliance has not yet
announced whom it will back for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and Amal led a guerrilla war against Israeli forces in
southern Lebanon. Their increased popularity after Israeli troops
withdrew from the border zone in May, ending an 18-year occupation,
appeared to pay off at the polls. Hezbollah increased its number of
legislators from seven to nine.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - From the streets of Brooklyn to the suburbs of
Buffalo, Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio
kicked off a Labor Day push for votes Monday, marching in parades
where each received enthusiastic greetings from friendly
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day is usually the traditional launch of political
campaigns heading into the November elections, but both candidates
in this high-profile race have already been sparring for months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a rousing welcome at the 33rd annual West
Indian American Day Carnival Parade, where supporters by the
thousands shouted out ''Hillary'' and screamed in adoration. She
marched alongside former New York mayor and fellow Democrat David
Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love her, I love her husband,'' said Brenda Wallace,
clutching a Clinton campaign sign that she hoped to have
autographed. ''They are nice people, who work for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a canary yellow suit, Clinton zigzagged from curb to
curb shaking hands while her security detail strived to keep
well-wishers, as well as members of the news media, from getting
inside a roped off ''security zone'' that moved down the street as
she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had intended to march the entire length of the parade,
but after a mid-afternoon cloudburst, the first lady and her
entourage decided to leave the parade after about five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio marched alongside a group of prominent Erie
County Republicans, including party chairman Bob Davis, U.S. Rep.
Tom Reynolds and County Executive Joel Giambra at the Clarence
Center Volunteer Fire Company Labor Day parade near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young and he's got young ideas,'' said Henry Grajek, 74,
a retired engineer from Clarence. ''She doesn't know anything about
New York state. She just wants to get into it to say she's doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lang held out a Lazio campaign sign as the candidate
walked by and pressed him to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Write I promise,''' she instructed. ''Promise more money for
upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio obliged, signing ''I promise'' and his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's in writing,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explained, ''We just don't want the money all to land
in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Lazio returned to the New York State Fair in
Syracuse -- where his rival and her husband, President Clinton,
visited on Saturday. Lazio also had been to the fair two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the response has been overwhelming,'' Lazio said,
despite being accompanied by a crowd of only about 50 or so. ''I
stand on my own. I don't need somebody else with me to draw a
crowd. I have my own record. I have my own name. I don't need to
use somebody else's name to run in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, however, did mend some bridges. During his first trip to
the fair, Lazio casually mentioned he was ''so-so on the sausage
sandwiches.'' The comment had unexpected reverberations as it was
picked up by the local media. Sausage sandwiches are the unofficial
''fair food,'' and some likened it to going to Buffalo and saying
you are ''so-so'' about the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons both feasted on loaded sausage sandwiches during
their visit and on Monday Lazio headed to Basilio's sausage stand,
one of the more popular eateries at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sausage sandwiches are the fair. It's one of the reasons
people come here year after year,'' said owner Paul Basilio, the
brother of former world middleweight boxing champion Carmen
Basilio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one's for Syracuse,'' Lazio said before biting into a
sandwich overflowing with sausage, peppers and onions. ''It's
almost like momma used to make.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Parkinson's May Affect Heart  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a study that could help change how
Parkinson's disease is diagnosed, researchers have discovered that
the disease affects nerves in the heart as well as the brain.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for many years that the tremors and movement
problems associated with Parkinson's result from a loss of nerve
endings in part of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke report in Tuesday's issue of the Annals of Internal
Medicine that people with Parkinson's disease also have a decreased
number of nerve endings in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that Parkinson's may effect the entire nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may change the viewpoints about what Parkinson's disease
is,'' said the institute's David S. Goldstein, author of the study.
''What these findings indicate is that Parkinson's disease is
associated with a loss of nerves outside the brain and, in
particular, in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said it appears that other organs' nerve systems are
not affected, but further research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it turns out that the loss of these cells (happens only) in
the heart, then the key question is, what it is about the nerves in
the heart and the system in the brain that appears to make those
the systems that are destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart nerve damage differentiates Parkinson's from
conditions with similar symptoms, such as multiple system atrophy,
according to the study. Goldstein said that may help doctors
determine whether a patient has Parkinson's or some other disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Fred Wooten, chairman of the department of
neurology at the University of Virginia, said that while the study
was intriguing, putting it into practice in diagnosis may be
difficult because researchers used specialized imaging equipment to
see the nerves around the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see this becoming a widely used standard of
diagnosis,'' Wooten said. ''It's expensive. The equipment necessary
wouldn't be widely available. I'm skeptical that it will be
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooten said few Parkinson's patients exhibit noticeable heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''More often than not, there's no major problem with blood
pressure control,'' Wooten said. ''It's rarely a problem early and
can become a problem later on, but only for some patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the breakdown of heart nerves was
related to the disease itself, not to drugs taken to treat
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients with Parkinson's have difficulty maintaining
adequate blood pressure while standing up. The study concluded that
such problems happen as a result of the nerve damage, not the drug
levodopa, which is given to Parkinson's patients because of the
loss of certain brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   What the nerve damage in the heart means is hard to determine.

   ''There are functional consequences, but I don't think anyone
knows what those consequences are,'' Goldstein said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - From the streets of Brooklyn to the suburbs of
Buffalo, Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio
kicked off a Labor Day push for votes Monday, marching in parades
where each received enthusiastic greetings from friendly
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day is usually the traditional launch of political
campaigns heading into the November elections, but both candidates
in this high-profile race have already been sparring for months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a rousing welcome at the 33rd annual West
Indian American Day Carnival Parade, where supporters by the
thousands shouted out ''Hillary'' and screamed in adoration. She
marched alongside former New York mayor and fellow Democrat David
Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love her, I love her husband,'' said Brenda Wallace,
clutching a Clinton campaign sign that she hoped to have
autographed. ''They are nice people, who work for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a canary yellow suit, Clinton zigzagged from curb to
curb shaking hands while her security detail strived to keep
well-wishers, as well as members of the news media, from getting
inside a roped off ''security zone'' that moved down the street as
she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had intended to march the entire length of the parade,
but after a mid-afternoon cloudburst, the first lady and her
entourage decided to leave the parade after about five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio marched alongside a group of prominent Erie
County Republicans, including party chairman Bob Davis, U.S. Rep.
Tom Reynolds and County Executive Joel Giambra at the Clarence
Center Volunteer Fire Company Labor Day parade near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young and he's got young ideas,'' said Henry Grajek, 74,
a retired engineer from Clarence. ''She doesn't know anything about
New York state. She just wants to get into it to say she's doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lang held out a Lazio campaign sign as the candidate
walked by and pressed him to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Write I promise,''' she instructed. ''Promise more money for
upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio obliged, signing ''I promise'' and his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's in writing,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explained, ''We just don't want the money all to land
in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Lazio returned to the New York State Fair in
Syracuse -- where his rival and her husband, President Clinton,
visited on Saturday. Lazio also had been to the fair two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the response has been overwhelming,'' Lazio said,
despite being accompanied by a crowd of only about 50 or so. ''I
stand on my own. I don't need somebody else with me to draw a
crowd. I have my own record. I have my own name. I don't need to
use somebody else's name to run in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, however, did mend some bridges. During his first trip to
the fair, Lazio casually mentioned he was ''so-so on the sausage
sandwiches.'' The comment had unexpected reverberations as it was
picked up by the local media. Sausage sandwiches are the unofficial
''fair food,'' and some likened it to going to Buffalo and saying
you are ''so-so'' about the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons both feasted on loaded sausage sandwiches during
their visit and on Monday Lazio headed to Basilio's sausage stand,
one of the more popular eateries at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sausage sandwiches are the fair. It's one of the reasons
people come here year after year,'' said owner Paul Basilio, the
brother of former world middleweight boxing champion Carmen
Basilio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one's for Syracuse,'' Lazio said before biting into a
sandwich overflowing with sausage, peppers and onions. ''It's
almost like momma used to make.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo police Sunday charged two men with
arson and murder in the fire death of a West Seneca tavern owner.
</P>
<P>
   Police say 20-year-old Johnathan Spaeth of Sloan and 22-year-old
Daniel Mariani of Buffalo set the fire to cover the robbery and
assault of William Metzger, the 65-year-old owner of the Goldmine
Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   The two are charged with second-degree murder, first-degree
burglary and first-degree arson.
</P>
<P>
   Spaeth and Mariani reportedly entered the tavern after it closed
about 2:30 a.m. and confronted Metzger in his apartment above the
bar, beating and robbing him. The men then reportedly set the
building on fire before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Metzger died from smoke inhalation, his death was ruled a
homicide because he had been beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   West Seneca is 7 miles east of Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 6, Cubs 2  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Rookie Juan Pierre went 5-for-5 and Todd Walker
fell a single short of the cycle Monday as the Colorado Rockies
beat the Chicago Cubs 6-2 .
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who had three RBIs, and Todd Hollandsworth each homered
for the Rockies. Colorado's most prominent Todd -- Todd Helton -- was
0-for-4, dropping his major league-leading average to .387.
</P>
<P>
   Helton was hitting .397 a week ago but is 3-for-20 in the last
six games. He also continued to struggle against the Cubs; he is
2-for-26 against Chicago this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (3-2), acquired from Boston on July 27, limiting the
Cubs to two runs and seven hits in seven innings. He walked three
and had a career-high seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter Jon Lieber (12-8) gave up four runs and seven
hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked three as the
Cubs fell to 8-23 in their last 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-1 with two outs in the fifth, the Rockies took the
lead on consecutive run-scoring singles by Pierre and Neifi Perez.
Walker added a homer in the sixth and a two-run double in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who flew out in the second and tripled in the fourth,
didn't come to the plate again after his double, missing a chance
to become the fifth player in Colorado history to hit for the
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth hit a solo homer off Lieber to give Colorado a 1-0
lead in the second. It was his first hit in seven at-bats against
Lieber and his third home run in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young's RBI single tied the game in the third, and Ross
Gload's first major league hit, a solo homer, gave the Cubs a 2-1
lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Young stole his 45th base of the season in the third. He
has been successful on his last 19 attempts. ... Colorado has hit
at least one home run in all 32 games against Chicago at Coors
Field. ... Cubs OF Sammy Sosa robbed Jeff Cirillo of a home run in
the second, catching the ball about a foot above the top of the
right-field wall. ... Hollandsworth's 12 homers match his career
high set in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Opinion on Lee Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The judge who tried to release fired
nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee from jail on $1 million bail said the
government failed to present convincing arguments for keeping him
behind bars until he is tried.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee was to have been released Friday from the Santa Fe
County jail, where he has been kept since December in solitary
confinement. But an appeals court halted his release at the last
minute while it considered an appeal from the government.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker, in an unsealed opinion
released late Friday, for the first time outlined his reasons for
wanting Lee released, saying he was no longer convinced that Lee
had downloaded some of the country's most sensitive nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the government described in December 1999 as the 'crown
jewels' of the United States nuclear weapons program no longer is
so clearly deserving of that label,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Taiwan-born scientist, a naturalized U.S.
citizen, allegedly downloaded restricted data about nuclear weapons
to unsecure computers and tapes at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He has been jailed nine months awaiting trial, scheduled for
Nov. 6. If convicted of all 59 counts, Lee could face life in
prison. Supporters say Lee is being singled out because of his
race, which prosecutors deny.
</P>
<P>
   Parker refused last December to set bail, citing ''clear and
convincing evidence'' that Lee was a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing conflicting views over the importance of the
information Lee is accused of mishandling, the judge wrote in his
initial order for release Aug. 24 that the government ''no longer
has the requisite clarity and persuasive character necessary'' to
keep Lee jailed pending his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who set strict conditions on Lee's release, including
electronic monitoring and a phone tap, was critical of the
appellate court's decision. He said he would have rejected the
government's request for a delay if the appellate court had not
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   In the unsealed order Friday, Parker was even more critical of
the prosecution, saying it ''has failed, at this time, to meet its
burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he remains ''seriously concerned'' about some of
Lee's actions, such as failing to tell Los Alamos officials that
senior Chinese weapons scientists prodded him for classified
information during what the judge called ''an extremely unusual
secret meeting'' in Lee's Beijing hotel room in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, also pointed to testimony from an FBI agent
who acknowledged that several pieces of key testimony he gave
during Lee's first bail hearing was incorrect. The agent said he
incorrectly testified that Lee told another scientist he wanted to
use that scientist's computer to print a resume when in fact Lee
told the other scientist he wished to download files. The agent
also corrected testimony in which he said Lee sent letters seeking
an overseas job.
</P>
<P>
   Parker also said the conditions he required for Lee's release,
which would strictly limit Lee's movements, were enough to prevent
the scientist from passing on several of the computer tapes the
government says are missing. The defense insists the tapes were
destroyed.

<HEADLINE> German Heads: EU Expansion on Track  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German leaders insisted Monday that the drive to
enlarge the European Union remains on track despite an EU
commissioner's suggestion of a referendum on whether eastern
European nations should join.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther Verheugen, a German who is the EU commissioner
overseeing enlargement talks with a dozen nations, set off a furor
Saturday by saying that a referendum on expansion would force
German politicians to make their case more clearly to citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told German ambassadors from around
the world gathered in Berlin on Monday that Germany supports the
speedy expansion of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in remarks at the same
forum, noted that there is no provision for a national referendum
in the German constitution and ruled out the idea of a plebiscite
on EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the notion that Germany would change its
constitution to allow a referendum on having Poland, Czech Republic
and Hungary and other countries join the 15-nation European Union
was ''totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   With Germany in the throes of a national debate on how to combat
a surge of neo-Nazi violence and anti-foreigner sentiment,
Verheugen's remarks on taking the question of EU expansion to the
people came at a sensitive time.
</P>
<P>
   Also, referendums have been taboo in Germany since Adolf Hitler
used them to consolidate Nazi power in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown most Germans are reluctant to embrace Poland
and other East European candidates as European Union members,
partly because they fear an influx of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''How a referendum in Germany would turn out is easy to imagine,
given the anti-foreigner sentiment that is rife and claims new
victims daily,'' said Hans Modrow, East Germany's last communist
premier and now a member of parliament from the ex-communist Party
of Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder insisted a new, more multicultural German society
is developing, and he urged his diplomats to ''convey abroad the
image of an enlightened and tolerant Germany that is open to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not tolerate xenophobia and neo-Nazi violence in
Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer acknowledged that the case for European Union expansion
needs to be made to the people -- particularly in eastern Germany,
shut off by communism for decades and a breeding ground for
anti-foreigner sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the first group of new EU members should join by
2005 at the latest and include Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has set no entry dates, and the leading
hopefuls say they would like to join by 2003. However, a leading
German business group this year argued that enlargement should be
delayed until at least 2004-2006.
</P>
<P>
   EU enlargement talks began in 1998 with Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus. This year, Bulgaria,
Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta were added to the
list. Turkey is also a candidate, but entry talks are not expected
to open for some years.

<HEADLINE> Belichick Loses Season Opener  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Bill Belichick lost his season opener for
the second straight year. Whether he's an assistant coach or
running the whole show, the feeling is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Losses hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you feel any better when you lose as an
assistant coach,'' the first-year head coach of the New England
Patriots said Monday. ''I don't think winning as an assistant coach
or a head coach gives you any more satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it makes any difference whether you're a player,
coach, head coach, defensive coordinator, whatever it is. It's all
the same scorecard. You're either 0-1 or you're 1-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 0-1 because they lost at home Sunday to Tampa
Bay, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was 0-1 last season because the Patriots beat the New
York Jets, where he handled the defense as assistant head coach,
30-28, at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes not to be 0-2 after they meet again next Monday night
at the Meadowlands. He'll face the team he left Jan. 4, one day
after being named its head coach, but Belichick isn't focusing on
that bizarre departure. No matter who he's playing, getting his
team ready to win is his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big game. It's a division game on the road and that's
what's really important,'' he said. ''They're not going to have
everybody's personal record in the standings on Monday. It's going
to be where the Patriots are.''
</P>
<P>
   The game won't have the hype of past meetings when Bill
Parcells, who coached the Patriots to the 1997 Super Bowl, played
them as coach of the Jets the past three seasons. When Parcells
stepped down after last season, Belichick's contract automatically
made him the successor.
</P>
<P>
   Then he quit, saying he had misgivings because the Jets were for
sale. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and a federal judge said
Belichick couldn't leave. But he went to the Patriots after they
and the Jets worked out a compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   Now Al Groh, an assistant with Belichick on Parcells' Patriots
staff in 1996, is head coach of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other connections. Former Patriots Curtis
Martin and Vincent Brisby are with the Jets. Former Jets Otis Smith
and Bobby Hamilton are with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to liven it up,'' said Hamilton, a starting
defensive end. ''It's going to be a hyped game and it's going to be
a fun game to watch on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a cornerback picked up when the Jets released him on
their final roster cut of the exhibition season, downplayed the
importance of Belichick's move from New York to New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''That situation is done with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is busy with more pressing issues. On Sunday, the
offensive line allowed six sacks, running backs gained just 25
yards, and the defense failed to stop the Buccaneers in key
third-down situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to cause everybody some problems. They certainly
caused us some,'' Belichick said. ''There are a lot of things we
need to get corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets began the season with a 20-16 win at Green Bay, a less
talented team than Tampa Bay. Still, the Patriots are the only AFC
East team that's not 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's their turn to go on the road, but it won't be to a
strange place. They play at the Meadowlands every year against a
team they're very familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always exciting to play the Jets, especially that we're
playing on Monday night,'' cornerback Ty Law said. ''There's still
a bit of controversy going over there about the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick left in a hurry, Groh stepped in and both must show
they can succeed as head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than the players, the coaching staffs have a lot to prove
to themselves,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick doesn't see the game as a personal issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've moved on,'' he said. ''Every team we play we want to
beat. It doesn't make any difference who they are.''

   Close said Monday his group would be prepared if police tried to
break up the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the boys will have spears and nulla-nullas (Aboriginal
clubs) with them,'' he said. ''We'll go in fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday night that protests at Olympic Park were
unlikely to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Close also said he is organizing an indigenous ceremony in
Parramatta at sunset Thursday to welcome Olympic visitors with
song, dance and a fashion parade.
</P>
<P>
   Police have granted another group of Aboriginal activists
permission to protest outside Sydney Airport in the days leading up
to the Olympic Games. Protesters will form a human chain in streets
near the airport on Sept. 10-14 to highlight the treatment of
Aborigines in Australia.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Jose Mercedes won for the eighth time in nine
decisions since the All-Star break, leading the Baltimore Orioles
to a 3-2 win over the Minnesota Twins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes (11-5), the only Orioles starter with a winning record,
allowed one run and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings. His second-half
record is tied for the best mark in the AL with Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes, coming off a two-hitter against Detroit, walked one
and struck out five. The only run he allowed came on a homer by
David Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kohlmeier pitched the ninth for Baltimore and earned his
ninth save in as many tries. With the bases loaded and one out,
Kohlmeier struck out Cristian Guzman and got Matt Lawton to fly out
to the fence in right-center to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mark Redman (12-8) gave up eight hits and two runs in
seven innings for the Twins, who lost for the fifth time in six
games. Redman, who leads majors in wins by a rookie, lost his
second straight game after winning seven of his previous nine
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson's RBI single in the fifth snapped a 1-1 tie.
Anderson's hit scored Mark Lewis, who had singled and stolen
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles added another run in the eighth on a sacrifice fly
by Jeff Conine to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore needed it because Minnesota came back with a run in
the bottom half against reliever Buddy Groom. Guzman hit his second
double of the game, took third on a groundout and scored when Ron
Coomer reached on a throwing error by Lewis at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz hit his ninth home run in the fourth, a 412-foot upper
deck shot, to tie the game at 1. Baltimore had scored in the top of
the inning on a bloop single by Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields had three singles for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken was robbed of an extra-base hit in the second inning
when Corey Koskie made a diving stab of a grounder over third base
and threw out Ripken at first. ... When outfielder Karim Garcia
makes his debut for the Orioles, he will be the 49th player used by
Baltimore this year, second-most in club history. ... Guzman, who
leads the majors with 19 triples, tried to stretch a double to the
left field corner into a triple in the first inning, but was thrown
out at third. ... Twins manager Tom Kelly wants his 2001 contract
status to be settled before the end of this season and team CEO
Chris Clouser says that is possible: ''I'm sure we will be meeting
with Tom in the near future,'' Clouser said.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Peace Talk Time Runs Short  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned
Monday that he will only give a Mideast peace treaty a few weeks to
be concluded, raising the possibility of failure ahead of crucial
talks with President Clinton during this week's U.N. summit.
</P>
<P>
   The formal deadline for a treaty, Sept. 13, is widely expected
to be missed. The real target date for Barak is the end of October
when an increasingly hostile Israeli parliament reconvenes.
Lawmakers are expected to try to topple him because of concessions
he has already made to the Palestinians. With a treaty in hand, he
could seize the initiative and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said it is now up to the Palestinians to compromise,
and Israel's Foreign Ministry said Monday the prime minister is not
planning to present new ideas to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president was to hold separate talks Wednesday with Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as part of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving in New York for the summit, Barak headed
for U.N. headquarters to meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. As
he entered the building, a reporter noted that it was a historic
time and a historic place for historic decisions, and asked what he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do hope and I pray, but I don't know,'' Barak replied.
</P>
<P>
   In their talks with Clinton, Barak and Arafat are expected to
respond to U.S. compromise proposals presented to them last week by
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, said a senior Palestinian official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides described the sessions with Clinton as a
make-or-break moment in the tortuous peace process which began with
a mutual recognition treaty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, Barak said a crossroad has been reached
in talks with the Palestinians, and that while opportunities were
great, time for concluding a deal was running short.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not have to be a matter of days, but it cannot be a
matter of months. We are talking about a few weeks,'' said Barak,
who is one of more than 150 world leaders in New York for the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official, speaking aboard Barak's plane en
route to New York, said on condition he not be named that if it
became apparent in the next few weeks that peace options have been
exhausted, the prime minister would invite hawkish opposition
parties into his government. Such a secular coalition could pursue
what Barak has termed a ''civic revolution'' that would lessen the
power of religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Aburdeneh also said the this week was
decisive. ''Either we reach a formula that we can build on and the
negotiations resume, or we reach a deadlock,'' Aburdeneh said,
speaking from Arafat's headquarters in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   Aburdeneh would not rule out a Clinton-Barak-Arafat meeting, or
talks between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in New York if a
formula was found.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult issue on the agenda is Jerusalem, with Arafat
insisting on sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, including holy shrines sacred to Muslims and Jews. Barak
has offered Arafat some control in east Jerusalem, home to more
than 200,000 Palestinians, but not over the holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the failed Mideast summit in Camp David in July, negotiators
closed some gaps on the future borders of a Palestinian state and
the fate of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but
nothing was put on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Camp David, both sides have accused each other of
intransigence, and have sought international backing for their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. summit is an opportunity for both Barak and Arafat to
intensify their diplomatic offensive and try to deflect blame for a
possible breakdown of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was to head back to the Gaza Strip in time for a weekend
gathering of the PLO's policy-making Central Council, which was to
set a date for a proclamation of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he could declare independence as early as Sept.
13, the deadline for a peace treaty, but has suggested a delay was
likely, apparently so as not to endanger negotiations with Israel.
Palestinian officials have suggested Nov. 15 as a possible new
date.

<HEADLINE> Beatles' New Book Answers Questions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new book by the surviving members of the Beatles
seeks to put an end to questions over the group's demise, saying it
was definitely John Lennon who called it quits first.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Beatles Anthology'' -- excerpts of which were published
in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper this week -- Sir Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr aim to set the record
straight about the band's journey from Liverpool teen-agers to rock
legends.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published in Britain and the United States in October,
is the product of six years of work by the trio, the Sunday
Telegraph said when it announced the project last spring.
McCartney, 57, Harrison, 57, and Starr, 59, have collected 1,200
photographs, mostly unpublished, for the book, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts published this week, the three recall how Lennon
was the first to quit the band, leaving to record with Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, whom some people believe spurred the breakup, simply
made the public announcement of the split several months later in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''John was a bit annoyed with me because I think he wanted to be
the one to tell anyone -- or not tell them,'' McCartney said in the
excerpt.
</P>
<P>
   The band members also speak frankly about their drug consumption
and their experience as wide-eyed teen-agers performing in
Hamburg's seedy Reeperbahn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamburg was quite an eye-opener,'' said McCartney in the
excerpt. ''We went as kids and came back as ... old kids!
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a sex shock,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The book reveals that the band members continue to differ over
key events in the band's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the group finished the minute John said, 'I'm
leaving,''' said McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Starr disagreed: ''There was always the possibility that we
could have carried on,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also show that tensions among the trio have not
evaporated in the three decades since the band split up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul has a way of using stuff,'' said Harrison. ''I mean, even
now, if he's going to do a tour he'll conveniently tell the press
that we're all getting back together or something.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Add Three Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Right-hander David Riske, who had surgery May 5
to remove a bulging disc in his lower back, was activated Monday by
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also recalled left-hander Tom Martin from Triple-A
Buffalo and shortstop John McDonald from Class-A Kinston.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Riske on the 40-man roster, minor-league
right-hander Jamie Brown was placed on the 60-day disabled list
with a lower back injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like what I've seen of Riske and we're going to use him,''
manager Charlie Manuel said. ''He's got some sneak on his fastball
and isn't afraid to go out there against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Riske went 1-1 late last season for Cleveland, but was injured
in spring training this year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has split the 2000 season between Cleveland, where he was
1-0 with a 4.40 ERA in 27 games, and Buffalo, where he was 0-1 with
a 3.60 ERA in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald appeared in two games with the Indians earlier this
season before being optioned to Kinston last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Might Stay on DL  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- With season-ending elbow surgery looking more
likely, Larry Walker has hired a personal trainer and a
nutritionist in an attempt to end his annual injury woes.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, on the disabled list since Aug. 21, hoped to return to
Colorado's lineup this week but complained of pain in his right
elbow after taking batting practice and playing catch Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no decision had been made, arthroscopic surgery
probably will be required to remove a bone spur from Walker's
elbow, which has plagued him throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been discussed,'' Walker said Monday. ''I think it
might happen. I don't know when, if it's now or at the end of the
season. I'm still in the dark on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell said there was a 50 percent chance
Walker would not play again this season. A final decision was
expected within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than we would like to have him back to help us with the
rest of the season, there is no reason,'' Bell said when asked what
would be gained by Walker's return.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the two-time defending NL batting champion, was hitting
.309 with nine homers and 51 RBIs in 87 games before going on the
disabled list for the second time this year. He has played in 140
games twice in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to shake the injury bug, Walker said he plans to
start a three-month workout program with a professional trainer on
Nov. 1, and a nutritionist will regulate his diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I wish I could shake,'' he said. ''I'm trying
to take all the right steps to avoid this.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was placed on the disabled list two weeks ago with
instructions not to pick up a ball or a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The rest appeared to help alleviate the onset of a stress
fracture, but a bone spur has developed, and there is loose
material in Walker's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our doctors have termed this as gravel or small loose bodies
in the elbow,'' Rockies trainer Tom Probst said. ''If it was just
that, we probably wouldn't consider surgery, but because there also
is a spur on the end of the elbow, we have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he is prepared to do whatever the Rockies want --
within reason. Don't expect to see him playing winter ball after
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm playing winter ball at 34 years old, there's a
problem,'' he said. ''I want to win a world series, but I don't
want to win a Caribbean World Series.''

<HEADLINE> Sprint Records Unlikely at Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Don't expect Maurice Greene to break
his world record in the 100-meter final at the Sydney Games.
Florence Griffith Joyner's world records in the women's 100 and 200
appear safe from Marion Jones' clutches.
</P>
<P>
   World records in the distance races also are unlikely, despite
the expected cool weather.
</P>
<P>
   Although the forecasters are predicting temperatures in the 60s
for late this month when the track and field competition is held --
from Sept. 22-Oct. 1 -- the sprinters will be buffeted by the
expected headwinds in 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While the distance runners -- from 1,500 meters through the
marathon -- should find the conditions ideal, history dictates that
world records in those events will stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the times are going to be as fast as everyone
thinks (in the sprints),'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago,
the 1996 bronze medalist in the 100 and 200, who already has
competed in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wind blows almost directly down the straight into which
the 100 meters is run. That's not something that sprinters love.''
</P>
<P>
   When Greene set the world record of 9.79 seconds at Athens,
Greece, last year, the weather was hot and the wind negligible. The
same conditions existed when he ran 9.80 in winning the 1999 world
championship later at Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   When Canada's Donovan Bailey set the 100 world record of 9.84 in
1996 at the Atlanta Games, he also was the beneficiary of warm
weather and little wind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The times this year don't matter,'' Boldon said. ''You run to
win. The Olympics is when time matters least.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jones should be thinking. She is facing a herculean
task in trying to win an unprecedented five gold medals and will
need to pace herself to remain fit for five events -- the 100, 200,
400 relay, 1,600 relay and long jump.
</P>
<P>
   She has come the closest to breaking FloJo's marks of 10.49 in
the 100 and 21.34 in the 200. Jones' best times are 10.65 and
21.62, both at altitude. Sydney is at sea level, so that will not
help her.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather is cool, ''it will have a physical and
psychological effect on the sprinters and jumpers,'' said Ernie
Gregoire, an assistant U.S. women's coach in charge of the long
jumpers, triple jumpers and hurdlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ballistic athletes depend on warm weather,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Include the throwers in the group that prefers the warmth, said
Jerry Quiller, an assistant U.S. men's coach responsible for the
distance runners from 1,500 meters through 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sprinters, jumpers and throwers don't want to have to compete
with their sweats on,'' he said. ''The distance guys will love the
cool weather unless it's windy. If it's just cool, they'll be
fresher after running their heats or rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloomy forecast for the sprinters and jumpers,
Gregoire thinks world records are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get in this kind of situation and the adrenaline
starts flowing and there's that quest to be No. 1, great things
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Special events bring out special times from special people.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. high jumper Kenny Evans doesn't think anything special will
occur in his event if the weather isn't warm.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that case, I don't think people will jump as high,'' he
said. ''People will just have to tough it out in the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of anyone breaking the world record when it's
been cold. I don't think anything explosive will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   American long jumper Melvin Lister doesn't believe the weather
will be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're feeling good, the record will fall,'' he said. ''If
not, it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Abdirahman, a member of the U.S. 10,000-meter team, said,
''It depends on how cold it gets. If it's real cold, it might not
help set a world record, but the cold probably will help some
people get PRs (personal records) by a couple of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer the cooler weather, not cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the weather, distance runners don't often set world
records at the Olympics, because most of the races are tactical.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top performances in races between 1,500 and the marathon,
plus the walks, very few came at the games. Going into this year,
the highest-standing mark from the Olympics was 27:07.34 by
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie in winning the 10,000 meters at
Atlanta, and that ranked only 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Only three other Olympic marks ranked in the top 50 in the
10,000. There were none in the 1,500, 5,000, marathon or the walks,
and only one in the 3,000 steeplechase -- the then-world record
8:08.02 by Anders Garderud of Sweden in 1976, and that was No. 49.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's events, there were four remaining marks in the
1,500, led by Russian Tatyana Kazankina's 3:56.56 in 1980, which
was No. 23 at the beginning of the year, and four in the 10,000,
headed by Portuguese Fernanda Riberio's 31:01.63 in 1996, No. 34.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiaries of the cool conditions might be the
walkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually the weather is conducive for sprinters,'' U.S. race
walker Andrew Hermann said. ''After being in Seville and Athens
(for the past two World Championships), where it was scorching hot,
you will see world-class times that you didn't see in those
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone from the 5,000 up is ecstatic about this. The sprinters
have had it warm every other meet.''

<HEADLINE> Web-based services aim to improve patients' health, cut doctors' costs </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two years after having quadruple bypass
surgery, Bruce Krawitz still gets so caught up in his business,
Antique Style Lighting, that he occasionally forgets to take his
heart medication.
</P>
<P>
   So the 50-year-old Nyack, N.Y., man reluctantly let his wife
sign him up for a new service that calls, beeps or e-mails patients
repeatedly each day until they confirm via the keypad that they
have taken their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple days, the automated calls, in the voice of his
doctor's secretary, were ''annoying, horrible'' - until he ignored
them for so many hours he suffered severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that experience, every time I hear that voice, I stop
what I'm doing and I take the medicine,'' Krawitz said last week.
''Four weeks, and I'm trained like a dog already.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the intent of the Internet company providing the
service, Livingston-based PanHealth, or ''total health.'' The
company, founded primarily by physicians on a $2 million
investment, offers a wide range of Web-based services aimed at
keeping patients healthier while helping their doctors cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to motivate people to be healthier,'' said Avi
Kulkarni, chairman and chief executive officer of the 10-month-old
company.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tirch, a 55-year-old disabled Ridgewood man who takes 10
medicines each day for diabetes and severe complications, is among
those using the medication reminder service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a constant reminder of how sick I am,'' and the need to
follow doctors' orders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is signing up doctors to have their
patients receive computerized reminders they have an appointment
coming up or need a flu shot, or to set up secure electronic
archives of patients files on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Patients could access part of those files to enter information
about allergies, treatment by other doctors and nonprescription
medicines they take. In addition, using PanHealth's Web server
eliminates the need for doctors to constantly upgrade their own
computer equipment, saving money and time for staff training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually, with electronic record retrieval, we should save
money,'' said Dr. Kenneth A. Black, medical director of a new
PanHealth client, a family doctors' practice called Porter Health
Services in Portage, Ind. ''We don't have a flu shot recall system,
so that could generate more revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, doctors for whom PanHealth created
''virtual offices'' on the Web will be able to post their office
calendar to let patients pick an appointment time, and doctors who
use a handheld computer will be able to e-mail prescriptions to a
pharmacy and be notified whether the patient fills the
prescription. That can be crucial information, as many
prescriptions written for chronic illnesses are never filled.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they take their medicine regularly, they will be healthier
and have less complications,'' said Dr. Bhupen Kapadia, a surgeon
at Christ Hospital in Jersey City and vice chairman of PanHealth's
board.
</P>
<P>
   When patients, especially those with chronic diseases, don't
take medication or follow doctor's orders all the time, serious
complications can land them in the hospital - or worse. Diabetics
who don't control their blood sugar, for example, can go blind or
have to have a limb amputated because of poor circulation, while
people with unchecked high blood pressure can suffer a heart attack
or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, the annual cost of patient noncompliance, for
additional medical care and lost productivity, is estimated at more
than $100 billion, roughly one-tenth of all health-care spending.
</P>
<P>
   Most of PanHealth's services are offered to patients and doctors
for free or at a minimal cost, while the company tries to sell ads
on its Web site and doctors on its moneymaking services.
</P>
<P>
   Those include training physicians' office staff on the
''e-health'' business and offering doctors overnight, discounted
transcription of their notes from patient exams.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can download the information by dictating over the phone
after each appointment or by using two types of electronic devices.
The data is shipped via the Internet to India, where clerks type it
into a computer and a physician edits the information before
e-mailing it back in one of several formats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this company has a good plan,'' said Dr. Vimal Pathak,
a general and oncology surgeon in Valparaiso, Ind., who says he has
been saving nearly 50 percent over his old transcription service.
</P>
<P>
   Pathak plans to gradually convert all his paper patient files to
electronic ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might go into the whole virtual office thing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   PanHealth's next big project is refining its prototype ''Smart
Pill Box,'' an electronic device wire to the telephone that alerts
patients, and eventually their relatives and doctors, if they don't
open the box on time to take their medication.
</P>
<P>
   PanHealth also is working on creating various partnerships with
insurers, government agencies, drug companies, hospitals and
doctors' practices - any groups that could benefit from patients
taking their medicine and staying healthier, or from sales of the
new technology involved.
</P>
<P>
   Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co., for example, is working on a
deal to refine its handheld PCs to better enable PanHealth clients
to transmit and receive patient information anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see some very good things'' from the partnership developing,
said Richard Williams, an H-P sales specialist in Paramus.

<HEADLINE> White House Reports on Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Pressing its health care agenda, the White House is
presenting two reports Tuesday that support the idea of expanding
government children's health care programs to parents.
</P>
<P>
   A study from the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities found that allowing parents to apply for aid under the
programs makes it more likely that their children will be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a White review of various studies on the subject
concludes that expanding existing coverage or federal support for
health care programs. was superior to offering parents tax
deductions or credits for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering legislation to expand coverage or
provide additional tax breaks for health care programs. Most
Republicans favor tax breaks, while most Democrats favor a bill
that would expand eligibility under existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most poor children are eligible for health care through either
Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP
was created in 1997 to help kids whose families earn too much to
qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. Congress
has been considering legislation to expand these programs to other
family members.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 7 million children who remain uninsured,
although they are eligible for health care assistance. Leighton Ku,
who wrote the Center's report, said some parents don't know about
the programs, while others don't take the time to apply for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, Hawaii and Tennessee, which expanded Medicaid
coverage to parents in 1994, coverage of eligible children
6-years-old or younger rose from 51 percent to 67 percent from 1990
to 1998, an analysis of Census data found. In states that didn't
expand their programs, the proportion of children insured only
increased 3 percentage points to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you make the program broader so the parents can join or
maybe some older siblings can join then they say it becomes
worthwhile,'' Ku said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the District of Columbia and nine states --
California, Connecticut, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Rhode Island and Wisconsin -- approved or carried out
expansions to their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income
families, including parents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The second report, a summary of various studies compiled and
released by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, concluded
that tax credits would encourage some individuals to pay for group
insurance or even the more expensive individual insurance. But this
is still less of an incentive -- and is more expensive for the
government -- than expanding existing programs or using a
combination of the two, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush supports a tax
credit of up to $2,000 per family to help low-income working
Americans buy health insurance and an expansion of tax-free medical
savings accounts that can be used to pay for health expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore favors expanding coverage for children
and parents and a tax credit so uninsured people can purchase
individual health policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ku said his findings support the passing of the Family Care Act
of 2000, bipartisan legislation proposed last month that would
spread $50 billion across the country during the next 10 years so
states could insure parents whose children are enrolled in Medicaid
and CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would let states set up insurance programs for
legal immigrant children and pregnant women, allow people leaving
welfare for work to keep Medicaid coverage for one year and expand
outreach programs to enroll more people. Those programs would cost
an estimated $12 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans oppose the plan. They would rather see the
government provide tax breaks so parents could choose a private
insurer. The measure fell nine votes short of Senate approval when
it was initially offered in July.

<HEADLINE> Five Iranians arrested in incidents near the U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Four Iranians were arrested over the weekend for
allegedly throwing yellow paint in separate incidents near the
United Nations, where 150 world leaders are gathering this week for
the U.N. Millennium Summit. One incident involved the president of
Iran, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear if the incidents were related, but a spokesman
for the National Council of Resistance of Iran - which bills itself
as Iran's parliament-in-exile - said yellow is ''the color of
dismay, the color of disapproval.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian President Mohammed Khatami ''is so hated in Iran and
outside of Iran because of his abhorrent record of human rights,''
group spokesman Alireza Jararzadeh said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Similar paint attacks were carried out earlier this year on
Iranian officials in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders
gathered for the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Reza Eskandari, 44, was arrested Sunday afternoon for
throwing paint at a car carrying Khatami. The attack happened on
the east side of Manhattan near the United Nations building, said
Det. Madeleine Galindo, a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In a second incident, Sedigh Hamid, 42, and Mohammed Reza, 44,
were arrested Sunday evening for allegedly throwing yellow paint
inside the lobby of the United Nations Plaza Hotel, said Police
Officer Guy Braun. The Iranian delegation is staying at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In a third incident Sunday, 44-year-old Akbar Parizanani was
charged with throwing yellow paint in a plastic balloon at the
outside of the hotel, police said. They added that Parizanani was
taken to Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation after he
appeared to be emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Also near the hotel, Hojjat Hassany was charged with disorderly
conduct after he got into an argument and scuffle with several
people.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was at the United Nations on Monday meeting with several
hundred Iranian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A call seeking comment about the paint attacks from the Iranian
mission to the United Nations was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   There were also three separate bomb threats against the hotel,
but the suspicious packages were found to be harmless, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 91 demonstrations are planned for the gathering of
world leaders, which runs from Wednesday through Friday. It is
expected to attract more than 150 heads of state and government -
the largest number of world leaders ever gathered in one city in
history, said Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Back After Leg Injury  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- A little frustrated and plenty banged
up, Rob Johnson was back on his feet Monday, saying the feeling and
movement has returned to his lower left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can control the movement. It's a lot better. It's just real
weak right now and I'm sure in the next couple of days it'll come
back,'' the Buffalo Bills quarterback said, adding he expects to
practice on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After being sacked five times and taking numerous other vicious
licks, Johnson went down with what he called a ''stinger'' just
above his left ankle five minutes into the fourth quarter of the
Bills' 16-13 victory over Tennessee on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being praised for his perseverance in the face of an
imposing pass rush, Johnson was discouraged that he was forced to
once again leave a game he started.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just frustrated that I left the field,'' he said. ''You
get tired of being carried off the field, or limping off the field,
especially in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 career starts in Buffalo, Johnson has now been knocked out
of the game five times -- three due to concussions and another due
to a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I would have stayed in there and finished the game,''
he said. ''It's not like one of those Pyrrhic victories where you
win the battle but lose the war. We won the game, which was nice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it a lot easier to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went down with the Bills ahead 13-6. He said someone
kicked him on the back of the leg, although replays showed that
Johnson's ankle seemed to give out while dropping back.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans scored to tie the game at 13 on their next
possession, but the Bills won when backup Alex Van Pelt sparked the
game-winning drive setting up Steve Christie's 33-yard field goal
with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson still had a solid performance, going 9-of-18 for 107
yards, while also leading the team with 60 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Van Pelt was impressed by Johnson's performance, comparing it to
that to former Bills great Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Jim Kelly standing there and take hits, Rob took some of
those hits last night. There's no question about his toughness,''
said Van Pelt, in his sixth year with the Bills after being
re-signed last month when Doug Flutie tore a groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll take the save but (Johnson) definitely deserves the win,
there's no question. He did all the hard work,'' he said. ''To keep
competing, a lot of guys may have folded in that situation. He
stood up. They kept coming at him, and he kept taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Wade Phillips said Johnson's performance inspired the
entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody after the game, all our players, were talking about
Rob's toughness,'' Phillips said. ''I thought Rob showed
exceptional toughness.''

<HEADLINE> Beatles Try To Set Record Straight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new book by the surviving members of the Beatles
seeks to put an end to questions over the group's demise, saying it
was definitely John Lennon who called it quits first.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Beatles Anthology'' -- excerpts of which were published
in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper this week -- Sir Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr aim to set the record
straight about the band's journey from Liverpool teen-agers to rock
legends.
</P>
<P>
   The book, to be published in Britain and the United States in
October, is the product of six years of work by the trio, the
Sunday Telegraph said when it announced the project last spring.
McCartney, 57, Harrison, 57, and Starr, 59, have collected 1,200
photographs, mostly unpublished, for the book, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts published this week, the three recall how Lennon
was the first to quit the band, leaving to record with Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, whom some people believe spurred the breakup, simply
made the public announcement of the split several months later in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''John was a bit annoyed with me because I think he wanted to be
the one to tell anyone -- or not tell them,'' McCartney said in the
excerpt.
</P>
<P>
   The band members also speak frankly about their drug consumption
and their experience as wide-eyed teen-agers performing in
Hamburg's seedy Reeperbahn, a red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamburg was quite an eye-opener,'' said McCartney in the
excerpt. ''We went as kids and came back as ... old kids!
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a sex shock,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The book reveals that the band members continue to differ over
key events in the band's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the group finished the minute John said, 'I'm
leaving,''' said McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Starr disagreed: ''There was always the possibility that we
could have carried on,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also show that tensions among the trio have not
evaporated in the three decades since the band split up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul has a way of using stuff,'' said Harrison. ''I mean, even
now, if he's going to do a tour he'll conveniently tell the press
that we're all getting back together or something.''

<HEADLINE> Green Bay's Favre Sprains Thumb  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Brett Favre's attempt to regain his form
just got a little bit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay coach Mike Sherman said Monday that Favre sprained his
right thumb during the Packers' 20-16 loss to the New York Jets on
Sunday. Though Sherman said it isn't serious, the injury is yet
another blow to a quarterback trying to recover from two sub-par
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Favre missed the final three preseason games with tendinitis in
his right elbow, and the three-time MVP played in pain Sunday while
competing just 14 of 34 passes for 152 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the thumb injury occurred early in the second
quarter when defensive end Shaun Ellis swatted the ball out of
Favre's hands. Tackle Earl Dotson recovered the fumble, and Favre
played the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That thumb will not be an issue on this team, and neither will
the elbow,'' Sherman said. ''Quarterbacks get hurt in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre went through a light workout at Lambeau Field on Monday
with his thumb wrapped securely in bandages. Offensive coordinator
and quarterbacks coach Tom Rossley said he isn't sure whether the
injury will affect Favre's ability to practice for the upcoming
game at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has come through a couple of bumps and bruises before,''
Rossley said. ''You don't start all those games in a row without
being tough.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention focused on Favre's tendinitis-stricken
right elbow this season, the balky thumb that hindered him last
year was nearly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a bruised and swollen thumb contributed to a subpar
season in which he threw 23 interceptions and failed to lead Green
Bay to the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After the Packers' loss Sunday, Favre -- who has started an
NFL-record 126 straight games -- conceded he will probably play
another season in pain. That could set up an interesting test of
wills between Favre and Sherman, who has pledged to remove Favre
from the lineup if the injuries significantly affect his play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I didn't hurt (the elbow) any worse,'' Favre said
Sunday. ''I was able to practice every day last week. I know how
it's probably going to feel this week, maybe the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt for the most part I threw the ball with a lot of
velocity, and accuracy I thought was as close to normal as
possible. It can get better with practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Packers' offense sputtered under Favre against New
York. In the first half, Favre was 4-of-13 for 25 yards, and the
Packers -- who dropped five or six of Favre's passes in the game --
managed just 55 yards of total offense before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't put the blame on Brett,'' said receiver Antonio
Freeman, who dropped two passes. ''We couldn't run the ball, so we
couldn't help the passing game. If you can't do one, it's hard to
do the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, who has preached a return to fundamental football since
replacing Ray Rhodes last winter, was particularly piqued by the
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are definitely catchable balls,'' Sherman said. ''On the
film, you see balls bouncing off chests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' offense won't get any relief from its running game
any time soon, either. Sherman said Dorsey Levens, who underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery during training camp, won't play on the
artificial turf at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Ahman Green, Levens' backup, played just three weeks after
spraining his left knee but was mostly ineffective, gaining 41
yards on nine carries and losing one fumble. Favre, who gained 13
yards on two scrambles, was the team's second-leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had caught even two of the five drops, we wouldn't be
talking about any of this right now,'' Sherman said. ''Right now,
(Favre) gives us a chance to win. I don't even think he was at 80
percent, but he's our guy.''

<HEADLINE> Spanish Premier: Long Road to Peace  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Responding to an upsurge in separatist
violence, Spain's prime minister on Monday vowed he would grant no
leeway for the gunmen and predicted a long battle for peace in the
Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a long road,'' Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar Aznar said in an interview with The Associated Press. ''We're
faced with terrorism, pure and simple. And in the European Union
and modern democracies of this century there can be no room for
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Aznar spoke upon returning to his Moncloa Palace residence in
Madrid after nearly a month in his seaside residence in eastern
Spain -- a holiday interrupted by funerals for five of the eight
people killed this summer in car bombs and shootings blamed on the
armed Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victim was Manuel Indiano, a small town
councilor for Aznar's Popular Party gunned down Wednesday in his
candy shop. The death brought to 10 the number of Popular Party
councilors whose deaths are blamed on ETA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had better Augusts,'' he said bitterly. ''I hope to have
better ones in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiano's death was the 12th since ETA ended a 14-month
unilateral cease-fire in December and unleashed one of its most
brutal offensives ever in what many see as a desperate attempt to
force the government into negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque
provinces in the north. It envisions an independent state that
would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   ETA was particularly active toward the end of the dictatorship
of Gen. Francisco Franco and the first few years of Spain's
transition to democracy following his death in 1975. The violence
subsided slightly under the socialist government that ended in 1996
with Aznar's first election as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural
identity and language. For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle
for sovereignty. But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals,
pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the
Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrorism is just another expression of tyranny....They are
Nazis those people who support terrorism in the Basque Country,''
Aznar said.
</P>
<P>
   During the cease-fire, ETA's longest in its 32-year-campaign, a
single round of negotiations failed to get either side to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, a survivor of an ETA car bomb in 1995, said prospects for
peace, or even negotiations, in the near future are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never accept Spanish democracy or liberties in Spain
being sacrificed on the altar of some negotiations that might prove
justification for the terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence brought an end to any political honeymoon for Aznar
after winning a second term in office with a landslide victory in
the March elections. At the time he was hailed at home and abroad
as representing a new and dynamic Spain whose centrist policies
were fueling a thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar rules out any fresh initiatives and insists the government
will persist in maintaining law and order, boosting police
efficiency and seeking greater international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> McNown Runs More Than Enis  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Who got the most carries and the most
yards for the Chicago Bears on Sunday? Not promising tailback James
Allen, who's getting a bigger role in the offense. Not the burly
Curtis Enis, who appears to have a diminished role.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' leading rusher after one game is quarterback Cade
McNown, who took off running 10 times in a season-opening loss to
the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's tally of 87 yards rushing was the most by a Chicago
quarterback in 27 years, since another left-hander, Bobby Douglass,
gained 100 yards on 19 carries against Green Bay in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But, that was a different era. Douglass, in fact, is the
10th-leading rusher in Bears history and gained 968 yards in 1972
when he led the team.
</P>
<P>
   So will McNown, who was sore Monday, be taking off from the
pocket so frequently this week when the Bears play at Tampa Bay?
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see it. It's the nature of his game, nature of our
game,'' coach Dick Jauron said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of them are designed runs, and a number of his scrambles
aren't designed. It will always be part of our game plan. It's a
weapon that's hard to defend against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears found that out firsthand Sunday when Vikings
quarterback Duante Culpepper, who stands 6-foot-4 and weighs 266
pounds, scored on three touchdown runs in his first NFL start. He
had 13 carries for 73 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just very difficult to defend a quarterback that can
maneuver on the field and beat you with his arms or his legs,''
Jauron said.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to contain Culpepper on his short-yard TD runs,
big second-half plays by Randy Moss and Robert Smith after Chicago
had contained them much of the game, and a fourth-quarter
unnecessary roughness penalty on offensive tackle Blake
Brockermeyer, led to the Bears' undoing in the 30-27 loss at the
Metrdome. Chicago led 20-9 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brockermeyer was whistled when he shoved Minnesota's Talance
Sawyer, just seconds after Sawyer made a late hit on McNown
following a 14-yard completion to Alonzo Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   The pass and the penalty would have put the Bears at the Vikings
21 and at least in field goal position, trailing 23-20. But
Brockermeyer's penalty wiped out the play, and the ball went back
to the 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a brutal hit on the quarterback in the open field where
the quarterback was lying on the ground,'' Jauron said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Brock thought Cade was hurt badly and he lost control.
Does that make it right? No. We had 30 yards of offense wiped out
because he lost control, and it's something we don't want to have
happen and unfortunately it did. On the other hand, you can
understand what he sees and feels at the time,'' Jauron added.

<P>
   McNown, who was 27-of-41 for 290 yards and two touchdowns, used
the quarterback draw to keep the Vikings' pass rush honest, and
also ran for a score.
</P>
<P>
   He had one more carry than Allen, who gained 60 yards, and six
more than Enis, who managed just 11.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's stepped-up role led to the question of whether he is
replacing Enis as the Bears' primary ball carrier?
</P>
<P>
   Enis carried 27 times last year when the Bears beat the Vikings
at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ''James was running the ball great, and he stayed in there. He
had a great game,'' Enis said Monday, seemingly unconcerned. ''They
didn't want to break up what he was going. That's just the way it
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauron said both backs will continue to play every game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the way they both handled it and the way they
performed,'' he said.

<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays activated third
baseman Vinny Castilla from the disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays also recalled right-handed pitchers Dan Wheeler
and Travis Harper from Triple-A Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Harper and Castilla did not play, but Wheeler pitched one
scoreless inning of relief Monday in a 5-1 loss to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla had never been on the disabled list before this season,
but has missed 63 games and been sidelined three separate times.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the first seven games of the season with a strained
rib cage muscle, 22 games with a back injury that sidelined him
from June 14 to July 2, and 34 games since Aug. 1 with lower back
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla, 33, hit 203 homers over seven seasons in Colorado
before being dealt by the Rockies last December. He has hit .223
with six homers and 39 RBIs in 71 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Garnes Out of Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants safety Sam Garnes
will have a post-concussion evaluation Tuesday to determine whether
he can play this weekend against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Garnes, injured in the fourth quarter of the Giants' 21-16
victory over Arizona on Sunday, still had lingering headaches and
some memory loss after being released from the Hospital for Special
Surgery, where he was held overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now I think I probably won't play, but I'm going to
fight to the end,'' Garnes said after returning to Giants Stadium
on Monday. ''I'm here to play football and I can't have my boys go
out there by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnes was knocked out for about 30 seconds after colliding with
teammate Jessie Armstead trying to break up a pass. Armstead seemed
to hit Garnes on the side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just know I was going toward the middle, that's the last
thing I remember,'' Garnes said.

<P>
	   FILLMORE, N.Y. (AP) - A 39-year-old man apparently walked out
the back door of a friends house early Saturday morning, fell into
the Genesee River and drowned, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers pulled the body of Charles E. Young of Fillmore
from about 15 feet of water at about 9 a.m. Sunday morning. He was
pronounced dead at the scene and his body has been sent to the
Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office for examination. The
preliminary cause of death is listed as accidental drowning, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was at the home of Victor Prial and apparently went out
the back door at about 2 a.m. on Saturday. Some 36 feet from the
back of the home the ground drops straight down about 15 to 20 feet
to the river, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed and police say the death appears to
be accidental.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Fear Train Woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Olympic organizers have done such a
good job of warning people about traffic problems that they fear
commuters will overload a fragile train system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that workers will change their traveling
habits too radically, putting too much pressure on trains that have
been hampered by recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Willoughby, a spokesman for the Olympic Roads and Transport
Authority, said Olympic crowds will cause the number of passenger
trips on the CityRail network to increase from the normal level of
14 million to about 34 million during the 19-day peak Olympic
period.
</P>
<P>
   And if commuters who have abandoned their cars are added to that
total, the train system could be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system can't afford for this to be artificially inflated
by people changing from car to train,'' Willoughby said Monday.
''Put simply, if everyone tries to travel at the same time,
passenger loads will exceed train capacity and very long delays
will be inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said that even though on-street parking will not be
allowed in downtown Sydney, commercial garages will be open and
cars will not be banned from the central business district.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also are recommending that commuters travel before 7
a.m. or after 9:30 a.m. during the Olympic period, and that
sightseers begin their trips after 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were some problems reported on Olympic shuttle
buses at the main press center and the athletes' village. Officials
said the system is experiencing ''teething problems'' and will be
fixed.

<HEADLINE> Jets on Even Keel After Win  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- There were no more tears in the New York
Jets locker room on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory at Green Bay behind them and another emotional
game against New England and former Jets defensive coach Bill
Belichick coming up next week, they needed a day to refocus
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat a team in the Packers that historically has a great
record at home and a quarterback in Brett Favre who has a great
reputation for coming back,'' said quarterback Vinny Testaverde,
who broke down crying on the field and in the locker room after
Sunday's 20-16 victory. ''I was very happy and excited, and it just
hit me all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde struggled in the first half, going just 11-of-25 and
throwing an interception, but he finished 23-of-44 for 261 yards
and was brilliant on the game-winning touchdown drive in the fourth
quarter. A 3-yard TD pass to Curtis Martin was set up by a
61-yarder to Dedric Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said several factors -- his return from last year's
season-ending Achilles' tendon injury, the death of his father in
February 1999 and the exciting finish -- combined to bring out his
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting the win, feeling the presence of my father, wishing he
was here, all those things made it emotional and made it special,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh, who won his head coaching debut after a long career as
an assistant, shrugged off Testaverde's emotional display by saying
''Hey, he's Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole team had a resolve to win, and nobody has to project
that resolve more than the quarterback,'' Groh said. ''Each quarter
was progressively better for him. It projects to the rest of the
team. His passes to Ward and Martin were bulls-eye throws where he
had just a little lane to throw through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn said going to Green Bay and winning
''was a boost to our confidence. The Packers are going to win a lot
of games, especially in their ballpark. Now we have to get ready
for Bill (Belichick). He knows us, and he will try to exploit
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After Martin's TD catch, the Jets had to hold off a final drive
by Favre and the Packers, who reached the New York 35 with 1:08
left. But an interception by Jets safety Victor Green ended the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've earned the right to look at themselves a little
differently,'' Groh said. ''They went into a tough place and won,
and it should give them reinforcement that they've done something
good when the game went down to the wire. You'd like to have a lot
of 34-7 games, but the reality is that you won't get a lot of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing for us to do is follow up on what we did because
they all count as just one (win).''
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Jason Fabini, considered one of the best offensive
linemen on the team, was benched by Groh in the fourth quarter
after committing four penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a running back gets 120 yards and fumbles twice, was that a
good day?'' Groh asked. ''The bad plays cancel out the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh indicated it was likely Fabini would start against the
Patriots.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Tries To Stir Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Makers of the CBS reality show ''Big Brother,''
whose ratings have paled in comparison to the summer smash
''Survivor,'' are hoping to bribe a contestant to quit so the
series can introduce a more interesting replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Producers will offer one of the six remaining ''Big Brother''
contestants $10,000 to depart in the hopes the new entrant will
bring more dramatic tension to the show, the New York Times
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' captures the personal relationships of a group
that has been confined to a house for eight weeks. Four previous
contestants were voted off the show by TV audiences. The last one
remaining will receive a $500,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday's show, contestants will be presented with a
briefcase containing $10,000 and given two minutes to decide
whether to take the money and run. If someone takes the money, an
alternate contestant will enter the house as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The producers said they hope to stir up some conflict among the
six fairly tame contestants remaining. Its ratings have been
mediocre, especially in comparison to CBS' other reality show
''Survivor,'' which dominated the ratings over the summer and drew
a Super Bowl-sized audience for its finale last month.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages and pages left Monday for two CBS spokesmen
went unanswered.

<HEADLINE> UN OKs Yugoslav Election in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a boost to President Slobodan
Milosevic, the United Nations on Monday grudgingly agreed to
demands by his supporters that Kosovo residents be allowed to vote
in upcoming Yugoslav elections.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by Bernard Kouchner, Kosovo's chief U.N.
administrator, should result in only a limited number of votes
being cast in the Sept. 24 presidential and parliamentary
elections. Serbs remaining in the province number only in the tens
of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with no plans for an independent ballot count in Kosovo
or outside monitoring of the elections, critics of Milosevic fear
that the Yugoslav president's camp will pad the results heavily in
his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who is lagging in popularity polls behind his chief
challenger for the post of president, has been accused of cheating
in past Kosovo elections.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo formally remains part of Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
republic, even though it has been run by NATO and the United
Nations since NATO bombing last year forced Milosevic to pull out
his troops and cede day-to-day control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But with the nearly 2 million Kosovo Albanians considering their
province independent, they are sure to boycott the elections,
permitting the Milosevic camp to fraudulently claim their vote, say
critics of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic is in danger of losing the elections, and he is
going to produce a lot of false votes in order to win,'' said
Father Sava Janjic, a spokesman for Kosovo's moderate Serbs, who
oppose Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government said last week that the parliamentary and
presidential elections would be open to voters in Kosovo. In
announcing his decision Monday, Kouchner said the international
community will not get involved beyond trying to provide security
for all voters -- in effect ruling out U.N. or NATO attempts to
monitor voting and provide independent vote counts.
</P>
<P>
   The elections ''do not meet any international standards,''
Kouchner said, alluding to Western concerns that Milosevic could
cheat to stay in power in the presidential vote and help his
supporters in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of cheating, the decision to include Kosovo in
the voting raises other complications.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo Albanians violently opposed to any association with
Yugoslavia, any plan to include the province in the Yugoslav
parliamentary and presidential elections is a sure recipe for
violence against Serbs and voting facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the move by Milosevic could be an attempt to gain
popularity by showing Serbs outside the province that Kosovo
remains part of their republic. Many Serbs blame the Yugoslav
president for losing Kosovo to the United Nations and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would open about 500 polling stations in the troubled
southern province for the Sept. 24 elections. The United Nations is
preparing to hold local elections in Kosovo on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Serbian opposition leaders and Montenegrin
officials warned of likely election fraud by Milosevic's allies,
after he reportedly collected the signatures of 1.6 million
citizens who support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, this alleged support is an indication how irregular
the vote will be,'' Montenegro's deputy prime minister, Dragisa
Burzan, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can, therefore, expect that he gets phantom votes just to
be certain of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears are increasing that Milosevic will tamper with the ballot
to stay in power. If an opposition candidate wins, he may declare
the vote invalid, which could trigger riots or clashes between
Milosevic's supporters and opponents.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars Call Up Paul Grafer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- The New York-New Jersey MetroStars called
up goaltender Paul Grafer from the Long Island Rough Riders on
Monday to replace Olympic-bound Tim Howard on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Grafer, who is 16-9-3 with a 1.29 goals against average with
Long Island in the A-League, is listed as the probable starter for
the MetroStars in Tuesday night's MLS regular-season home finale
against the Miami Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars general manager Nick Sakiewicz said the team reached
an agreement with Long Island that will enable Grafer to play with
both teams in their playoff runs. The Rough Riders are a minor
league affiliate of the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Grafer, 26, a native of Port Washington, N.Y., helped the Rough
Riders (16-9-3) clinch their first-ever A-League Northeast Division
crown by beating Toronto 1-0 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Grafer played 13 games for Colorado of the MLS during parts of
the 1997 and 1998 seasons. He had a 1-12 record.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- Powerful Toy held off a late charge by
favored Astreos and survived a foul claim to win the $331,350 Cane
Pace at Freehold Raceway on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by Luc Ouellette, Powerful Toy covered the mile in the
opening leg of pacing's Triple Crown in 1:51.4, beating Astreos and
driver Chris Christoforou by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   Christoforou said Ouellette and Powerful Toy impeded Astreos in
the stretch, but the judges disallowed the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This horse just turned in his best race ever,'' Ouellette
said. ''We found out last week that he's better on the front end.
He likes this track and he likes half-mile tracks in general.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Astreos) was at my bridle at the three-quarters, but he
wasn't gaining. He got close in the stretch, but I wasn't really
worried that he'd get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerful Toy paid $11.80, $5.60, $4.20 in winning for trainer
Monte Gelrod and owners Newman Racing Stable, Dodge A Bullet Stable
and Sampson Street Stable.
</P>
<P>
   Astreos, who matched the track record in winning his elimination
nine days ago, paid $4.20 and $3.20. Art Dot Com paid $5.40 to show
in the eight-horse field.

<HEADLINE> Wannstedt's Choices Help Dolphins  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The easy choices would have been Damon Huard
and J.J. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Wannstedt, despite stirring up conflict and
controversy, had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   He selected journeymen Jay Fiedler and Lamar Smith to lead his
team into the season, and they helped make Wannstedt a winner in
his first game as team's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler completed 15 of 24 passes for 134 yards, and Smith
gained 145 yards on 27 carries in Miami's 23-0 victory over
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt's personnel decisions, considered his downfall in
Chicago, are one of the main reasons the Dolphins are 1-0 and
confidently preparing for Sunday's game at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not all going to fall into place, we know that,''
Wannstedt said Monday. ''You're going to miss. There are going to
be mistakes, but you've just got to make sure you keep those to a
minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wannstedt has made all the right moves.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler, sidelined for much of training camp after having hip
surgery, didn't throw an interception against the Seahawks.
Wannstedt chose Fiedler over Huard, who started five games in place
of Dan Marino last season, after just one preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt picked Smith over incumbent starter J.J. Johnson, who
led the team in rushing with 558 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   Offseason acquisitions Thurman Thomas, Bert Emanuel, Leslie
Shepherd and rookie Todd Wade also made impacts in their Dolphins
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had 31 all-purpose yards, Emanuel and Shepherd combined
for four catches for 46 yards and Wade opened up holes all
afternoon for Smith on the right side of the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're supposed to win only three or four more games, so this
is good,'' linebacker Zach Thomas said. ''This is good for
Wannstedt. People were already knocking him.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only move that didn't work Sunday was Emanuel's stint
at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were penalized for using Emanuel on a third-and-1
play in the second quarter, something they had done consistently in
the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Emanuel couldn't enter the game at quarterback
because the Dolphins didn't list him as one of the three
quarterbacks on the ''weekly deactivation report.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt said he was still seeking clarification from the
league on the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there was some mixup,'' Emanuel said. ''I'm not
going to say it's wrong, but I've seen other guys on other teams
run similar packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mixup, Wannstedt's moves seem to be working -- at
least through Week 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''My experience of going through this stuff before is maybe why
I'm at where I am right now mentally,'' Wannstedt said. ''I'm as
excited today as I was my first win in Chicago eight years ago, but
I approach it a little differently. I know what we've got to do
tonight and I know what we've got to do tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Gulf Air Didn't Slow Down  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The pilot of a Gulf Air plane that
crashed into the sea off Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard,
failed to gain altitude or slow down during his landing attempts
despite being alerted by his co-pilot and cockpit alarms that the
plane was moving too fast for its altitude, investigators said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The actions described by investigators indicated the crew was
having trouble controlling the plane and that it appeared to have
accelerated rather than reduced speed after the warnings, problems
that could be attributed to the control systems, the crew's
abilities or a combination of both, according to Jim Burnett, a
U.S. aviation expert not involved in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hilldrup, a U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
expert who was appointed by Bahrain as chief investigator into the
Aug. 23 crash, told reporters Monday night that it was too early to
say pilot error caused the Airbus 320 to nosedive into shallow Gulf
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Hilldrup, citing information from the flight data and cockpit
voice recorders that were analyzed by the NTSB in Washington, laid
out the final few minutes of Flight 072. He said Air Traffic
Control at the Bahrain International Airport told Capt. Ihsan
Shakeeb to, ''climb 2,500 feet'' after the pilot called off his
initial landing approach and requested a go-around.
</P>
<P>
   After Shakeeb's second aborted attempt to land, Hilldrup said
''the first officer stated 'over speed limit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the flight data recorder indicated forward
movement of the ''Captain's Side Stick,'' Hilldrup said, which put
the aircraft into a rapid descent. The plane's speed increased
beyond 212 mph at 1,000 feet, setting off the continuous chiming of
the aircraft's Master Warning system, Hilldrup explained.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a ground-proximity alarm went off that Hilldrup said gave
a warning of ''whoop-whoop, pull up'' -- an indication the plane was
in acute danger. The pilot, he said, tried to increase altitude by
pulling back on the stick, but Hilldrup said the ''pull up''
warning lasted to the end of the recording.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's last recorded speed was about 322 mph, Hilldrup
said. Because of varying factors such as air conditions, and the
plane's weight and size, authorities would not say what a proper
landing approach speed would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire data is still viewed as preliminary,'' he said.
''It will take time to validate this data. ...We don't want to
prejudge things.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxes, Hilldrup said, also showed that Shakeeb was the pilot
flying the aircraft, that the autopilot was disconnected on final
approach and that the remainder of the flight was flown manually.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Hamer, Bahrain's Undersecretary for Civil Aviation
who serves as chairman of the investigating committee of which
Hilldrup is a key member, said ''it is premature from our side to
express opinions on this case.'' However, he said that air traffic
controllers had done their job and it is ''the pilot's
responsibility'' to safely land the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hilldrup nor al-Hamer would comment on the crew's last
words; a transcript of the voice cockpit recording was not released
and investigators said they were still working on precise timings
based on the information contained in the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, an aviation expert reached by The Associated Press in
Little Rock, Ark., said that ''the whole scenario indicates that
the crew were having difficulty controlling the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether that arises from control systems or the training of
the crew I don't know, but it could be a combination of both,''
Burnett, a former NTSB chairman, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Forward movement of the Captain's Side Stick would point the
nose of the plane down, he said, adding that ''pitching the plane
nose down tends to only increase the speed rather than decrease
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Monday, about 250 Bahraini Coast Guard divers with
nine boats continued their sweep of the crash site for parts of the
plane and personal effects. ''We are still bringing considerable
amount of pieces of the plane,'' Bahrain's Civil Defense Chief Col.
James Windsor said.
</P>
<P>
   Divers brought in part of the plane's fuselage and one wheel of
the nose undercarriage. Some personal effects, including jewelry
and clothes of the victims, also were retrieved.

<HEADLINE> NFL Contracts Hit New High  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The wacky nature of NFL contracts has hit a
new high.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Stephen Davis' new deal with Washington is the
first in league history to have a maximum value of more than $100
million, although realistically it is worth much less.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins formally announced the deal Monday. Strictly by the
numbers, the contract covers nine years at $90.75 million with an
extra $45 million available in incentives, making the total
possible package worth a staggering $135.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, only the $6.5 million signing bonus is guaranteed. The
deal is otherwise purposely designed to be renegotiated early and
often to keep the team from bursting the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can live with this contract the first two years, that's
the way we created it,'' said Steve Weinberg, Davis' agent. ''They
don't have to go to Stephen Davis in 2000 or 2001 to create some
cap room.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all major NFL contracts have similar structures designed
to bend the cap as much as possible. The previous most lucrative
contract is believed to be the nine-year, $85.5 million deal signed
last year by Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, and Aikman
almost certainly will be long retired before that one expires.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic estimate of the worth of Davis' contract is
three years at $15.75 million, with incentives that could max out
to $32.55 million. The contract actually gives the Redskins about
$800,000 more cap room for this season than Davis' previous
one-year, $3.532 million deal, possibly allowing the team to get to
work on a new multiyear agreement with quarterback Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg and director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato tried to
avoid the media glare by negotiating last week at a Baltimore
restaurant, where the waiter thought his customers were two guys
talking over a fantasy football trade.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy turned into reality when the deal was signed just
before Saturday's 4 p.m. deadline, putting the contract in effect
for Sunday's season opener. The talks had at times been very
acrimonious -- Davis walked out of one session in February when he
felt insulted by a low-ball offer -- and the fourth-year running
back nearly nixed the deal with only 30 minutes to go Saturday
before one final sticking point was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big relief,'' Davis said. ''It's let me know how far
I've come.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overshadowed by all the numbers is Davis' story of
perseverance. Drafted in the fourth round out of Auburn -- it still
stings that he didn't go higher -- Davis worked his way up the
ladder as the ultimate team player. He didn't gripe when he had to
play behind Terry Allen. He handled the humiliating sucker-punch at
the hands of teammate Michael Westbrook about as well as anyone
could. He even played fullback for a season when the starter was
injured during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis won the running back job over Skip Hicks and
rushed for a team-record 1,405 yards despite missing the last two
regular season games with a bad ankle. The injury wasn't healed in
time for the playoffs, but he played anyway and rushed for 119
yards against Detroit. He also went to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a patient runner with excellent vision, often getting
five yards when the play is blocked for three. On Sunday, he put an
exclamation point on his new contract with a bruising 133-yard
performance in a 20-17 victory over Carolina, with 98 of the yards
coming in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a long fight for him,'' coach Norv Turner said.
''He's worked hard the last few years to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was upset in February when the Redskins designated him
their franchise player, restricting his value on the open market.
He walked out when the team proposed $15 million over three years,
and held out for two days of training camp before signing the
one-year contract to get on the field.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Misfire On Game Plan  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The way the San Diego Chargers played in their
opener, it might as well still be 1999 -- or even 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The defense played a great game and the offense let it get away,
losing 9-6 at Oakland on Sunday in a game marked by the return of
quarterback Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Leaf commit his fourth turnover of the game with an
interception on a questionable play selection by the coaches on
fourth-and-inches with 1:25 to play, but it turned out the Chargers
misfired on their game plan overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers expected the Raiders to blitz Leaf into oblivion.
They didn't, although Leaf still was hit several times, including
once on a late hit by Regan Upshaw that left Leaf bloodied and
needing stitches in his chin. The Chargers didn't adjust, and found
themselves in matchups they couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers didn't expect the Oakland crowd to be as vocal as
it was, which contributed to some of the mistakes by Leaf, who
missed last year with a shoulder injury and was playing in his
first real game in nearly 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of how well that defense played yesterday, eight
three-and-outs they gave us, and we can't let that go to waste,''
Leaf said. ''That's a championship defense is what we have, so we
have to develop that championship offense. Believe me, I'm going to
get better. This offense is going to get better and we're going to
win some ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the Chargers had a great game plan, but he also seemed
to diplomatically question the way it was executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't really get to run a lot of our game plan,'' Leaf
said. ''They were trying to protect me. They've just got to let me
do what I can do. You know, put those five wideouts out there and
let's play football. Know that, hey, I know what's happening around
me now and let's go forward with that. And they know that. I don't
think we were as aggressive as we should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the Chargers used eight-man protections a lot on third
down, while the Raiders dropped into a seven-man zone to cover two
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of black shirts back there and only two white
ones,'' Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the coaches wanting to protect him from the blitz ''was
a good thought process, but you've got to be able to see that
during the game and make the adjustments and go forward with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they were more worried about bringing a lot of people
at me and me not seeing it, but I see what's going on out there.
I'm very comfortable in what we want to do. I've just got to drive
the car,'' Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it looked more like a car wreck. Leaf didn't throw a
touchdown pass, was intercepted three times and fumbled twice,
losing one. The only two TD passes he's thrown came during his
awful rookie season of 1998, when he committed 19 turnovers. He now
has 23 career turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Mike Riley: ''I didn't intend that we would be
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf didn't really have an explanation for the turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the game yesterday was dictated because it was
my 10th start,'' he said. ''I was very comfortable sitting back
there throwing. Even after getting hit that one time, I didn't have
jittery feet or anything. I don't foresee it continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said Sunday that he thought he might have broken his left
hand, but X-rays were negative.

<HEADLINE> India Hooked On 'Millionaire' Show  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- It's hard for anyone in India these days to
state a simple fact -- their name, address or the day of the week --
without a friend asking, ''Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the catch phrase of the newest Indian TV hit: a
Hindi-language version of the American quiz show ''Who Wants To Be
a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, hosted by the country's all-time top movie star,
Amitabh Bachchan, is India's most popular TV program ever. Millions
of Indians are hooked, dreaming of winning the rupee equivalent of
$219,000. The stock phrases used in the show, ''Who Will Become a
Holder of 10 million?'' -- rupees, that is -- have become part of the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   And in a typical local reaction to the chance to win loads of
money, Indian viewers are trying to figure out who to bribe to get
on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Indians are not alone in their obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the show are licensed and on the air in 31
countries, from Finland to South Africa, and 19 more companies have
opted to start local versions soon. In most places it's a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   The show's set, music, question format and contestant
qualification process are set out in a 169-page guide that the
creators, Celador Productions Ltd. of Britain, provide with the
license. ''The show is pretty much the same the world over,'' said
Colman Hutchinson, executive producer of the original British show.
</P>
<P>
   But there are local variations.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ''Oh Lucky Man!'' in Russia. In Spain, it's ''50 for
15,'' meaning 50 million pesetas for the 15 questions it takes to
win the grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese audiences didn't take to ''Millionaire'' because of a
cultural bias against individuals who flaunt wealth. Swedish
authorities banned the show, saying it violated laws against
lotteries. Many candidates in the last Russian presidential race
went on the program, though eventual winner Vladimir Putin wasn't
among them.
</P>
<P>
   After the show became a hit in the United States, it spread
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us thought it would be the global success it has
been,'' Hutchinson said. ''It's like when the Beatles went to
America. They became a global domination.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched on July 3 by Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, the Indian
version, called ''Kaun Banega Crorepati,'' was an instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Philbin, the host of the American show, tortures the
audience and contestant with ''Is that your final answer?'' the
Indian show's host asks squirming, would-be millionaires: ''Are you
sure?'' ''Confident?''
</P>
<P>
   As viewers sit with bated breath in front of their TV sets
across India, movie star Bachchan twists the knife, raises an
eyebrow, offers an enigmatic smile. ''Shall we lock it?'' he asks
the contestant. And finally, ''Computer, please lock the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest amount won so far in the Indian game was $110,000,
collected on Aug. 23 by Ramesh Dubey, a clothing store owner from
New Delhi. It's enough to pay his business' rent for the next three
years, even after a 60 percent tax bite.
</P>
<P>
   Dubey's wife, who sat in the audience praying during the last
four questions, came to stand next to her husband after he won. But
she didn't hug him in ecstasy, as American winners' spouses often
do. She bent down and touched the feet of the host, Bachchan, in a
traditional Indian respectful greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the money was not the only criteria. I wanted to be on
the show, be on television and meet Amitabh,'' said Satinder Singh,
who won $28,000 in August. ''Also I hoped I wouldn't make a fool of
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other Indians, Singh had been watching Monday
through Thursday, trying to guess the answers and see if anyone
would become a ''crorepati,'' or ''holder of 10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife kept telling me to try, and I did on an impulse,''
said Singh, who runs a retail furnishing business in the northern
city of Haldvani.
</P>
<P>
   Singh answered the first 12 questions correctly, doubling his
money each time as he covered history, mythology, films and sport.
When it came to the 1.25 million rupee question, Singh asked for a
friend's help to answer: ''Which Moghul emperor transferred the
jagirdari (right to the estates) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa to the
East India Co.?''
</P>
<P>
   Singh's friend correctly chose ''Shah Alam.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the next question would have netted Singh $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''In which sport is this 10-yard long cloth, folded into six and
called Movashi, used?'' the question read. The choices: Sumo
wrestling, pollet, hurdling or malkambh.
</P>
<P>
   Singh chose not to take a guess, instead stopping and keeping
his winnings. He said he plans to donate 10 per cent to charity.
The correct answer was sumo wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Bachchan, 58, with his white beard and billowing dark hair, is
an Indian superstar whose ''angry young man'' roles dominated Hindi
cinema for more than three decades. He has a huge fan following in
India and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His recent films have flopped and a bank is threatening to sell
off his mansion because of bad debts, but the TV show has given his
career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amitabh is extremely stylish and dignified. Our thinking was
that he would add to the magic. Initially many participants came
just to meet him,'' said Sameer Nair, senior vice president for
programming on Star TV, which has enjoyed a ratings boost from the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Scam artists have already tried to cash in by promising hopefuls
access for a fee. Some were told $225 was the price for a
participant's slot. Over the past couple of weeks, several people
have arrived at the filmings offering cash bribes to get on the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already announced on subsequent shows that there is no
fee to get on,'' said Nair, the Star TV programming vice president.
''But all this makes for good fun.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Sheep Drive Draws Crowd  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   REED POINT, Mont. (AP) -- The warning comes over a loudspeaker:
''Get out of the way! The sheep are coming!''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, hundreds of sheep -- some white, some black, some
white with black faces -- run down the main street, as thousands of
onlookers whoop and clap while standing on wooden sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the running of the bulls in Spain, only a whole lot
safer,'' said resident Connie Schlievert.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite -- not even close. But the tame nature of this
event hasn't stopped tourists from thousands of miles away from
pouring into this tiny town to watch the woolly beasts trot down
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just neat, something different,'' said Marj Foulon, who
witnessed the sheep drive Sunday for the third year in the row.
''They don't exactly have things like this in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   It started out as a joke, a lighthearted spoof of 1989's Great
Montana Centennial Cattle Drive, which celebrated Montana's
statehood anniversary. But the sheep drive upstaged the cattle
drive, attracting about 12,000 people, said Schlievert's husband
Russ, an organizer of the original sheep drive who spent part of
the day grilling sausages and roasting lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's become a tourist attraction, and the people in Reed
Point, about 60 miles west of Billings, take the event seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it's just like any small-town celebration, with a
parade, candidates for public office, carnival games and dozens of
food and craft vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is sheep country and we're trying to promote lamb,''
said Russ Schlievert.
</P>
<P>
   Money generated by the sheep drive has been used by the
community club to fix the roof at the fire hall, build an addition
to the library and buy a limousine ride for high school basketball
players after a good season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real shot in the arm for the economy,'' said county
commissioner Chuck Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers advise against running with the sheep. The animals
spook, and have stopped cold in their tracks. But there's no chance
of being gored at this festival, or having to dodge a barreling
animal. The sheep trot in a calm, close formation, herded by a
sheep farmer, and once they get to the end of their journey, they
are rounded up and sent back to the farms.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 people took part in Sunday's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you can get that many people into a town of 100,
that's pretty good,'' said resident Jerry Friend.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The southerain Plains continued to bake in
triple-digit heat
Monday, while the rest of the nation was wet and cool.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excessive heat warainings were posted for most of the southerain
Plains states and lower-Mississippi Valley. Most of Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas expected temperatures over 100
degrees. Dallas reached 100 degrees by 10 a.m. marking its 43rd day
this summer in triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front pushing through the Ohio Valley and Northeast
brought showers and thunderstorms to Ohio, West Virginia and
Kentucky. High pressure behind the cold front brought fair and dry
weather to the Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   An upper-level disturbance over Georgia produced showers and
thunderstorms over the Mid-Atlantic states and Southeast. As much
as an inch fell in southerain Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and
the Florida Panhandle. Gusty winds and small hail fell with the
stronger storms.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered lighter rain fell in Montana and the Dakotas south to
Oklahoma and Missouri. West of the Rockies, skies were partly
cloudy with scattered rain.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Teacher Talks Continue  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Three days before classes were scheduled to
begin for 200,000 Philadelphia students, the city's teachers' union
announced Monday it would urge teachers to approve their first
strike since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers and the
School District of Philadelphia spent Labor Day at the bargaining
table, but union President Ted Kirsch said Monday that negotiations
were not progressing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsch said the union's leaders would recommend teachers vote
Tuesday morning to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the union must give the district 48 hours'
notice of a walkout. Classes are scheduled to begin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have responded positively and creatively at the table,
willing to break ground on each and every issue to improve
education in the district. But at the 11th hour, it has become
apparent that the district has no intention of honoring their side
of the bargain,'' union spokeswoman Barbara Goodman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John F. Street, who hand-picked the school board now
locked in negotiations, took to the podium at a Labor Day rally
Monday and tried to reassure the teachers of the city's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing that we would like more than to get a
contract. We have to have a contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21,000-member union has so far rejected the district's
proposals to extend the school day and school year, increase
co-payments for health insurance, institute a pay scale based on
teacher performance rather than years of experience and level of
education, and give principals more say in teacher job assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants smaller classes, stronger early-childhood
education, a new reading program and enhanced school security. Its
teachers in 1997-1998 earned between $28,600 and $57,200 according
to the union.
</P>
<P>
   District officials have said they will face an $80 million
shortfall in their $1.6 billion budget even without granting the
pay raises that the union says are needed to keep talented
educators in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge has promised to work for additional state funding
if teachers agree to a contract overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge also has said the state might take over the chronically
under-performing district if teachers walk out. A state law passed
in 1998 allows the governor to assume control of city schools if
the school board does not produce a valid budget or state officials
determine that it is not adequately educating pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Although state law does not bar teachers from striking, it does
prevent a work stoppage denying school children of 180 days of
school per calendar year. Teachers could strike for more than six
weeks without a disruption to the 180-day school year, although
there would likely be no scheduled vacations and days off.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hundreds of teachers gathered in downtown
Philadelphia for the Labor Day rally pledged solidarity and vowed
to strike if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to hurt the children. Is the board really thinking
about the children?'' said first-grade teacher Jacqueline Chapman,
wearing a sandwich board that read ''Striking for safe schools'' on
one side and ''$$$ for schools before stadiums!'' on the other -- a
reference to the city's plans to spend hundreds of millions on new
baseball and football stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question in my mind and in the minds of every PFT
member I've talked to that they're ready to go out on strike,''
Kirsch said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 5, Angels 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Hideo Nomo pitched eight shutout innings as the
Detroit Tigers dropped Anaheim below .500 by beating the Angels 5-0
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley was 3-for-5 with two doubles and three RBIs for
the Tigers, who have won four of five and remained five games
behind Cleveland, which leads the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels (68-69) went under .500 for the first time since they
were 20-21 on May 18. They've lost five straight and are 6&AMP;frac12; games
behind Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo (6-11), gave up five hits and struck out seven with two
walks to win for the third time in his last four decisions. He
hasn't pitched a shutout since September 1996 when, while pitching
for Los Angeles, he threw a no-hitter at Colorado's Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Karl (0-1) lost in his second start since the Angels
acquired him Aug. 22 from Colorado, allowing five runs -- four
earned -- and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit got an unearned run in the second when Tony Clark
reached on third baseman Troy Glaus' two-base throwing error and
scored on Deivi Cruz's single.
</P>
<P>
   Easley hit a two-run double to make it 3-0 in the fourth after
singles from Cruz and Brad Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit added a pair of two-out runs in the sixth when Easley
hit an RBI double and scored on Bobby Higginson's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ausmus was 3-for-3 and is batting .361 (13-for-36) in his
last 11 games. ... The Angels' five-game losing streak matches
their season high (Aug. 1-6). ... The Tigers have won 23 of their
last 35 games, including three of four on a current seven-game
homestand. ... RHP Mark Fyhrie, on the disabled list since Aug. 12
with right elbow inflammation, was activated and allowed
Higginson's RBI single, pitching one-tbird of an inning. ... The
Angels have been shut out four times, the previous July 23 at
Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Battle Says He'll Be Ready for Neb.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame quarterback Arnaz Battle's
sprained right ankle didn't appear to bother him in practice Monday
as the Irish began preparations for top-ranked Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be 100 percent,'' coach Bob Davie said. ''The swelling
went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle was several minutes late for the practice and rode a
stationary bike while the team stretched and did some sprints. He
then joined the team for the rest of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no problem with my preparation. I may not be 100
percent as of today, but Tuesday I'm looking forward to going
through the practice at 100 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle had a plastic brace on his ankle during a news conference
earlier Monday and limped slightly. He sprained his ankle Saturday
during the second quarter of No. 23 Notre Dame's 24-10 victory over
Texas A&AMP;M. Battle said his ankle rolled while he was scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle was retaped at halftime and was sore in the second
half. Despite the injury, Battle was more effective in the second
half, completing 4 of 5 passes for 79 yards, including a 46-yard TD
pass to Javin Hunter that gave the Irish the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Battle was 10-of-16 for 133 yards overall with two touchdowns
and no interceptions. He had 12 carries for 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Battle also needed several stitches in his left shin and had the
wind knocked out of him a bit when he ran hard into the wall
surrounding the field after being chased out of bounds on the third
play of the game. Battle joked that he was going to review game
films to see which teammates failed to help him slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someone would grab me but they kind of parted like
the Red Sea,'' he said. ''They say you take your first lick and the
jitters go away. My first lick just happened to be against a
concrete wall.''

   UNION, S.C. (AP) -- An 18-year-old being questioned about
vandalism grabbed his own gun from a police chief's desk, loaded it
and shot himself while handcuffed in the chief's office, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ray Thomasson was in critical condition Monday night
after shooting himself Sunday afternoon when Union Police Chief
Russell Roark walked away from the desk during a questioning
session, said State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Hugh Munn.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been questioning Thomasson about a brick that been
thrown through the window of a downtown business, Munn said. Roark
was called to the door, and that's when Thomasson grabbed the gun,
which had been seized by officers who brought him in, Munn said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomasson's hands had been handcuffed in front of his body so he
could wipe away a chemical sprayed in his face during a struggle
with police, Munn said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Lazio march in parades at opposite ends of the state  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - From the streets of Brooklyn to the suburbs of
Buffalo, Senate candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio
kicked off a Labor Day push for votes Monday, marching in parades
where each received enthusiastic greetings from friendly
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day is usually the traditional launch of political
campaigns heading into the November elections, but both candidates
in this high-profile race have already been sparring for months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a rousing welcome at the 33rd annual West
Indian American Day Carnival Parade, where supporters by the
thousands shouted out ''Hillary'' and screamed in adoration. She
marched alongside former New York mayor and fellow Democrat David
Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love her, I love her husband,'' said Brenda Wallace,
clutching a Clinton campaign sign that she hoped to have
autographed. ''They are nice people, who work for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a canary yellow suit, Clinton zigzagged from curb to
curb shaking hands while her security detail strived to keep
well-wishers, as well as members of the news media, from getting
inside a roped off ''security zone'' that moved down the street as
she marched.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Yolande Bobb, 55, was arrested for allegedly biting a
Secret Service agent who accompanied the first lady, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had intended to march the entire length of the parade,
but after a mid-afternoon cloudburst, the first lady and her
entourage decided to leave the parade after about five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio marched alongside a group of prominent Erie
County Republicans, including party chairman Bob Davis, U.S. Rep.
Tom Reynolds and County Executive Joel Giambra at the Clarence
Center Volunteer Fire Company Labor Day parade near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young and he's got young ideas,'' said Henry Grajek, 74,
a retired engineer from Clarence. ''She doesn't know anything about
New York state. She just wants to get into it to say she's doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lang held out a Lazio campaign sign as the candidate
walked by and pressed him to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Write I promise,''' she instructed. ''Promise more money for
upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio obliged, signing ''I promise'' and his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's in writing,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explained, ''We just don't want the money all to land
in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Lazio returned to the New York State Fair in
Syracuse -- where his rival and her husband, President Clinton,
visited on Saturday. Lazio also had been to the fair two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the response has been overwhelming,'' Lazio said,
despite being accompanied by a crowd of only about 50 or so. ''I
stand on my own. I don't need somebody else with me to draw a
crowd. I have my own record. I have my own name. I don't need to
use somebody else's name to run in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, however, did mend some bridges. During his first trip to
the fair, Lazio casually mentioned he was ''so-so on the sausage
sandwiches.'' The comment had unexpected reverberations as it was
picked up by the local media. Sausage sandwiches are the unofficial
''fair food,'' and some likened it to going to Buffalo and saying
you are ''so-so'' about the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons both feasted on loaded sausage sandwiches during
their visit and on Monday Lazio headed to Basilio's sausage stand,
one of the more popular eateries at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sausage sandwiches are the fair. It's one of the reasons
people come here year after year,'' said owner Paul Basilio, the
brother of former world middleweight boxing champion Carmen
Basilio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one's for Syracuse,'' Lazio said before biting into a
sandwich overflowing with sausage, peppers and onions. ''It's
almost like momma used to make.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis Raises $55M in Telethon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jerry Lewis, bounding back from health
problems that sidelined him for most of last year's Muscular
Dystrophy Association telethon, raised a record $54.6 million
during this year's annual Labor Day weekend event.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 74, and telethon anchor Ed McMahon cheered along with a
studio audience after announcing the total, which will go to fight
neuromuscular diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, fighting back tears, then broke into his show's trademark
closing anthem: ''You'll Never Walk Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We made it for children, for people, for parents ... for
humanity,'' Lewis said, choking back tears. ''And what a wonderful
thing to live in a life where there are people that care so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35th annual telethon, a 23-hour variety show of singing,
dancing and fund-raising, was broadcast on nearly 200 television
stations and was available in streaming video on the Internet. It
ended Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The telethon broke last year's mark of $53.1 million by $1.5
million, and the total could still climb because many local
television stations planned to extend their broadcast after the
national show ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has vowed to conduct the telethon each Labor Day until a
cure is found for neuromuscular diseases.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- AL Rookie of the Year Carlos Beltran, at
odds with the Kansas City Royals since going on the disabled list
two months ago, was activated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder, sidelined July 5 with a bone bruise on his right
knee, was suspended without pay by the team on Aug. 3 for refusing
to report to the Royals' spring training facility at Haines City,
Fla., where the team wanted him to rehabilitate, but relented about
two weeks after the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The players' association filed a grievance, and the sides are
awaiting the decision by arbitrator Shaym Das, who heard arguments
Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   During a five-game rehab assignment at Triple-A Omaha, Beltran
hit .333 (6-for-18) with two home runs and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, who was not in the starting lineup for Monday night's
game against the New York Yankees, was hitting .247 with six homers
and 32 RBIs when he was injured. He rejoins a team with a
hot-hitting outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon, shifted from left field to Beltran's spot in
center, is leading the majors since the All-Star break in average,
hits and runs. He is the first player in Royals history to score
100 or more runs in three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie left fielder Mark Quinn is making a strong case for
Rookie of the Year honors this season. Going into Monday's game, he
led AL rookies in batting, doubles, home runs, RBIs, on-base
percentage, slugging percentage, extra-base hits and total bases.
</P>
<P>
   And right fielder Jermaine Dye is challenging the team's
single-season home run record. Dye had 32 homers going into Monday
night's game, needing five more to break Steve Balboni's record of
36, set in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the Royals activated left-hander Paul Spoljaric
from the disabled list. Spoljaric spent much of the season at
Triple-A Omaha, where he was 1-2 with seven saves and a 3.00 ERA in
40 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric had been on the disabled list since Aug. 19 with a
strained lower back.

<HEADLINE> General: Other Ship Part Near Kursk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers
located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that
resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy
spokesman denied any such discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov offered no evidence for the claim,
which he said supported the theory that a collision with a foreign
vessel caused the explosions that killed the Kursk's 118-man crew
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered
the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being
guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. He did not say when
or how it was located or give other details, according to Russian
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The chief spokesman for the Northern Fleet, Vladimir Navrotsky,
said no such object was found when the Kursk was studied last week,
according to the Russian news web site Gazeta.ru.
</P>
<P>
   The navy press office could not be reached for comment Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the two explosions remains unclear. Military
officials claim the most likely scenario is that the Kursk struck
another vessel, probably a foreign submarine. The U.S. and British
navies have denied any collision, and the Russians have offered no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers blame an internal malfunction and explosion in
the submarine's torpedo compartment. Russian officials have also
not ruled out that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.

<HEADLINE> Labor Day parade begins march to Election Day  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J. (AP) - On Labor Day, the candidates got
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Marching simultaneously but separately in this town's elaborate
annual parade, Democrat Jon Corzine and Republican Bob Franks
marked the unofficial start of election season with waves,
handshakes and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, tan from a weekend of politicking on beaches and
boardwalks, then paid visits to a street fair in Rutherford and a
campaign kickoff picnic for Democrats in Highland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Franks visited Rutherford's street fair. A planned visit to
Closter was canceled by summer rains, but Franks was to continue to
Scotch Plains later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Working the Rutherford street fair from opposite directions,
Franks and Corzine crossed paths amid concession stands and craft
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haven't been to church in a while, so I haven't seen you,''
Corzine told Franks during a lengthy handshake. The two men live in
adjoining Union County towns and both worship at Christ Church in
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine and Franks have been running for the U.S. Senate for
nearly a year. But the ceremonial close of summer brings the fall
election season in focus, and with polls showing 20 to 25 percent
of New Jersey voters undecided, Corzine and Franks have some
influencing to do.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, each man had 64 days to assemble a winning
coalition of party faithful and swayed independents.
</P>
<P>
   What's their pitch to voters?
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they know that I believe we ought to use this
prosperity to invest in the progress of the country - on health
care, education, the environment - and that we ought to be an
inclusive society in all aspects,'' said Corzine, the former
chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. who is in his first race for public
office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said Corzine's proposals for universal health
care, universal long-term care for seniors and universal preschool
would more than soak up the entire federal budget surplus. But
Corzine said, ''I think we can do that fiscally responsibly. Matter
of fact, I know we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, who hopes to join the Senate after four terms in the
House, didn't criticize his opponent, focusing instead on his own
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very much like most of the people who call New Jersey
their home,'' he said. ''I was raised by a great family. They
instilled in me the values that I believe are mainstream in our
state, and I hope people get to know the kind of public official
I've been for the past 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 54-46 majority in the Senate, and Democrats
insist they have a chance to win enough seats to take control. To
do so, they certainly need to win in New Jersey, where Corzine and
Franks are seeking the seat being vacated by Democrat Frank
Lautenberg after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Senate campaign is shaping up as a referendum on
Corzine. With an estimated net worth of $400 million, Corzine spent
an unprecedented $36 million - most of it from his own pockets - to
defeat former Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Florio accused him of buying a Senate seat. Franks has leveled a
similar charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign began airing two ads in Philadelphia and
New York television stations that will mark the start of a
nine-week wave of television and radio advertisements until
Election Day, Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine saturated the airways for eight weeks prior to the
primary in June. He said that his general election ad campaign will
not be as massive because he is now better known.
</P>
<P>
   While assailing Corzine's spending, Franks has been trying hard
to narrow the financial chasm. As Corzine met voters up and down
the Jersey coast this weekend, Franks spent Saturday and Sunday in
private meetings and on the phone, trying to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old girl watching the Monday parade, Shakera Jones of
South Plainfield, was in satisfactory condition after she was run
over by a float Monday morning. She was flown to Robert Wood
Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick after the accident,
which halted the parade for about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   South Plainfield police said the girl ran up to the float to
give a water bottle to someone riding on it, slipped to the ground
between the front and rear axles of the flatbed carrying it, and
the rear tires ran over her, causing severe leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tomei, 42, of South Plainfield, who drove the truck pulling
the float, suffered chest pains and shock immediately afterward and
was taken to Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center. A spokesman for
the hospital said Tomei was in guarded condition after being
admitted to the cardiac care unit for chest pains and hypertension.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Addresses Taxes, Debates  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate
Joseph Lieberman ended a 27-hour campaign push through five states,
telling union workers Monday that ''no one will work harder for
hard working middle class families'' than he and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 400 people at a union hall, Lieberman said
Republican rival George W. Bush's ''monstrous'' tax cut would rule
out possibility of a sustainable prescription drug plan under
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's he going to get the money?'' asked Lieberman. Bush has
said he would offer details of his prescription drug plan on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took aim at Bush's debate proposal, saying it was
designed to limit the size of the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   Using a football analogy, he told the crowd: ''It's a little bit
like heading toward the Super Bowl and one of the teams says, 'I
don't want to play in that city and I don't like those referees and
I'd only like to play three quarters, and not four, because I don't
want too many people to watch the game this year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed three 60-minute debates, but not under a
format recommended by a bipartisan commission. The Gore campaign
wants three 90-minute debates as recommended by the commission,
saying those will reach the widest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at another labor gathering in Detroit, Lieberman said
he would keep pushing for a place for religion in public life,
telling union workers the ''the labor movement is built on values
that come from faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you see men and women as created in the image of God, then
you will not treat them as extensions of machines, as pure things
to take advantage of, and that is what the labor movement is about,
justice to people, fairness to people,'' Lieberman told about 700
mostly union workers at an annual Labor Day festival Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, raised eyebrows last week
when he asserted in a speech here at Fellowship Chapel, one of the
largest black churches in the country, that religious faith should
have a greater role in American public life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave kind of a sermon and some people objected to it because
I talked about the place of faith in American life,'' he told the
union rally. ''Some people say, 'Don't say that.' I'm going to keep
saying it because I believe that's what most Americans believe. It
unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman pledged that he and Gore would fight for workers'
rights, saying they respect working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say that the labor movement was built on values that
come from faith, that were enshrined in the Declaration of
Independence, all of us are created equal. Where did that equality
come from? It was an endowment of our Creator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was coming off an all-night campaign run with Gore.
The two campaigned in Philadelphia and Flint, Mich., on Sunday,
arriving in Tampa, Fla., early Monday. From there, Gore headed for
events in Pittsburgh and Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   After Lieberman's Detroit labor rally, he went to Maumee, Ohio,
for a minor league baseball game that pitted the Toledo Mud Hens
against the Columbus Clippers, a farm team of Lieberman's beloved
New York Yankees. The Clippers won 4-0.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Appeals for Chilean Unity  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- In his first statement since a court
stripped him of his immunity and paved the way for him to stand
trial on human rights charges, Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Monday
called upon Chileans to overcome ''our pains and divisions of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's brief, conciliatory remarks were read by his
granddaughter, Maria Jose Martinez, at the main entrance to the
former dictator's heavily guarded suburban Santiago residence.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet and his wife, Lucia, stood by their 17-year-old
granddaughter as she read.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this date, I want to express to every man and woman of my
beloved fatherland, that I shelter in my heart the firm hope that
our divisions and pains of the past will be overcome, and we will
set our sight in the future, for the sake of the new generations,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, walking with difficulty and using a cane, returned to
the house holding his wife's arm after their granddaughter read the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The day marked the so-called ''Day of National Unity,'' a day
that replaced a holiday that had been observed on Sept. 11 -- the
anniversary of the bloody 1973 coup led by Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday also marked the 30th anniversary of the election victory
of Salvador Allende, the Marxist president that Pinochet eventually
toppled in the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and other leftists laid wreaths at the newly
inaugurated monument to Allende, who committed suicide the day of
the coup in his presidential palace under heavy air and ground
military attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being convinced that I have always wanted what is best for my
fatherland, with full humbleness I ask God to give my countrymen
the necessary wisdom to overcome the conflicts of the past and
contribute to a future in peace, unity and progress,'' Pinochet
added.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing, former ruler also made an appeal to preserve the
works of his 17-year old regime, which in spite of massive human
rights violations is widely credited with modernizing Chile and
starting a long period of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet urged Chileans to work so ''the results achieved with
great effort and sacrifice by all Chileans will not be put at risk,
so it can consolidate and last long.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pinochet's first public comment since the Supreme Court
last month removed his immunity from prosecution. The action paved
the way for his trial in one of the most notorious cases of rights
abuses during his long reign, the so-called ''caravan of death,''
in which a military squad executed 72 political prisoners shortly
after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,197 people were killed or
''disappeared'' for political reasons under Pinochet.

<HEADLINE> Gray Colt Runs Fastest 440 Futurity  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- Eyesa Special, Jack Brooks and Jacky
Martin were too tough a trio to catch on All American Futurity day.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old colt Eyesa Special ran the fastest 440 yards in
the history of the world's richest quarter horse race Monday. He
hit the wire two lengths in front of the filly Fashionisanattitude
and with some help from a tailwind, was timed in 21.097 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Eyesa Special earned $1 million from the record purse of $2.2
million for the partnership of Jim Pitts of Wichita Falls, Texas;
Terry Bell of Lawton, Okla.; and Homer Hill of Dimmett, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million win was the third in four races for the imposing
gray, but familiar territory for Brooks and Martin. Over the past
22 years, they have teamed to write a legacy in quarter horse
racing not likely to be matched anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who in 1959 arrived at Ruidoso Downs with one
thoroughbred mare, has now won eight All Americans, five more than
any other trainer. It was Martin's seventh win and all were aboard
horses trained by Brooks. No other jockey has won the All American
more than three times.
</P>
<P>
   The other wins in the futurity for the two were Moon Lark in
1978, Mr Master Bug in 1982, Mr Trucka Jet in 1985, Merganser in
1988, Strawberry Silk in 1989 and Dash Thru Traffic in 1992. Brooks
also saddled 1998 winner Falling In Loveagain, with jockey G.R.
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   And this one was the easiest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking from the No. 3 post position, Eyesa Special took the
lead moments after the nine-horse field left the gate and midway
through the sprint was already two lengths in front.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hand-rode him most of the way,'' Martin said. ''I hit him a
time or two and it was really all over then.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who watched the start of the race from behind the gate,
considered the California horse Copper Buff his biggest threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt if I could break with Copper Buff, we'd have a heck of
a shot to win it,'' Brooks said. ''It's not three or four jumps and
you can see our horse is hanging with him and I knew what he was
going to do later on. I headed for the winner's circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Martin went through a difficult split in 1995, but at
the start of this year decided to get back together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been a million miles together and we should have never
parted company,'' Brooks said. ''But it might have been the best
thing for both of us. It made both pick our heads up and look a
little bit ... because we'd had it so good for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the colt bled internally during the running of the
race but pulled up in good shape and veterinarian Bob Story said
the colt did not suffer any serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eyesa Special's winning time surpassed the 21.18 by Winalota
Cash in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he knew last winter, when he started training Eyesa
Special, what type of speed the colt had.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back then, he was one of the best things we'd ever had,''
Brooks said. ''He proved it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashionisanattitude, the No. 10 horse, closed strongly on the
outside to finish second, but posed no threat to Eyesa Special. The
filly, owned by Joe Kirk Fulton of Lubbock, Texas, won $406,120.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Ortiz, who rode Fashionisanattitude, said the filly was
more concerned with crowd noise than racing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a good trip, but the mare never really got to running,''
he said. ''She was tweaking her ears back and forth and looking
around all the way down. When she bears down, she can really run
and it might have been close. We might even could have outrun
him.''
</P>
<P>
   First Down N Surfin, who has yet to win a race in four starts,
was a half-length back in third and earned $174,008 for Daniel
Lucas, a retired doctor from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field, in order of finish, was: Eye On Paydirt,
Copper Buff, Whosleavingwho, Beccas Quick Six, Ima Royal Winner and
Blazen Maven.
</P>
<P>
   Eyesa Special paid $7.60, $4 and $3. Fashionisanattitude
returned $4.40 and $3.20, while First Down N Surfin paid $4.80 to
show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Russ Ortiz was sent to the bullpen at the
All-Star Break to work things out. It was a short stay. After
spending exactly one day out of the starting rotation, Ortiz has
been nearly unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (12-10) allowed two hits, four walks and struck out five
in 6 1-3 innings to win his seventh consecutive decision as the San
Francisco Giants defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander extended his scoreless streak to 17 innings,
dating to the second inning Aug. 25 at Philadelphia. He hasn't lost
since July 29 at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident in my ability and I never lost that,'' said
Ortiz. ''I did lose a little confidence in throwing inside early in
the year and I made too many mistakes with my fastball and that
killed me. Now I'm able to make my pitches and stay ahead of the
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was 4-8 when he made his only relief appearance of the
season on July 14, pitching six innings against the Oakland
Athletics without allowing an earned run. He hasn't looked back
since.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's keeping the ball in the ballpark,'' said Giants' manager
Dusty Baker. ''In the first half he gave up something like 20 or 25
homers. You have to call upon positive results you've experienced
in the past. You just stay after it and keep pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds supplied most of the offense, homering twice to top
40 for the fourth time in his career. Rich Aurilia also hit a home
run for the Giants, who won their sixth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spent about an hour extra hitting before the game and it
paid off,'' said Baker. ''September is Barry's month. His physical
strength is the difference. He's in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit solo shots in the third inning off Omar Daal (3-17)
and in the eighth off Jeff Brantley to give him 41 homers on the
year. Bonds has 45 career multihomer games, 10th on the career
list.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice, but there's a long way to go and I really don't
want to talk about it,'' said Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen got three outs for his 34th save in 39 opportunities.
He has converted 21 straight save chances, tied with Toronto's
Billy Koch for the longest in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has a major league-leading 13 shutouts, the most
for the Giants since having 16 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lead idle Arizona by a season-high 5&AMP;frac12; games in the NL
West.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a lot of time left and we're not taking anything
for granted,'' Bonds said. ''It seems all our starters are locked
in and we're comfortable at home. When things aren't going well, we
come home and get it straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies matched their season high with six consecutive
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not scoring, everything becomes glaring,'' said
Phillies manager Terry Francona. ''Our whole team is trying to do
too much. We're trying to hit the ball 500 feet, when 330 is good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal threw his third consecutive quality game, but still managed
to lose his fifth straight decision, giving up solo homers to Bonds
and Rich Aurilia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched real good, but we're going through a period where
you have to be perfect and it's hard to be perfect,'' said
Francona. ''I'd like to think if you only give up two runs we have
a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal pitched six innings, allowing three hits but none after
Bonds gave the Giants a 2-0 lead with one out in the third. He
walked five and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been tough, but that's the way it is,'' said Daal.
''Today when I gave up the second run I thought I was in big
trouble because Russ was pitching a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal has allowed just seven earned runs in his last 19 innings
(3.32 ERA) to lower his ERA to 6.67 from a season high 7.19 on Aug.
19. He's won once in 14 starts since May 30.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bonds last hit 40 homers in 1997. ... Ortiz does not have a
complete-game shutout in 73 career starts. ... Giants 1B J.T. Snow
did not start consecutive games for the first time this season. ...
Abreu has 14 walks and five stolen bases in 15 games as the leadoff
hitter. ... The Phillies have scored one earned run in their last
41 innings. ... Aurilia leads all NL shortstops with his 17 homers.

<HEADLINE> Eight-Time Division Champs in Slump  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Go ahead, take the division title. The Atlanta
Braves insist.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no. The New York Mets don't want it. Can't they just
leave it in Atlanta for another year?
</P>
<P>
   On it goes, a so-called pennant race in which neither team will
take control, flailing around in the NL East as if the thought of
extending the season deep into October is downright revolting.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were off Monday, licking their wounds and trying to
figure out how to escape the worst stretch of the year -- five
defeats in seven games, and eight of the last 11. Included is a
season-high, four-game losing streak and three straight series
losses, another first.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta is still on pace to win 95 games, it would be the
fewest victories in a full season since 1991, when the Braves began
their unprecedented streak of eight straight division titles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the players even called a rare clubhouse meeting,
hoping that airing things out would turn things around. But Atlanta
is only 2-3 since going behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no panic in this club,'' manager Bobby Cox said,
undeterred by a 9-3 setback Sunday to the lowly Houston Astros. ''I
think the day off may help us. Maybe it'll break things up a little
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the suddenly clutch-less Mets, Atlanta was still
clinging to a one-game lead in the East after going 14-15 in August
and losing two of three in Houston to start September. The
once-torrid Mets endured three straight final at-bat losses to St.
Louis over the weekend and lost Monday at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way both teams are playing,'' Braves outfielder Brian
Jordan said, ''you'd think no one wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta could always count on its starting pitching, but Tom
Glavine (18-6) has been out on a limb in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (15-8) has put together solid numbers overall, but
he's only 3-5 since July 18. Andy Ashby, acquired in an All-Star
break deal, was rocked for five runs and eight hits in 3 2-3
innings Sunday, taking his fourth straight loss. Kevin Millwood is
not the same pitcher he was a year ago, plodding along at 8-10 with
a 4.76 ERA. Overall, the staff ERA (4.22) is more than half-run
above last year's and on pace to be the highest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about the pitching. Chipper Jones, who agreed last
month to a six-year, $90 million contract extension, has been a
rather ordinary player since the All-Star break. He is batting just
.259 with eight homers and 26 RBIs, including a current 8-for-48
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Making those numbers more pronounced, Jones was always one of
the Braves' most reliable clutch players. Until this year, he had a
.306 career average after the break and clinched his first NL MVP
award last season by hitting .324 with 24 homers and 53 RBIs down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to go through a rut at some point in time,''
Glavine said. ''Unfortunately, we're going through it right now.
When it's late in the season, it's magnified a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Glavine to pull the Braves out of another slump.
He'll start Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game series
against Arizona, taking on Randy Johnson (17-5) in a showdown
between the two leading contenders for the NL Cy Young award.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are a desperate team, trailing the Mets by 4&AMP;frac12;
games in the wild card race. But Glavine is 8-1 when he's pitched
after an Atlanta loss, and five of those wins came in August,
putting a soft landing on the Braves' slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a challenge,'' Glavine said. ''You can't let the
situation make you do things you're not capable of doing. I've just
got to pitch my game.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Family Members Dead in Ohio  </HEADLINE>
By KATE ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVA, Ohio (AP) -- Seven members of a family were found dead
inside their burning trailer early Monday in what police said
appeared to be a murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary autopsy reports released late Monday showed the
youngest of the five children, 5-year-old twins, had been shot to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody in that house we feel was involved in firearms, and
the last man standing probably set the fire,'' said Noble County
Sheriff Landon T. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Richard Pangle, 37, his wife, Sheryl, 29, and
their five children -- ages 5-12 -- were found after a report of a
fire about 3 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the fire had been set, but he would not say how or
who authorities believe may have committed the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   An automatic pistol and three shotguns were found near the
bodies of the parents, and the oldest daughter was in the living
room where spent cartridges were found, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were identified as Kayla, 12, Brett, 10, Derek, 7,
and twins Trina and Trinda, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had known the family for years, said there had been
no reports of domestic violence at the house, but he said the
couple had been discussing a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor in a camper about 20 feet from the trailer, at the
end of a gravel road in the Appalachian foothills of eastern Ohio,
saw the fire and ran to a nearby home to call for help, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Pangle's mother lives nearby on the same property, which
is owned by the family. Her brother, Lloyd Anderson, said Richard
Pangle doted on his children and recently bought all of them new
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   He had been working for a company that manufactures shipping
containers in nearby Caldwell, a town of about 1,700 about 75 miles
east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the bicycles and children's toys were
scattered across the property. The front half of the
brown-and-white trailer was destroyed, with only a charred stove
standing in what appeared to be the kitchen. The back half of the
trailer was standing, a burned-out shell.
</P>
<P>
   Crying family members and friends gathered near the trailer and
comforted one another. Sheriff's Detective Steven Hannum said
investigators were also having a difficult time emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ''These folks are known by many of the people who live in Noble
County,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Court: Siamese Twins Need Exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British appeals court on Monday requested a
second medical opinion before making a life-and-death decision
about the fate of four-week-old Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   The three judge panel in the Court of Appeal ordered the second
examination at the start of legal action by the girls' parents to
block a High Court ruling that would mean certain death for one of
their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Johnson ruled last month that Jodie -- the stronger
of the twins -- should be separated from her sister Mary, who is
reliant on her sister's lungs and heart to survive. If they are
separated, Mary will die, medical experts said. But without the
surgery, both twins are likely to perish within three to six months
because of the extra strain on Jodie's organs. Mary and Jodie are
not the their real names, and the family has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were born joined at the lower abdomen on Aug. 8 in
Manchester, northern England. Their parents have opposed an
operation to separate them, saying they did not want one of their
children ''actively killed.'' They have also questioned what kind
of quality of life the surviving twin would have.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Parker, a lawyer assigned to represent the stronger twin,
said medical experts believed that she would not face significant
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must look at it not that something is being done to Mary to
hasten the end of her life, but that something is being done to
Jodie in order to restore to her her own integrity and bodily
system,'' Parker told the court.
</P>
<P>
   A medical team from London's prestigious Great Ormond Street
Hospital agreed to see the twins on Tuesday and report back to the
court.

Air-Quality Tests Ordered for New Subs
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX (AP) -- An inadequate air-scrubbing system could make
stale air aboard Canada's new Victoria-class submarines a health
hazard, reports suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised about units that remove carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere aboard the state-of-the-art boats,
which are being purchased from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The scrubbers aboard the new subs are the same devices the navy
was concerned about on its now-retired Oberon-class submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both classes (of boats) are diesel operated (and) the method
of cleansing and upgrading the atmosphere is identical,'' says a
1998 letter, part of a group of documents obtained under the Access
to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide levels ''climb to twice the maximum permissible
concentration after only 12 hours'' of undersea operation, says
1997 Defence Department report that looked at the Oberons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This represents an unsatisfactory condition for both the
health and safety of the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defence Department was warned a decade ago there was a
potential health problem.
Documents: 2 Navy Ships Tore Into Fishermen's Gear
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX (AP) -- At least two of four navy ships tore into
fishermen's gear during a training exercise in St. Margaret's Bay,
N.S., this summer, newly released documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgment appears to bolster the claims of a group of
five mackerel fishermen, who are asking for more than $140,000 in
compensation for damaged equipment and lost income.
</P>
<P>
   ''Navigation tracks of the ships do correlate with the reported
positions of the fishing gear,'' says a document obtained under the
Access to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''Furthermore, two of the ships report actually hitting fishing
gear, while a third ship reports seeing fishing gear and believe
they may have hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged damage occurred June 22 as a flotilla of four navy
ships simulated the evacuation of Canadian nationals from an
unstable country, an exercise dubbed Operation Blue Hope.
</P>
<P>
   HMCS Iroquois, a destroyer, and HMCS Preserver, a supply ship,
confirmed they hit fishing gear in the positions reported by
aggrieved fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the destroyer HMCS Athabaskan reported increased
torque on its propeller shaft, suggesting it too had snagged gear.
Ex-Ontario Students Allege Attempted Genocide
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 former students of a Catholic school on a northern
Ontario reserve have commenced legal action against Ottawa, the
province and the Church claiming decades of physical, sexual and
psychological abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the claimants say they were slapped, brutally beaten and
sexually assaulted at St. Anne's Residential School in Fort Albany
as part of a larger attempt to smother their native culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, genocide happened at that school,'' said John-Paul
Nakochee, 42, a student there between 1965 and 1973. ''I was
slapped for trying to speak my own language.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer James Wallbridge has filed 13 individual claims and eight
group statements, each representing about 10 claimants, in Superior
Court. Two more group claims were being processed and Wallbridge
said at least 150 people have requested the forms necessary to
commence action.
</P>
<P>
   Nakochee's statement of claim alleges he was beaten and sexually
assaulted and also ''punished and ridiculed for speaking Cree, or
for observing any aspect of his culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakochee is claiming damages of more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of Keewatin Le Pas operated St. Anne's from 1904
to 1973 in the isolated Cree community of 1,400 on James Bay. Cree
and Ojibwa children were forced to live for 10 months a year at the
school as part of a failed federal policy that tried to assimilate
aboriginals into white culture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ontario provincial police concluded a three-year
investigation that found evidence of widespread sexual and physical
abuse of students at St. Anne's.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has recognized its role in misconduct by staff and
teachers at residential schools in Canada. In 1998, the federal
government apologized and established a $350-million fund to pay
for traditional healing circles and to cover the cost of counseling
for victims.

<HEADLINE> Fides: Bishop Detained in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A newly appointed auxiliary bishop in
central China has been detained in the government's ongoing
crackdown on the underground Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican
news agency Fides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fides said there has been no word of Monsignor Jiang Ming Yuan
of Hebei province since public security officials took him away
Aug. 26. Witnesses confirmed his detention, Fides said.
</P>
<P>
   The news coincides with word of another crackdown by Chinese
authorities, who charged 85 members of a banned Christian church
with belonging to a cult, a Hong Kong-based human rights group said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 85 were among 130 members of the Fangcheng church detained
Aug. 23 in central China's Henan province, including three
Americans later released following appeals from the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's communist leaders forbid worship in all but a state
church set up in 1951 to break the Vatican's influence over the
country's Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Two other clerics in Hebei, a bishop and an auxiliary bishop,
have been missing since police took them away in 1996, Fides said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based Cardinal Kung Foundation reported last week that
police detained a priest, two nuns and 21 other Roman Catholics in
the southeastern province of Fujian. Beatings in police custody had
the priest bleeding and spitting blood, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said the 85 Fangcheng church members were charged with
''using a cult to sabotage the law of the nation and the
enforcement of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Henan government's religious affairs bureau has denied that
any Christians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cult law, tightened in October during the government's
crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, has been used
against a variety of Christian and meditation groups that officials
view as threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangcheng church is one of scores of so-called house
churches that operate out of private homes to avoid restrictions on
worship. China's communist government forbids organized religious
activities outside state-sanctioned churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangcheng church said China's official church politicizes
religion and places allegiance to the national government above
allegiance to God in violation of Christian tenets.

<HEADLINE> Toledo: Time To Forget Alabama Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The broad smile UCLA coach Bob Toledo
displayed Monday had probably been in place for nearly 48 hours --
ever since the Bruins completed a dominating 35-24 victory over
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was about to be replaced by a more serious look.
</P>
<P>
   ''They key thing now is we put it behind us,'' Toledo said after
speaking in glowing terms of the Bruins' effort against the Crimson
Tide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked too hard to not enjoy the victory,'' Toledo said.
''It's my job now to make sure we put it behind us, starting with a
team meeting at 3 o'clock today.''
</P>
<P>
   Unranked entering Saturday's opener at the Rose Bowl, UCLA is
No. 16 in this week's Associated Press poll. Alabama is 13th, down
from No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''The poll thing really baffles me,'' Toledo admitted. ''I'm
pleased we moved up in the rankings, but are you going on last
year, or are you going on this year?
</P>
<P>
   ''When you beat somebody, you should be ranked ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rolled up 396 yards in total offense against a
defense that allowed an average of 100 yards less last season. The
Crimson Tide, meanwhile, gained 265 yards against UCLA, which gave
up 444.6 yards per game last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had said we had the best defensive group since I've been
here,'' Toledo said. ''They didn't score any points on our defense
in the second half. Five times, we went three plays and out (on
defense). One time, we went two plays and recovered a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Offensively, we controlled the clock. That's something I
wanted to do. I think the conditioning really showed. Our offensive
line, our tight ends, our fullbacks, we were knocking guys off the
ball. They were very physical, (DeShaun) Foster was very
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, plagued by a sprained ankle much of last season, when he
gained only 375 yards, had a career-high 187 yards on a school
record-tying 42 carries against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impressive thing is he had 105 YAC yards -- yards after
contact,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Foster's heavy work load, Toledo smiled and
said: ''That was a piece of cake compared to what he did in high
school. He is physically capable of doing that. I don't
particularly want him to carry the ball 42 times a game. If that's
what we need to do, maybe I'll give him two scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he was a little sore Sunday, but felt fine Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''However many times they ask me to carry the ball, I'll carry
it,'' said Foster, who recalled carrying the ball 44 times once in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea I was going to get 42, I thought maybe 20, 25.
They just kept calling my number, I was happy to carry it. The
(offensive line), they were just blocking well, I was in the
secondary a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a 6-foot-1, 217-pounder, said he wasn't sure if he lost
any weight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might have, I haven't stepped on the scale yet,'' he said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won decisively despite the fact that quarterback Cory
Paus separated his throwing shoulder on the game's first play, and
Alabama's Freddie Milons returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown
three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McCann replaced Paus and completed 14 of 24 passes for 194
yards and one touchdown with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go find the helmet and get loose,'' McCann said when asked his
first reaction to Paus' injury. ''The blood starts pumping, that
helps you get loose a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann expressed sympathy for Paus, but said he hoped to keep
the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a devastating blow, anybody would be upset,'' McCann
said. ''It's an unfortunate way to get the job. I was fortunate
enough to be ready and take advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he expected Paus to miss at least three games
starting with Saturday's contest against Fresno State at the Rose
Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Rams, Broncos Tied After First Q  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Brian Griese and Az-Zahir Hakim scored
first-quarter touchdowns as the Denver Broncos and St. Louis Rams
were tied 7-7 Monday night in a game matching the last three Super
Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   Griese led the Broncos, who won the Super Bowl after the 1997
and '98 seasons but slumped to 6-10 last year, to a touchdown on
their first possession. He scored on an 8-yard bootleg with 10:05
to go as the Broncos drove 59 yards in six plays.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, who is returning from a serious knee injury,
carried the first three plays for a combined 17 yards, and after
two completions he was an effective decoy on Griese's scoring run.
Griese also hit Rod Smith for 16 yards and Dwayne Carswell for 18
in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Super Bowl champion Rams blew their first scoring
chance as Al Wilson intercepted a ball that glanced off the hands
of St. Louis tight end Roland Williams at the 7 with 5:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense held after five plays, and Hakim returned Tom
Rouen's punt 86 yards to tie the score with 2:05 left in the
quarter. Hakim also returned a punt for a touchdown last Oct. 3
against the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were making their first Monday night appearance since
Nov. 25, 1991, a 33-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. St. Louis
hadn't had a Monday night game since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Lieberman Wrap Up All-Nighter  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A caffeinated Al Gore marched, not danced, to
''The Pennsylvania Polka,'' still standing Monday after an
all-nighter with the graveyard shift and more than 10,000
supporters behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate and running mate Joseph
Lieberman wrapped up the madcap and sleepless 28-hour campaign
sprint as a Labor Day anthem to American workers. As for
presidential politics, this was ''time to turn up the heat,'' said
Gore, sustained by five changes of shirts, two pre-dawn breakfasts
and rotations of coffee and Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats beckoned to middle-class voters with a fired-up
argument against the broad $1.3 trillion tax-cut package at the
heart of Republican George W. Bush's rival campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd veto that in a minute,'' Gore said at the Louisville Motor
Speedway in Kentucky, where he lost count of the hours just as his
marathon reached the finish line. ''I've been at this for 30
straight hours. You're going to get the unvarnished truth -- you
know it!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if to inch closer to that 30-hour mark, he made
unscheduled stops at a fire station and to shake hands with Taco
Bell workers.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the race he and Bush began two years ago started fresh
on Labor Day, Gore is using the week to present his agenda for the
economy as shiny and new. He emphasized balanced budgets, paying
off the national debt and using budget surpluses to improve
schools, health care and the environment. He planned an economic
speech Wednesday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to handle this responsibly. We've shown in the
last eight years that we know how to do that,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6:30 a.m. or Hour 14, as he greeted 500 Florida
enthusiasts at a West Tampa fire station, Gore began to ramble and
repeat himself. But from the back of a firetruck, his populist
us-against-them focus remained sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we stand by as the rich get richer and the poor get
poorer? ... I'll be durned if we're going to go back to the old
ways of just borrow and spend and go into debt in order to give a
big tax cut to the wealthy,'' he drawled.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hours later, he regaled Pittsburgh supporters with tales
of the strapped senior citizens he'd met who need Medicare coverage
for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a Medicare drug benefit at a 10-year cost of
about $253 billion. Bush belatedly promised to outline a proposal
on Tuesday. Gore's economic analysts preemptively crunched numbers
to argue there's no room for drug aid in a Bush budget heavy with
tax cuts, unless he were to start digging deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett retorted, ''Why should people be
expected to believe his math calculations of Governor Bush's budget
proposals?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who split from Gore in Tampa to cover more ground in
Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, told Detroit union workers at a rally,
''This guy is working me!''
</P>
<P>
   With daytime fireworks over the Allegheny River and the nonstop
frenzy, Gore and Lieberman sought to create an image of themselves
in the lead of this race. They zeroed in on tossup states where,
aides said, internal campaign polling over the past two weeks has
been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ever wondered whether Michigan is central to what
happens in this election, I've been here three times in the last
week and twice in the last 10 hours,'' Lieberman, who had been with
Gore for a midnight stop in Flint, joked at Detroit's annual Labor
Day festival.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of confetti and a band playing ''The Pennsylvania
Polka'' greeted Gore as he, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson strode from Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade into
Point State Park and a crowd that police put at 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers suffered a mix of satisfaction from what Lieberman
called ''adrenaline surge'' and sheer exhaustion. On one leg,
Gore's brother-in-law, Frank Hunger, tried sleeping on the floor of
Air Force Two but couldn't find a spare pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, adviser Greg Simon delighted in the contrast to Bush's
holiday weekend itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday's event was one bogus press conference. Today he's
got one talk,'' Simon sniffed. ''He's running a Rose Garden
campaign without a rose garden.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Uses Profanity About Reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- George W. Bush made a disparaging remark
Monday about a reporter from The New York Times that was picked up
by a live microphone.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush stood on the podium waiting for music to finish, he
turned to running mate Dick Cheney and used an obscenity to
describe reporter Adam Clymer in the nearby press area. Cheney
agreed with Bush's assessment. Both men thought their remarks were
off-mike.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the comment at a brief airport news conference
in Allentown, Pa., late Monday, Bush said, ''I regret that a
private comment I made to the vice presidential candidate made it
through the public airways.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt he owed Clymer an apology, Bush did not answer
directly, only saying, ''I regret everybody heard what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said the remarks were ''a
whispered aside to his running mate. It was not intended as a
public comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clymer said, ''I'm disappointed in the governor's language.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney refused to discuss it. ''The governor made a private
comment to me. It was a private comment, and I don't plan to say
anything about it,'' he told reporters later in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays need 11 wins to become the third
expansion team to increase its victory total over its first three
seasons. The New York Mets did it from 1962-64 and the Seattle
Pilots/Milwaukee Brewers did it from 1969-71. ... All 25 of Tampa
Bay's remaining games are against teams playing over .500. ... RHP
Albie Lopez is day to day with a strained left calf. ... 3B Vinny
Castilla was activated but did not play. He had been sidelined
since Aug. 1 with back inflammation. ... RHPs Dan Wheeler and
Travis Harper were recalled from Triple-A Durham. Wheeler pitched a
scoreless inning of relief Monday. ... The Devil Rays are 2-10 at
Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel is optimistic RHP Bartolo
Colon, who left his start Saturday with an inflamed shoulder, will
not be sidelined. ''His MRI was good, he says he feels fine and
right now, he's going to pitch on Thursday.'' Colon is scheduled to
throw on the side Tuesday. If he cannot make his scheduled start,
RHP Charles Nagy is among those being considered as a replacement.
Nagy had elbow surgery May 19 and has been on rehab assignment at
Triple-A Buffalo. ... OF Kenny Lofton has hit .364 (39-for-107)
since Aug. 8 to raise his average from .252 to .279. ... Cleveland
is 40-22 in games Lofton has scored a run.
Athletics-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: LHP Todd Belitz made his major league debut, throwing
eight consecutive balls. .... Oakland starters combined to go 3-0
with a 1.67 ERA in the series. ... Starter Barry Zito retired the
first seven batters he faced, and didn't allow a hit until Dave
Martinez singled with one out in the fourth. ... In Zito's two
starts against Toronto he has allowed just one earned run over 13
2-3 innings. ... The Athletics have hit 17 home runs in their last
10 games.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays have gone a season long 143 at-bats
without a home run. ... Toronto is 7-21 when not hitting a homer.
... The Blue Jays had a season low two hits. ... David Wells
allowed seven runs, matching a season high. .. Toronto was 3-7
against Oakland this year.
Mariners-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Boston and Seattle split their weekend series 2-2. The
Mariners haven't won any of their last seven series. ... Edgar
Martinez had two hits and his second stolen base of the season.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Brian Daubach missed his fifth consecutive game since he
was injured in last Tuesday's brawl against Tampa Bay. ... Carl
Everett is the sixth switch-hitter to get 100 or more RBIs in both
leagues. He had 108 last season with Houston. ... The Red Sox
called up Donnie Sadler before the game and started him at second
base, batting eighth. ... Monday was Carlton Fisk Day in Fenway
Park as the Red Sox retired the Hall of Famer's number.
Orioles-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: When OF Karim Garcia makes his debut for the Orioles,
he will be the 49th player used by Baltimore this year, second-most
in club history... the Orioles were coming off a 5-hour, 17-minute
game against Cleveland on Sunday, a 12-11 loss at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: SS Cristian Guzman has 19 triples and remains on pace
for 23, which would break the AL record of 21 set by Willie Wilson
in 1985.... Manager Tom Kelly wants his 2001 contract status to be
settled before the end of this season and Twins CEO Chris Clouser
says that is possible: ''I'm sure we will be meeting with Tom in
the near future.''
Rangers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Cal Eldred is likely done for the season. Eldred,
who has been on the DL since July 17 because of an irritated nerve
in his right elbow, took himself out of a rehab start Sunday with
Triple-A Charlotte after two innings. He gave up four runs on three
hits, including two home runs, and hit a batter. Eldred, 10-2 in 19
starts before he was sidelined, was penciled in to start Friday
against Cleveland. The rotation for the weekend series against the
Indians now is LHP Mike Sirotka on Friday followed by RHPs James
Baldwin and Jon Garland. ... RHP Kevin Beirne was recalled from
Charlotte and arrived Monday in time to pitch the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers will add four players to the major league
roster Tuesday, including OF Ruben Sierra. Sierra, 34, signed with
the Rangers on May 1 and led Triple-A Oklahoma team with 18 homers
and 82 RBIs. He was batting .326 in 112 games. He first played in
the majors in 1986 with the Rangers. ''We'll see what he can do,''
Rangers GM Doug Melvin said. ''Obviously, his role has changed from
when he was 22, 23 years old.'' RHP Danny Cubillan, IF Kelly
Dransfeldt and C Randy Knorr also will join the Rangers on Tuesday.
Manager Johnny Oates downplayed Sierra's turn to the big leagues.
''They're just September callups,'' Oates said. ''They'll report
tomorrow and be used as needed.''
Angels-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: OF Darin Erstad made his 10th straight start at DH in
Monday's game at Detroit. He hasn't played the outfield since
missing four games Aug. 19-23 with muscle spasms in his right rib
cage. ... 3B Troy Glaus needs seven extra base hits to tie Doug
DeCinces' club-record 77 set in 1982. ... OF Ron Gant hit safely in
nine of his first 15 starts since the Angles acquired him July 30
from Philadelphia. ... The Angels are the last AL team to make
their first visit to Comerica Park. Their current four-game series
is their only trip to Detroit this season.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Willie Blair still is listed as Thursday's starter
against Anaheim, but RHP Dave Mlicki might go instead. Mlicki has
been on the DL since July 23 with a severe sinus infection that
required surgery, but he's ready to return after making two rehab
starts. ... 1B Tony Clark was 4-for-8 with two doubles in his first
three games back from the DL (lumbar spine strain). He was 2-for-2
with a walk in Sunday's 4-1 loss to Texas. ... Six of SS Deivi
Cruz's last eight hits entering Monday went for extra bases (three
doubles, a triple and two home runs).
Yankees-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: LHP Andy Pettitte was making his first start of the
season against Kansas City. In 11 previous appearances (nine
starts), he was 5-3 with a 3.36 ERA. ... David Justice reached 100
RBIs for the third time in his career, the first since 1997. ...
Derek Jeter has a 29-game streak of reaching base safely on a hit,
walk or hit by pitch. That's the longest such streak by a Yankees
player since Jeter reached safely in 53 straight games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals activated OF Carlos Beltran and LHP Paul
Spoljaric from the disabled list. Beltran, the 1999 AL Rookie of
the Year, had been out since July 5 with a bone bruise on his right
knee. Spoljaric had been out since Aug. 19 with a strained lower
back. ... The Royals' Jermaine Dye continues to chase the club
record for most home runs in a season. He had 32 going into Monday
night's game, and is one of only nine Kansas City players to hit 30
or more homers in a year. The record of 36 was set by Steve Balboni
in 1985.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Lee Stevens is day to day after straining a flexor
muscle in his left big toe. Stevens said he was hurt while swinging
the bat Monday. X-rays were negative. ... When Vladimir Guerrero
was ejected for arguing over a third strike, the Expos lost their
most potent offensive weapon, but they did not lose production from
his spot in the lineup. Fernando Seguignol, who replaced Guerrero,
hit a two-run homer to cut the score to 3-2. Expos manager Felipe
Alou did not criticize Guerrero for being ejected. ''You'll have to
ask him what happened, I haven't talked to him,'' Alou said. ...
The Expos recalled RHPs Tony Armas Jr. and Guillermo Mota from
Triple-A Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mike Matheny threw out two runners Monday and
extended his career-high hitting streak to 12 games. Manager Tony
La Russa said he wasn't surprised by Matheny's offense even though
he was acquired mostly for his catching skills. ''After seeing how
hard he worked on his hitting in spring training, I think it has
paid off for him,'' La Russa said. Matheny has thrown out 38 of 77
runners attempting to steal. La Russa said Matheny was in some good
company when he is compared to other catchers he has managed. ''I
had Carlton Fisk and Terry Steinbach and he's right up there with
those two,'' he said. ... Andy Benes made his first appearance
Monday after going on the disabled list Aug. 19 with an inflamed
right knee. Benes, making his sixth career relief appearance, gave
up a double and a home run in 1-3 inning.
Mets-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets called up LHP Bobby M. Jones, RHP Grant
Roberts and INF Jorge Velandia from Triple-A Norfolk. INF David
Lamb was designated for assignment to open a spot for Velandia on
the 40-man roster. ... Mike Piazza got hit on the left elbow by
Pokey Reese's bat as he followed through on a swing in the eighth
inning Monday. Piazza stayed in the game and said afterward he was
fine.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey has 435 homers, 26th on the career list.
Andre Dawson is next at 438. ... Griffey is three homers shy of
becoming the fourth player to hit 40 homers seven times (Babe Ruth,
Hank Aaron and Harmon Killebrew are the others). ... Elmer Dessens
is 2-5 in his seven starts since the end of July.
Marlins-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins recalled INF Chris Clapinski from Class A
Brevard County. On Tuesday, the Marlins plan to recall RHPs
Vladimir Nunez and Joe Strong, INF Nate Rolison and C Sandy
Martinez from Triple-A Calgary. INF Pablo Ozuna is scheduled to be
recalled from Double-A Portland on Tuesday. ... Luis Castillo has a
.434 on-base percentage (entering Monday's game). Only Todd Helton
of Colorado (.479), Gary Sheffield of Los Angeles (.441) and Barry
Bonds of San Francisco (.435) have higher on-base percentages among
National Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: C Mitch Meluskey leads NL rookies with 14 homers and is
tied for first with 58 RBI and admits he's thinking about the
National League Rookie of the Year award. ''It's important to me,''
he said. ''It would certainly be a feather in my cap. But mainly I
just want to help us win games.'' . ... RHP Tony McKnight, recalled
from Triple-A New Orleans Saturday, is to start Tuesday against the
Marlins. ... Moises Alou has accumulated enough plate appearances
to qualify for the top 10. Alou is hitting .367 (entering Monday's
game against Florida) and is second in the league in hitting to
Colorado's Todd Helton.
Cubs-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: 1B Mark Grace did not play because of a bruised left
knee. He left Sunday's game at San Francisco after fouling a pitch
off the knee. Playing in Grace's place, rookie Ross Gload hit his
first major league home run. ... 2B Eric Young stole his 45th base
of the season in the third. He has been successful on his last 19
attempts. ... OF Sammy Sosa did not hit a homer Monday, but he
prevented one. Sosa robbed Jeff Cirillo in the second, catching the
ball about a foot above the top of the right-field wall. ''It could
have been a pivotal play. But the next guy hits a home run,''
manager Don Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: C Brent Mayne, slowed by a sore left hip and a
strained left wrist, made his first appearance in six games as he
pinch hit and caught the ninth inning Monday. Manager Buddy Bell
hoped Mayne would return to the starting lineup Wednesday. ... Even
with an expanded roster, Bell said Colorado's younger players
probably wouldn't see much playing time in the final 25 games.
''September's a real tough time to evaluate. It's only a month. To
tell if a guy can play, you need more than a month.'' ... Colorado
has hit at least one home run in all 32 games against Chicago at
Coors Field.
Phillies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: OF Bobby Abreu is hitting .370 (20-for-54) in 14
games at the leadoff spot with a .493 on-base percentage. Though he
claims to dislike hitting at the top of the order, he's been
effective and has added to his power numbers as well. Abreu has hit
five homers and driven in nine runs since moving to the top of the
lineup on Aug. 20 at St. Louis. He has also walked 13 times. Former
leadoff hitter Doug Glanville walked a total of 24 times in 121
games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: 1B J.T. Snow, one hit shy of 1,000 for his
career, was not in the starting lineup for the.. OF Barry Bonds hit
his 40th home run of the season on Monday, the fourth time in his
career he has hit 40 or more, with a career high of 46 in 1993. ...
Bench players Russ Davis, Ramon Martinez and Calvin Murray combined
to score four runs and drive in three in the Giants' 5-2 win over
the Chicago Cubs on Sunday. ''When we get our chance, we know we
have to do something,'' said Martinez. ''It's important for us to
go out there ready to play.'' Davis said he's come to terms to
playing infrequently after spending several years as the starting
third baseman in Seattle. ''At first it was mentally draining, but
now I'm relaxed and have gotten comfortable with the role,'' Davis
said. ''I've always felt part of the team. The guys in this
clubhouse make it that way. It's a great group and they've helped
me through it.''
Brewers-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers bullpen continues its hot streak, not
having allowed an earned run in its last 21 innings spanning seven
games. LHP Ray King has not allowed a run in his last 13 relief
appearances. ... The Brewers' Nos. 3 and 4 hitters -- Geoff Jenkins
and Richie Sexson -- have been a hot combination since Sexson made
his Brewers' debut on July 30 after being acquired from Cleveland.
The pair have combined to hit .336 with 19 home runs and 51 RBI in
32 games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres have hit a long-ball slump, having failed
to homer in 11 of their last 17 games. ... After opening September
with three straight losses to Pittsburgh, the team with the worst
record in the majors, the Padres are trying to post a winning
September record for just the third time since 1990. ... Milwaukee
is one of only five times the Padres have a .500-or-better all-time
record against at 15-8. Anaheim, Florida, Seattle and Colorado are
the others. ... RHP Tom Davey and LHP Dave Maurer were recalled
from Triple-A Las Vegas.
Pirates-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates recalled LHP Brian O'Conner from
Triple-A Nashville. In five Nashville starts, he went 2-2 with a
6.84 ERA. ... The Pirates haven't won four straight games since
July 4-8. ... C Jason Kendall is one steal shy of becoming the
first catcher to swipe 20 bags in the same season three times.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: 1B Eric Karros needs one homer to tie C Roy
Campanella for third place on the career Dodger home run list.
Karros has 241. ... The Dodgers will play 16 of their final 25
games at home, and 22 of the 25 will be against NL West opponents.

</P>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Ralph Looney, a former editor at The
Albuquerque Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, died
Monday following a lengthy illness. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Looney, who was editor of The Tribune from 1973 to 1980, joined
The Tribune as a reporter in 1953. He left two years later for a

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bess Taffel, a screenwriter whose career
dried up after she was blacklisted for refusing to cooperate with
the House Un-American Activities Committee, died July 21 of a
stroke. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Taffel began writing for studios after working with a
progressive Hollywood theater company. Her screen credits included
''Badman's Territory,'' ''A Likely Story'' and ''Elopement.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Tender Comrades,'' a history of the blacklist period by
Patrick McGilligan and Paul Buhle, Taffel admitted she had joined
the Communist Party and said it was the ''most patriotic thing I'd
ever done in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After refusing to answer questions before the House committee in
1951, her began to decline.

<HEADLINE> Anhalt, Oscar-Winning Writer, Dies  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Writer Edward Anhalt, who won Academy Awards
for his work on the films ''Becket'' and ''Panic in the Streets,''
died of cancer Sunday, his family said. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Oscars for the 1964 and 1950 films, Anhalt
was nominated for the 1952 film ''The Sniper,'' which he co-wrote
with Edna Anhalt, the first of his five wives. She also
collaborated with him on ''Panic in the Streets'' in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Anhalt died at his Pacific Palisades home after fighting
multiple myeloma for four years, said his nephew, Jonathan Barry of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Anhalt was ''big-hearted'' and well-liked, but he always said he
did his best writing during times of emotional turmoil, Barry said.
Writing was his escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the actual craft of writing, he hated it,'' Barry
said. ''He just did not enjoy the process ... but he loved the
product, and he liked the money and he liked the notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his career producing television documentaries but
turned to film just as television was beginning to threaten the
studios' dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Among his credits are 1957's ''Pride and the Passion'' with Cary
Grant and Sophia Loren, the 1962 Elvis Presley film ''Girls, Girls,
Girls,'' 1968's ''The Boston Strangler'' with Henry Fonda, and
1981's ''Green Ice'' with Ryan O'Neal and Anne Archer.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the 1972 Robert Redford movie ''Jeremiah Johnson''
with ''Apocalypse Now'' co-writer John Milius.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- to late 1950s, Anhalt broke with the studios and
began writing independently, Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   He was critical of the ''blacklisting'' of that era, when many
in Hollywood had to work under assumed names or had their names
stripped from credits because of alleged communist leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said he once asked his uncle why he was never blacklisted.
Anhalt's response: ''Because I was just too good.''
</P>
<P>
   That he used writing as an escape was evident in the differences
between the themes he pursued and the type of person he was in
life, said his daughter, Julie Anhalt Rice of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeremiah Johnson'' examined man pitted against nature.
''Becket'' dealt with issues of spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the issues he explored were mostly about men and
men's relationship with others and with God, in reality he was very
earthy and all about good humor,'' Rice said. ''He lived for a
great martini.''
</P>
<P>
   Anhalt was born in 1914 in New York City and graduated from
Columbia University.

Montana Land Reopening After Rain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Millions of acres of forests and grasslands will reopen
to the public tomorrow because cool, rainy weather and increasing numbers of
firefighters have helped to lessen the danger posed by wildfires, state and
federal officials announced. The U.S. Forest Service said today it was lifting
closures on all national forest land in the central, northwest and southwest
areas of Montana -- those hit hardest by this summer's wildfires. ''This
decision effectively reopens 16 million acres of National Forest System lands in
Montana,'' said Dale Bosworth, regional forester at Missoula. Gov. Marc Racicot
made a similar announcement regarding 3.6 million acres of state land.

Report: Gulf Air Jet Didn't Slow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Investigators said Monday that the pilot of a Gulf
Air plane that crashed into the sea off Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard,
failed to slow down or gain altitude during his landing attempts despite being
alerted by his co-pilot and cockpit alarms that the plane was moving too fast
for its altitude. This indicated the crew was having trouble controlling the
plane and that it appeared to have accelerated rather than reduced speed after
the warnings, which could be attributed to the control systems, the crew's
abilities or both, according to Jim Burnett, a U.S. aviation expert not involved
in the probe.

Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Monday called upon Chileans to overcome ''our pains and

<HEADLINE> Report: Gulf Air Plane Didn't Slow  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The pilot of a Gulf Air plane that
crashed into the sea off Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard,
failed to slow down during his landing attempts or gain altitude
afterward, despite warnings from his co-pilot and cockpit alarms
that the plane was moving too fast, investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The actions described by investigators indicated the crew was
having trouble controlling the plane and that it appeared to have
accelerated rather than reduced speed after the warnings. Those
problems could be attributed to the control systems, the crew's
abilities or a combination of both, according to Jim Burnett, a
U.S. aviation expert not involved in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hilldrup, a U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
expert appointed by Bahrain as chief investigator into the Aug. 23
crash, told reporters Monday night that it was too early to say
whether pilot error caused the Airbus 320 to nosedive into shallow
Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
   Hilldrup, citing information from the flight data and cockpit
voice recorders that were analyzed by the NTSB in Washington, laid
out the final few minutes of Flight 072. He said Air Traffic
Control at the Bahrain International Airport told Capt. Ihsan
Shakeeb to ''climb 2,500 feet'' after the pilot called off his
initial landing approach and requested a go-around.
</P>
<P>
   After Shakeeb's second aborted attempt to land, Hilldrup said
''the first officer stated 'over speed limit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the flight data recorder indicated forward
movement of the captain's side stick, which put the aircraft into a
rapid descent, Hilldrup said. The plane's speed increased beyond
212 mph at 1,000 feet, setting off the continuous chiming of the
aircraft's Master Warning system.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a ground-proximity alarm went off that Hilldrup said gave
a warning -- ''whoop-whoop, pull up'' -- an indication the plane was
in acute danger. The pilot, he said, tried to increase altitude by
pulling back on his stick, but Hilldrup said the ''pull up''
warning lasted to the end of the recording.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's last recorded speed was about 322 mph, Hilldrup
said. Because of varying factors such as air conditions, and the
plane's weight and size, authorities would not say what a proper
landing approach speed would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire data is still viewed as preliminary,'' he said.
''It will take time to validate this data. ...We don't want to
prejudge things.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxes, Hilldrup said, also showed that Shakeeb was the pilot
flying the aircraft, that the autopilot was disconnected on final
approach and that the remainder of the flight was flown manually.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Hamer, Bahrain's Undersecretary for Civil Aviation
who serves as chairman of the investigating committee, said it was
premature to express opinions on this case. However, he said that
air traffic controllers had done their job and it is ''the pilot's
responsibility'' to safely land the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hilldrup nor al-Hamer would comment on the crew's last
words; a transcript of the voice cockpit recording was not released
and investigators said they were still working on precise timings
based on the information contained in the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole scenario indicates that the crew were having
difficulty controlling the airplane,'' Burnett, a former NTSB
chairman, said in a telephone interview from Little Rock, Ark.
''Whether that arises from control systems or the training of the
crew I don't know, but it could be a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward movement of the captain's side stick would point the
nose of the plane down, he said, a movement which tends to
increase, rather than decrease, the plane's speed.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site Monday, about 250 Bahraini Coast Guard divers
with nine boats continued their sweep for parts of the plane and
personal effects. ''We are still bringing considerable amount of
pieces of the plane,'' Bahrain's Civil Defense Chief Col. James
Windsor said.
</P>
<P>
   Divers brought in part of the plane's fuselage and one wheel of
the nose undercarriage. Some personal effects, including jewelry
and clothes of the victims, also were retrieved.

<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Deontey Kenner threw a 12-yard touchdown pass
to Jason Collins-Baker with 6:11 left as Cincinnati rallied to beat
Army 23-17 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner completed 18 of 29 passes for 239 yards for Cincinnati,
which overcame a 17-13 deficit in season opener to snap a six-game
losing streak in Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deontey played great as expected,'' Cincinnati coach Rick
Minter said. ''We must continue to use him to the best of his
ability for this team to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Army lost its first game under coach Todd Berry, the former
Illinois State coach who took over after Bob Sutton was fired
following a 3-8 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''For as many good players as Cincinnati has, I thought we
handled that pretty well,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you play on national TV, you have a chance to expose
your program to recruits. It was good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathon Ruffin added a 26-yard field goal with 31 seconds left
for Cincinnati. Ruffin also connected from 31 and 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Ray Jackson had a 37-yard touchdown run in the
third quarter, and finished with 108 yards on 26 carries. DeMarco
McCleskey added 90 yards on 19 carries, and Collins-Baker finished
with six receptions for 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Army's Alton McCallum scored on a 1-yard run in the third
quarter, and the Cadets' Chad Jenkins threw an 8-yard touchdown
pass to Michael Wallace early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was 14-of-29 for 123 yards with an interception. Wallace
ran for 56 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati gained 437 yards in total offense and held Army to
243 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stepped it up and got the job done,'' Kenner said of the
Bearcats' defense. ''This is a great win for us. Any win,
especially in the conference, is huge. But now that we got this one
off our back, we'll shift our focus to the next game, Syracuse.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Leave Volcanic Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Only officials and relief workers remained on a
volcanic island south of Tokyo on Monday after stragglers boarded a
boat to flee eruptions and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake Island's 400 remaining residents left by ferry in the
afternoon, bound for Tokyo shelters where hundreds of other
islanders have huddled in a three-day evacuation, local official
Yoshiko Numata said.
</P>
<P>
   The order to leave came after 2,686-foot Mount Oyama erupted
Wednesday for the eighth time since early July. Only police, fire
and municipal personnel remained on the island, about 120 miles
south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, nearly 600 people left Miyake by ferry.
More than 60 percent of the island's population of 3,855 had
already fled to the mainland before Friday's evacuation order.
</P>
<P>
   The eruptions have blanketed the island, part of the Izu chain,
with ash, prompting warnings that heavy rain could set off
mudslides. It has also been shaken by thousands of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The government set up shelters in Tokyo, which administers
Miyake, and dispatched ships to the island. Troops requested by
Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara have cleared ash from roads and
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said shifts in huge underground pools of magma are
responsible for the recent volcanic and seismic activity on Miyake.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a volcano on Japan's northern main island of
Hokkaido erupted for the first time in nearly two years, spewing
ash and white smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Komagatake, a 3,716-foot mountain, erupted late Monday
night, the Sapporo District Meteorological Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the eruption, a small amount of ash was observed on
the ground in a town located northwest of the mountain, the
observatory said. The mountain's last eruption, on Oct. 25, 1998,
was minor.

<HEADLINE> Khatami To Expatriates: Help Iran  </HEADLINE>
By KARINE G. BARZEGAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Monday urged hundreds of Iranian expatriates living in the United
States to embrace their native land and unite to forge a better
future for Iran.
</P>
<P>
   With signs of a thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations, Khatami stressed
the importance of dialogue and interaction among all Iranians, and
asked those inside and outside the country to use their energy to
help Iran develop economically.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts are beating for the love of one place, and this
place is Iran,'' Khatami said, as the audience that filled a U.N.
conference room applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The reformist president did not mention a bill submitted to the
Iranian parliament Sunday that would grant amnesty to Iranians who
fled the country because of anti-government activities or ties to
outlawed political parties. But his speech clearly signaled his
support for an open door for expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing concern about an Iranian brain drain, the president
said he hopes Iranians across the world will pool their knowledge
and scientific skills to create a new advanced civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we cannot go forward without good technology, science
and management,'' he said. ''The brilliant generation of Iranians
that lives inside and outside the country can help us, since they
happen to be our new investment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iranian-American response was largely positive,
many businessmen at the event said they needed to have the approval
of all powers -- including the country's hard-line supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- in order to start investing in economic
projects in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is in New York to attend the U.N. Millennium Summit of
more than 150 world leaders, making only his second visit to the
United Nations since his 1997 election. The gathering is being held
just before Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez hosts a summit of the
oil cartel in late September.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian president said he had no sympathy for demands that
oil prices should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khatami addressed Iranian-Americans at a similar U.N.
meeting in 1998, it was believed to be the first time that members
of the Jewish-Iranian community and other religious minorities --
such as Armenians and Zoroastrians -- were invited to listen to the
president in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, wearing the flowing black robe and turban of a senior
Shiite cleric, paid tribute to the role of religious minorities in
Iran's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I though his speech was wonderful since he stressed the fact
that we are all Iranians and all equal,'' said Banouh Mehr, a
Zoroastrian-Iranian in her mid-fifties.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mehr, many Iranian-Americans at the meeting viewed
Khatami's speech as an attempt to reassure religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he wanted to give the assurance that any matter
involving those communities will be conducted fairly,'' said Trita
Parsi, head of Iranians for International Cooperation, a grassroots
organization working to end U.S. sanctions and promote U.S.-Iranian
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about dialogue between the Iranian community and the
government: the dialogue among civilizations needs to start at
home,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Montana Land Reopening After Rain  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Nearly 20 million acres of forests and
grasslands in Montana will reopen to the public Tuesday because
cool, rainy weather and increasing numbers of firefighters have
helped to lessen the danger posed by wildfires, state and federal
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service said Monday it was lifting closures on
all national forest land in the central, northwest and southwest
areas of Montana -- those hit hardest by this summer's wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision effectively reopens 16 million acres of National
Forest System lands in Montana,'' said Dale Bosworth, regional
forester at Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot made a similar announcement regarding 3.6
million acres of state land, as well as an undetermined amount of
private land. Both bans are to be lifted at noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A major factor in making these decisions is the availability
of resources to effectively respond to any new fire starts,''
Racicot said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state's unseasonably hot, dry weather began changing
in recent days, officials in Montana had been flooded with requests
to reopen forests to hunting, fishing and other activities,
including logging. The National Weather Service said the cool, wet
weather was expected to continue most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   There were some exceptions to the reopenings, and fire-danger
restrictions such as limiting campfires and smoking to designated
areas and restrictions on off-road vehicles remained in force.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 81 large fires were still burning on 1.67 million
acres Monday in Arkansas, California, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 74,571 fires have burned nearly 6.6 million acres
across the nation, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --In Wyoming, Devils Tower National Monument reopened to
visitors. Hundreds of tourists had been evacuated or turned away
over the weekend because of a wildfire that had spread over 1,550
acres. Firefighters had the blaze nearly contained.
</P>
<P>
   --The Texas Forest Service issued a fire safety alert, warning
residents to take extra precautions during the drought as 19 large
fires burned over 20,000 acres. One fire northeast of Houston
forced the evacuation of 92 homes in Liberty County, while another
north of Dallas burned nine houses and three barns.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana's hard-hit Bitterroot Valley, residents turned the
Labor Day holiday into a Firefighters Appreciation Day.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Thank You'' was for ''the firefighters, emergency
personnel and uncounted volunteers who have helped us through this
crisis,'' said John Schneeberger, a businessman in Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Montana officials say more than 11,000 people have answered
their fire call, not counting volunteers. In addition to locals,
firefighters came from Canada, New Zealand and Australia, from 27
other states and numerous military units.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kurt Warner hit Ricky Proehl for a 6-yard score
with 38 seconds to go in the first half as the St. Louis Rams took
a 21-17 lead over the Denver Broncos on Monday night in a matchup
of the last three Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who beat the Tennessee Titans 23-16 in the Super Bowl
last January, drove 77 yards in nine plays to take the lead.
Warner, the NFL MVP who threw 41 touchdown passes last year in his
first season as starter, was 15-of-20 for 173 yards in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, which won the Super Bowl after the 1997 and '98 seasons
but faltered to a 6-10 record last year, had taken the lead on a
25-yard pass from Brian Griese to Rod Smith with 3:50 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   A 47-yard pass from Griese to Smith set up the Broncos' other
second-quarter score, a 32-yard field goal by Jason Elam that put
Denver ahead 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk scored his 50th career rushing touchdown on a
5-yard run to put the Rams ahead 14-10 with 8:53 to go in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos played the second quarter without Terrell Davis, who
twisted his left ankle. Davis, who missed the last 12 games with a
serious knee injury last year, had 34 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   Griese, who was 7-of-11 for 133 yards in the half, led the
Broncos to a touchdown on their first possession. He scored on an
8-yard bootleg with 10:05 to go as the Broncos drove 59 yards in
six plays.
</P>
<P>
   Davis carried the first three plays for a combined 17 yards, and
after two completions he was an effective decoy on Griese's scoring
run. Griese also hit Smith for 16 yards and Dwayne Carswell for 18
in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams blew their first scoring chance as Al Wilson
intercepted a ball that glanced off the hands of St. Louis tight
end Roland Williams at the 7 with 5:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' defense held after five plays, and Az-Zahir Hakim
returned Tom Rouen's punt 86 yards to tie the score with 2:05 left
in the first quarter. Hakim also returned a punt for a touchdown
last Oct. 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were making their first Monday night appearance since
Nov. 25, 1991, a 33-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. St. Louis
hadn't had a Monday night game since 1986.

Montana Land Reopening
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Nearly 20 million acres of forests and grasslands in
Montana will reopen to the public tomorrow because cool, rainy weather and
increasing numbers of firefighters have helped to lessen the danger posed by
wildfires, state and federal officials announced. The U.S. Forest Service said
today it was lifting closures on all national forest land in the central,
northwest and southwest areas of Montana -- those hit hardest by this summer's
wildfires. There were some exceptions to the reopenings, and fire-danger
restrictions such as limiting campfires and smoking to designated areas and
restrictions on off-road vehicles remained in force.

Report: Gulf Air Jet Didn't Slow Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The pilot of a Gulf Air plane that crashed into the
sea off Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard, failed to slow down during his
landing attempts or gain altitude afterward, despite warnings from his co-pilot
and cockpit alarms that the plane was moving too fast, investigators said
Monday. The actions described by investigators indicated the crew was having
trouble controlling the plane and that it appeared to have accelerated rather
than reduced speed after the warnings. Those problems could be attributed to the
control systems, the crew's abilities or a combination of both, according to Jim
Burnett, a U.S. aviation expert not involved in the probe.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- In his first statement since a court stripped him of
his immunity and paved the way for him to stand trial on human rights charges,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Monday called upon Chileans to overcome ''our pains and
divisions of the past.'' Pinochet's brief, conciliatory remarks were read by his
granddaughter, Maria Jose Martinez, at the main entrance to the former
dictator's heavily guarded suburban Santiago residence. The day marked the
so-called ''Day of National Unity,'' a day that replaced a holiday that had been

<HEADLINE> Japan Slams U.S. Over Whaling  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The highest-ranking Japanese member of the
International Whaling Commission declared Monday that slapping
sanctions on his country for its whale research program would only
backfire on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Masayuki Komatsu, the group's deputy commissioner, said many
American workers would suffer if the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tens of thousands of Americans engaged in importing and
marketing fishery products will lose jobs and income, which now
bring them more than $1.2 billion annually,'' he said at a
conference on Pacific fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Komatsu was responding to remarks by U.S. Commerce Secretary
Norman Mineta, who said he was considering asking President Clinton
to ban imports of Japanese fishery products to show opposition to
Japan's decision to add larger Bryde's and sperm whales to its
research program, which until now was confined to minke whales.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece published in The Honolulu Advertiser, Mineta
called Japan's claims that the whales must be killed to collect
research data ''preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that the expansion of the Japanese hunt to
larger whales is aimed at paving the way for an outright resumption
of commercial whaling,'' Mineta said.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling commission banned commercial whaling in the
mid-1980s, but allowed some whales to be killed for research
purposes. The commission requires that all parts of whales taken
for research be used, and parts wind up being sold commercially in
fish markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs to conduct research on whales to study pollution
levels and the depletion of fish stocks, Komatsu said. By opening
the stomachs of whales, scientists can track how much fish the
whales are eating.
</P>
<P>
   Whale blubber also is a great receptacle for dioxin, PCBs and
other toxic chemicals, Komatsu said, adding that it can help
determine the best way to combat pollution. He also claimed that
many scientists say there is no other way to conduct the research
without killing whales.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials boycotted a U.N. environmental conference that
began last week in Japan to protest Japan's decision to begin
hunting Bryde's and sperm whales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Japan hunted 100 minke whales in the North Pacific, and
440 minke whales in Antarctic waters. This year, Japan is adding 50
Bryde's whales and 10 sperm whales to its North Pacific totals.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Opening his fall campaign with a
weeklong tour, George W. Bush taunted rival Al Gore on Monday for
rejecting his offer of three presidential debates. ''All of a
sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything,'' Bush
told a Labor Day rally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, coming off a 27-hour campaign sprint through several
states, tried to keep the focus on his pitch to working families
that he would be the better steward of the economy and work harder
for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot at stake, our economy in particular,'' Gore
said in Pittsburgh. ''Working people have done better and there are
more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan, Gore told supporters
at the Louisville Motor Speedway in Kentucky, ''I'd veto that in a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, and his running
mate Joseph Lieberman appealed to working class voters with a
six-state Labor Day weekend tour. The two campaigned together in
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida, then Gore hit the trail on his
own in Kentucky while Lieberman made solo stops in Ohio and
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and running mate Dick Cheney together opened a campaign
push through six Midwest battlegrounds: Illinois and Michigan on
Monday with Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio to follow
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate kept up the pressure on
Gore to agree to Bush's proposed debate schedule as the Gore
campaign held open the possibility for negotiations over the three
prime-time matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just yesterday, we had an interesting example of Washington
doublespeak,'' Bush told a rally in this heavily Republican Chicago
suburb before he and Cheney walked in a parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent said he would debate me any place, anytime,
anywhere,'' Bush continued. ''I said fine, why don't we just show
up ... and discuss our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the debates Bush accepted would be 60-minute appearances,
one Sept. 12 on a special prime-time edition of NBC's ''Meet the
Press'' and Oct. 3 from Los Angeles on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign wants three 90-minute debates as recommended
by a bipartisan commission, saying those will reach the widest
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush must agree to the commission debates before any
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become a tradition to get all the networks together and
give all of the American people the right to see three 90-minute,
prime-time debates,'' the vice president said on NBC's ''Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman told reporters, ''I think Governor Bush is making an
end run around the rules of the debate commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has accepted the invitation from the Commission on
Presidential Debates to negotiate further this week over a debate
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the commission's offer to
negotiate further would not change Bush's intention to accept only
one of its venues -- an Oct. 17 debate at Washington University in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader marked Labor Day at
a downtown Detroit rally of several hundred volunteers. He said if
elected he would seek a repeal of the 53-year-old Taft-Hartley Act
and other laws that he said ''tilt toward employers'' and inhibit
the ''fair opportunity for workers to organize without
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trail, a Gore-Lieberman 27-hour campaign sprint took the
candidates to greet laborers in Philadelphia; Flint, Mich., and
Tampa, Fla. Gore then marched in a Pittsburgh parade and rallied at
the speedway in Louisville, Ky. Lieberman sandwiched a Toledo
(Ohio) Mud Hens baseball game between visits to union members in
Detroit and Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned an economic speech Wednesday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney endured a light rain on their parade in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of a better place to start the fall campaign,''
Bush told a crowd of hundreds at a pre-parade rally. ''We're in for
a tough battle. This is going to be a close race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In 64 days, we're going to end the Clinton-Gore era,'' Cheney
said to loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney walked about a mile and a half in the parade,
with Bush moving from side to side, pumping hands with those lining
the route. Cheney shook far fewer hands than Bush and mostly walked
down the middle of the street as Bush darted about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crowd was overwhelmingly supportive, some
protesters waved signs ridiculing the GOP ticket. ''I'm voting for
Bush because not enough of my tax dollars support corporate
welfare,'' said one sign. Another said: ''Vote Bush because gay
people have too many rights.''
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, Bush attended Michigan's annual peach festival
in Romeo, Mich. The town is in a county known for its high
proportion of voters who swing back and forth between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney rode a Chicago elevated train to a Polish food fair,
where he danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen and served up
hot cabbage rolls with tomato sauce from behind a steam table.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told the crowd that one of his proudest moments was
meeting Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, saying he ''lit a spark in
Poland that lit a prairie fire of freedom.'' He ended his remarks
with a hearty ''Sto Lat!'' -- a Polish congratulatory expression
that means ''May you live 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were reuniting Tuesday in Allentown, Pa., to announce
their plan to provide seniors with a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Record-Setting Texas Heat Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Record-setting heat continued to bake the region
Monday as northern Texas entered its 66th day without rain.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas hit 111 degrees -- an all-time high for the day and the
highest temperature ever recorded in the city in September, the
National Weather Service said. The previous record was 108, set in
1980; the highest ever was 113, set in June the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures have been 100 degrees or higher on 42 days so far
this year, well above last year where there were 33 days in the
triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve deaths in the city this summer have been blamed on the
heat, including 66-year-old woman was found dead Saturday in a home
where the air conditioner had been turned off.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston area, the medical examiner's office has confirmed
28 heat-related deaths this year. Temperatures in Houston hit 108
degrees on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing drought also has increased the threat of
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Forest Service issued a fire safety alert Monday in
the wake of a 4,000-acre fire that had forced the evacuation of 92
homes in Liberty County, northeast of Houston. The blaze started
Saturday as two smaller fires, then merged into one. Another fire,
north of Dallas, had burned nine houses and three barns.
</P>
<P>
   While forecasters aren't promising widespread rain any time
soon, some relief is in sight and isolated showers are possible in
some parts of northern Texas this week.
</P>
<P>
   A high-pressure system moving south from Canada was expected to
bring east to southeasterly winds to Texas starting Tuesday
afternoon
</P>
<P>
   ''Temperatures will be in the upper 90s to low 100s for a few
days, said Lonnie King, a meteorologist for the National Weather
Service in Fort Worth. ''That's still going to be 10 degrees above
normal but not near the record levels we are seeing today.''

<HEADLINE> Former Soviet leader says post-Cold War thinking is inadequate  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said
Monday that a ''lack of new thinking and political leadership'' was
costing the world community a chance to improve itself in the
aftermath of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   He said globalization - the extending of economic and cultural
opportunities to all people - ''could have many negative
consequences'' if allowed to take place in a spontaneous,
uncontrolled manner. ''It should be governed and guided,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev addressed a dinner audience of several hundred at the
opening of the State of the World Forum 2000, a non-profit
organization whose fifth annual meeting in New York coincides with
the United Nations Millennium Summit, expected to draw leaders from
150 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates said the trend toward globalization already affects
most of Earth's 6 billion people and is accelerating, but in widely
differing and unequal ways that deprive developing nations of the
benefits enjoyed by wealthier nations.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, Gorbachev proposed creation of a permanent
''people's assembly'' to focus attention on the issue full time
rather than piecemeal, suggesting it be called the World Citizens
Network for Security and Development.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor of Jordan also spoke at the dinner, which opened a
week-long meeting of the World Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who was president of the Soviet Union from 1985 until
it collapsed in 1991 and now runs the Gorbachev Foundation, a
Paris-based think tank on international affairs, said the post-Cold
War era is filled with questions about the course of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where are we succeeding and where are we failing? Everyone is
asking, 'what is happening to all of us?''' he said. ''We do not
fully understand what is emerging. We are living in a new, global
world in which the paradigm of our world is changing ... we are
lacking the political leadership that we need to meet these
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ''intellectual diversity ... and open-minded debate''
are necessary, because ''statesmen alone cannot solve the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who spoke Russian with simultaneous interpretation
into English, said the end of the Cold War presented a ''great
opportunity'' that has been wasted by new kinds of international
strife and hard-line policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mildest I can say is that we have not used well these
opportunities, we have frittered them away,'' he said. ''We have
new conflicts on top of the old conflicts, and we still see
attempts to solve problems by domination and dicta.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Kosovo as one example.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process of disarmament has slowed down, and there is a
danger of a new arms race,'' he said. ''The G-7 countries and the
transnationals continue to act in the old ways, without realizing
the changes and impulses coming from the world for a civil
society.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said there were some positive signs, mentioning the
European summit and President Clinton's recent decision to defer
any further work on a ballistic missile defense system, adding that
''at the U.N., they recognize that this is a problem that affects
all nations.''
