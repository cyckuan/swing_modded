ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today expressed his hope that the forthcoming foreign
secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India would be
"meaningful."
</P>
<P>
India should adopt an attitude which would help the forthcoming
foreign secretary-level dialogue move toward "the meaningful
talks," Leghari told reporters here today at a news conference
held at the Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
There are many outstanding issues between the two sides but
Kashmir remains the core issue, he said.

He said that Pakistan was never reluctant to have talks with
India provided these were "meaningful."

<P>
It had been Pakistan's persistent policy to have talks with
India to seek a peaceful settlement of the issues, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a national consensus on this policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP to Propose Holding National Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today said that his Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) would officially propose holding national elections in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the party would make the proposal to the FUNCINPEC
Party, the CPP's partner in the coalition government, at a
coordination committee meeting later today, Hun Sen said at a
school inauguration ceremony in the Svay Rieng province.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the CPP leader suggested three dates for the
upcoming elections and asked the country's political parties
to agree on one of them.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that to conform to the constitution, the national
election could be held in May 1998, the fifth anniversary of the
UN-brokered elections here, or in June or September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Hun Sen threatened to cancel local and
general elections scheduled in 1997 and 1998 if King Norodom
Sihanouk decided to abdicate.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's CPP shares power with the FUNCINPEC Party led by
Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in the coalition
government formed after the 1993 elections which ended decades of
war and civil strife.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe Hun Sen and the CPP fear the king might
step down to re-enter the world of politics.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old king hinted last month he was thinking of
abdicating but said he would never stand in the 1998 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also said today that the CPP wanted to sort out the
controversy with the FUNCINPEC over the issue of the nationality
of candidates running in the elections.
</P>
<P>
At its January congress, the CPP declared its support for
the principle that members of parliament and government must
hold only one nationality, the Khmer nationality.
</P>
<P>
But the FUNCINPEC argued that all Cambodian citizens, including
those who hold two or more passports, should have the right to
vote and to be elected.
</P>
<P>
Many of FUNCINPEC's leading members picked up new passports
after fleeing overseas, mainly to Australia, France and the U.S.,
to escape the civil war in 1970s and 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Germany Deports 41 Bosnian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany today deported 41 Bosnian
refugees to their home country from the southern city of Munich in
a move signalling the start of a much larger repatriation.
</P>
<P>
A chartered plane flew 41 Bosnian refugees living in Bavaria
and Berlin to Sarajevo this morning. Twelve had criminal records.
</P>
<P>
The move represents the first relatively large-scale repatriation
of Bosnian refugees from Germany this year, following the symbolic
deportation of two refugees from Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Germany's first-ever repatriation of Bosnian refugees occurred
last December when 22 people were deported from Munich.
</P>
<P>
Uneasy with the heavy financial burden of hosting refugees,
estimated at three billion U.S. dollars a year, German local
authorities have mounted increasing pressure on some of the
320,000 predominantly Muslim Bosnian war refugees to return home
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have cut some social security payments and
insisted that the overall Bosnian refugee population in Germany
be reduced by some 80,000 before summer.
</P>
<P>
But the repatriation plans have met with strong protests from
refugees, especially Bosnian Muslims whose homes lie in what are
now areas controlled by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Against such protests, German officials argue that with the
Bosnian peace agreement more than one year old, refugees should
return home to participate in the rebuilding of their country,
just as Germans did after World War II.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the Bosnian authorities last year,
Germany envisaged a staged repatriation. Single people, childless
couples and Bosnians with a criminal record in Germany are
supposed to go home in the first wave.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Environment, Development Forum Held in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and US
Vice-President Al Gore presided over a Sino-US Forum on
Environment and Development at the Great Hall of the People here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The forum was aimed at exchanging views on the environment and
development between the two countries, and exploring ways of
cooperation in science and technology, environment, energy, and
business.
</P>
<P>
Since early this century, tremendous changes have occurred on
the earth, which sustains human existence. What is noteworthy is
how science and technology have developed by leaps and bounds, and
productive forces have been greatly raised, Li Peng said at the
forum.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, soaring population has posed a series of
challenges to economic and social development. Natural resources
are excessively exploited, and large amounts of pollutants are
discharged, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"At this historical moment at the turn of the century, what
kind of earth will be left to our coming generations is a major
topic of common concern to the people in all countries around the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the Chinese government has been paying great
attention to environmental and development matters. Based on its
own conditions, China has chosen a road of revitalizing the nation
with science and education and sustainable development, a road
which correctly deals with the relations between economic growth
and environment, population, and resources.
</P>
<P>
China has scored remarkable progress in achieving sustained and
rapid economic expansion, basically curbing the deterioration of
environmental quality with environmental protection as the basic
national policy, preliminarily putting fast growing population
under control, saving existing resources while exploring new
resources, and actively promoting international cooperation in
environmental protection, Li said.
</P>
<P>
However, China still faces arduous work and severe challenges
in the fields of environment and development, Li noted.

<P>
Being a developing nation with a vast population, China has
many difficulties with its economic development, ecological
protection, and the use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"But we have both confidence and methods to solve these
problems," he said, explaining that China has found a road for
development which is suitable for China's concrete conditions,
worked out effective policies and methods, and accumulated a lot
of valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
"The sustainable development of humanity requires concerted
efforts by the countries all over the world," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The vast number of developing countries care about the world's
peace and stability and oppose bloodshed and conflicts; they
care about fast economic growth and want to shake off poverty and
backwardness as soon as possible; they care about equal trade;
they care about financial and technological support which enables
them to fight against bad environment; and they care about
obtaining assistance in terms of education, training and
management to raise the quality of their peoples, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"They have exerted arduous efforts in achieving these goals.
But it is a pity that their justifiable requirements have not won
due attention and active response from the international
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Li noted, this year marks the 25th anniversary of
the publication of the Sino-US Shanghai Communique, and leaders of
the two countries ended a long-term confrontation and isolation 25
years ago. Since that time, he added, bilateral relations have, on
the whole, made relatively great progress despite twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as the two countries strictly observe
the various principles set by the three Sino-US communiques, a
fairly good Sino-US relations can be brought into the 21st
century," Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Two County Officials Punished for Selling Official Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two county-level Communist Party
officials have been given harsh penalties for selling official
posts and titles, according to a circular released jointly by the
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and the Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on all Communist Party organizations and
officials at all levels to draw lessons from the two cases of
corruption, tighten organizational and personnel discipline, and
stop the evil trend of selling official posts and titles.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, Zheng Yuansheng, former secretary of
the Guangfeng County Party Committee in east China's Jiangxi
Province, had accepted bribes worth more than 130,000 yuan (15,600
US dollars) since 1992 to promote lower-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yuansheng was sentenced 13 years in prison, and was
expelled from the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Shanxi Province, Zheng Zesheng, former
secretary of the Fenxi Country Party Committee, had accepted many
bribes from Meng Yongming, an ex-convict and former director of
the county's Township Enterprises Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1995, Zheng Zesheng decided to make Meng Yongming
deputy procurator-general of the county's procuratorate and
director of the county's Anti-corruption Bureau in accordance with
the latter's desire. But the decisions sparked bitter accusations
from the local people.
</P>
<P>
Because of the case and other misconduct, Zheng Zesheng was
expelled from the Communist Party and arrested. And five other
corrupt county-level officials were given severe punishments.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that the scandals of officials like Zheng
Yuansheng and Zheng Zesheng seriously damaged the image of the
Party and government, and the penalties indicated the Party's
staunch determination in purifying itself.
</P>
<P>
In another move to do a better supervision, Zhang Siqing,
procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said
today that contingents of honest, just, and well-trained personnel
in charge or supervision are needed to push forward discipline
inspection.

<P>
The United States and China began their cooperation in
environment and development long ago, and certain achievements
have been made, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In order to beef up future cooperation in these fields, Li set
forth the principles of mutual respect and seeking common ground
while reserving differences; equality and mutual benefit with each
others' advantages; drawing on experience and expanding
cooperation; and envisioning the future on the current basis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the forum would increase mutual
understanding and cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
US Vice-President Al Gore said at the forum that both China and
the United States are great nations. The United States had scored
fast development in a relatively short period of time with its
abundant natural resources, while China was one major birthplace
of human civilization and had made incomparable achievements in
its long history.
</P>
<P>
After giving an account of the environment problem in the
United States and control measures, Gore said China had in recent
years done a great deal of work in protecting the environment and
promoting development. For the interests of the coming
generations, it is necessary for the two countries to join hands
in environment and development.
</P>
<P>
There are huge potentials for the two countries to increase
their cooperation in science, technology and energy, Gore said.
Business circles from both sides also should help solve prime
problems concerning environment and development by means of
investment, trade, technological transfer, and inventions.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, participants at the forum were divided into
four panels for in-depth discussions concerning the science for
sustainable development, environment policy, energy policy and
business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Participants from both countries said that the forum had
achieved anticipated goals and scored positive outcome.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Holds Talks With Russian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that Sino-Russian relations
are a positive factor in safeguarding world peace and promoting
world development.
</P>
<P>
The development of Sino-Russian relations has produced a
wide-ranging and active impact on the world, Qian said during
talks with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the relations, based on mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, conform with the trends and needs of the world
situation and international relations in the post-Cold War era, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, during his visit to Russia next
month, will sign with Russian President Boris Yeltsin an important
joint communique, said Qian, who arrived here Monday on a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang and Yeltsin will also sign an agreement on the
reduction of armed forces in the border areas with leaders of
Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
All these are of far-reaching significance, and will contribute
significantly to further developing good-neighborly, friendly
relations between the five countries, to world multi-polarization,
and to the establishment of a peaceful, stable, just and rational
international order, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Primakov agreed that the establishment of the
21st century-oriented strategic partnership between China and
Russia last April, and the formal start of regular meetings
between the premiers of the two countries at the end of last year
have pushed forward bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Primakov said that the world is developing toward
multi-polarization, in which both China and Russia play important
roles.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "actively developing 21st century-oriented
strategic partnership between Russia and China should not be seen
as a temporary measure, and we should steadily develop
Russian-Chinese relations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's state visit to Russia next month will be the fourth
Russian-Chinese summit, and Russia is actively making preparations
for it, said Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the mechanism for regular meetings between
Russian and Chinese premiers is an important channel in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides can, through this channel, explore
new ways of cooperation, solve problems arising in bilateral
cooperation, and enhance substantial cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia attaches importance to the agreement on reducing armed
forces in the border areas, which has been initialled by deputy
foreign ministers of the five countries, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides a new model for enhancing trust and
maintaining security in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also briefed Qian on the Russian-U.S. summit held last
week in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that dialog, cooperation and deepening trust are the
proper ways to safeguard world peace and promote common
development.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on armed forces in border areas to be signed by
China, Russia and three Central Asian nations is of far-reaching
significance for regional and world peace and stability, Qian
added.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM Says Ties With Malaysia Should Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said that relations between Malaysia and Singapore
should move on now that the Malaysian cabinet has accepted Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew's apology, Singapore television reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at the end of his visit to Laos, Goh told
reporters that even though Singapore would take steps to restore
ties, the pace would largely be determined by Malaysia, because
Malaysia had indicated that it would take some time for ties to be
restored to the old level.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly said that differences between the two countries
were mainly due to inaccurate newspaper reports. And that these
inaccuracies, said the Prime Minister, will be resolved in due
course.
</P>
<P>
On the differences highlighted by the Malaysian newspapers on
the Malaysian Railway land in Singapore, Goh said that the reports
contained inaccuracies. These inaccuracies, he said, suggested
that Singapore had not been very helpful in resolving problems
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that it is important to put right the inaccuracies,
Goh said that the process would take some time, and over time such
perceptions would be eliminated and that he would leave it to the
ministries to explain the inaccuracies in a friendly and neutral
manner.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Malay saying, the Prime Minister said water could not
be separated, even by a knife. That, he stressed, was the nature
of Singapore's relationship with Malaysia and the interests of the
two countries which are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two countries share some common future, Goh
said if one country was badly hit, the other country would also be
affected.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Rejects Hashimoto's Request Over U.S. Base Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The governor of Japan's southwestern
prefecture of Okinawa, Masahide Ota, today rebuffed a request by
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for support over the issue of
leases on land for U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Ota, Hashimoto tried to persuade the
governor to go along with Tokyo's plans to revise a 1952 law so as
to legalize the continued use of private land leased by
U.S. military bases on the island prefecture. The leases are due
to expire on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Hashimoto's talks with visiting U.S. Vice
President Al Gore on Monday, during which the prime minister said
he would push the revision of the law through parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ota repeated his opposition to the revision, saying, "We can
hardly accept this proposal because the sentiment in Okinawa is
too strong against the U.S. bases."
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 landowners who hold forced leases of property
inside the 12 U.S. bases in Okinawa have refused to extend the
leases after they expire.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has the highest concentration of U.S. military bases
and troops in Japan. Anger against the forces boiled over after a
12-year-old girl was raped by three U.S. servicemen in September
1995.
</P>
<P>
Agreement has been reached to move some U.S. facilities
out of Okinawa, but the island will continue to house more than
half of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan,
even though it makes up only one percent of Japan's land mass.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said the central government understood the
prefecture's stance, but could not allow land to be occupied
illegally.
</P>
<P>
If the leases expired on the May 14 deadline, the
U.S. military's continued use of the land would be illegal. To
continue the forced land leases legally, the government must
revise the law, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
On February 21, the prefectural land expropriation committee
started public hearings on a forced-lease renewal process, but
it is unlikely to complete necessary procedures by the May 14
deadline. A third hearing is scheduled for Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Develop Nuclear Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has sufficient human
resources to develop nuclear technology for peace and welfare
purposes, an official of the National Atomic Energy Board (BATAN)
said today.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 nuclear scientists in Indonesia, a BATAN
official said. The scientists, most of whom graduated from foreign
universities, have lengthy experience in various nuclear centers
in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The time is ripe to introduce nuclear technology in Indonesia
although funds are still very limited, the official said.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, Indonesia's House of Representatives approved
a bill on nuclear power, but the government pledged not to build
a nuclear power plant in the near future.
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years the government has been conducting
preliminary studies on the development of nuclear energy near the
dormant volcano Muria in Epara in central Java. The study has
already cost 22 billion rupiah (9.5 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Rejects Press Suggestions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has rejected press suggestions that his government has
made a U-turn on its position on common ground between the
positions of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in the
ongoing proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press when asked to comment on press
reports in this regard after watching today's parade in Nicosia to
mark the Greek Independence Day, President Clerides said "there has
been no change on the definition of what consists common
ground at January's meeting in Athens, between the Cyprus and
the Greek governments."
</P>
<P>
However, the President did not elabrate what consists of common
ground on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the National Council, the top
advisory body to the President on handling the Cyprus question,
will decide whether sufficient common ground has been found to
allow for direct negotiations to begin, after the conclusion of
the current U.N.-led proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief's Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel has begun indirect talks from March 10, through
bi-weekly separate meetings with President Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to break current deadlock and pave
the way for face-to-face talks. However, nothing has been
revealed since the talks began.
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment on reports that the Turkish side has not
given any signs of shifting its position during the
U.N.-sponsored talks, Clerides replied: "It would be odd to
expect that either side would shift its positions during the
two meetings we have had so far on the substance of the
Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
The President said he believes the current talks could last
six to seven weeks, and noted that discussions have not touched
upon substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
"One has to be patient and wait and see whether we reach
common ground," President Clerides explained.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that confidence building measures, proposed

renewal and repairs of various kinds of elevators and escalators,
has set up 160 subsidiary organizations in 41 countries and
regions. The company chalked up 2.12 billion U.S. dollars in
sales last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to resume talks to resolve
their dispute over Nagorny Karabach, a region densely-populated by
Christian Armenians in Azerbaijan, where the main population are
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Military conflicts began in 1988 between the two countries over
Karabach. A cease-fire came in 1994 after Armenia seized the
region and about 20 percent of Azerbaijan which it still controls.
The two sides held direct talks in 1995 with Bonn's mediation, but
the contacts broke off in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
"These contacts should be immediately resumed," Kinkel said. "A
resolution is long overdue."
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the appeal in a statement expressing Bonn's welcome
to the planned resumption of efforts by the Minsk group of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Minsk group, to which Germany belongs, is going to restart
its mediation bid in Moscow on April 1.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Chief Warns of Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Chief of Staff
Amonon Lipkin Shahak today warned that there would be "a war"
between the Palestinians and the Israelis if the situation goes
out of control.
</P>
<P>
Shahak made the warning after he toured the West Bank city of
Hebron, where Palestinian protesters have battled Israeli
soldiers with stones and petrol bombs for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
Commenting to reporters on the possibility of renewing the
Intifada or Palestinian uprising, Shahak sternly warned that
there would be no more Intifada but a war.
</P>
<P>
Shahak said that he had ordered the troops to put an end to
the Palestinian rioting and restore order.
</P>
<P>
Later Shahak briefed the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee on the current situation. He said that
there was still bilateral security cooperation despite that
Palestinian security head in Gaza Strip Mohammed Dahlan
threatened Monday to halt such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meir Dagan, head of the Coordinating Committee for
Countering Terrorism, told a news conference that many terrorist
attacks had been thwarted thanks to the cooperations among
several security agencies including the police, the General
Security Service and the secret intelligence service Mossad. He
declined to disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
Warning that terrorists were still trying to launching more
attacks, Dagan called on the public to be on high alert against
possible new attacks like last Friday's suicide bombing in
central Tel Aviv, which killed 4 people and injured dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to take
 tougher actions to crack down on the terror organizations such
as Hamas, which claimed responsibility for the Tel Aviv
bombing. He said that, if the PNA rejected the charge that it
had given green-light to terrorist attacks, it should have
proven it by making more efforts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Dagan denied Israel was relying on the PNA in combating
terrorism, saying Israel relied mainly on its own
capabilities. He stressed that the security agencies could
provide necessary security to Israeli public.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Probe Into IRA Prisoners' Escape Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government ordered an
official inquiry today into the attempted Irish Republican Army
(IRA) prisoners' escape from Northern Ireland's high-security Maze
Prison.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said that the
province's director of policing and security, John Steele, would
supervise the probe.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew said that the inquiry would look into the planning of
the escape bid and ways of improving security.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Plainly there are lessons to be learned."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that inmates dug a 40-foot (13 meter) long,
seven-foot deep tunnel from the H7 block, which housed 95 of the
prison's 297 IRA men, to just beyond an inner fence at the prison.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which measured 2.5 sq ft and was fitted with
electric lights, was discovered by a prison officer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prison holds about 500 IRA and pro-British Loyalist
guerrillas in separate blocks.
</P>
<P>
This was the most audacious attempt by the IRA in more than a
decade to escape from the top-security prison although the
Northern Ireland Office said that no prisoners had escaped from
the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urged to Suspend Tariff Discount on Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine sugar industry leaders
today appealed to President Fidel Ramos for the suspension of the
35 percent tariff discount on refined sugar imports from the other
members of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Ramos, they expressed disappointment to
the Tariff and Related Matters Committee at foregoing the earlier
proposed suspension of the 35 percent tariff discount.
</P>
<P>
The committee said Monday it would ask Ramos to include sugar
in the coverage of the ASEAN common effective preferential tariff
(CEPT) instead of working for a suspension of the tariff discount.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusion of sugar in the ASEAN's CEPT, tariffs on
sugar imports from the ASEAN countries will be maintained at 65
percent from 1997 to 1999 after which it will be reduced to 50
percent until the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar planters and millers have asked the
government to remove the tariff discount and delay the inclusion
of sugar in the CEPT to save the country's ailing sugar industry.
The country's sugar prices have slumped since late last year,
causing great losses to the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
The sugar planters and millers also sought a 200-day moratorium
on sugar imports and the issuance of an executive order retaining
the present 100 percent tariff rate for the next four years.

That is the only effective method to keep long-term stability

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
sending Congress an anti-fraud bill that would close loopholes and
broaden punishment for people who pilfer from Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which Clinton was unveiling at the White House
Tuesday, includes new provisions to crack down on fraud and abuse
in the government health care programs, said an administration
official.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of
the provisions would allow the secretary of Health and Human
Services to forbid a convicted felon from participating in
Medicare or Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
Medicaid is the state-administered program for the poor.
Medicare is federally run and caters to senior and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Another provision would require health care providers to
register their social security numbers, making it easier for HHS
and state Medicaid regulators to track offenders, prevent them
from moving from state to state and continue to commit fraud.
</P>
<P>
The bill also would give the Department of Health and Human
Services broader sanction authority.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Opposes Merging WEU with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen has warned that proposals to merge the Western
European Union (WEU) defense union with the European Union (EU)
could cause difficulties for the expansion of the EU, the press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Russia, which has protested loudly
against expanding NATO membership to include former Warsaw Pact
states, would have the same objections to the EU's expansion if
the EU made moves towards becoming a military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to merge the WEU and the EU was initiated by
France and is supported by a number of EU members. Holland, which
currently holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, has included
part of the French proposal in its draft for a new EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
Lena Hjelm-Wallen refused to say whether Sweden would use its
veto on the matter at the Intergovernmental Conference which is
debating changes to the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 and has observer
status in the WEU, promised during its EU membership negotiations
that it would not block plans by other member countries wanting to
form a defense alliance.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, which groups 10 of the 15 EU states, aims to build
a security and defense structure in Europe.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 German Steel Workers Protests Against Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 German steel workers
demonstrated today in Frankfurt in protest against the role played
by big German banks in devising a hostile takeover plan by the
steel concern Krupp-Hoesch against its rival Thyssen.
</P>
<P>
Braving the spring chill, protesting steel workers from Thyssen
factories across Germany as well as their colleagues from other
steel companies waved banners, whistled and blew horns outside the
headquarters of the Deutsche Bank, which, along with another big
German commercial bank -- the Dresdner Bank -- pieced together a
15 billion mark (about 13 billion U.S. dollar) financial package
for the takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the demonstrators, Klaus Zwickel, leader of the
steel workers' trade union IG Metall, called for bank control of
the industry to be brought under tighter legal restraints at the
German and European level.
</P>
<P>
"This casino capitalism has become a danger to the general
public.... We're fed up with being ruled by these anonymous
financial powers," Zwickel said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 6,000 Krupp-Hoesch workers went on strike in
their factory in Dortmund, saying they would keep the mill idle
until they received a written guarantee that their jobs would be
protected.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting public pressure, Krupp-Hoesch Monday formally
abandoned its takeover bid for Thyssen which is feared to lead to
about 10,000 job losses. Instead, the two biggest German steel
concerns are negotiating a friendly merger of their steel
operations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new development, steel workers remain unsatisfied
because even a merger would not avoid mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
They are particularly angry at what they see as a betrayal of
the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank which sit on Thyssen's
supervisory board but at the same time advised a competitor on an
unsolicited takeover.
</P>
<P>
The banks, however, argued that rationalization is necessary
for German steel makers to survive tough international
competition. "Only through a speedy new order in the German steel
industry will jobs be secured for the long term," the Deutsche
Bank said.

CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Egyptian company for trade
and marketing will be established when Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal al Ganzouri visits Beijing in April, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The creation of this company comes as part of Egypt's drive to
bolster its exports to the Chinese market that represents a
growing economic power, the agency said, citing an economic
official here.
</P>
<P>
The company will allow for marketing the Egyptian products
in China and southeast Asia.

The company will enjoy the same tax and financial benefits
provided to the companies in China when they import foreign
products from Hong Kong, Macao or from the free zones inside
China, he added.
</P>
<P>
The source expressed the confidence that Egypt will gain a lot
from China's know-how that had helped it tap various markets
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Besides China, Ganzouri will also visit Singapore and Malaysia
on a three-nation Asian tour scheduled for the second half of
April. It comes as continued efforts to develop bilateral
relations since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit here last

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) - Russian Foreign Affairs Minister
Yevgeny Primakov today expressed concerns over Israel's
construction of new settlement in East Jerusalem and the
consequential violence in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
The construction and the violence has made the middle east
peace process more complicated, said Primakov while holding a
meeting here with Tunisian Secretary of State in Charge of Foreign
Affairs Said Ben Mustapha.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that the Jerusalem dispute ought to be solved
in the "final status" negotiation between Israel and
Palestinians. He urged Israel to give up unilateral action so as
not to influence the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Primakov called on curbing the violence and terrorism in the
middle east in a bid to heighten all sides' confidence of solving
the thorny regional problem.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russian foreign ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreyev
said that Russia was disappointed at Israel's construction of new
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Between Palestinians, Israelis Continue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- For the 6th straight day,
Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers today in the
West Bank, though the scale of the confrontations was smaller
than that of the recent days.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that some 200 Palestinian youths threw
stones at Israeli soldiers stationed at Rachel's Tomb, at the
entrance of Bethlehem, which is under the control of the
Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers reportedly used tear gas and rubber bullets
to disperse the protesters, wounding several Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that more than a dozen Palestinians,
including one Palestinian policeman, were taken to hospital for
treatment of tear gas inhalations and rubber bullet injuries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinian youths threw stones at
Israeli soldiers in Hebron, before Palestinian police, who
arrived at the scene soon after the riots erupted, formed a
human chain and pushed back the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials claimed that the Fatah Movement, a main
supporter of PA President Yasser Arafat's peace policy in the PLO,
organized the recent violent demonstrations in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamel Yechli, a local Fatah leader in Bethlehem,
said today that he expected violence to escalate unless the
Israelis stop the construction of a Jewish settlement at Har
Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation would get out of control
within a week or two if action is not taken soon, adding
then Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, will turn out to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting here, following Friday's suicide
bombing attack in Tel Aviv and continuous confrontations between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moussa Ranimat, 28, of the Village of Tsurif
near Hebron, detonated a three-kilogram TNT bomb packed with
nails and pieces of metal in a coffee shop in the center
of Tel Aviv, killing three women and wounding 48 others.
</P>
<P>
A total closure was imposed on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip by the Israeli army immediately following the attack,
barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest came after Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa in East Jerusalem, despite strong condemnations from
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, the construction on Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on
the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem, which started last
Tuesday, continued today as bulldozers and steam shovels set
off for further ground work.

products during the second Egyptian Products Fair, due to be held

Only recently, cooperation between Egypt and China has started

and small industries, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese delegations visited Egypt recently and agreed on
launching three factories for plastics, lamps and toys, he said.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two major political
parties today reached compromise over the issue of nationality of
candidates in the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has agreed to delete from
the draft commune electoral law the clause that prohibits dual
citizenship people from campaigning, said Sar Kheng, a CPP deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, co-chairman of the coordinating committee of the CPP
and the FUNCINPEC party, made the remarks at a briefing after a
meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC's Ing Kiet, deputy prime minister, welcomed the move
of the CPP. The CPP had insisted that members of the Cambodian
parliament and government must hold only one nationality, the
Khmer nationality.
</P>
<P>
Many of FUNCINPEC's leading members picked up new passports
after fleeing oversea, mainly to Australia, France and the U.S.,
to escape the civil war in 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng said both sides agreed at the meeting that the
national elections will be held in November or early December next
year and the exact date will be announced later.
</P>
<P>
No final solution has been found yet for the formation of a
commission to supervise the elections, said Sar Kheng.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal to ban the royal family members from
politics was not touched at the meeting.

LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind today accused Britain's European Union (EU) partners of
planning a "lurch" towards federalism, according to a BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who is in Rome to celebrate the 40th anniversary of
the Treaty of Rome, told reporters today that new EU proposals on
defense, immigration and foreign policy were "totally
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, put forward by the Dutch EU presidency,
the EU Commission would be granted more powers in the three fields
mentioned above and the Western European Union would be fully
incorporated in stages into the EU.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary stressed that the new proposals
effectively swept away the balance struck at Maastricht. "Foreign
policy is always the prerogative of the (EU) member states," he
added.
</P>
<P>
If some EU countries were planning "a lurch in a federalist
direction," they should acknowledge that openly, he said.

effective partner in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The call came from K. Y. Amoako, United Nations Under-Secreatry

Ministers of Finance is taking place against a backdrop of
significant developments both in Africa and outside the region.

''On the international scene, globalization and liberalization of
the world economy continue to gather momentum. Barriers to trade and

context of the Uruguay round agreements,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Africa, he said, ''the majority of our
countries in Africa have embarked on comprehensive reforms of
their economic and financial structures''.

<P>
ECA ''has indeed been encouraged by the progress and
resilience of African countries in the implementation of such
reforms'', he stressed.

He said this meeting of experts from ministries of finance and
central banks is intended to offer an opportunity to analyze
these issues, share experiences, and provide guidline to the
ministers on best policy practices
</P>
<P>
He concluded that ''Africa has potential to overcome its economic
and social problems and become an effective global development
partner. If all of us contribute to this cherished goal, we will
witness the changes and experience the positive results of these
actions, together.''

HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stock market, one of
the largest in Africa, is poised for further growth of over 20
percent this year provided there are no major economic or
political shocks, a leading analyst said here today.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jason Moore said the stock market was benefiting from
a combination of good company results, an above average
agricultural season and renewed investor interest.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the stock market was judged by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) as one of the best emerging markets,
and was ranked sixth in the IFC's global index of 22 stocks.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting about 20 percent growth in the market from
now towards the end of the year barring any negative factors,"
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the performance of the stock market in 1996 and
1997 was probably the best ever since Zimbabwe started
implementing market reforms more than six years ago.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan President Calls for Diversified Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President Ketumile
Masire has called on entrepreneurs to diversify national economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Botswana Exporters Association's first annual
conference at the weekend, Masire said the only way to achieve
objective of diversifying national economy away from diamonds was to
develop non-traditional export trade.
</P>
<P>
"Botswana is committted to an export orientated industrialization
program. This is the essential base for economic diversification and
job creation," South African Press Assoiciation quoted Masire as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
Masire pointed out that Botswana must protect its industries when
competition in world markets was intensifying.
</P>
<P>
Batswana used to be one of the poorest countries in the world.
Thanks to the great efforts by the governments of Botswana since its
independence in 1965, economy in the land-locked country has been
developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Batswana has been well-known for exporting diamond, copper, nickle
and beef. In recent years, the Masire government has been advocating
to develop agriculture in a bid to be self-sufficient in grain.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- For the seventh straight day,
clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers today
continued in the West Bank, though the confrontations were
smaller in scale than in the previous days.
</P>
<P>
At the Jewish settlement of Tequa near Bethlehem, several
dozens of Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli soldiers, who
later dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that three of the protesters and
one Palestinian policeman, who was at the scene to help calm
the situation, were lightly injured and evacuated to nearby
hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, Palestinian demonstrators burned Israeli and the
United States flags; in Hebron, there were also several
stone-throwing incidents, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an effort to resolve the current crisis
between Israel and the Palestinians, U.S. special Middle East
Coordinator Dennis Ross is expected to arrive here Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Ross would have a stop-over at Morocco
to meet Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat before
flying on to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Ross is scheduled to fly back to Washington to
report to President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on his trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Albright Tuesday reportedly phoned Arafat, who is currently
visiting southeast Asia, to inform him of the forthcoming visit
to Israel by Ross.
</P>
<P>
Arafat promised Albright he would cut short his visit and
return to the region soon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been increasing following Friday's suicide
bombing attack in Tel Aviv, and continuous confrontations
between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moussa Ranimat, 28, of the Village of Tsurif
near Hebron, detonated a three-kilogram TNT bomb packed with
nails and pieces of metal in a coffee shop in the center
of Tel Aviv, killing three women and wounding 48 others.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli army threw a total closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after the attack occurred,
barring Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest came after Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa in East Jerusalem, despite strong condemnations from
the Palestinians and sharp criticism from the Arab and Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
However, the construction on Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on
the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem, which started last
Tuesday, continued today as bulldozers and steam shovels are
engaged in further ground work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- German prosecutors announced on
Wednesday that they had dropped a probe into possible tax evasion
by Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the southern city of Mannheim said in a
statement that they dropped the probe against Steffi Graf on
suspicion of tax evasion with the agreement of the accused and the
Mannheim court.
</P>
<P>
Graf was ordered to pay a sum of money to charity -- a
procedure often used by German prosecutors with the agreement of
the accused to end a case.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutors did not specify the sum of the payment.
</P>
<P>
Graf's father Peter Graf was sentenced last year to over six
years in jail for evading millions of marks (dollars) on his
daughter's income.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Faces Challenge of Maintaining Growth: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh today admitted that Thailand is facing the challenge
of sustaining growth.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit made the remarks when he addressed a
gathering of participants of the 1997 Fortune Global Forum at the
government house.
</P>
<P>
"Our growth over the past decade has been nothing short of
miraculous, exceeding even our expectations. And we are now faced
with the challenge of maintaining growth, at more reasonable
levels I must admit, into the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to make unwavering efforts to get the economy and the
country back on track, Chavalit reiterated the key elements of his
government's policies to maintain growth -- to revive the economy,
institute political reform, overhaul the administrative system,
promote human resource development, and prepare Thailand for the
integration into the regional and world economy in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
To revive the economy, the Thai government have moved
decisively to restore confidence in the Thai economy and put in
place needed reforms, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Indicating the country was unprepared for the slowdown in
export growth facing the country last year, he admitted that the
Thai economy is encountering problems, such as the high current
account deficits, instability in financial markets, and liquidity
shortages in the property sector.
</P>
<P>
On political reform, Chavalit said that a constitutional
drafting assembly has been formed and it is moving in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
On the administrative reform, he vowed again to overcome the
government bureaucracy and delegate power to government agencies.
</P>
<P>
On human resource development, Chavalit said that his
government is committed to increasing the competitiveness of all
Thai citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The key to competitiveness in the global economy is our human
resource base," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen this, we are improving the educational
opportunities for students in every corner of the kingdom and
ensuring adequate supplies of skilled manpower," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit also indicated that Thailand has long been a supporter
of regional economic cooperation and taken a leading role in
forming and supporting regional agreements.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would try to do something to contribute to the global
economic integration, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Fortune Global Forum was closing in Bangkok today.
Participants to the three-day event included former Israeli prime
minister Shimon Peres, chairman of Time Inc. Reginald Brack, and
deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization Chulsu
Kim.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Hails U.S.-Russia Helsinki Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria today welcomed the outcome
of last week's U.S.-Russia summit in Helsinki and the agreement
defining ties between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov said, "The meeting in
Helsinki between (U.S. President) Bill Clinton and (Russian
President) Boris Yeltsin marks an important stage in developing
NATO-Russian relations."
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria welcomes the agreement in principle to define ties
between NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and Russia, he
said, referring to a charter Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to sign to
build a new relationship between Moscow and the western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government indicated it wanted to join NATO on
February 17 and its wish has immediate significance given the
current challenges to stability in the Balkans, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Bulgaria has maintained good relations
with its neighboring countries, and its role in regional stability
has been generally acknowledged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vlaikov hinted that these factors would help the country to win
NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders will meet in Madrid in July to decide which
countries will be allowed to join the western military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are widely expected to
be the first to win NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Land Fund Tops 7.1 Billion Patacas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The land fund of the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) grew to 7.1 billion patacas
(about 898 million US dollars) by the end of 1996, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Runzhen, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Land Group, told reporters today after a meeting
among members of the Consultative Committee of the Macao SAR Land
Fund that the Investment Committee of the fund made a total of 740
million patacas (about 93.67 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Founded on November 15, 1994, the two committees were designed
to improve management of the special fund for the future SAR
government. They are mostly composed of local people from such
fields as industry and commerce, finance, culture, education,
labor, religion and government.
</P>
<P>
Of the profits gained last year, 430 million patacas (about
54.4 million US dollars) came from investment projects, while the
remaining came from sales of land.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao signed in 1987, from the day the joint
declaration went into effect until December 20, 1999 when China
resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao, all income
from land sales should be divided equally between the Macao
government and the future SAR government, after the land
development cost was deducted.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Land Group has sold a total of 188 hectares
of land since its founding in 1988.

HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The stock of inward direct
investments in the non-manufacturing sectors of Hong Kong totaled
487.3 billion HK dollars (62.47 billion US dollars) by the end of
1995, up six percent from that at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Results of a recent survey released today showed that Britain
was the largest investor country, accounting for 29 percent of the
total at the end of 1995, while China and Japan ranked the second
and third, accounting for 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The stock of inward direct investments is a measure of the
cumulative amount of funds provided by external direct investors.
</P>
<P>
In terms of business sectors, banks and deposit-taking
companies attracted the largest share - 40 percent - of the total
value of the stock of inward direct investments in the
non-manufacturing sectors at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Inward direct investments through holding companies accounted
for 22 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
A similar survey in respect of the manufacturing sector is also
underway. Based on the findings of the two surveys, the overall
total of the stock of inward direct investments in the
manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors amounted to 532.6
billion HK dollars (68.28 billion US dollars) at the end of 1995,
which is seven percent higher than the amount at the end of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Armenia to Free Azerbaijani Prisoners Ahead of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Armenian foreign ministry
announced today that Armenia would free all Azerbaijani prisoners
taken during the war between the two countries over the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax news agency report quoted an Armenian foreign
ministry statement as saying, "by this move, Armenia confirms its
devotion to agreements to free prisoners of war without
preconditions on the principle of 'all for all'."
</P>
<P>
It added that the Armenian Ministry of National Security and
Interior was already in touch with Red Cross representatives to
arrange for the handing over of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Armenia called on the rulers of Azerbaijan and of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region, an Armenian-populated enclave within
neighboring Azerbaijan, to follow its example so as to create
favorable conditions for talks between the two sides in Moscow
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been engaged in a bitter conflict
over the mountainous territory of Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988,
although rivalry between the two South Caucusus republics over the
territory stretches back decades.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Nagorno-Karabakh declared itself an independent
republic, a move regarded by Azerbaijan as illegal.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the two former
Soviet republics, was agreed in 1994, ending a six-year
inter-ethnic fighting which left an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
people dead.
</P>
<P>
But peace talks stalled, with both parties refusing to
compromise. Armenia has said its action to free the prisoners of
war was a gesture of goodwill ahead of the talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, last Friday, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan
appointed Robert Kocharyan, leader of Nagorno-Karabakh, as
Armenia's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan condemned the move and many analysts interpreted the
appointment as a hardening of Armenia's stance on negotiations
with Azerbaijan.

</P>
<P>
Grand ceremonies were held today to mark the completion of the
Stonecutters Island Naval Base and the Gun Hill Military Hospital,
 both of which have been built by the China State Construction
Engineering Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the military facilities was nailed down in an
agreement signed by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in June
1994. The British side agreed to rebuild for the PLA troops some
buildings and fixed facilities gratis, including a military
hospital and a naval base.
</P>
<P>
The naval base is set on a reclaimed plot along the south shore
 of the Stonecutters Island, which is now actually linked to the
west part of the Kowloon Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 16 hectares, the base has 33 buildings with
 a total construction area of 35,000 sq.m., including an office
block, quarters, an assembly hall, a quay club, a vessel repair
workshop, a fuel storage building, a signal tower, a heli-pad and
quay storage houses.
</P>
<P>
Building of the 17,000 sq.m. Gun Hill Military Hospital started
 in May 1995. The main hospital building includes a low block and
an 11-storey high block. Other auxiliary facilities include a
seven-storey composite block, a storage block, a canteen and two
staff quarters.
</P>
<P>
The hospital will provide medical services for the PLA
servicemen based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ceremonies were also held today to mark the
completion of Shek Kong Barracks Military Supplies Depository,
which started construction in October 1995, and Chek Lap Kok
Airport Military Transport Center, which started construction in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
All military facilities will be officially handed over to the
PLA garrison troops on July 1.

<P>
BEIRUT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A moderate earthquake struck
Lebanon at 3:21 p.m. (13:21 GMT) Wednesday afternoon, the second

state-run Radio Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The NGOC put the magnitude of the first earthquake, which took
place at 6:26 a.m. (0425 GMT) today, at five on the Richter scale
in its first statement, but adjusted the figure to 5.5 a couple of
hours later.
</P>
<P>
It reported that several deserted buildings in the capital of
Beirut, which were badly damaged during Israeli air raids on the
city in 1982, collapsed in the morning shock, crushing about a
dozen of cars parking beside them, but no word on casualties was
available.
</P>
<P>
A NGOC official said that the epicenter of the earthquake was
some 110 kilometers northwest of Beirut.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's soccer coach Artur
Jorge was attacked and knocked to the ground on Wednesday by
Sporting Lisbon striker Ricardo Sa Pinto.
</P>
<P>
The attack was apparently because the player was angry at being
dropped from the national squad.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Sa Pinto turned up at the Lisbon training
ground, where the national team was preparing for Saturday's World
Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The disappointing player, who has played 21 times for Portugal,
talked to the trainer before he struck him and knocked him down.
</P>
<P>
Jorge, who appeared unhurt in the attack, said later that the
incident would have no effect on the preparation of the team which
leaves for Belfast later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of Sa Pinto was one of the surprises in the
20-man squad named by Jorge for the World Cup game. No reason was
given for the drop.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Pledges Support for CIS Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev has pledged resolute support for the integration of the
CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) members and denied
allegations that he wanted to replace integration with regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly "New Generation" paper ahead
of his departure this Friday for a CIS summit in Moscow, the
president denied he planned to lead the country out of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He said integration is the only option for Kazakhstan and one
of the fundamental conditions for coexistence in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Nazarbayev blamed Russia for the slow
progress of the CIS integration process. He accused Russia of
abandoning the strategic and political interests of the CIS for its
own immediate economic interests.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with New Generation, the president explained
that he had criticized Russia because Russia didn't pay enough
attention to CIS integration and that he himself sincerely hoped
the integration process would be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The faster integration process between Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan
and Uzbekistan in Central Asia was not directed against other
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The world has developed toward multi-polarization, and each
country hopes to first forge ties with its closest neighbors,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, regional integration is a good supplement to
globalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Kazakh-Russian relations, Nazarbayev said the two neighbors
should become intimate, trusting partners, and should adhere to a
policy of friendship, as they share thousands of kilometers of
border.

<HEADLINE> China Visit a Positive Step in Developing Relations: Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- US Vice-President Al Gore said
here today that his visit to China is a positive step in the
development of US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with the press after his meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin this afternoon, Gore said his meetings with
Jiang, Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders have "provided an
opportunity to develop the broad strategic dialogue" between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions are productive, friendly, searching, and above
all, wide-ranging, so too were my meetings with Premier Li Peng as
well as a number of other members of the Chinese government," said
Gore.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the purpose of his visit is to
"demonstrate the commitment of the US and the Clinton
Administration to our relationship with China and our
determination to strengthen and broaden that relationship."
</P>
<P>
Given the enormous importance that we attached to the US-China
relationship, there was naturally a very long list of issues of
significance to the two nations and the two sides should try to
narrow the differences when they existed and to find new ways to
deepen their co-operation in those areas in which they agree, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who is here to make preparations for the exchange of
visits on the highest level between the two countries this year
and next, said the two sides have reaffirmed that Chinese
President Jiang Zemin will visit Washington this autumn while
President Clinton will pay a return visit to China next year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries are working earnestly for this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the contracts and agreements Boeing and General
Motors have signed with China are "important" for American
business and jobs and an indication of Chinese market's wider
opening to the US business.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president reiterated US support of China's membership
in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He added that the US and China will seek ways to communicate in
a more effective and constructive way to solve the existing
differences in such issues as trade and human rights.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Gore delivered a speech at Qinghua University,
one of China's top institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
"At the dawn of a new era in world history, as we look toward
the horizon of a new millennium," Gore said, the United States and
China, "as friends and partners, are destined to work together in
leading the way to a peaceful, prosperous future."
</P>
<P>
The sustained and dramatic economic growth in Asia, and
especially here in China, is having a profound impact on prospects
for the future here and potentially in the entire world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the nations of East and West must find not
only a new way of regarding one another, but basic new ways of
working with each other at every level," Gore noted.
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Gore, his wife and entourage toured the Great
Wall to the north of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here Monday evening on an official visit, is
scheduled to leave here to proceed to Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, early Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests To Provide Safe Beef Labelling In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- DNA tests are to be used to
reassure British consumers that they are buying "safe" beef,
newspaper reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists who produced Dolly, the cloned sheep, are working
with cattle breeders to enable consumers to tell which breed of
cattle their meat comes from if there is any dispute about
quality, according to The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The scientists at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh said on
Tuesday that they were only about three months away from
perfecting a DNA profiling system to replace blood tests used to
establish the parentage of cattle.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to provide genetic "fingerprints" that will allow
meat to be tracked accurately from farm to supermarket shelf even
if official animal tagging systems break down.
</P>
<P>
Sales of beef in Britain plummeted in March last year after the
government admitted the possibility that a fatal cattle disease
known as "mad cow" disease could be transferred to humans. Beef
consumption has yet to recover to levels seen before the health
scare broke out.

<HEADLINE> Postcard to Feature Endangered Birds Launched in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will launch a set of
philatelic collection featuring migratory birds, which make yearly
stops at the Mai Po Marshes -- a wetland abundant with habitats
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Mai Po, located in the northwest of the "New Territory", is a
vital ground for hundreds and thousands of migrant birds moving
from places as far away as north Siberia and South Australia to
rest and feed before continuing their long-distance journey.
</P>
<P>
Four birds that frequent Mai Po, the great knot, falcated teal,
yellow-breast bunting and black-faced spoonbill, are chosen for
the design of the collection, which will be jointly issued by the
Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) and the World Wide Fund
for Nature Hong Kong (WWF HK).
</P>
<P>
Black-faced spoonbill, with only 450 individuals now left in
the world, is critically endangered; fortunately, a quarter of the
 existing population is found at Mai Po in winter, according to
David Melville, WWF HK's executive director.
</P>
<P>
The philatelic set, including a normal cover, a set of
postcards and a souvenir pack, will be produced to echo the new
special stamps of migratory birds to be issued by the Post Office
in April.

today as the historic moment of Hong Kong's return to her
motherland is only 97 days away.
</P>
<P>
On display were well-chosen 380 photos, featuring four topics
-- the origin of the Hong Kong question, changes in Hong Kong
society, close links between Hong Kong and Interior areas, and
the settling of the Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by the Chinese Ministry of Culture, the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the

</P>
<P>
Co-organizers in Hong Kong were Wen Wei Po and the Chinese

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Zhang
Yunfeng, chairman of Wen Wei Po, claimed, it is the first time

The exhibition had been successfully held in many interior
cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Changchun
and Guangzhou, since July 1996, attracting a total of 500,000
visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang hoped that the exhibition would help Hong Kong people get

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal Reserve, to no one's surprise, voted to raise
interest rates for the first time in more than two years, but by
one of the smallest steps possible. Several major banks
immediately raised their prime rates. The stock market rose, then
fell.
</P>
<P>
-- The Government warned Texas officials that the state could
lose Federal higher education money unless it maintains
affirmative-action programs in its university system. The Texas
Attorney General says such programs are illegal under a Federal
court ruling. The contradiction will likely end up in court.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Senator Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,
standing next to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in
another meeting of their mutual admiration society, signaled Today
(Tuesday) that he will allow an international treaty banning
chemical weapons to come to ratification vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
-- The trial of Timothy James McVeigh, accused in the Oklahoma
City bombing, is to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton proposed cracking down on dishonest health-care
providers as part of an initiative to reduce fraud and abuse in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The legislative proposals
would, among other things, bar health-care providers convicted of
a felony from participating in Medicare, and attempt to close
bankruptcy loopholes.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly two percent of more than 34,000 active blood donors
who responded to an anonymous survey acknowledged they had failed
to report "deferrable risks" for HIV or other diseases when they
last gave blood.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese ship carrying 13,000
tonnes of rice arrived at Um AL Qasr port south of Iraq this
morning, the first arrival of foodstuff under the food-for-oil
deal between U.N. and Iraq via sea.

<HEADLINE> Macao, Guangdong Reach Consensus on Cross-Border Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We discussed this year's work in a pragmatic and serious way,"
said Chao, who is also director of the Foreign Affairs Office of
the Guangdong Provincial Government. "And we have reached
consensus on all issues, and it will be a great encouragement to
this year's work on both sides."
</P>
<P>
Guangdong and Macao set up the Guangdong-Macao Border Affairs
Coordination Group a decade ago. The joint group meets annually to
review the work of the past year and study ways for increased
cooperation in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Chao said the friendly cooperation between the two sides has
been fruitful over the past decade. The Ya Chong River, which
separates Macao and Guangdong, for instance, used to be a garbage
dumping area in the 1980s. It has become a park on the Macao side
and will be a tree-covered area on the Guangdong side.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the director said that cooperation has facilitated
the work on the Gongbei Border Cross, which last year saw 26.28
million people passing through, up 25 percent from 1995, and the
crossing of 1.10 million motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Fezas Vital, head of the Macao delegation and a
foreign affairs advisor for the Macao governor, said that the two
sides have discussed ways for further cooperation in the crackdown
on drug smuggling and the step-up of border control.
</P>
<P>
Experts group of the two sides will hold regular meetings on
those issues, said Vital.
</P>
<P>
The 11th meeting of the group will be started in Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province, next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world rally champion
Tommi Makinen of Finland was closer to this year's title chase as
he scored victory in the Rally of Portugal on Wednesday in
Figueira Da Foz, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi driver increased his lead to three minutes and
31 seconds over Belgiuan Freddy Loix in a Toyota in the first four
stages of the final day.
</P>
<P>
Makinen's only real rival Swede Kenneth Eriksson, in a Subaru,
retire in Tuesday evening, extending more winning chance for the
Finn.
</P>
<P>
With only five stages left until the finish at Figueira da Foz
on Wednesday night, only a mechanical problem would realistically
cost Makinen a debut victory in the Portuguese event.
</P>
<P>
German Armin Schwarz, in a Ford, was poised to move into joint
third place in the standings with team-mate Carlos Sainz.

<HEADLINE> Lung Transplantee Doing Well Two Years Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- After 25 months since his lung
transplant, the survival of a Chinese patient, doctors say, mark a
breakthrough in China's organ transplant field.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the surgery and a two-year survival of the
patient proved that we have achieved a good beginning for future
development in this field," Prof. Chen Yuping at Thoracic Surgical
Dept. of the Anzhen Hospital, Beijing, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"Results from data retrieval showed that the patient's survival
period is the longest in Asia," said Prof. Chen, who led a medical
team to perform the operation on February 23, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old patient, Ji Shuchun, has been able to take care
of his own daily life and to do light physical work since late
1995.
</P>
<P>
"And I feel much better now than last year. In a few days I'll
go back home to have a reunion with my family," Ji, who is staying
at the hospital for a post-operative check, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ji, from Anyang city of central China's Henan Province, was
diagnosed with severe pulmonary fibrosis three years before the
operation. The disease causes serious dysfunction of pulmonary
ventilation, which results in difficulty in breathing.
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, the doctors conducted the single-left-lung
transplantation for the patient. In the past two year, they have
helped the patient pull through many near-fatal post-operative
complications, such as acute rejection, tuberculosis of the chest
wall, and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Six months after the surgery, the transplanted lung worked
with normal function," Chen said. "And tests showed pulmonary
ventilation and blood infusion of the lung appeared normal."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pulmonary fibrosis in Ji's right lung did not get
worse, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese surgeons have successfully carried out kidney, liver
and heart transplant operations. "However, lung transplant is
still considered backward in China compared with advanced levels
overseas," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 lung transplant operations have been carried
out worldwide since the first such case was reported successful in
Toronto, Canada, in 1983. Patients lives have been extended
another seven to eight years.
</P>
<P>
But Asia is still regarded "rather backward" in this field
since only about 20 lung transplant operations have been done in
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Chen
noted.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Builds Tower to Mark Tropic of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A tower to mark the Tropic of
Cancer, located at 23.26 degrees north latitude -- the borderline
of the tropic and temperate zones -- has been built in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Located in Shizui Township some five km from the scenic city of
Guiping, the tower was built in the shape of an arced pillar
piercing a ball.
</P>
<P>
The pillar, with a span of 26 m, symbolizes the magnetic line
of force, while the ball with a diameter of six m represents the
earth.
</P>
<P>
A map of Guangxi is painted on the ground below the ball.
</P>
<P>
The tower will be open to visitors at sunset on June 21, the
Summer Solstice -- the day marking the 10th of the 24 solar
term. It is the longest day of this year.
</P>
<P>
Local scientists say that Guangxi, as well as Yunnan, Guangdong
and Taiwan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and the eastern part of India,
are the only areas along the Tropic of Cancer that have pleasant
weather and abundant forests.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen countries and regions can be found along the Tropic of
Cancer, 12 of them in desert or grasslands.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Telecommunication Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation between Beijing
and Hong Kong in the telecommunication sector has been enhanced
significantly during the past years.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jidong, deputy director of telecommunication
business in Beijing, said at a seminar today that since 1990 the
volume of phone-calls between Hong Kong and Beijing, has been
growing at an average yearly rate of 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In 1991, the number of phone-calls between these two places
totaled 12.7 million, while in 1996 the figure reached 33.49
million," he said.
</P>
<P>
During recent years other telecommunication services, such as
digital networks and mobile phones, have also been conducted
jointly by Beijing and Hong Kong, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Alex Wong, sales manager of the Hong Kong Telecom, told Xinhua
that as the return of Hong Kong comes nearer, further increase in
the volume of the telecommunications between the two places will
be expected.
</P>
<P>
More than sixty big telecommunication client firms, such as
Microsoft and Nokia, attended today's seminar which was jointly
sponsored by the Beijing Telecom and Hong Kong Telecom.

<HEADLINE> WHO Proposes Regular Testing for Cervical Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Women should have regular smear
tests for cervical cancer because the disease is curable if caught
in its initial stages, the World Health Organization recommends
in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500,000 women develop cervical cancer every year and
more than half of them die. But based on results from British
Columbia, Canada, and Finland, organized mass screening can
reduce mortality and morbidity rates by up to 70 percent, the
report, written with the European Organization on Genital
Infection and Neoplasia, says.
</P>
<P>
The authors urge women to have cervical smear tests at least
once every three to five years. The test, known as a Pap smear
test after its inventor, is a "simple and inexpensive" technique
"without complications", the WHO says.
</P>
<P>
However, three quarters of women who develop cervical cancer
are in the developing world, where mass screening programs are
still "wishful thinking" because of financial constraints, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
And even in many developed countries, the disease's decline has
been insignificant, partly due to large intervals between testing
and the high percentage, between 10 and 30, of false negative
results.
</P>
<P>
The report urges improvements in personnel training and the
introduction of machines in detection to reduce the number of
false negative results.
</P>
<P>
Cervical cancer is a global public health problem known to be
strongly linked with an early involvement of sexual activity and
multiple sexual partners. More than 90 percent of new cases are
as a result of sexually transmitted infection of the cervix.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Tsing Ma Bridge Off to Historic Running Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A marathon race slated for May
4 this year will mark the historic completion of the construction
of the world's longest dual-purpose suspension bridge in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Swire Group Tsing Ma Bridge Marathon and 10km Race '97 will
celebrate the completion of Hong Kong's most spectacular new
landmark Tsing Ma Bridge and the completion of the link to Hong
Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The momentous event is expected to attract a record-breaking
field of more than 7,000 competitors, including runners from
Britain, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, New Zealand, Hong Kong and
other parts of Asia/Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The field will make the race the biggest Hong Kong has ever
staged.
</P>
<P>
The marathon race will start at 7:30 AM at the eastern
entrance of the Tsing Ma Bridge, traverse the entire
3.5-kilometer Lantau Link (which includes Ma Wan Viaduct and Kap
Shui Mun Bridge) to the Lantau Island Toll Plaza, and covers
most part of the North Lantau Expressway to the turning point at
Tai Ho.
</P>
<P>
Runners will then return along the same route back to the
starting point at the Eastern end of the Tsing Ma Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The 10km race will begin at 8:15AM, also from the eastern
entrance of the Tsing Ma Bridge, travel west to the Lantau Toll
Plaza, then turn around and come back across the Lantau Link.
</P>
<P>
There are men's and women's Open and Senior categories in both
Marathon and 10km race. Junior runners aged 16-19 could
register in the 10km race. "It is only fitting to inaugurate a
record-breaking structure with an event of unprecedented
popularity," said William Ko, Chairman of the Hong Kong Amateur
Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
"Also, because the Tsing Ma Bridge will not allow pedestrian
traffic when it is officially open to vehicles, there will
probably never be another chance for people to compete in such a
unique environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
An essential part of the transport network to the new airport
at Chek Lap Kok, the Tsing Ma Bridge cost 7.1 billion HK dollars
(0.91 billion U.S. dollars) to build and is the world's longest
suspension bridge supporting both roads and a railway.
</P>
<P>
Stretching 2.2 kilometers from end to end, the main span of
the Bridge is 1,377 meters from tower to tower, and the vertical
clearance is 62 meters above high water. Under construction
since 1992, the Tsing Ma Bridge forms the largest part of the
Lantau Link, which connects the islands of Tsing Yi, Ma Wan and
Lantau in the 156.4 billion HK dollars (20.05 billion
U.S. dollars) Airport Core Program.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Freezes New Bilateral Dealings with Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today decided to
freeze fresh bilateral dealings with Singapore in the wake of
recent developments following Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew's remarks over Johor.
</P>
<P>
This was decided at the weekly cabinet meeting chaired by
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim today, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
One minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was quoted
as saying the cabinet decided to cool off ties for a while in
terms of bilateral talks "or anything to do with Singapore".
</P>
<P>
Any existing bilateral talks will also be postponed for now,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted another minister as saying that
government-to-government contacts, meetings between ruling
political parties and awarding of contracts to Singapore companies
would also be affected.
</P>
<P>
Today's Cabinet decision was prompted by the subsequent remarks
or reaction from across the Causeway linking Johor and Singapore,
in particular by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar, after the Malaysian government announced that it
accepted Lee's unreserved apology for describing Johor as
"notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings," the same
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is accompanying
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on a visit to Japan now, announced
after last Wednesday's cabinet meeting that although the
government accepted Lee's apology, it would take time to restore
the relationship to the old level.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the same day Jayakumar expressed surprise
at the Malaysian government's statement because Lee's remarks on
Johor was made by Lee personally in his action against Singapore
opposition figure Tang Liang Hong.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said Lee was suing Tang in his private capacity to
defend his personal reputation and to enforce his personal rights.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks on Johor were contained in an affidavit in his
defamation suit filed against Tang by him and his son, Lee Hsien
Loong, who is also Singapore Deputy Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
After making known his apology through his press secretary, Lee
later issued a personal statement in which he repeated his
unreserved apology and said he had instructed his lawyer to delete
the offending statements from the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Goh was reported by Radio Corporation of Singapore
as saying relations between Malaysia and Singapore should move on
following the Malaysian cabinet's acceptance of Lee's apology.
</P>
<P>
Goh blamed differences between the two countries on inaccurate
newspaper reports and said the inaccuracies would be resolved in
due course.
</P>
<P>
He also said that even though Singapore would take steps to
restore ties, the pace would largely be determined by Malaysia.

with international norms, added Li.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's rapid economic development and effectiveness
in curbing industrial pollution, Woolard said that his company
holds a positive attitude towards cooperation with China and will

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest TB-Control Program Beneficial in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A anti-tuberculosis (TB)
program covering almost half of China's population has effectively
stopped the infectious disease from spreading in the country.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities of Chengde city, in north China's Hebei
Province, announced that 95 percent of the TB patients have been
cured since the city joined in the program in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The curing rate was 10 percentage points higher than the year
2000 goal set by the World Health Organization (WHO), and was also
above the average cure rate in the program areas.
</P>
<P>
The program, aided by World Bank loans, was launched by the
Chinese Ministry of Health among 560 million people in 12
provinces and autonomous regions. It adopted DOTS, or "directly
observed treatment, short course", which was introduced by WHO as
the only way to reduce the transmission of TB.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis was previously curable. However, it re-emerged as
a major world health problem in the recent decade mainly due to
improper treatment and emergence of multi-drug resistant strains
of TB.

<P>
Citing TB as a serious epidemic, the WHO declared the disease a
global health emergency in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the DOTS strategy, patients receive their drug dosage
daily under the supervision of health staffers to ensure that they
take the medicine for the full six month period usually required
to cure TB.
</P>
<P>
The program, deemed to be the world's biggest DOTS-using TB
control project, achieved an average curing rate of 92 percent,
the Ministry of Health announced at a meeting to mark the World TB
Day in Beijing Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the number of TB patients in China has
reached about one fourth of the world's total. More than 250,000
people die from TB each year.
</P>
<P>
Like people in many areas of China, Chengde residents have been
greatly threatened by TB.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in line with DOTS principles, local medics and
TB-control staff provided face-to-face treatment to TB patients,
and thus achieved a very high cure rate in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday, Vice-Governor Pan Guiyu of central
China's Hunan Province announced an allocation of 15 million yuan
(1.8 million US dollars) to set up a TB-Control foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will aid TB patients in Hunan who cannot afford
the expense of treatment, the vice-governor said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Expects Favorable Outcome in Manila-NDF Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
expressed the hope for a fruitful outcome from the on-going talks
between the Philippine government and the country's communist-led
National Democratic Front (NDF) in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was commenting on reports from the Netherlands that the
government and the NDF panel have agreed to push for the
completion of peace talks by June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Tuesday after the government peace
panel, led by former ambassador Howard Lee, and the NDF held talks
under the mediation of Speaker of the Philippine House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press conference, Ramos said he was also
optimistic about the outcome of the current on-and-off exploratory
negotiations between the government and the NDF.
</P>
<P>
But the president said the two panels have still to work out
the agenda for the resumption of their formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
One of the obstacles the government and the NDF have to hurdle
is the ticklish human rights issue and international humanitarian
law, which the NDF said should be resolved before the resumption
of their formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But the government said it would like to tackle first the
livelihood program for the communist rebels so that they can go
back to the productive mainstream of civil society.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Front, a leftist alliance led by the
Philippine Communist Party, has been in armed conflict with the
government forces since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF began its exploratory talks with the government in
September 1992, but the talks have been on-and-off because of
sporadic conflicts between the NDF's military arm, the New
People's Army, and the government forces.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the strength of the New People's Army had
been weakened significantly after the government began an all-out
war against it.
</P>
<P>
The military setbacks also resulted in splits among the
Philippine Communist Party and forced its top leaders to flee to
the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Power Transmission Project for Three Gorges Dam Starts Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Installation of a 176-km-long
power transmission line from Changshou County of Sichuan Province
to Wanxian City of Chongqing, China's youngest municipality,
started today.
</P>
<P>
The transmission line is but the first of many power
transmission projects for the gigantic water control dam now under
construction at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The power transmission project, together with the dam itself
and the related resettlement work, have been considered as three
key jobs to be done for the construction of the Three Gorges Dam
Project.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua sent a letter of congratulations for
the ground-breaking event. In his letter, Zou claimed that China
would have a power grid connecting ten provinces and cities in
east, central, and west China in the forthcoming ten years, with
the Three Gorges Project as a central link, which would produce
great impact on China's national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's ceremony for the ground-breaking event, Guo
Shuyan, director of the Three Gorges Project Office of the State
Council, said the entire power transmission project of the Three
Gorges project will require the construction of over 80 separate
power transmission facilities and will cost a total of 27.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Installation of Changshou-Wanxian power transmission line is
scheduled to be finished in May of next year, while the Three
Gorges Dam-Wangxian-Changshou-Chongqing power transmission project
be completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The State Power Grid Development Co. Ltd, which is responsible
for the construction of the Three Gorges power transmission
project, will practice a range of effective measures, including
corporate liability, contracting projects through public bids,
project supervision and contract management, to ensure complete
success of the Three Gorges project.

NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of 1,183
Bangladeshi Chakma refugees will be repatriated from India to
their home in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in southern
Bangladesh between March 28 and 30, a government official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 5,463 refugees from other five camps of Amarpur
subdivision of south Tripura in northeast India will be

Over 6,000 Bangladeshi refugees fled their home in CHT
following disturbances in 1986 and sought shelter in neighboring
India.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation is the outcome of a joint agreement signed
between the two countries on March 9. The Bangladesh government
has announced a 20-point economic and rehabilitation package to
persuade refugees to lead a normal and peaceful life in CHT.

BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Iraq will start
preparatory work for the implementation of the oil contract signed
here last Friday without waiting for the lifting of the sanctions
on Iraq, Russian high-level diplomatic sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Victore
Bosovalyouq as saying that the preparatory work will not oppose
the sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990. All the Russian-Iraqi
projects are long-term projects which will be implemented when
the sanctions are lifted.

<P>
Iraq and Russia signed last Friday a 23-year contract to
develop the Qurnah oil field in southern Iraq at the cost of 53
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to work for the lifting of the sanctions
despite the opposition of the United States and Britain, the
Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
Russia rejected in the U.N. that the contract signed with Iraq
violates the international embargo imposed on Iraq for its

<HEADLINE> Major, Blair Condemn IRA Bomb Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prime Minister John Major
and opposition Labor Party leader Tony Blair today strongly
condemned the Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb attacks in
northwest England early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the two bomb blasts in a town in
Cheshire was a two-fingered insult to democracy at the start of a
general election campaign in which Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, are fielding candidates right across Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair also condemned the "evil act", saying if it was the IRA's
work, they should realize that the chances of them joining the
democratic process diminished with every bomb and bullet.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded early on Wednesday morning in Wilmslow town
center, just south of Manchester, after police received a coded
warning from IRA.
</P>
<P>
The first device exploded in signalling equipment 350 yards
from the town's railway station just before 0700 GMT, and the
second went off at the police station shortly after. The railway
station was closed after the bomb alert.
</P>
<P>
No injuries have been reported so far. A fire brigade spokesman
said that the device was designed to cause disruption rather than
injury.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which opposes British rule in Northern Ireland, has
carried out several bomb attacks on mainland Britain since
February 1996 when it ended a 17-month cease-fire in protest at
the lack of progress in talks aimed at bringing about peace in the
province.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecoms Expect Brilliant Prospects by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
industry, which claims nine percent of the country's GDP, will
maintain a sustained growth through the year 2000 and hold on to
its annual increase margin.
</P>
<P>
The telecom business volume is expected to record a yearly
growth rate of 24 percent, hitting 27 billion yuan in 2000. The
industry's share in China's GDP will increase from the present 1.4
percent to two percent, reported a recent issue of China
Electronics News.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that during the next four years, the telecom
sector will continue to receive preferential industry policies and
state investment.
</P>
<P>
As the investment in telecommunications keeps a stable rise in
the next four years, the urban telephone subscription will
increase by eight to nine million clients annually on average, and
the number of phone users in rural areas will increase yearly by
six to seven million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mobile phone business will gain momentum, with
the subscription rate hitting 30 million users and the cellular
phone density rate jumping from 0.5 percent to 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The data telecom industry will also experience a take-off in
the four-year period, as the number of clients for the country's
public data telecom networks will exceed 1.5 million -- 10 times
the present figure.
</P>
<P>
But the fledgling businesses of visual and multi-media
telecommunications are not expected to grow rapidly, owing to the
high costs and limited market demand here.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom manufacturing enterprises will benefit from the
surging development, and win an increasingly profitable market
share nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The telecom manufacturing sector registered a sales volume of
34 billion yuan last year, and expects to see a big rise in the
figure, as a result of the foreseeable skyrocketing demand for
mobile telecom and data telecom equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the domestic demand for program-controlled switching
machines will be fixed at about 20 million lines every year,
almost excluding the possibility of a generous fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
To lay a solid foundation for the domestic telecom industry,
the central government will give priority to the research on ATM
(asynchronous transport mode) high-speed exchange, broadband
access, and large-capacity digital transmission.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Addresses Joint Session of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari has asked the new government and elected representatives
to address the major economic problems through prudent policies to
provide better living environment to the people.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint sitting of Parliament here today, Leghari
said that this year had an added significance as Pakistan was
celebrating the 50th anniversary of its independence and the
elected representatives must analyze the present situation and
plan for the future in a manner to avoid repeating past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The general elections held on February 3 had brought many
positive results replacing frustration and despondency with hope
and optimism that the new government will resolve the problems
prevailing in the country, said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The President said the present economic mess was the result of
misplaced economic policies of previous governments, and the new
government was focusing its attention towards stabilizing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Leghari noted that there had been a decline in the economic
growth rate, the industrial sector had suffered from stagnation,
agricultural production could not keep pace, exports decreased and
imports had registered an increase.
</P>
<P>
The President also said the foreign debts had increased to such
a level that it became almost impossible to manage further
resources to make the payment.
</P>
<P>
There was no domestic savings and the budget deficit was the
most serious problem confronting Pakistan's economy, said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Leghari called on the government to streamline the taxation
system and check expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction that reports of task forces
established by the government for improving the economy had
started coming in.
</P>
<P>
The President was confident that the government will adopt a
program which optimally utilize agricultural produce and potential
and farmers amicably rewarded for their soil.
</P>
<P>
The economic policies of the government should be clear and
unambiguous, Leghari said, adding that "private sectors' role in
development should be clearly defined for which conducive
atmosphere must be created and incentives and facilities
provided."
</P>
<P>
While commending the enthusiastic public response towards the
government's debt retirement program which would provide immediate
relief to tackle economic difficulties, Leghari said "a lot needs
to be done" to increase exports for durable economic recovery and
widening of tax base to increase government revenue.
</P>
<P>
Legal measures were needed in addition to political will to
accelerate the process of accountability, Leghari said, adding
that "we must live up to the expectations of the people to
continue this process even handedly."
</P>
<P>
The President called for improvement and reform in the legal
system to provide immediate and cheap justice. Leghari expressed
dissatisfaction over police performance which has failed to curb
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Leghari assured that the armed forces were also ready and alert
to defend the motherland, saying that "India has significantly
increased its defense budget this year. Pakistan does not want to
join the arms race with anyone but cannot remain oblivious to
defend needs."
</P>
<P>
Commenting the forthcoming foreign secretary-level talks
between Pakistan and India, the President hoped that "the Indian
leadership will demonstrate greater degree of realism and it would
be possible for the two big south Asian states to establish
relations free from tension and bitterness."
</P>
<P>
"Pak-US relations are improving as both countries believe in
democratic value and sanctity of human rights," said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Leghari believed that the "purpose of nuclear non-proliferation
in south Asia cannot be achieved by ignoring regional realities
and the difficulties emanating from the unresolved Kashmir
dispute and Indian missile and nuclear program."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Pakistan's relations with China, Leghari said
that "Pak-China relations are time tested, enduring as corner
stone of our foreign policy. Cooperation between the two countries
covers numerous fields and was fine example of bilateral relations
in the world."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's relationship with Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey was
as strong as ever while its relationship with the Central Asian
Republics and Middle East countries was getting stronger, Leghari
said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Experts Find Cancer in Ancient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian experts have found early
evidence of cancer for the first time in archaeology in the skull
of a workman who helped build the Giza pyramids 4,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made during excavations of the tombs of the
workmen who built the pyramids, according to today's Egyptian
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists found two cemeteries and the skull was in the
lower cemetery for the workmen who moved the stones to build the
pyramid, said Archaeologist Zahi Hawwas.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in archaeology that you see one
individual dated back to 4,600 years ago and he had cancer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the skull through the National Research Center
revealed early evidence of cancer, said Hawwas, adding that the
skull and other finds of bones at the tombs could help increase
the understanding of medical practices in ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The skull was peppered at the top with holes ranging from the
size of a large coin to a pea, said the English daily.
</P>
<P>
Azza Ezz Eddin, researcher at the center, said the man was about
35 to 40 years old when he died. She said the lesions in the skull
and others they found in his ribs point to a diagnosis of
carcinoma, a type of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Turmoil in Southwestern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Two rioters were reportedly shot
dead and one night guard burnt to death in the oil city of Warri
in southwestern Nigeria on Tuesday when local communal crisis
turned into an orgy of arson, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaw community has embarked on a series of demonstrations
since last week to protest against the removal of the relocation
of the newly-created Warri South local government.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws also held hostage 127 employees of the Shell
Petroleum Company as a means to draw attention from the
government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the coastal town was thrown into confusion as
unknown rioters resorted to the burning of the property of those
suspected to be sympathetic toward the relocation.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was former Information Minister Chief Edwin
Clark, whose house was burnt down and one of the night guards
reportedly burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
Two rioters were also shot and killed by security agents, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
About 17 people were in Clark's house when it was set ablaze,
but all of them escaped. The ex-minister was not at home at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The degenerated security situation also forced Shell Petroleum
Company to shut down another oil well with a capacity of 5,000
barrels a day, the company announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shell closed down a number of production facilities Monday,
including a drilling sub-station producing 90,000 barrels of
crude oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chevron, another big western oil company operating
in Nigeria, also shut three stations producing 45,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday evening 33 of the hostages had been freed,
reportedly due to their state of health, particularly the
injured.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a combined team of navy and policemen has
been dispatched to riverine communities to contain possible
deterioration of the communal crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Raises Key Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) today decided to lift the Liquidity Adjustment
Facility (LAF) rates, the primary interest rates, by 25 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made shortly after the Federal Open Market
Committee increased the United States Fed Funds Target Rate by 25
basis points on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA, which plays the role of the central bank in Hong
Kong, raised the LAF bid rate from 4 percent to 4.25 percent, and
the LAF offer rate from 6 percent to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taking the US Fed Funds Target Rate for reference, the HKMA
expects to align the Hong Kong benchmark rates more closely in
line with the US dollars market interest rates. The HKMA used to
observe the US Discount Rate for a signal of possible changes in
Hong Kong's interest rates before September 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the monetary authority, it is up to individual
banks to determine the rates on deposits with maturities of seven
days or more, as well as the best lending rate. The interest rates
on retail deposits which become mature within seven days will be
nailed down by the Hong Kong Association of Banks.

Liberia's election, the slow pace of preparations for the May 30
poll has aroused concern of the West African peace-keeping force,
known as ECOMOG, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a postponement of the election, ECOMOG Force
Commander Major-General Victor Malu has urged the authorities of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which
sent ECOMOG to Liberia in 1990, to ensure the implementation of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
Malu made the call during a meeting on Tuesday at the ECOMOG
headquarters in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, with the acting
executive secretary of ECOWAS, Mahamadou Quhounoudou who is
currently on a visit to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG chief said all efforts must be made to ensure that
elections be held on May 30 and the new democratic government
sworn in on June 15 as scheduled in the revised Abuja accord
signed in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the success in the efforts to disarm Liberia's formal
rival factions and retrieve hidden weapons, ECOMOG has created
necessary security conditions for the holding of a free and fair
election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malu also allayed any fear of post-election violence or
fighting while assuring the ECOWAS authorities and the
international community that ECOMOG was in position to contain
and effectively tackle anyone who might lose election and try to
cause problem.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the Liberian refugees in Guinea and Cote
d'Ivoire have started returning in large numbers daily with the
recent ECOWAS decision not allowing voting by refugees outside
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Malu reiterated his appeal for
international assistance for the rehabilitation of the grounded
organic vehicles and other equipment of ECOMOG, especially the
supply of tyres, batteries and spare parts.

CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Following are business briefs from
the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's tax administration is expected to be
improved in cooperation with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
under an accord signed in the framework of the World Bank's
Financial Aid and Technical Cooperation Project, according to the
semi-official Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
An IRS expert team is to arrive here in early April to launch a
two-year drive with a cost of 7 million U.S. dollars. Thus, a
complete picture of the Turkish tax system will be drawn.
</P>
<P>
In their report to the Turkish government, the officials will
suggest ways of reducing tax losses.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. experts are also reportedly to provide a training
program to the Turkish Finance Ministry officials to make them
grasp the effective skills of detecting tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Suez Canal will have its draught deepened by 4
feet (1.2 meters) to 62 feet (18.9 meters) in 19 months, Chairman
of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Ahmad Ali Fadel told the
Egyptian MENA news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The deeper draught will allow vessels and giant tankers to
transit the canal with full load of up to 200,000 tonnes by the
end of next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of these operations, the SCA will embark
on implementing the rest of the second stage of the upgrading
works of the Suez Canal in the run-up to the year 2010, the SCA
chairman added.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, the draught will be further deepened to
70 feet (21.3 meters) so that the Suez Canal will become capable of
tackling all sorts of vessels and tankers, Fadel said.
</P>
<P>
The authority has taken full charge of the development and
deepening operations and paid the bill out of its own revenues, he
said, thus sparing the state about 252 million Egyptian
pounds (74.1 million U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
The 195-kilometer canal is the longest one in the world without
locks. As the third largest foreign currency earner for Egypt, it
garnered 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's debts increased by 3.6 percent in January
to reach 2,732 billion Lebanon pounds (1.76 billion U.S. dollars)

December 1996, the Lebanese Banks Association said in a report
issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic debts constituted 86.6 percent of the total sum, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Ministry of oil and Industry decided to
raise petrol prices by 1.7 percent Tuesday, the second rise of the
petrol prices in two months.

Unleaded petrol and 98 octane now cost 12,000 Lebanese
pounds (7.74 U.S. dollars) per 20 liters, while 92 octane
rises to 11,700 Lebanese pounds (7.55 dollars) per 20 liters.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's trade deficit amounted to 426 million
U.S. dollars at the end of January 1997, 67 million dollars less
than that in the same period of 1996, Beirut's Ad-Dyar daily
reported today, quoting a customs report.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese customs said that the exports amounted to 89
million dollars and the imports 515 million dollars in January
1997, with Italy being the biggest exporter for Lebanon and Saudi
Arabia the biggest importer of Lebanese products. Endiem

ULAN BATOR, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first French cabinet
minister visiting Mongolia has brought in a grant of 20 million
French franc (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Corinne Lepage, France's minister of environment, told a press

<P>
To facilitate the official aid program, Lepage said at the end

<P>
During her visit, Lepage met with Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan,

</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope to further the bilateral cooperation in
culture and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Trains to Run Faster in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Trains on China's three major
railway lines of Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, and
Beijing-Harbin will run at a speed of 140 kilometers per hour as
of April 1.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made today by the Ministry of Railways at
a press conference for the implementation of a new railway map.
</P>
<P>
Some trains on other rail lines will have a per hour speed of
120 kilometers, said Huang Sichuan, spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The effort will bring the average travel speed of China's
trains from the current 48.1 to 54.9 km, signaling an initial
change of the long-time low traveling speed of the country's
trains, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Cargo trains on the three trunk lines will operate at a per
hour speed of 80 km, he said, and an increasing number of 5000-ton
heavy-duty trains will be put into use on the lines, as well as a
railway linking Lianyungang, in east China's Jiangsu Province,
with Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
In order to lure back travelers who in recent years have headed
for the highways and airlines to get faster or more comfortable
service, the Ministry of Railways will open 78 "arrive in a night"
trains, starting from large and medium-sized cities including
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an,
and Shenyang, with a travel distance within 1,500 km.
</P>
<P>
"Travelers may think of the trains as hotels -- hotels without
disturbances," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will for the first time launch 515
cargo trains with clearly-set travel times, lines, train numbers,
stops, and ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
China's railway map is usually adjusted every two
years. The '97-'98 version will witness the largest overhaul
since 1949, with emphasis being put on the raised speed of the
trains.

Ministry official arrived here Tuesday night for talks on
bilateral relations following a recent Russian contract with Iraq
in developing oil field in southern Iraq, Kuwaiti official sources
said today.

hold talks with Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majid
Al-Shahin and other Kuwaiti officials on bilateral relations

<HEADLINE> IMF Delegation to Discuss Economy With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) delegation is to arrive in Ankara on April 1 to discuss
with Turkish officials measures to improve the country's sluggish
economy, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two of the major topics to be discussed will be the ongoing
privatization process by the Turkish government and whether
structural measures have been taken to bring about a long-term
improvement in the Turkish economy.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources said the IMF wants to see a sustained
privatization drive and concrete and effective steps to bridge the
gap between public revenues and public spending.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials wants to gain access to data giving a
realistic picture about the Turkish economy, said the sources,
adding they also hope to get information about the measures
against the rampant money laundering activities in this country.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts told the paper that the coalition government
led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan had to speed up work
toward improving the public financing system, increasing exports
and maintaining the export-based development model, and reforming
the taxation and social security systems.

<P>
Meeting with the press in Beijing, McDonnell confirmed that the
cooperation which started 22 years ago between McDonnell Douglas
and Chinese aircraft manufacturers, will expand after the merging
of Boeing and his company -- a move which is awaiting approval
from the US government and the two companies' shareholders.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the new company's board, he added, he was sure
that it will continue to support the manufacturing and marketing
of MD-90 jets produced in China.
</P>
<P>
MD commercial planes now account for about 20 percent of the
Chinese aircraft market, and the company has stepped up marketing
campaigns since last year, said analyst Huang.
</P>
<P>
The only manufacturer of large commercial planes outside the
United States to contend with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in the
global arena, Airbus Industrie is also expanding its operation in
China from only selling planes to the production field.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China last week, Pierson and a leading
Chinese official in charge of aircraft manufacturing discussed how
to add a new jointly-made 100-seat passenger jet to the Airbus
family.
</P>
<P>
Airbus announced last December it would join in the AE-100
project, a three-way cooperative project between China, Singapore
and Europe, and the biggest commercial jet program for Aviation
Industries of China.
</P>
<P>
"The AE-100 project is one of the most important issues in 1997
and the one that is significant to our long-term strategy," said
Pierson.
</P>
<P>
With China's booming air transport market, all the leading
manufacturers predict the market will become one of the biggest in
the world some time in the first two decades of the next century,
and are eyeing the market with mounting interest.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that the increasing competition on the market
will help promote the development of China's aircraft
manufacturing and airline industries, while creating more
opportunities for the competitors themselves.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's People's Party Makes Concessions on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodia's People's Party
(CPP) has agreed to drop the issue of one nationality in the
election laws and reaffirmed its support for the establishment of
commissions for the forthcoming local and national elections.
</P>
<P>
A statement, released today by the CPP, said the CPP had
previously demanded that the members of the Royal Government and
National Assembly, and officials holding positions in the
administration at or above the communal level must have one
nationality or Khmer nationality.
</P>
<P>
However, in order for the upcoming elections to proceed as
mandated in the constitution, the CPP will not raise the issue of
one nationality in the electoral laws any more, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CPP supports the establishment of one
commission for local elections and the other for general
elections. It agrees that these two commissions will enjoy full
rights to make decisions on all issues relating to the process of
the two upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the CPP suggested that the local
elections be held before the general elections. It proposed
November 1998 as the date for holding general elections since the
five-year term of the National Assembly will terminate in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The CPP appealed to all political parties to regard national
interests as of paramount importance and work together to ensure
the elections proceed as scheduled and in a free and fair way.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Tuesday evening, a coordinating committee was
set up to solve problems in the relations between the CPP and the
Funcinpec, the CPP's partner in Cambodia's coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement that the general elections
are to be held in November 1998 and local elections may be set for
early next year.
</P>
<P>
The CPP and the Funcinpec also agreed to allow Cambodians with
dual citizenship to run for public office, ending a dispute that
had threatened to derail both elections.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Building Railway Economic Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China is stepping up
efforts to build an economic corridor along the second Eurasian
Continental Bridge, opened for traffic in 1992, to revitalize the
ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which links Lianyungang in east China with
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, runs 10,800 kilometres with more than
4,100 kilometres passing through China, mainly in northwest
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
and Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
Serving as the bridgehead, the Alataw Port in Xinjiang
bordering Kazakstan, has become China's second largest railway
port, with an annual transport capacity of 3.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The gold passage, as the railway is called, supported by
highways, airlines, and fiber optic lines, offers good
opportunities to provinces and regions along the tracks,
especially to northwest China, which benefits from markets in east
China, Central Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The area spares no efforts to prepare for the westward shift of
China's economic development. An electric railway, which runs from
Shaanxi's Baoji city through Gansu to Zhongwei in Ningxia, was
open to traffic in 1995, and has become another passageway to
China's coastal areas. The incipient Southern Xinjiang Railway
will further promote the role of the continental bridge. Gansu
Province plans to electrify the tracks in its boundary and build a
double track between its capital of Lanzhou to Baoji at the
beginning of next century.
</P>
<P>
The railway takes the lead in attracting investments into the
central and western parts of China. Provisional statistics show
that more than 18,000 cooperative projects and 22.5 billion yuan
worth of goods supply have been agreed among the areas along the
line.
</P>
<P>
Centered around the railway, large-scale key projects, pillar
industries, trade centers, and high-tech zones are booming in the
northwest, while cities and towns are linked with each other to
form a city belt or an economic corridor.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's imports showed a
notable increase in February over a year earlier, while exports
dropped slightly, according to the latest official statistics on
external trade.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports reached 102.3 billion HK dollars (13
billion US dollars) in February 1997, up 6.6 percent over the same
month of last year, according to the Census and Statistics
Department.
</P>
<P>
Total exports decreased by 1.5 percent to 89.1 billion HK
dollars (11.5 billion US dollars) in February. Re-exports edged up
by 0.3 percent to 76.5 billion HK dollars (about ten billion US
dollars), while domestic exports fell by 11 percent to 12.6
billion HK dollars (1.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that strong domestic demand pushed
the imports up, while a dispute with the United States on export
quota for textile and clothing dampened domestic exports.

<HEADLINE> Automaker Urges Government Support (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior auto executive recently
urged the Chinese government to back up Chinese automakers by
controlling the approval of new auto-related projects, gearing up
the utilization of auto-making capacities and financially
supporting the research and development programs.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhaojie, president of China First Auto Works Corporation,
the country's largest automotive enterprise, said that the need to
adjust the overall industrial structure is still imperative two
years after the central government issued the "Guidelines to
China's Automobile Industry."
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the document has played a positive role in the
sound development of the industry," he said. "However, two old
problems, the irrational industrial structure and low economic
efficiency resulting from small production scale, have not been
markedly improved yet."
</P>
<P>
According to Geng, even if the state announces that approval
will not be granted to any new auto-making ventures before the
turn of the century, 24 out of the 31 Chinese provinces still
designate the auto industry as the local "economic pillar" in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, certain provinces have dodged the limitations by
wooing state approval for engine projects, "with the unspoken
motive of virtually building a new auto-making venture," Geng said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, Geng suggested that the central
government fully assume the power over project approval and stop
to give green light to new auto-making or engine projects before
the year 2000. He also said the state should re-examine and
abolish those projects not yet underway.

<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Navy ships left here this afternoon for China after
paying a four-day goodwill visit to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The ships, one missile destroyer and one missile frigate, were
under the command of Vice Admiral Yang Yushu, commander of the
East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by the Chinese Navy ships to the country,
was aimed at strengthening the friendly relations between the two
armed forces and especially between the two navies of the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Yang met Philippine Undersecretary of Defense
Feliciano Gacis, Navy Commander Eduardo Santos and Deputy Chief of
Staff of the Philippine Armed Forces Rodolfo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
Both Yang and these Philippine senior military officials
stressed the need for more exchanges of visits between naval ships
of the two countries to deepen mutual understanding between the
two countries' armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Manila was the last leg of the two ships' three-nation
Southeast Asia tour which also took them to Thailand and Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Geng urged the state to encourage cooperation among the major
automakers in a bid to ensure the economy of scale in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts of big players, in his view, can also resolve
the problem of inadequate use of existing production powers.
</P>
<P>
China's automobile industry has experienced low growth for two
years. Meanwhile, the completion of several key projects has
greatly increased the production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Statistics form China's Ministry of Machine-Building Industry
indicated that China last year manufactured 385,000 cars,
less than half of the actual yearly capacity of 850,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The utilization rates of light- and medium-duty vehicles last
year were also around half of the total capacities, now at 970,000
and 340,000 units, respectively, a year.
</P>
<P>
Geng said one reason for the insufficient market demand is the
excessive fees and fares levied by local governments on vehicle
purchase. He quoted statistics from a ministry survey which reveal
that buyers have to pay 11 kinds of fees and fares accounting for
28 percent of a car's original price.
</P>
<P>
The excessive levying "not only chilled the market demand, but
virtually encouraged local protectionism as well," Geng noted.
</P>
<P>
To activate the market, Geng suggested that all local fares
other than the taxes levied by the state should be abolished, and
low-interest loans for private buyers should be provided.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the financial support for consumers, Geng said,
the state input to back up the research and development projects
for home-designed vehicles, in particular the self-development of
car products, is also necessary if Chinese automakers want to
develop China's automotive industry.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Accepts Resignation of Transportation Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today announced that he has accepted the resignation of Amado
Lagdameo, secretary of Transportation and Communications.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said in a letter to Lagdameo that he accepted the
resignation with "deep regret" and praised him for his
"significant accomplishments in improving and modernizing the
fields of communications and transportation".
</P>
<P>
"It is with deep regret that I accept, effective April 16,
1997, your resignation indicated in your letter dated 24 march
1997, " Ramos said to Lagdameo.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos refused to give the reason for Lagdameo's
resignation and to tell who will be appointed as the new Secretary
of Transportation and Communication in his weekly press conference
today.
</P>
<P>
Local press earlier reported the president has asked Lagdameo
to tender his resignation for his alleged involvement in the
Manila Bay "land scam". Ramos denied the report, saying that he
never asked Lagdameo to resign.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced Tuesday the reappointment of Lagdameo even as a
fact-finding team is set to file charges against him in connection
with the controversial, multibillion-peso land deal involving the
Public Estates Authority which he used to head.

<HEADLINE> New Contract Ushers in New Round of Competition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Air China has signed an agreement
with Boeing to purchase five Boeing 777 jetliners, the first plane
purchase contract between a Chinese carrier and Boeing since it
announced a coming merger with McDonnell Douglas last December.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and visiting US Vice President Al Gore
attended the signing of the agreement, worth some 685 million US
dollars, in Beijing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the contract indicates a new round of
competition for the Chinese aircraft market -- one of the
fastest-growing in the world -- as the wooing of Chinese business
partners has begun.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Xiaonan, a Beijing-based aviation analyst,
it is interesting to note that high-ranking officials of the
world's three leading aircraft manufacturers visited China around
the time the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
came for the signing on the order of Air China, calling this "a
strong vote of confidence" in Boeing airplanes. Air China is the
leading carrier in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the leading contender on the Chinese aircraft market whose
products represent 60 percent of the market for western-built
jetliners in China, "Boeing has invested more than 100 million US
dollars over the past three years to support China's aviation
industry development by improving safety, increasing capacity and
providing management skills training," Woodard said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila, Rebel Group Sign Agreement on Formation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed an agreement Tuesday
on the formation of an Interim Ceasefire Monitoring group that
would oversee violations of a ceasefire between the two sides in a
Mindanao region, a joint statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued here today after the
government-MILF cessation committee held an emergency meeting in
Simuay, Maguindanao of Mindanao on March 23-25.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring group will be composed of professors, newsmen
and lawyers, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, it said, the monitoring group will conduct
fact-finding inquiries on matters pertaining to alleged violations
of the provisions of the Interim Ceasefire Agreement reached by
the two sides last January.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF will provide administrative support
to the monitoring group in the performance of its functions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine President Fidel Ramos approved today the
inclusion of a third party in the joint government-MILF ad hoc
team, which will investigate the March 16-17 clash between the two
sides in Buldon, Maguindanao, the presidential palace said in a
press statement.
</P>

The palace said that Defense Secretary Renato de Villa sought
the inclusion of a third party in the investigation to preclude
possible charges of bias in probing the case.

On March 16-17, MILF rebels shelled the government army
detachment in Buldon, prompting government troops to request for
artillery fire support to counter the MILF mortar fire and to
weaken their position.
</P>
<P>
During the conflict, 11 civilians were killed, three government
soldiers were wounded and hundreds of families in the area were
displaced.
</P>

The presidential palace said that the results of the joint
investigation team will be submitted to President Ramos.

<HEADLINE> New Tax Policy To Be Announced In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's new tax policy
will be announced in the June budget which would be "investor
friendly and taxpayer friendly".
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Daniel Yona revealed this here on Tuesday
when answering what progress the government was making in
overhauling its much-criticized taxation policy.
</P>
<P>
He said a government-commissioned report into tax policy
should be completed within the next week and held several
surprises.
</P>
<P>
Declining to give specific details of tax policy change, Yona
noted Tanzania's new tax policy would put the country on a
competitive level with neighboring Kenya and Uganda and would act
as an incentive to attract foreign and domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to bring them to a level where they will be
competitive in the domestic and external market. We are revising
our tax regime so we have fewer taxes, stable taxes", he said,
adding that some taxes are too high and too many.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yona said out of the 400 ailing state assets in
1992, about 150 had already been sold off. Some 30 state
enterprises sold were completely bankrupt.

<HEADLINE> China Builds 600,000-kw Turbogenerator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first 600,000-kw
turbogenerator, jointly designed by Chinese and Japanese
technicians, has been built by the Dongfang Generator Plant
in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The machine will soon be shipped to the Zouxian Power Plant in
east China's Shandong Province, and will be put into operation by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The 600,000-kw turbogenerator has many advantages, as it is
energy-efficient, causes less environmental pollution, and has
proved to have good economic and social benefits unmatched by any
other turbogenerators of smaller capacity.
</P>
<P>
China first imported such 600,000-kw turbogenerators at the end
of the 1980s. There are now a dozen in operation in the country,
most of which are imported.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China
expects to increase its total generating capacity to 300 million
kw and to improve efficiency of its power industry.
</P>
<P>
The success in the development of the turbogenerator, which
demonstrates that China has become one of the world's advanced
nations as far as the technology and ability to produce
large-capacity generators are concerned, will make it possible for
600,000-kw turbogenerators to dominate the country's thermal power
industry in the 21st century, experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad is to hold talks with heads
of diplomatic missions in the Middle East on South Africa's
changing foreign policy priorities in the region.
</P>
<P>
A source said here today that the meeting, scheduled for April
in Bahrain, follows steady expansion of South African
representation in the Middle East, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Ferguson, a specialist on the Mideast in the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, told the National Assembly committee on
foreign affairs Tuesday that Kuwait, Oman and Lebanon are leading
South Africa's list for ties expansion due to the potential for
trade hike.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was putting increasing efforts into promoting its
trade in the Gulf where oil-rich countries imported 90 percent of
what they consumed.
</P>
<P>
However, Ferguson expressed his frustration at South Africa's
strict visa requirements which, while necessary, hampered
businessmen who came to this country to investigate further
trade.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson added his country would continue to put a high
premium on support for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
There was a "critical dialogue" developing between South
Africa and Israel about Israel's relations with the Palestinian
authority, particularly with regard to the current controversy
about house-building project in East Jerusalem, he added.

Cambodia before the end of the century, a senior ADB official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this morning, Toru Tatara, a

ADF loans will carry no interest, with 1 percent service charge
and 40 years of repayment period including a 10-year grace.
</P>

dollars for 1997, four projects totaling 110 million dollars for
1998, four projects totaling 90 million dollars for 1999 and four

two to three years, with inflation kept at around a modest 5
percent annually.

JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will build two
special prisons to house convicted rapists in a bid to get tough

<P>
"We have discussed the possibility of making one of the
supermaximum prisons an institution for rapists only,"
Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela was quoted as saying.

epidemic proportions... That is ridiculous in a country that has
a constitution, and a bill of rights and is governed by the rule
of law," Mzimela said.
</P>

Visiting a juvenile center recently, Mzimela said he found out
of 52 people in a cell, 48 were convicted rapists, and some were

<HEADLINE> Fatah Plans Mass Demonstrations Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Fatah Movement of
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) is planning widespread
demonstrations on Sunday's Land Day to protest Israel's
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the meeting of Fatah activists and
Palestinian Council held Tuesday at Beit Sahur near
Jerusalem. Fatah head Marwan Barghouti said several marches and
"powerful" demonstrations would be staged across the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Council is to hold a meeting in the West Bank
city of Rmallah, north of Jerusalem, to coordinate the protest
plans. But council members in the Gaza Strip were denied entry to
attend the meeting because of the ongoing closure imposed by
Israel following last Friday's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Fatah, the main PLO faction led by Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, has called on the PNA to
suspend security cooperation with Israel until it agreed to halt
settlement expansion. Despite the recent tension, the security
coordination between both sides continues, though at a lower
level.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, about 500 Fatah activists held a joint
meeting of its area committees and Higher Fatah Council at Beit
Sahur to discuss plans to counter Israel's settlement
activities, especially the construction work which began last
week in Har Homa of southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, about 30 percent of the participants called
for renewing the intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and some
even called for armed attacks against Israel. But the majority
opted for peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
In concessions to the hawks, the meeting decided to call for
a boycott of Israeli goods which could be replaced by local
goods. Moreover, the definition of peaceful demonstrations
apparently included throwing stones and fire-bombs at Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
For the past week, Palestinian youths have been throwing
stones and petro-bombs in clashes with Israeli soldiers, who
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. The clashes
did not escalate into a bloodshed mainly due to the efforts made
by the Palestinian police who tried hard to separate the
protesters from Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have observed the Land Day since 1976 when six
Israeli Arab villagers were shot by Israeli police in a protest
over Israel's expropriation of their land. Fatah's plan to stage
mass demonstration this Sunday is expected to fuel the recent
tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The current tension was triggered by Israel's move to begin
the controversial plan to build a Jewish neighborhood in Har
Homa, which is within the boundary of the occupied East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes. While Israel has declared its sovereignty over the
whole Jerusalem, the PNA wants the eastern part to be the capital
of its future independent state.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 80,000 Sudanese Refugees
have returned home from Uganda in the past two or three days,
reported the local Monitor daily today.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Arman, a spokesman for the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), was quoted as saying that Sudan's borders with
Uganda and Zaire were now under the control of the SPLA led by

During the offensive this month, the SPLA says it has killed
about 3,000 governmental militiamen and wounded or captured
1,000.
</P>

Several hundreds of SPLA fighters were also killed, said the
SPLA.

troops to fight alongside the SPLA in its campaign in the south
and the east since January this year. But they all deny the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), there are about 184,000 Sudanese refugees
living in Uganda at present.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Road Safety Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
launched the Police Road Safety Campaign with an aim to curb road
carnage.
</P>
<P>
Launching the public awareness campaign, Kenyan Police
Commissioner Duncan Wachira said here on Tuesday that "today I am
launching a Road Safety Campaign aimed at changing the attitudes
of our drivers."
</P>
<P>
The campaign is largely seen as a shift from the traditional
use of conventional traffic laws to curb road carnage to an
emphasis on attitude change as the more effective alternative.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, police officers will conduct public
lectures at markets, administrative centers, urban areas,
schools, colleges and other institutes in the eastern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Posters, leaflets and stickers will also be distributed to
enlighten Kenyans on safe road use.
</P>
<P>
The police boss said that the number of road accidents in
Kenya last year increased from 11,785 in 1994 to 13,890, an
average of 37 accidents daily.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14,390 Kenyans have perished in road accidents
during the past three years in the country with a population of
28 million, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"the number of those dying (in road accidents) is large
enough, that of serious injuries is just too high," Wachira said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 85 percent of these accidents are human
error-related and the biggest cause is losing control due to
either speeding or overtaking dangerously.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority objective in this campaign will be to persuade
drivers to make a conscious decision to observe the traffic rules
and regulations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to a report compiled by the Institute of Economic
Affairs, a local civic non-governmental organization, the death
rate on Kenyan roads is among the highest in the world, and it
stands at 7.7 per 1,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Kenya lost about 73 million U.S. Dollars
annually in material damage, and more than 100 million Dollars in
manpower as a result of road accidents.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Coal Mines in Henan Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The restructuring of
state-owned enterprises has transformed state-owned coal mines in
Henan Province from money losers into profit makers.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, five major state-owned coal mines
in the province all reported profits for the first time in 1996,
with gains amounting to 320 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
They are the Pingdingshan, Zhengzhou, Yima, Hebi and Jiaozuo
coal mines, with a combined annual production capacity of 40
million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Henan, in central China, is ranked second only after Shanxi
Province in the north in terms of coal production.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the five mines suffered heavy losses resulting from
shrinking coal resources from excessive mining, stockpiling of
coal, and price hikes of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
By 1991, four of the five mines had reported two billion yuan
in losses.
</P>
<P>
The mines have been searching for effective means of improving
enterprise efficiency since China decontrolled its coal market and
stopped subsidizing unprofitable state-owned coal mines three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The steps, which so far have worked, include reforming
traditional coal production and marketing practices and arranging
output and varieties according to market demands, cutting staff of
work teams for coal production, and organizing additional workers
for sideline production.
</P>
<P>
Last year, while guaranteeing normal coal production,
state-owned coal mines of the province generated 5.1 billion yuan
in output value from sideline production, generating 340 million
yuan in profits and taxes, both showing marked increases over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100,000 of the province's 400,000 coal
workers, some of whom are from collectively-owned coal mines, have
left their jobs and turned to other professions such as tourism
and building materials.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Experts Call for Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian agricultural expert has
recommended that Zambia should exploit ways of adapting more
stable foods from crops like soya beans, cassava and rice.
</P>
<P>
Amos Bunyolo, the chief agricultural research officer at
Kasama's Misamfu Research Center, is working with some
agricultural officers and researchers on a research program in
Zambia's northern province.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Bunyolo as saying that Zambia can
easily shift from maize growing because other crops can be
exploiting more especially by small scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Foods like cassava could be developed very easily because
they are in fact drought-resistant. This is the time we should
consider this seriously," Bunyolo said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has vast potential for developing other crops into
stable food which can reduce food deficits in the country, He
said.
</P>
<P>
Cassava and rice are traditional crops in parts of the country
and Bunyolo and his team are reportedly working to introduce the
crops in more areas.

bilateral repurchase agreement here today in an effort to
strengthen ties among central banks in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each party can sell to the other US
government securities in exchange for cash, and then repurchase
the same securities at a specified date later for an agreed amount
of money.

The arrangement allows each institution to enhance the
liquidity of its foreign reserves portfolio at minimal risks. The
HKMA has established such links with the central banks of nine
other nations -- Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such agreement the central bank of New Zealand
has inked. Dr Don Brash, governor of the RBNZ said that since
seven of New Zealand's top ten export markets are in Asia, it is
important that the RBNZ develops relationships with its Asian
counterparts.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The rate of inflation
dropped to 13.8 percent in February from 14 percent in January
with prospects of achieving a single digit rate by the end of the
1996/97 financial year.
</P>

would fall to a single-digit level this year.

<HEADLINE> Courier Reaches European-Dominated Quarters at Lipton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Former world number one Jim
Courier Tuesday ousted Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek and
advanced to the Lipton Championships quarter-finals, which took on
a decidedly European flavor.
</P>
<P>
Six quarter-final slots up for grabs on Tuesday went to
Europeans. Courier's fellow American, the world number one Pete
Sampras is the other non-European survivor.
</P>
<P>
The 26th-ranked Courier, who has a home nearby and the crowd in
his back pocket, showed some of the form that brought him the top
ranking and four Grand Slam titles earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
The American squandered two chances to break Krajicek in the
eighth game of the first set, but succeeded in the tight 8-6
tiebreaker, exploiting a forehand error by the Wimbledon champion.
</P>
<P>
The second set, which was eventually won by Courier 6-4, was as
hard fought as the first. The local favourite capitalized on the
Dutchman's erratic forehand performances and sent fifth-seeded
Krajicek home in his fourth appearance since the injury last
December.
</P>
<P>
In the round of last eight, the resurgent Courier takes on
fourth-seeded Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, who advanced with a 6-4,
6-4 victory over promising Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty.
</P>
<P>
Australian Open champion Sampras, in the hunt for his fourth
title of the year, next meets German Hendrik Dreekman.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Austrian Thomas Muster next faces Jonas Bjorkman
of Sweden, who fended off missile-serving Australian Mark
Philippoussis 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Former two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain, who
upset third seed Michael Chang in the third round, will face
Ukraine's Andrei MedvedevMedvedev in the quarter-finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin met a
Hong Kong youth delegation in the Great Hall of the People here
Monday, hoping the youths of the two metropolises join hands for a
promising new century.
</P>
<P>
Jia said the delegation's visit to Beijing indicated that Hong
Kong young people support the policy of "one country, two systems"
and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected mayor noted that the visit would play an
active role in increasing exchanges between the young people in
Hong Kong and the inland areas, and promoting Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this January, Hong Kong, the biggest investor in
Beijing, had directly invested 9.98 billion US dollars in 5,139
companies in Beijing, 48 percent of the total overseas-funded and
cooperative firms and joint ventures in Beijing, and 49.5 percent
of contracted overseas investment, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jia invited more Hong Kong young business people to invest more in
the capital to boost their business here.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of the motherland,
he believed that Hong Kong young people will carry forward the
historical task and make concerted efforts for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and its long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The delegates at the meeting expressed their determination to
contribute to the HK-Beijing exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, the
44-member Hong Kong youth delegation arrived in Beijing on March
23 and attended celebrations of the 100-day countdown of Hong
Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland.

<P>
TIRANA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Defense Minister Shaqir
Vukaj said today that the country's public order was improving
steadily.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with visiting U.S. Commander
of the Sixth Fleet of Navy, Charles Abot.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Telegraphic Agency reported that after Vukaj's
briefing, Abot said the United States was "satisfied" to see the
progress Albania had made in establishing stability.
</P>
<P>
Abot said that Albania's stability and normalization of its
peaceful life had special meaning to itself and its (NATO's
peaceful) partners, adding that the two countries' good military
relations would restart and be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Defense Ministry today issued a statement denying
that any U.S. aircraft had been attacked by Albanian missiles when
they set down in Tirana earlier this month to evacuate
U.S. nationals in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
"No civilian or military aircraft was targeted by Albanian army
missiles", said the communique.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Defense Ministry claimed that on March 20, a
U.S. transport plane was targeted by Albanian surface-to-air
missiles near Durres, and last week, two U.S. helicopters were
also targeted by anti-aircraft cannon fire, according to the
Albanian Telegraphic Agency.

NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela is arriving here tomorrow on an official visit to India,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mandela and Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda would give a substantive thrust to bilateral strategic,
defense, political and economic cooperation, South African High
Commissioner Jerry M. Matsila said.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, India and South Africa
are expected to sign an ambitious document on strategic
cooperation during Mandela's visit here.
</P>
<P>
The contours of the politico-military agreement will be
contained in a declaration to be released at the end of Mandela's
visit. South Africa will be the first country with which India
will have a strategic alliance in the post-Cold War era, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
India gave significant support to South Africa in its struggle
against apartheid and now feels that the goodwill should be turned
to better use between the two countries. "We need a sustained and
energetic interaction with South Africa," an Indian official said.
</P>
<P>
A grand civic reception has been planned at Red Fort of Delhi
on March 28 for the South African president, who is going to be
the second foreign dignitary to be honored at the Red Fort after
India's independence in 1947. Before him, it was the former
American president, Jimmy Carter, who was accorded such kind of
welcome in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Ukraine, Azerbaijan Reach Broad Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
and his Azerbaijani counterpart Geidar Aliev said today that
they have reached agreement on a broad range of issues.
</P>
<P>
They told a press conference at the end of Aliev's two-day
visit that they hold identical views on bilateral cooperation, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European security.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming CIS summit, Kuchma said the group of 12 former
Soviet republics should be a community where each member nation
enjoys equal rights regardless of its size and population.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he was in "complete agreement" with his host, Aliev
said the CIS should be a mechanism of democracy, high efficiency,
equality that goes in line with international norms.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the CIS summit scheduled for Friday in Moscow
will bring "radical improvement" in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Aliev's visit here, the first by an Azerbaijani president since
the breakup of the Soviet Union, was in return for a tour of his
country by the Ukrainian president in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of Aliev's stay, the two countries signed 17
economic, cultural and military agreements, including a memorandum
on cooperation in the oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's spokesman said the memorandum lays out plans for
Ukraine to build platforms for a future Caspian Sea drilling
project.

<HEADLINE> India to Remove 450 Items from Restricted Import List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government plans to
remove over 450 items from the restricted list of imports and the
decision will be announced at the end of this month, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government will also scrap the value-based advance
licensing scheme (VABAL) along with its sensitive list in the
Export-Import (EXIM) policy for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The items removed from the restricted list will be put on the
special import licence (SIL) and open general licence (OGL) lists.
The passbook scheme and the negative list under the VABAL scheme
will also be dropped.
</P>
<P>
The passbook scheme, however, will reappear in a simplified
form. The concept of "credits" is likely to be kept alive in a new
scheme and duty-free entitlements for imports will be given
against credits according to the sector/category.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is also likely to lower the duty to 10 percent
on imports worth less than 200 million rupees (5.63 million US
dollars) under the export promotion capital goods scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry aims to remove about 600 of 3,000 items
on the restricted list every year for the next five years, the
same official said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Signs Accords with Turkey, South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina held separate talks here Tuesday with visiting Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel, South African President Nelson Mandela
and President of the Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat
and signed two accords with Turkey and one with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders arrived here on Tuesday afternoon to attend
Bangladesh's 25th anniversary independence day celebrations today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen on the outcome of the talks, Foreign Secretary
Farooq Sobahan said that the discussions were fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh signed two agreements with Turkey, one for opening
of air links between Istanbul and Dhaka, and the other a cultural
and scientific exchange program valid for three years, said the
foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
He said another agreement with Turkey was expected to be signed
shortly on avoidance of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
President Demirel also offered Bangladesh the Turkish free port
areas for storage of merchandise bound for Europe and assistance
for the development of infrastructures in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
During the bilateral talks, Prime Minister Hasina stressed the
importance of South-South cooperation and closer cooperation among
the D-8 initiated by Turkey. The so-called D-8, development of
eight countries, includes Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
About the talks with the South African president, the foreign
secretary said the two sides declared their intention to
consolidate bilateral relations in order to establish the widest
possible cooperation in all spheres of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration issued by President Mandela and Prime
Minister Hasina also expressed their intention to utilize the
renewed cooperation in the process of durable economic and social
reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader also recalled the strong support of
Bangladesh in their long struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
About the talks between Arafat and Sheikh Hasina, the foreign
secretary said the Palestinian leader recalled his relations with
Bangladesh's former president Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, the
father of Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Arafat informed Hasina that the acts of judaisation of
Jerusalem by Israel was causing an economic loss of seven to nine
million U.S. dollars every day to Palestine. He expressed the hope
that Bangladesh would continue to support the Palestinian people
in their cause.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina assured the Palestinian leader of strong and
unequivocal support of Bangladesh. "We in our humble way uphold
the cause of Palestine at every place and on every occasion,"
Hasina was quoted to have told Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents are scheduled to address a state function
today along with Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin Ahmed in
observance of the independence day today.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-U.S. summit in
Helsinki reached "realistic and compromise results," though it
went on under hard situation, a Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yelstin held that the Helsinki summit
was the most tense and difficult one among the 11 summits between
the two countries he had taken part, Russian presidential press
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary said the summit took place in a very
complicated situation: one was to avoid the ties with the Western
countries being worse and another was to force the West to pay
more attention to Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said the summit gained some achievements by
agreeing to work out documents on the ties between Russia and NATO
as soon as possible and no nuclear weapons to be deployed and no
fighting troops to be stationed in new NATO member countries. The
United States agreed to help Russia join the Paris Club and the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States and Russia should do a lot
of careful work to implement the agreements.
</P>
<P>
The summit was held on March 21 with the signing of five joint
statements on European security, disarmament and bilateral
economic ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian naval and law enforcement
vessels today continued patrolling the lower Adriatic Sea to
intercept and turn back boats carrying Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that more stringent measures to prevent
the crossing of Albanian refugees were enacted when it became
clear that Albanian criminals had set up a traffic in would-be
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The moves follow the arrival of up to 12,000 asylum-seekers
from neighboring Albania in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Italian Adriatic armada includes 25 Coast Guard
cutters with two P-166 surveillance aircraft and one helicopter
patrolling Italian territorial waters along the coast of the
southern Puglia region, where most of the refugees arrived.
</P>
<P>
Two navy frigates and two corvettes are keeping an eye on areas
of sea close to Albanian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Also committed to the operation are 54 police patrol boats,
some fitted out for long stretches at sea, and 12 helicopters for
keeping tabs on areas of the Adriatic from Ravenna on the
north-central coast down to the heel of the Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Waters along the Puglia coast are also being plied by
Carabinieri and national police boats.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government signed an agreement with Tirana on
Monday to step up Italian patrols of the Adriatic and hold off the
Albanian illegal immigration flow into the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that the Italian navy will maintain
patrols along the Albanian coast for 30 days, a term which can be
extended.

HANOI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The passenger service for the
Hanoi-Kunming railway route will begin operation on April 18, the
Vietnam News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The railway between Hanoi and Kunming, crossing the border at
Lao Cai, about 300 kilometers northwest of Hanoi, has been used
for freight only.
</P>
<P>
The railway line was built by the French colonialists about 100
years ago. It is the only single gauge route between Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Hanoi-Kunming passenger rail service is
expected to lead to a steady increase in tourists from the
land-locked southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan for visits to
Vietnamese beaches.
</P>
<P>
The first Vietnamese-Chinese train route was re-opened for
passengers at the beginning of 1996, linking Hanoi to Pingxiang in

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and France
today failed to reach agreement over the command of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say we reached agreement," French Defense Minister
Charles Millon told reporters after talks on the issue with
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "I am confident that one of these days we will
find something in common."
</P>
<P>
Millon said their talks focused on the post-Cold War adaptation
of NATO, including reforms of NATO's Southern Command headquarters
in Naples, Italy.
</P>
<P>
France wants Washington to turn over the NATO Southern Command
to a European officer, and has tied this to the issue of its
decision whether to return to the military wing of NATO.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has been insisting on its position in the
post.
</P>
<P>
"We want to reach a new military balance between the United
States and Europe," Millon said. "We want to reach actual parity
in the southern region."
</P>
<P>
"What France wants to see is a balanced evolution of the
structures of NATO," Millon said. "What France requests today is
basically to actually share responsibilities on an equal footing."
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister explained that responsibility for
Europeans in the framework of NATO had to be taken by the
Europeans themselves.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Rejects Dutch Plan for Reforming Maastricht Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind today dismissed as unacceptable the Dutch plan for
reforming the European Union's Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Rifkind said that the
Presidency Paper proposed by the Netherlands "is a serious problem
that will create very real difficulties...because it seeks to
reopen what was negotiated and agreed at Maastricht".
</P>
<P>
Rifkind was in Rome today with other EU foreign ministers for
the celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the signing of
the Treaty of Rome which founded the European Economic Community,
forerunner of the EU.
</P>
<P>
"What the Presidency Paper proposes is that the second and the
third pillars should be swept away into the community pillar,
subject to majority vote, subject to the jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice and with the commission having the sole
right of initiative," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
"Such proposals are totally unacceptable and should be
unacceptable to other countries as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also slashed at the Dutch proposals for merging the
Western European Union (WEU) and the EU, pointing out that
existing EU members Sweden, Finland and Austria were neutral
countries and not members of the WEU.
</P>
<P>
"The inference is that they would play a part in determining
collective security which they were not themselves committed to,"
Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also claimed that merging the WEU with the EU could
threaten plans for enlargement of the EU to include the Baltic
states, and would cause major problems in relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
What was at stake was "a fundamental question as to which route
the EU is going to take over the years to come and what its final
destination is intended to be," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Invite Foreign Election Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided not to invite foreign observers to monitor the May 29
general election, reversing its earlier decision, Attorney General
Singgih said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no plans to invite foreign observers, but
if they want to come here to watch, let them go ahead. But they
can not supervise, because according to the law, only we have the
authority to supervise (the election)," Singgih said here after
meeting with President Soeharto Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Singgih's statement came only one day after Coordinating
Minister for Political Affairs and Security Soesilo Soedarman said
that foreign observers would not be banned from monitoring the
general election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S. Memet,
who is also head of the National Elections Institute, said the
government would "invite neighboring and foreign countries to
monitor the election."
</P>
<P>
Singgih is head of the Election Supervision Committee, the
official poll watchdog. He said the committee and its branches
across Indonesia would hold a meeting on April 14-15 to discuss
various issues related to the supervision of the general election,
including "the contentious (issue) of foreign observers."
</P>
<P>
However, Singgih reiterated that foreigners could "watch" the
election but would be barred from doing any investigative
activities, "As that is the job of the official poll monitoring
body."
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Supreme Court denied Monday with finality the
government's petition to reconsider a decision awarding the
government's 51 percent equity in the Manila Hotel to Manila
Prince Hotel corp., a Filipino firm, instead of the winning
Malaysian bidder -- Renong Berhad. And later the Ramos
administration accepted the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it
will no longer pose any objections to the court ruling on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government may seek the lifting of
quantitative restrictions on rice imports following plans to phase
in tariff reduction on rice under the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) of the ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2005,
Agriculture Assistant Secretary Marinela Castillo said Monday. He
said that the inclusion of rice in the CEPT was reinforced at the
recent ASEAN economic ministers meeting here.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government is set to review the existing
government policies covering freeports and special economic zones,
including duty free shops there, due to the reported proliferation
of smuggling activities at the Clark Special Economic Zones, the
newspaper Manila Bulletin said today. It said that the review of
the current rules governing duty free shops and the special
economic zones follows the report of the Bureau of Customs
detailing "rampant" violations by duty free shops in the nation's
special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines' big banks have adopted different positions
on their prime lending rates despite a sustained decline in the
country's benchmark interest rate. The Bank of the Philippines
Islands and Far East Bank and Trust co. said they had cut their
prime rates. But other big banks said they decided to keep their
rates unchanged from last week's. The benchmark 91-day Treasury
Bill rate has been falling for the past five weeks in the country.
It hit an 18 month low of 9.724 percent on Monday due to excess
liquidity.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Presses bid to Host World Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will make a strong
bid to host the World Exposition in the year 2002 after winning
Bureau des Expositions' (BIE) approval for small nations to host
exhibition on small scale, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its recent General Assembly extraordinary session in Paris,
the BIE approved the Philippine proposal on the holding of smaller
scale world expositions to be officially classified as
"recognized" World Expositions.
</P>
<P>
The BIE is an inter-government world organization that
regulates the frequency and organization of international
expositions. The Philippines is one of its 48 member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has campaigned since 1993 to get BIE approval
for its smaller member countries to be allowed to host
international expositions.
</P>
<P>
The recent BIE approval of the scheme makes it a top contender
to bid for the 2002 World Exposition hosting.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Tourism
have joined forces in pressing the sustained Philippine campaign
for smaller BIE member countries to likewise enjoy such World
Exposition hosting privilege.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor personally pressed the campaign at
the recently concluded BIE assembly. Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingo Siazon also met with BIE officials in Paris last year to
follow up the meeting President Fidel Ramos had with them in 1994.
</P>
<P>
What claimed the victory for the Philippine campaign, the
report said, was the support it gained from other developing
countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Okays Export Growth Target for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has agreed to
fix the export target for 1997 at 1,558.7 billion baht (62.3
billion U.S. dollars), or an increase of 10 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Government House,
the proposal regarding the target raised by the Economic Affairs
Screening Committee on Monday won the cabinet approval at its
weekly meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also agreed to increase Thailand's imports to 1,972
billion baht (78.9 billion dollars) for 1997, which means that the
country's trade deficit will decline to 413.3 billion baht (16.5
billion dollars), or by 3 percent from last year, the Government
House said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai economic performance in 1997 will be positive as Thai
major markets like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the United States, Japan and Europe are moving well,
according to the Government House.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Thai products, such as electronic and electrical
appliances, jewelry, vehicles, sports equipment, canned seafood,
rubber products, fruits and rice, are expected to expand for the
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cabinet also agreed to curb the country's
current account deficit below 6.9 percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's export was only 0.4 percent higher
than 1995.
</P>
<P>
To remove export obstacles to exporters, the Thai government
this year plans to help boost export by speeding up value-added
tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will remain the top export market, with a forecast of an
11.7 percent increase. Exports to the EU are forecast to grow by
10.6 percent, to Japan up 10 percent and the U.S. up 9.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Urges Further EU Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today urged all European Union (EU) member states to enhance
cooperation in solving commonly-faced problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Rome, the European Community's founding
document, Prodi warned his EU partners that there no longer
existed any room for isolated actions.
</P>
<P>
The European governments must work hard together to gain
lasting and non-inflationary economic growth, to raise the
standard of living and to roll back unemployment on the continent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the issue of unemployment, Prodi said many
European countries had already developed "widespread systems of
social protection capable of reconciling social cohesion and
economic growth".
</P>
<P>
However, the situation was changing, he said. The need had
come for a new social model to replace the "excessively
overbalanced one toward those who are in the labor market".
</P>
<P>
There must be more equitable access to jobs because a lack of
equality in the distribution of income harmed economic growth, he
argued.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Rome laid down "principles for safeguarding the
younger and future generations," he noted. "When the unemployment
rate exceeds 10 percent, there is an unacceptable waste of human
resources."
</P>
<P>
But this could be alleviated through supranational policies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union covered
not only the single currency but also the attached social policies
and common structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen the space of freedom and security within the
European Union, some issues still disciplined by national norms
must be transferred to the community sphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issues included emigration, asylum, checks on the EU's
external borders, customs cooperation and the fight against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in Albania, Prodi stressed the need for a
European contribution to help end the crisis, saying that Italy
could not take action by itself in a situation which was negative
for the entire continent.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella will visit Washington from March 31 to April 2 to
solve trade problems with the United States, the foreign ministry
announced today.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he will meet and have talks with his
U.S. counterpart Madeleine Albright on the lopsided trade between
the two countries with a 1.761-billion-U.S.-dollar deficit for
Argentina in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. statistics, the two countries' bilateral
trade reached 6.792 billion dollars in 1996, in which, Argentina
imported a total of 4.514 billion dollars from the United States,
and exported 2.278 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two countries' trade had reached 10
billion dollars during the four years from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The important topics to be discussed are: investments,
privatization of airports, telecommunications, infrastructure,
joint projects, and the U.S. airline companies' buying Argentine
airlines stocks.
</P>
<P>
The others in which Argentina is interested are: the trade
imbalance and export quotas on various products to the
U.S. market, while the other side is more interested in
Argentina's intellectual property, patents and possible future
sanctions against Argentina in several trade categories.
</P>
<P>
The most important products exported to the United States
include crude oil, fruit juice and articles made from gold, while
those imported from the United States include mechanical products,
machinery, electrical appliances, plastic materials, chemical

<HEADLINE> Armenia to Continue Political, Economic Reform: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- New Armenian Prime Minister Robert
Kocharyan pledged Tuesday to carry on political and economic
reforms in Amenia and to restore order in the country, according
to reports from Armenia capital Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference held after being appointed prime
minister on March 20, Kocharyan said he was ready to cooperate
with all political parties to seek national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He urged all-out efforts for unity in the Armenian society.
</P>
<P>
On Armenian economic policy, Kocharyan said he would pursue
tougher tax policy, and exercise stricter supervision over the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who had been president of the self-declared
Nagorno-Karabakh republic after 1994, stressed that the bad
economic and political situation in Amenia would affect the
region, which is both claimed by Amenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave inside Azerbaijan but populated
mostly by Armenians, has been the focus of a bitter feud between
Amenia and Azerbaijan since 1988, when the republic declared to
secede from Azerbaijan to join Amenia.
</P>
<P>
A truce signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1994 ended a
bitter war in which thousands of people were killed, but peace
talks have been stalled.

SEOUL, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Public bus drivers in Seoul, Inchon
and Taejon went on strike today to back demands for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
Only about 2 percent of Seoul's 8,700 buses were still
operating, leaving tens of thousands of commuters stranded.
</P>
<P>
Municipal officials said that Seoul bus unions were demanding a
13-percent wage increase and an additional half-a-month bonus
payment a year.
</P>
<P>
Bus unions in Pusan, Taegu and Kwangju had planned to join
today's strike. But drivers in Pusan and Taegu reached settlements
early in the day and union leaders in Kwangju agreed to continue
negotiations with the management.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was hit by a month-long strike following the
passage of a new labor law late last year. The strike forced South
Korean President Kim Young-sam to return the bill to parliament
for revision.
</P>
<P>
Its replacement delayed implementation of a controversial
lay-off clause. It also recognized the formerly outlawed Korean
Confederation of Trade Unions that organized the January strike.

BRUSSEL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Feyenoord Rotterdam could lose
their club sponsor, a large Dutch insurance company, after clashes
between Feyenoord and Ajax hooligans on Sunday left one person

The fight at Beverwijk in the west of the country, away from

the bad publicity could incur and might pull the plug after this

WELLINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Wellington has launched its
official bid to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games despite cries
from bidding candidate Christchurch, local reports said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wellington Commonwealth Games Society chief executive Arthur
Klap said that support for the nation's capital was impressive.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the late emergence of Christchurch as a possible
bidder, we've had tangible backing from right around the country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand lasted staged the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne, Australia, is considered the current front-runner by
winning its nation's nomination ahead of Brisbane and Darwin.
</P>
<P>
Australia has staged Commonwealth Games, which previously were
known as the Empire Games, at Sydney in 1938, Perth in 1962 and
Brisbane in 1982.
</P>
<P>
If Cape Town, South Africa, fails in its bid to host the 2004
Olympic Games, then there is a strong chance an African city could
be given the right to host the 2006 Commonwealth Games, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Games will be staged in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and
the 2002 Games in Manchester, England.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler's
sporting behaviour in an English premier league game brought a
letter of congratulation from Sepp Blatter, general secretary of
the world governing body FIFA, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Your reaction in the penalty incident...did you great
honour. It is the kind of reaction which helps maintain the
dignity of the game," said Blatter, after Liverpool's crucial
top-of-the-table match against Arsenal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With Liverpool leading 1-0, Fowler, appearing to be brought
down in the penalty area by England goalkeeper David Seaman and
receiving the penalty signal from referee Gerald Ashby, protested
that he had not been fouled.
</P>
<P>
Ashby later claimed he had not heard Fowler and the decision
stood. Liverpool went on to win the game 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the message of thanks came on the same day that the
control and disciplinary committee of UEFA, the European governing
body, was discussing possible action against Fowler.
</P>
<P>
In last week's European Cup Winners' Cup match, he broke UEFA
rules by revealing a political slogan on his T-shirt after scoring
against Brann Bergen of Norway.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
announced that it strongly opposes Israel's construction of a
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry's spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl said here last
night that Israel should promptly cease the housing project at Har
Homa in East Jerusalem because it will ultimately destroy the
Palestine-Israel peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel does not immediately stop the construction of the
settlement, Palestinians will inflict a bigger demonstration than
what they did in Tel Aviv few days ago," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The government and people of Indonesia, he said, condemned any
act of force by Israeli soldiers against demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that if the peace process between Israel and
Palestine failed, stability and security in the Middle East could
be threatened.
</P>
<P>
To prevent matters which may result in new conflicts in the
Middle East, Ghaffar urged Israel to obey by the U.N. resolution
calling the Jewish troops to withdraw from all occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, Israel's Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem
approved the building of 6,500 homes for Jews and more than 3,000
houses for Arabs in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has a go-ahead to the first stage
erection of 6,500 houses for more than 30,000 Jews in Jabal Abu
Ghniem or Har Homa, East Jerusalem.

federation after a coin was thrown at a referee during a league
match.

FIFA, of which the bylaws forbid teams from taking recourse in

<P>
According to the traditional view, "mi se" ware, a special term
for this kind of porcelain made in Yue Kiln, was developed in the
Five Dynasties (907-979).
</P>
<P>
The palace, where Sakyamuni's holy bones were enshrined in the
Tang Dynasty (618-907), was found with more than 1,000 rare
cultural relics in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Among the relics were 14 "mi se" ware, 13 of them stored in a
wooden box.
</P>
<P>
Never seeing "mi se" ware before, the experts, however,
recognized the 13 ware according to inscriptions on a stone tablet
in the palace, which recorded the details of "mi se" ware
presented by an emperor of the Tang Dynasty as gifts.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time people could see what "mi se" looks
like. "Mi se" in Chinese means a mysterious color.
</P>
<P>
Since the underground palace was enclosed in 874, the experts
say, the "mi se" ware must have been made before that time.
</P>
<P>
The re-dating was part of the result of study on "mi se" ware
in the past decade, during which experts from both at home and
abroad have studied such topics as how "mi se" ware were made and
the development of porcelain-making techniques of the Yue Kiln.

<HEADLINE> Muster Reaches Quarterfinals at Lipton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- King of clay Thomas Muster
proved on Tuesday he could also manage hardcourts. The
second-ranked Austrian marched into last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win
over Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
Winning Lipton would represent a breakthrough for the
29-year-old Muster. All but three of his 43 career titles have
come on clay, saddling him with a reputation as a one-surface
specialist.
</P>
<P>
Muster has played 21 hardcourt matches already this year,
winning 18 for his best start ever on the surface. His only
defeats were to eventual tournament champions -- Jim Courier at
Doha, Sampras at the Australian Open and Michael Chang at Indian
Wells. He beat Ivanisevic to win the Dubai title last month.
</P>
<P>
Muster's opponent in the quarterfinals will be Swede Jonas
Bjorkman, who advanced by beating Australian Mark Philippoussis
6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Pete Sampras, who could meet Muster in Sunday's
final, blitzed Magnus Larsson of Sweden 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, 20-1 this year, has lost just 13 games in his three
matches at Lipton. His quarterfinal opponent will be Hendrik
Dreekmann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
No. 4 seed Goran Ivanisevic, a possible semifinal opponent for
Muster, beat 19-year-old Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4.
Spaniard Sergi Bruguera and Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine also
advanced.
</P>
<P>
In women's play, Monica Seles won her fourth match in five
days, rallying past Irina Spirlea of Romania 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. Her
opponent in the semifinals Thursday will be Austrian Barbara
Paulus, who beat Sandrine Testud of France 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Seles, back from a broken finger, is playing her first
hardcourt tournament since the U.S. Open seven months ago.

MEXICO CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian exports of footwear reached 27.8 million
pairs during the first two months of this year, 17 percent more
than the 23.8 million pairs exported during the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Footwear Industry Association said that export
revenues for the first two months of 1996 were 361.3 million
U.S. dollars as against 231.5 million dollars received in January
and February 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months this year, U.S. imports of
Brazilian-made shoes increased 3.7 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's fiscal deficit could amount to 4.2
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) this year, according
to Deputy Finance Minister Marvin Taylor.
</P>
<P>
A fiscal deficit equal to 3.5 percent of the GDP for this year,
the target set at the end of last year by the Costa Rican
government, will now be difficult to fulfil due to lower receipts
from sales taxes, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February, the fiscal deficit accumulated in this
country was 72 million dollars, a figure which represents an
increase of 7 percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaragua will produce 348,715 tons of sugar during
the 1996-1997 season, an increase of 14 percent over the previous
season, said Noel Chamorro, chairman of the National Committee of
Sugar Producers.
</P>
<P>
Chamorro attributed the increase to the greater efficiency of
Managuan farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader of sugar producers, Nicaragua will
export 41,000 tons of sugar to the United States this year and
136,000 tons to other markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Automobile sales in Mexico will increase at
least 20 percent this year after registering a record increase of
64.2 percent, predicted Mexican market experts.
</P>
<P>
According to these experts, a total of 252,200 automobiles will
be sold in Mexico this year, 26 percent more than in 1996 plus
156,000 truck units, 17 percent more than those sold last year.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile reported a 139-million-dollar trade surplus
in February and a 73-million-dollar surplus for the first two
months of this year, announced the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for February was the result of a
1.32-billion-dollar worth of exports and 1.18 billion dollars
worth of imports, according to a central bank report.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose in February due to a 3.4-percent increase in
overseas copper sales in spite of a drop in the price of that
metal and a drop in the quotations of other products.

MEXICO CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin America over the past few days:
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- The consumption of gasoline for automobiles in
Venezuela decreased last year by 7 percent compared with 1995 and
equivalent to 14,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
With that decrease, the daily consumption dropped to 183,000
barrels per day which represented 51.8 percent of the consumption
of liquid fuels.
</P>
<P>
The lower consumption of gasoline was due to an increase in the
use of gas and to higher fuel prices in 1996.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- The slaughter of beef cattle in Colombia
in 1996 surpassed the 1995 mark by 1.7 percent, rising from
1,644,885 head in 1995 to 1,673,000 head in 1996, according to the
National Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly slaughter in 1995 was 137,074 head of
cattle rising to 139,431 head in 1996. August was the month in
which the largest number of cattle -- 148,372 head were
slaughtered last year.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- The plastics industry in Chile imported 238 million
dollars worth of manufactured products in 1996 which represents an
increase of 14.8 percent compared with the year before.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Plastic Manufacturers in Chile said that
most of the imports were from the United States and cost 65.4
million dollars. Another important source of imports was
Argentina, with 18.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The association said that per-capita consumption rose from
26.09 kilograms in 1995 to 28.97 kilograms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina exported 345,825 tons of cotton
fibers in 1996, a volume which ranked it the fourth supplier of
cotton fibers in the world, informed the Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-1997 season, there were 952,260 hectares of
land planted with cotton, which meant a slight decrease compared
with the previous season.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- On December 31, 1996, Uruguay's international
reserves were 3.8229 billion dollars, an increase of 317.9 million
dollars over the same date last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 31.9 percent corresponded to the private banking
sector, 18.1 percent to the Banco Republica Oriental de Uruguay
and the remaining 50 to Uruguay's central bank.

<HEADLINE> World Economy Growth to Pick Up Modestly in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The World economic growth
is expected to pick up this year and continue to strengthen over
the next few years, a group of economists said today.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 economists from all over the world were attending
a three-day meeting of the Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Short- and
Medium-term Prospects of the World Economy.
</P>
<P>
According to their forecast, the continuing expansion of the
world economy is led by the developing countries, where aggregate
output is seen as increasing by 6 per cent in 1997 and at a
slightly faster pace in 1998. All main developing country areas
are forecast to share in this expansion, with a particularly rapid
rate of increase in Asia.
</P>
<P>
An acceleration in growth is also expected in the more
industrialized groups of developed market economies, although the
average rate of expansion in these countries is likely to remain
slower than in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
They said that this positive outlook for world economic growth
is also reflected in the sustained buoyancy of world trade. While
world trade slowed down in 1996 following two years of extremely
high growth, world trade volumes are now expected to rise rapidly
during 1997 with the recovery of continental Europe.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Forward Proposals for Reforms of Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation Liu Xinsheng here today put forward proposals
for further reforms of a sub-commission of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights after mentioning its recent
improvements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the commission, Liu expressed
hope that more in-depth discussions could be held and more reform
measures be formulated so as to enable the Sub-Commission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to adapt
itself to the new situation and play a more effective role as an
important expert body in the UN human rights system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese proposals are as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. The sub-commission should further avoid political
confrontation and reduce the number of country resolutions.
Experts should strictly abide by their independence and abandon
political bias. It is encouraged to exchange experience and put
forward proposals rather than making accusations.
</P>
<P>
2. The sub-commission should strengthen its function as an
expert and advisory organ devoted to human rights research and
studies. Over the years, the sub-commission has made significant
contributions to international human rights standard-setting. With
regard to the choice of research subjects, the sub-commission
should, in a prudent, objective and pragmatic manner, choose less
and better subjects. Those issues with wide-ranging impact that
have emerged in the new circumstances may be selected and those of
concern to the developing countries yet have not received adequate
attention from the Human Rights Commission should be given
priority. Experts should refrain from selecting subjects at will
just out of his or her personal interest. Some research projects
that have been carried out for many years may be ended as
appropriate and efforts should be made to avoid taking up issues
that mainly fall within the terms of reference of other UN bodies.
</P>
<P>
3. At its 48th session, the sub-commission requested the
Secretary-General to examine the financial and other implications
of organizing its sessions according to each of the three
proposals contained in decision 1996/112. We believe that, if the
sub-commission could effectively limit the time given to NGOs'
statements, avoid duplication of work with the Commission, reduce
the number of agenda items and resolutions, and improve its
efficiency with focus on the discussion of thematic subjects,
there would be no need to prolong its annual sessions.

<HEADLINE> Bush Fulfills Parachute Jump Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- 72-year-old former U.S.
President George Bush parachuted out of an airplane over the
Arizona desert today, fulfilling his promise to himself after Navy
plane was shot down in World War Two.
</P>
<P>
Bush parachuted with eight others including members of the U.S.
Parachute Association and the Army's Golden Knights parachute
team. He jumped out of the civilian plane into a cloudless sky at
3,800 meters over the Army's Yuma Proving Fround.
</P>
<P>
After the successful sky trip, Bush gave onlookers the
thumbs-up signal. "Like that," Bush told them his feelings, decked
out in a red, white and blue jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
Bush last jumped from an airplane in September 1944 when his
torpedo bomber was shot down over an island in the Pacific Ocean
south of Japan. With his plane on fire and severely damaged by
anti-aircraft fire, he flew out over the ocean before he bailed
out and was rescued by a Navy submarine.
</P>
<P>
Bush renewed his pledge to make a parachute jump at a recent
meeting of the U.S. Parachute Association.

President Moi, who arrived here earlier today for the Lome OAU
summit on Wednesday, said that he will present a report on the
Nairobi peace process for Zaire to the special summit to "hand
over the responsibility we have carried before to the UN and the
OAU."

He said this reflected an appeal made by the March 19th
regional summit in Nairobi that all initiatives should be
coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Twelve countries, including Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Cameroun, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, Congo, Ethiopia,
Eritrea and Zaire, were represented at the Nairobi Summit III.

U.N. Secretary-General Koffi Annan and 13 African heads of
states or their representatives arrived here today for tomorrow's
special summit of the OAU with particular reference to the
Zairean crisis.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises on News of Fed Rate Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rallied in New
York Tuesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for
the first time in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of rising rates in the United States, combined
with the persistently uncertain outlook for rates in Japan and
Germany, spurred traders to buy dollars. Higher U.S. rates tend to
bolster the dollar by making assets denominated in dollars more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 123.75 yen, up from 122.91
Monday. The dollar cost 1.6914 marks, up from 1.6881. The pound
cost 1.6184 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6186 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's policy-making committee raised the target for the
federal funds overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.50
percent to combat the threat of higher inflation from a growing
economy.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Monday: 1.4666
Swiss francs, up from 1.4586; 5.7045 French francs, up from 5.6900;
1,693.25 Italian lira, up from 1,688.80; 1.3779 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.3795.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence of U.S. Holds Steady in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Confidence Index of
the U.S. registered 118.5 percent in March, virtually unchanged
from the February reading of 118.9, according to its designer, the
New York-based Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The research group also said today that the Present Situation
Index advanced slightly to 144.1 and continues to run at a 27-year
high. The expectations Index declined by about half a point and
currently stands at 101.4.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some concerns about an economic moderation ahead,
consumer confidence continues to run at relatively high levels,"
said Lynn Franco, Associate Director of the Board's Consumer
Research Center. "The message from consumers is that both business
and employment conditions will remain upbeat through the spring
and summer."
</P>
<P>
The researchers also reported that only 5.8 percent of American
consumers look for the economy to cool off significantly during
the next six months, down from 6.6 percent in February. More than
15 percent look for business conditions to improve, about the same
figure posted in February.

talks with the rebels of Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Mobutu's spokesman,

</P>
<P>
In a televised announcement, Lumuna said that the committee
will consist of a representative of the president, two
representatives of the parliament of transition, a representative
from the justice power, two representatives from the "political
family" which is in reference to the opposition party and the
presidential party, as well as a representative from the
government of transition.
</P>
<P>
Lumuna also said that Mobutu has asked the parliament of
transition to carry out a "mobilization of the active forces of
the country" to look for ways and means of putting an end to the
war in Zaire and seeking a "national consensus."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Mobutu has taken note of the
resignation of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, and has asked the
country's political class to "propose to him very rapidly a new
prime minister."

<HEADLINE> First Britain, China Science Report Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British government published its
first report today on collaboration between Britain and China on
science, technology and engineering, which highlights the prospect
of great mutual benefit through collaboration.
</P>
<P>
"China has a great tradition of scientific innovation,
stretching back many centuries," said Mr Ian Taylor, British
Minister for Science and Technology, when he launched the report.
</P>
<P>
"The report sets out practical recommendations to help UK and
Chinese researchers to work together," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The deep understanding between UK and China will broaden our
research area, create new opportunities in finding and resolving
problems and make the researches in both countries more
productive," he said to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"For a country like China, science and technology are surely of
vital importance," said Mr Wang Qiliang, minister at the Chinese
Embassy in Britain at the launching reception.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years, the economy (of China) has been
growing at an average annual rate of 12 percent. It goes without
saying that science and technology has played an important role in
our nation's development," Mr Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Great Britain has an international reputation for the quality
of its research and engineering base...therefore I have every
reason to believe that the scientific and technical cooperation
between China and the UK shall have a bright future and great
potentiality."
</P>
<P>
The report named "Collaboration into the 21st Century-- the
UK/Chinese Relationship in Science, Engineering and Technology"
sets out a number of practical recommendations for British
industry, government and academia to increase effective
collaboration with their Chinese counterparts, and offers a
checklist for successful collaboration.

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States is recalling
its ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz from Belarus for consultations
following Minsk's expulsion of an American diplomat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman John Dinger said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has summoned Yalowitz from Minsk to
discuss ways of dealing with the rapidly deteriorating U.S.
relationship with the former Soviet republic.
</P>

Dinger said the Clinton administration is weighing the
possibility of expelling a Belarus diplomat in return for the
Belarussian decision to expel Serge Alexandrov, first secretary at
the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Alexandrov was detained by Belarussian police Sunday during an
anti-government march. Belarus accused Alexandrov of being a U.S.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Raises Short-term Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
raised short-term interest rates today in a preventive way to curb
the inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed announced that its policy-maker, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), voted to increase the federal fund rate,
the interest that banks charge each other for the overnight loans,
from 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was no change today in the discount rate, which the Fed
charges on its own loans. It stands at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the U.S. Fed to increase the
short-term interest rate since February 1, 1995. The rate has been
unchanged for a year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement explaining its reasoning, the FOMC said the
interest-rate increase "is viewed as a prudent step that affords
greater assurance of prolonging the current economic expansion by
sustaining the existing low inflation environment."
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the last several years has reinforced the
conviction that low inflation is essential to realizing the
economy's fullest growth potential," it said.
</P>
<P>
Today's move was expected to result in an increase in the prime
rate charged banks' best business customers, from 8.25 percent to
8.5 percent. Rates charged millions of consumers and businesses
are linked to the prime.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed increased the short-term interest rate at a time
when the inflation rate in the U.S. is actually lower so far this
year: 2.3 percent for January and February compared with 3.3
percent for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Fed is acting pre-emptively, hoping to
prevent any increase in inflation before it occurs.
</P>
<P>
They had widely anticipated the rate increase, based on Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent public comments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed first tried the pre-emptive approach three years
ago. Starting in February 1994, it doubled the overnight interbank
rate from 3 percent to 6 percent, in seven steps over a 12-month
period.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States
are seeking to put an end to Zaire's civil war, French Defense
Minister Charles Millon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a common U.S.-French approach as far as trying to
reach peace and achieve a positive change, change toward stability
in Zaire," he said before meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Millon is in Washington for talks with Cohen on a number of
issues, including Zaire, which has been torn by the civil war for
five months.
</P>
<P>
Millon said the United States and France are coordinating their
diplomacy so that Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel
leader Laurent Kabila can "reach an agreement on a government that
will satisfy what the people expect from it."
</P>
<P>
Cohen did not reply directly when asked if the United States
and other countrit on Monday sent a
letter to Mobutu urging him to seek a ceasefire and establish a
negotiating team or designate a person who can engage in
negotiations on behalf of the Zaire government, the State
Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's rebel forces have seized about a quarter of Zaire's
territory since they took up guns against the Zairian government
last October.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, fight are building up,
both Mobutu and rebel leader Kibali have kept silent over what to
do next.

<HEADLINE> German FM Arrives in Ankara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel arrived here tonight for a two-day visit for discussions
with Turkish leaders on Turkey's bid for its full European Union
(EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Ankara, Kinkel, accompanied by a group of
German businessmen, will also exchange views with Turkish leaders
on issues of common concern, including economic cooperation as
well as the matter of Turks living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Ankara will ask the German foreign
minister to explain what they called Germany's indifferent
attitude towards Turkey's bid for full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Britain, France and the Netherlands, Germany has been
reportedly reticent on Turkey's intergration with Europe,
claiming that Turkey's bid should be kept aside until its human
rights record is improved and the appropriate solutions are
found to the Cyprus and Kurdish problems.
</P>
<P>
Although some key EU foreign ministers made it clear that
Turkey should be allowed to participate in the " European
Conference," which is seen as a kind of "waiting room" for EU
candidates, Kinkel still insisted that there was "nothing
certain" on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was greatly angered by a March 4 statement by the EU
Christian Democrats which called Turkey's membership application
unacceptable due to its religious culture.
</P>
<P>
Ankara vowed to veto the NATO expansion process if its full
EU membership bid failed, claiming that these two processes were
directly linked, which was termed as "blackmail" by Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the tension between the EU and Ankara, the EU
foreign ministers met in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, on March 16
and issued a statement saying Turkey will be treated the same
way as other states seeking accession into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel is expected to discuss the measures to expand economic
cooperation between Germany and Turkey during his talks with
Turkish high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
The issue of two million Turks living in Germany will also be
on the agenda, especially their right to vote in local elections
and new visa requirements for children under the age of 16.

SARAJEVO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft from Munich landed
at the Sarajevo airport on Tuesday afternoon, carrying the first
group of Bosnian refugees forced to leave Germany.
</P>
<P>
The group included 47 refugees, who were mostly former
residents on the territories of the Bosnian Federation and also a
few living in the Serb-controlled areas before the war, local
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The plane also carried eight refugees who were expelled after
they were found guilty and were escorted all the way by German
police to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Germany has sheltered 320,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia
and has made it clear that most of them should be sent back by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the Bosnian government has complained that Germany has been
too haste to repatriate refugees since their houses were destroyed
in the war or their returns are still blocked by local
governments.
</P>
<P>
The first group of returnees would be accommodated in a
makeshift camp or stay with friends and relatives, according local
press.

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 percent of people in the
candidate countries for European Union membership see their future
increasingly linked with Europe while only less than 20 percent
favor closer ties with the United States, a survey showed here
today.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the Baltics, all countries polled show
majorities in favor of EU membership, says the survey, conducted
recently by the EU in central and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of Romanian people and 70 percent of
Polish citizens are willing to have more to do with the EU. The
percentages of the two countries in this regard lead the list in
the survey.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that decision-makers are generally much
more positive about the EU than the general public.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the overall situation, 43 percent of people in
the candidate countries believe that their country is going in the
right direction, which is a six percent increase from last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France, US Jointly Appeal for Emergency Talks in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States have
launched a joint appeal for emergency talks between the warring
sides of Zaire "to put an end to the conflict" in the country,
reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The text of the appeal -- written in French and English -- was
first sent to Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Pannou Monday by the
French and U.S. embassies in Lome, and has been distributed to
about 20 African countries on the eve of a summit on Zaire to be
held Wednesday in the Togolese capital by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
France and the United States affirmed their "strong support"
for the peace efforts being made by the United Nations and OAU
envoy for the Great Lakes region Mohammed Sahnoun for "a solution
which includes at the same time stop of hostilities and (holding
of) political dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The two countries also said that the appeal by Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko to form a national council -- or
transitional legislature -- is "a positive step," but regretted
that Mobutu has not made a declaration showing his willingness to
start talks with the rebels of Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We think that a declaration without ambiguity is necessary so
as to start the talks," said the appeal, adding that France and
the United States are also contacting the rebels to "obtain in
return a positive complementary gesture."
</P>
<P>
The United States denied Monday an announcement by France that
Paris and Washington were working together to press for a
cease-fire in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a Western diplomat in Lome as saying that there
could have been a misunderstanding between France and the United
States over the meanings of "joint step" and "common step."
</P>

Both France and the United States have sent their special
envoys, Michel Dupuch and Howard Wolpe, to Lome to attend the OAU

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Refutes Claims on Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Defence Industries
(ZDI) today refuted claims it had lost out on lucrative UN
tenders to supply goods, saying it has instead just won a 55,000
US Dollar contract to supply civilian and sporting ammunition to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions after a visit of the ZDI complex by 15
defence attaches, representatives of non-governmental
organisations and journalists, General Manager Tshinga Dube
denied allegations the ZDI had lost lucrative international
tenders because the country was said to be still manufacturing
and exporting anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Dube said the ZDI was now diversifying into the manufacture of
civilian and sporting ammunition.
</P>
<P>
''We have never, never manufacture anti-personnel landmines
for use in Zimbabwe or for export,'' said Dube. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Supports African Rapid Reaction Plan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa saw the
urgency of forming an African rapid reaction capacity which had
been highlighted by visiting United Nations Refugee Chief Sadako
Ogata, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said today.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the plan would be to demobilize and separate
armed elements in conflict-ridden areas in the continent, South
African Press Association quoted Pahad as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to fast-track our preparedness
for it," Pahad told reporters after meeting with Ogata in Cape
Town, the legislative capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The formation of such a capacity would however be discussed
within the framework of the Organization of African Unity, the
deputy minister added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ogata blamed the reluctance and lack of preparedness
of the international community to respond to conflicts in Africa.
She told reporters that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had
been left alone to deal with refugee problems in strife-torn
areas.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this at a price of putting our staff to serious
risk. The reluctance of the international community to dispatch
military assistance to these areas really puts us in a difficult
position," Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
Had there been international military capacity the situation,
such as in Zaire, would not have reached the position it had in
the last few weeks, She added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Political parties should
rise above their differences in bringing about a better life for
all South Africans, Acting President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said
today.
</P>
<P>
During his first debate in the National Assembly on the
1997/98 budget, unveiled by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel on
March 12, Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom Party leader and Home
Affairs Minister, renewed his commitment to national
reconciliation, saying it was time for "gloves to come off" in
the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law must reign supreme and above party
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the budget, Buthelezi said he had worked
with Manuel and the rest of the cabinet in drawing up the budget,
and had "nothing to criticise in it".
</P>
<P>
However, national efforts were needed to address the issues of
privatisation, further relaxation of foreign exchange controls
and unemployment, said Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
Privatisation, among others, was necessary to decrease debt
and improve efficiency, he added.

<HEADLINE> DANIDA to Assist Mwanza of Tanzania in Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Danish International
Development Agnecy (DANIDA) has promised to offer 4.4 billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 7.3 million US Dollars) for squater settlement
upgrading in Mwanza, Northwestern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
John Mayunga, the Municipal Director, told reportes in the town of
Mwanza today that negotiations between the town authority
and a DANIDA delegation have already been held, and what is
remaining is the implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News, Mayunga said the fund
will be provided into four phases, the first of which will cover
road construction in squatter settlement especially in
mountainous areas, adding that according to tentative project
proposals about 1.24 billion T.Shs. (about 2 million Dollars)
will be spent in this phase.
</P>
<P>
The municipal director said the other part of the fund would be
used for hygiene improvement and providing public utility to the area.
</P>
<P>
He said at present most squatter settlement in Mwanza
are lacking permanent swage disposal system and solid waste
management, the situation which contributes to higher percentage of
polluting Lake Victoria, particularly during rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the municipal director said that the fund was part
of the implementation of the resolution of the Agenda 21, adopted
at the 1992 United Unition Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio de Jenairo.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Camerounian Minister of
Public Health Titus Edzoa urged the health professionals to
reflect on the ways and means which can help in the solid
implantation of health insurance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Titus Edzoa was speaking today in Yaounde while opening the
Ninth National Medical Conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 participants attended the annual event. For
three days, health professionals will focus their discussions on
health insurance in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
Edzoa said introduction of the health insurance in Cameroun is
a positive step towards achieving "health for all about the year
2000."
</P>
<P>
Health professional were urged to restrain themselves to their
respective areas of competence so as to upgrade the standards of
health care in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Cameroun, health insurance is not popular yet. Only some
companies, groups and families enjoy health insurance. According
to the health experts, introduction of health insurance in the
country could go a long way to help Camerounians treat themselves
without immediate payments.

<HEADLINE> UK Economists Foresee Huge Hole in Labor's Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Labor government would have to
raise 15 billion pounds (24 billion US dollars) more in taxes than
the Tories, if it gets to power in the coming election, according
to an independent City think-tank.
</P>
<P>
The increase, equivalent of putting 8 percent on the standard
rate of income tax, has been forecast by the Center for Economics
and Business Research.
</P>
<P>
Its economists based their prediction on Labor's published
policies as well as assumptions about how they would be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
They warned that Labor's plans "will probably damage growth and
investment." Chief Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave said the
report confirmed that "Labor's plans would mean higher spending
and higher taxes."
</P>
<P>
"An increase in public spending on this kind of scale would be
equivalent to an extra 650 pounds (1,040 dollars) a year in tax
for every household," he added.
</P>
<P>
The report gave a boost to Tories as Prime Minister John Major
and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke are trying to focus attention on
their economic successes in the election campaign now under way.
</P>
<P>
The economists made a series of policy assumptions for a Labor
government, including a windfall tax raising 7 billion pounds
(11.2 billion dollars), the introduction of a national minimum
wage of 3.50 pounds (5.60 dollars) an hour, Britain signing up to
the European Social Chapter and a 2 billion pound (3.2 billion
dollar) welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
The assessments were based on public commitments made by Labor
leader Tony Blair, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown and other Shadow
Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that by 2001, Labor will have to spend and
tax by 15 billion pounds (24 billion dollars) more than the
Tories.
</P>
<P>
The City experts predicted that while the windfall tax will
raise substantial revenue, tax increases will be necessary to pay
for Labor's program.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "The effects of higher taxes on dividends, on
the higher paid and on privatized utilities will probably damage
growth and investment but the main impacts on growth of measures
of this kind tend to emerge between five and 10 years after they
are put into effect."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the dim prospects, Waldegrave said, "At a time
when Britain is booming and we are facing the best economic
prospects for 30 years, we must not allow Labor to blow it."

<HEADLINE> Kohl: Treaty of Rome, Key Element for Peace in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Marking the 40th anniversary of the
Treaty of Rome that founded the European Community, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that the treaty is a decisive
element for safeguarding peace and overcoming division in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Without the Treaty of Rome, it would be impossible for Europe
to be a continent of peace and freedom in the 21st century," Kohl
declared in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Kohl said that European integration
should be further deepened. Above all, he said, the efficiency and
democracy of the European Union should be improved and its
"capability to act" in the areas of common foreign and security
policies, and in combating of international crimes should be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
However, that does not mean that Europe will become a
centralized state, Kohl said, adding that national and regional
traditions should be respected and cultural variety should be
cultivated.
</P>
<P>
Apart from EU integration, the German chancellor stressed the
necessity of EU enlargement to include eastern and southeastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"Without an enlargement towards the east and southeast, the EU
will remain a torso," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
On the planned single European currency -- the euro, Kohl
reiterated the importance of strict adherence to the qualifying
criteria laid out in the EU Maastricht Treaty as well as to the
January 1999 start-up date.
</P>
<P>
"The strong EU we want would be incomplete without a stable
common currency," Kohl said.

<HEADLINE> New UAE Cabinet Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABIE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A new cabinet has been formed
in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under the premiership of Sheikh
Maktoum Bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth cabinet since the founding of the UAE in
December 2, 1971.
</P>
<P>
Maktoum tendered the resignation of his former cabinet on
March 16 and was charged the same day by President al-Nahyan to
form the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet, which was formed according to federal decree
N0. 67 for the year 1997 issued by UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin
Sultan al-Nahyan today, embraces 23 members, of whom 21 are
cabinet ministers. Eight new ministers have been appointed.
</P>
<P>
In the new formation, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayid Al Nahyan became
Minister of Information and Culture after having been the
undersecretary for the ministry, and the appointment of Obeid Bin
Seif Al Nasseri as Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, a
post which has been vacant.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ministry of Education has been merged together
with the Ministry of Youth and Sports under the name of ministry
of education and youth, while the Ministry of Justice and
Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Waqfs (Endowments) have been
amalgamated to have become the Ministry of Justice, Islamic
Affairs and Waqfs.
</P>
<P>
Though eight new ministers have joined the newly-formed
cabinet, ministers in charge of key portfolios such as defense,
foreign affairs and the interior have not changed. Likewise,
Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan will maintain his post as
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Holding several principal posts besides the premier, the
56-year-old Maktoum is a member of the UAE Federal National
Council, Vice-President of the country and ruler of the
Emirate of Dubai, the second biggest of the seven emirates of
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The former cabinet was established on November 20, 1990,
comprising 24 cabinet members. But the posts of ministers of
health, transport, petroleum and mineral wealth had long been
vacant.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Important Achievement in Angola's Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Jonas Savimbi, the leader of
Angola's former rebel UNITA, has promised that all the members of
parliament and would-be government officials of the opposition
will arrive in the capital of Angola by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi made the promise to United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in the central Angolan city of Bailundo, where the
UNITA headquarters is, yesterday during their 45-minute talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan was satisfied with Savimbi's promise. He said: "This is
a decisive step in the peace process in Angola."
</P>
<P>
Since the two warring sides of Angola signed a peace accord in
Lusaka, Zambia, on November 20, l994, progress has been made in
the release of prisoners of war, the assembly of soldiers and the
formation of a unified army. On December 20 last year, nine UNITA
generals were enroled into the unified army, making a
breakthrough in solving the military problems.
</P>
<P>
After the military problems had been resolved basically, the
Angolan government and UNITA began to tackle the major political
problems, namely the estalishment of local governments in
UNITA-controled areas, the inauguration of UNITA members of
parliament, the formation of a government of national unity, and
the position of UNITA leader Savimba in the postwar period. Then,
an inspiring situation had appeared in the peace process of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, things did not develop according to the will of the
people. Because of the absence of UNITA members of parliament and
would-be government officials, the inauguration of the new
parliament and the government of national unity, initially
scheduled respectively for January 18 and 25 this year, had been
put off time and again.
</P>
<P>
UNITA explained that the purpose of its members of parliament
and would-be government officials to go to the capital is not to
attend the inauguration of the new parliament and the government
of national unity, but to negotiate with the current government
on the administrative program of the new government.
</P>
<P>
UNITA said the two sides should discuss the administrative
program of the government of national unity and the position of
its leader in the postwar period before the inauguration of the
new parliament and government, while the Angolan government said
the administrative program should be discussed by parliament
members instead of by the two parties and therefore UNITA members
of parliament should be sworn in to office first.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the government and UNITA had created an
obstacle to the peace process of Angola.

<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- To remove the obstacle, UN
Special Envoy to Angola Blondin Beye started to mediate between
the two sides. Thanks to his efforts, more than 30 UNITA members
of parliament arrived in the capital of Luanda on March 17. And
on March 21, the two sides reached agreement on Savimbi's
position in the post-war period -- they agreed that Savimbi is
the "leader of the major opposition in Angola". The agreement
will be submitted to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Afterwords, the Angolan government made another concession. It
agreed to UNITA's proposal that the administrative program be
discussed by the two sides before the inauguration of the
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Although the government and UNITA reached agreements on
Savimbi's position in the postwar period and the discussion of
the administrative program, some of UNITA members of parliament
and would-be government officials have not arrived in the
capital, impeding progress of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan went to the central Angolan
city of Bailundo yesterday to meet with UNITA leader Savimbi and
try to persuade him to send to Luanda the UNITA members of
parliament and would-be government officials who are still in
Bailundo. And, Annan succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that as UNITA members of parliament
arrive in Luanda soon, the government of national unity will be
inaugurated in the near future, heralding the end of the
two-year-old peace process in the southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Non-Involvement of Angola in Zairean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here today that no evidence has been detected to
prove Angola's involvement in the Zairean civil war.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was winding up his four-day Angolan tour, told a
press conference in capital Luanda that President Eduardo Dos
Santos had given him a promise of non-involvement in the Zairean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the Zairean crisis should be solved
on the basis of the five-point U.N. peace plan which includes an
immediate ceasefire and peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan also expressed satisfaction over the results of his
Angola tour, calling for Angolans to step up their peace efforts
and seek an early formation of the national unity government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief had held talks with both President Dos Santos
and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the former rebel movement, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
during his visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Annan also appealed to the international community for
providing 228.4 million U.S. Dollars of aid to help Angolans
rebuild their country. More than 100,000 demobilized soldiers and
their 340,000 family members need humanitarian assistance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan left Luanda for Lome, capital of Togo, to attend the
African heads of state summit meeting on the Zairean crisis,
organized by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
scheduled to begin on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Vows to Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The new leadership of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone has assured the
government that all impediments to the full implementation of the
Abidjan Peace Accord will be removed.
</P>
<P>
With the assurance, according to a statement issued here by
the Sierra Leonean High Commission here today, the Sierra Leonean
government is actively consulting with leaders of the sub-region
on the collective need to manage and move forward the stalled
peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement welcomed the assurance by the new RUF leadership
to remove all the obstacles placed in the way of lasting peace by
its deposed leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
It especially condemned Sankoh for "the delay in the
appointment of the joint monitoring group and the demobilization
and rehabilitation committee which should carry out the
encampment and disarmament of RUG combatants."
</P>
<P>
"Ceasefire violations by the RUF combatants have completely
ceased since the change of leadership was announced," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This development, seen alongside the declared commitment of
the new leadership of the RUF, indicates brighter prospects for
the peace process," it added.
</P>
<P>
The accord to end Sierra Leone's six-year civil war was signed
in Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire, on November 30, 1996. The peace
process is said to come to a standstill due to the obstacles set
by Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
In its statement earlier this month announcing the deposition
of Sankoh as its leader, RUF's new leadership called for the
support of the international community for relief supply to
facilitate the rehabilitation of displaced civilians and
combatants in the areas affected by the war.

Observers Mission in Liberia, originally scheduled to expire this
month, is expected to be extended until after the May 30
elections, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended a three-month extension in a report delivered to the
U.N. Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The extension will enable the observers to monitor Liberia's
general elections together with the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to what has been agreed, the elections will be
organized by an independent 10-member electoral commission, with
one member each from the OAU, ECOWAS and the U.N. who have no
voting power.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas much remains to be done and it is essential to remain
alert to the dangers that still persist, the prospects for peace
in Liberia now seem to be more promising than at any time since
the start of the civil war," the Secretary-General was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General also recommended the strengthening of
the electoral unit of the observer mission, which currently has
only one person, and the recruitment of 200 additional personnel
to observe the polling and counting of votes.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese flotilla, winding
up a historic five-day visit in the continental United States,
weighed anchor here this morning and proceeded for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the departure ceremony, Vice Admiral Brent Bennitt,
commander of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Air Force, said that the
Chinese flotilla has represented the Chinese navy and nation "with
honor, pride and professionalism."
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit "marks the beginning of a new era that
is sure to last for many decades -- an era of understanding,
cooperation and respect between our navies, an era where our doors
are open in friendship, offering us a clear path to a bright and
successful future between our peoples."
</P>
<P>
Vice Admiral Wang Yongguo, commander of the flotilla and the
Chinese navy South China Sea Fleet, said at the ceremony that the
flotilla's visit to Hawaii and San Diego has added a new chapter
in the annals of friendly exchanges between the two countries, two
armed forces and especially the two navies.
</P>
<P>
"It is of and has great and far-reaching significance and
influence and will leave the Chinese and American officers and
sailors unforgettable memories," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii and San Diego, he said, he and Chinese navy Deputy
Commander Vice Admiral He Pengfei have made many friends among the
senior officers of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and the meetings with
them have increased mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Language has not been a barrier in the exchange between
officers and sailors of the two navies, Wang said, adding that
friendship has been based on sincerity.
</P>
<P>
He wished that the friendship between the two peoples, armed
forces and navies will flow forever like the Yangtze and the
Mississippi, and the Pacific will enjoy real peace in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Bennitt presented Wang with an album with photos of the
flotilla's visit in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, a total of 50,000 people visited the
Chinese naval ships. Officers and sailors of both navies made
visits to each other's vessels and attended get-togethers. The
Chinese sailors were also honored at two receptions hosted by the
Chinese community in San Diego and Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Congolese President Rejects Accusation of Zairean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Congolese President Pascal Lissouba
today rejected an accusation by Zairean rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila that the deployment of 1,000 Western troops
in Brazzaville makes up "a threat to the peace" in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French television channel France Info,
Lissouba said that the Western troops are deployed on Congolese,
not Zairean, territory.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 soldiers from the United States, France, Belgium
and Britain are deployed in Brazzaville, which is separated from
the Zairean capital Kinshasa by the River Zaire, in preparation
for a possible evacuation of some 3,000 Western nationals from
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean rebel leader Kabila described the action by Western
countries as "a threat to the peace" and an "intimidation of
neo-colonial type" against Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The Congo and Brazzaville are not an integral part of
Zaire.... Even if they (the Western troops) are at the door of
Zaire, they are in Congo," said Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
On the declarations made by Kabila that the rebels will not
accept a ceasefire until Zaire is "liberated up to the sea,"
Lissouba said, "I understand this logic, but it is far from that
of the international moral and it is far from being like a leader
who says that he wants peace in his country."

<HEADLINE> GCC Calls for International Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states today called on the international community
to exert pressure on Israel to force it to implement all relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem and other occupied
Arab territories, reports reaching here from Riyadh said.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber
al-Thani made the call at the opening ceremony of the 62nd GCC
foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this evening.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad said only the international pressure would help
overcome violence and tension and secure the resumption of the
peace process on all tracks in the Middle East, Kuwait News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad said that the developments in the occupied Arab
lands should be addressed, especially in view of Israel's decision
to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli bulldozers undermined the peace process,
violated international resolutions, the principles agreed on in
Madrid's peace conference and agreement signed between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of Jewish settlement would be one of
the major items on the agenda of the two-day meeting, which
started this evening.
</P>
<P>
The issue of peace process and Arab-Israeli economic relations
would also be discussed thoroughly during the meeting, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also deal with relations with Iran in
light of the recent Gulf tour by the Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Israel's settlement construction in East Jerusalem triggered a
strong anger among the Islamic countries and wide criticism from
the international community.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to defuse the anger, Israel announced a plan to
bull back troops from 9 percent of the rural areas of the West
Bank, a matter that could only make things more complicated
because the announced withdrawal was less than that agreed upon
in accords between Israel and the Palestinians, Sheikh Hamad
said.
</P>
<P>
GCC is a regional political and economic organization composed
of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar
and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Iraqi Joint Economic Commission to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish-Iraqi Joint Economic
Commission is to meet in Baghdad at the end of this month to
discuss measures to expand trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Iraqi officials will exchange views on the current
small trade volume despite the implementation of an U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food agreement, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil in a six-month period to buy food and
other necessities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is disappointed at its trade with Iraq for it has only
sold 25 million dollars worth of goods to the latter so far.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials attributed the small trade volume to the fact
that the prices of Turkish goods were not competitive, but
Turkish businessmen claimed that the real cause was the wrong
policy Ankara pursued toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly suffered huge economic losses from the
U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Baghdad since 1991. The loss is
estimated at 25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier media reports, Turkey has sent the
first shipment of humanitarian supplies to Iraq under the
U.N. supervision, and part of the planned 10,000 tonnes of edible
oil has been transported to Iraq via Habur on the Iraqi-Turkish
border.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen: Jiang Zemin to visit Moscow Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
expected to visit Moscow in April and to hold talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference, which was held by Qian Qichen and
Evgeny Primakov, the Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers, after
their talks, Qian Qichen said "his visit to Moscow is aimed at the
preparations for the Chinese-Russian summit, scheduled for next
month."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed satisfaction with the results of his talks with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Russian counterpart Evgeny
Primakov. He said that the relations between China and Russia had
been successfully developed after president Boris Yeltsin paid an
official visit to China last April, when China, Russia,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan reached an agreement on
peace and trust in military field.
</P>
<P>
During the forthcoming summit between Chinese President Jian
Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Qian Qichen added, the
two sides will sign an accord on reductions of armed forces in the
border areas of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said such an agreement has already been signed by the
foreign ministers of the five states.
</P>
<P>
He believed that "the two things -- the creation of strategic
partnership between China and Russia and reductions of armed
forces in the border areas of the countries concerned -- would put
forward a new concept that is different from the thought of "cold
war", and exert a deep influence in Asia and Pacific areas, as
well as the entire world."
</P>
<P>
At the press conference Primakov expressed satisfaction with
the talks with Qian Qichen and said that the preparations for the
upcoming Russian-Chinese summit have been basically completed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the summit is "of historic significance and
is a milestone in the relations between Russia and China," hoping
that "it would bring a lot of things."
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that after the "cold war" the international
society is creating a new international order. A multipolar world
is forming and it should be formed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides agreed that in the multipolar world
one polar is Russia and the other is China.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China have formulated the policy of partnership on
the base of mutual trust and equality, and "we will continue to
pursue the policy," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Minister meanwhile emphasized that the
strategic partnership with China has not been created against the
third country. "We intend to stabilize the international situation
and to make the relationship of the countries equal", Primakov
noted.
</P>
<P>
On the possible reached agreement on reductions of armed forces
in the border areas the Russian minister said "when the agreement
was signed, we may think it sets up a model of stabilization in
Asia and Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
Asked about what are the common views between the Chinese and
Russian sides in the political field, Qian Qichen said that China
and Russia share a very long boundary line and have contacts of
long history. The history facts have proved that maintaining of
the relations of equality, mutual benefit and cooperation between
Russia and China will be favorable to both countries, and, in
return,if the two countries make confrontation, it would damage
the interests of both of them.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said that the two sides share many opinions in
creation of the new international order and world situation after
the "cold war".
</P>
<P>
Replying to the question in which economic and trade field the
two countries have the largest potential of cooperation, Qian
Qichen, also the Chinese Vice Prime Minister, noted China and
Russia have very good prospects in economic and trade cooperations
because of their superiority in physical geography.
</P>
<P>
At present the volume of the bilateral trade amount to seven
billions of U.S. dollars, Qian Qichen said, and "we plan to raise
the amount to 20 billions of U.S. dollars by the end of the year
2000."
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen today also had talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and visited the tomb of unknown soldiers in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Crackdown on Health Care Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday sent Congress a bill that would stiffen punishment for
those who pilfer from Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
The bill, made public at the White House today, includes new
measures to crack down on fraud and abuse in the government health
care programs. Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles, who has tried
similar measures in Florida, joined Clinton for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said abuse of the system amounts to a "fraud tax that
falls on all our taxpayers," mostly the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate fraud that robs taxpayers even as it harms
those of us to whom we owe a great duty," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The bill, expected to go to Congress after its Easter recess,
would allow the secretary of health and human services to forbid a
convicted felon from participating in Medicare or Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
Current law only allows a ban on people convicted of health
care-related felonies.
</P>
<P>
Another provision would require health care providers to
register their social security numbers, making it easier for HHS
and state Medicaid regulators to track offenders, prevent them
from moving from state to state and continue to commit fraud.
</P>
<P>
The bill also would give the Health and Human Services
Department broader sanction authority.
</P>
<P>
Medicaid is the state-administered program for the poor.
Medicare is federally run and caters to older and disabled
Americans.
