<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Running battles between students
of University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and heavily armed riot police
continued Friday at the campus, with the students trying to force
their way out into the Harare city center.
</P>
<P>
The students who gathered in groups said they had wished to
stage a peaceful demonstration into the capital in solidarity for
one student who was shot and seriously injured by a police
officer during a demonstration on Wednesday, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, armed riot policemen sealed the troubled country's
highest institution of learning to prevent the students from
marching into the city.
</P>
<P>
Other armed riot police also surrounded Africa Unity Square in
the city center near the building of the Ministry of Higher
Education and Technology.
</P>
<P>
"We sense that the students might march into the city today
and there is a possibility of them being violent, that is why we
are here," said a police officer.
</P>
<P>
However, UZ vice-chancellor Graham Hill said the students were
just having skirmishes with the riot police and there were no new
developments yet from Thursday's situation.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations started Wednesday after students objected
to the privatisation of all non-academic activities of the
institution, including the cafeteria system among other problems.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Trade Fair Getting More Overseas Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A businessman from the
Neitherlands ordered several pieces of Chinese-made furniture
today at the 83rd Guangzhou Export Commodity Trade Fair and said
the prices and quality are acceptable, and that the only thing
Chinese exporters could do is increase competitive ability on the
international market by improving quality.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50,000 other people from outside China have visited
China's oldest and largest export trade fair, that's 7 percent
more than for the last fair. This spring fair begins on April 15
and ends on May 30.
</P>
<P>
This shows that foreign businessmen are still interested in the
Chinese market in spite of the feared negative effects of the
financial turmoil in Asia, says Liu Xiangdong, Assistant minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Southeast Asian
countries and the Republic of Korea have increased their viability
on the world market by devaluing their currencies, which has been
seen as a major challenge to Chinese exporters.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from these countries has decreased as
was expected, but what was unexpected is the fact that the number
of businessmen from European, American and African countries has
increased remarkably, according to a fair organizing committee
official.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveils New Economic Stimulus Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government unveiled
Friday a record 16.6 trillion yen (128 billion U.S. dollars)
economic stimulus package covering public works spending, tax
cuts, financial reforms, property market reforms and foreign
assistance to save the country from a recession.
</P>
<P>
"To overcome this severe economic condition and achieve a
strong economic recovery, we need to carry out drastic measures,"
the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The package, with 12.3 trillion yen (about 94.6 billion
dollars) in actual stimulus spending as its centerpiece, is the
largest-ever economic package worked out by the Japanese cabinet
in a bid to pull its economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
The steps were intended "to expand domestic demand, strongly
push economic structural reform and promote disposal of bad
debts," the government said.
</P>
<P>
The package includes four trillion yen (about 30.8 billion
dollars) in income tax cuts over two years and 7.7 trillion yen
(about 59.3 billion dollars) in public works spending.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders applauded the new economic package, but said
it will have at best a temporary impact on the economy as it does
not include permanent income tax cuts.

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- After 20 years of
reforms and opening up, China has basically established a lagal
system and laid a foundation for rule by law among the masses.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lijie, deputy director of the Law Department of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, made a remarks at a
symposium on rule by law held here recently.
</P>
<P>
She said that government departments are gradually shifting
their efforts from micro-economic controls and direct management
to macro-economic controls and indirect management and this means
that they will more rely on economic and legal means than on
administrative means.
</P>
<P>
Huang Huanliang, an official from the Ministry of Land and
Natural Resources, said at the symposium that legalizing
government intervention in the market economy means putting each
administrative office and administrative action of government
intervention in the market economy responsible to the law.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations on the market economy should be perfected
to ensure that administrative behavior has a legal basis, he said.

<HEADLINE> Resignation of Nepali Cabinet Minister Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra has
accepted the resignation of Khum Bahadur Khadka, minister for
forest and soil conservation and supplies on the recommendation of
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, said a notice issued Friday
by the King's Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The notice said the minister resigned due to health reasons and
the prime minister himself has taken over the post. Now Koirala
holds concurrently five posts including that of defense, foreign
affairs and royal palace affairs.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Minister Khadka offered resignation
Thursday, two days after he was inducted into the cabinet, under
the pressure from some MPs of his own Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
As Khadka was home minister under the governments led
respectively by Sher Bahadur Deuba and Surya Bahadur Thapa, he
should be logically responsible for the upsurge of corruption and
smuggling in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most of NC MPs boycotted parliament sessions for a second
straight day Thursday to show their displeasure at the induction
of tainted MPs into the cabinet, The Kathmandu Post said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Industry and Labor Amar Raj Kaini and
Assistant Minister for Women and Social Welfare Kamala Panta, who
were picked up by Koirala on Tuesday in his expansion of the
cabinet, had refused to take the oath of office until Friday.
</P>
<P>
The present government is a minority government of the NC, the
largest party in parliament. Sources said the NC is now
negotiating with the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-ML) over the formation of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Before the formation of a minority government on April 15, the
NC tried to forge an alliance with the CPN-ML but failed.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Banning Direct Marketing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- People involved in the direct
marketing scheme in the Chinese capital have responded calmly to
the State Council's ban on direct sales several days ago.
</P>
<P>
But some sellers gathered in twos and threes in front of the
direct marketing companies, apparently discussing the ban.
</P>
<P>
DishDrop Amway's Beijing Branch reported no returned products
and there wasn't even a drop in the number of buyers, most of whom
said they came to buy the products for their own use.
</P>
<P>
A person in charge of Amway Beijing said that Amway respects
the Chinese government's policy but would not withdraw from
China. But, he said, the company is considering readjusting its
business strategy by using sales methods that "fit in with Chinese
realities".
</P>
<P>
A Beijing commercial administration official said that big-name
direct marketing companies like Amway have business principles and
standard sales methods, but the problem is that some of its
agents' behavior is not that decent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rampant cheating and swindling, the Chinese
government has made all sorts of direct marketing schemes illegal,
including licensed ones like Amway.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Administrative Bureau of Industry and Commerce
officials say they will close down illegal pyramid sales companies
and help those that have licenses to cope with the new conditions.
</P>
<P>
Even though Beijing has regulations on direct marketing, it is
difficult to supervise and there have been reports of misconduct
by sales agents, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing gave licenses to 24 companies in direct marketing last
year and has handled over 100 legal complaints, and handed out
860,000 yuan in fines.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Grateful to All Duma Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sergei Kiriyenko, who was just
approved by the Russian State Duma as prime minister on Friday,
expressed thanks to the deputies who took part in the third vote.
</P>
<P>
He was equally respectful and grateful to the deputies who
voted either "yes" or "no", who took and did not take vote papers,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko asked the deputies to forget in their future work the
emotions that preceded the confirmation vote in the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his candidacy's approval indicated that "neither
we nor you need great upheavals, that both we and you need a great
Russia".
</P>
<P>
He said that his administration will work hard to win the
confidence of the State Duma and all citizens of Russia.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin is "pleased" with the results of the
voting, said Alexander Kotenkov, the president's representative in
the Duma.
</P>
<P>
After the endorsement of Kiriyenko as prime minister, Acting
First Vice Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters that the
approval enabled a normal work of the government, and there was
also a whole possibility to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party Leader Gennady Zyuganov, who firmly rejected
the president's nominee, said the third voting was "unfair." It
was the continuation of the old policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, it should have been an open vote so that
everyone's stand would be clear and visible.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Our Home is Russia movement, Russian ex-premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin welcomed the decision. He said now Russia has
both the government and the State Duma, which is a very positive
factor for the country.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin threw the government and parliament into disarray on
March 23 when he fired the entire cabinet, headed by long-time
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin accused the government
of failing to improve the economy and people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
He then nominated Kiriyenko, a former banker and energy
minister, as prime minister. He said that he was the right man for
the job and will breathe new life into economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
But the deputies in Duma rejected Kiriyenko twice in the past
two weeks by solid margins.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Yeltsin threatened to disband the State Duma, if
the nomination was not approved in the third voting.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Industry Expected To Help China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Du Xunsheng, a State Economic and
Trade Commission official, speaking at a symposium on China's
strategy of developing the multimedia industry, said that China's
electronics market will be worth one trillion yuan by year 2000
and 6 trillion yuan by 2010 and that it will play a key role in
promoting China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will be the largest electronics information
market in the world in the next century and that China's
multimedia market has already entered a stage of rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, China's computer industry has
been expanding at an annual rate of more than 50 percent and China
now has over 20,000 enterprises and institutes in computer
development, production, sales, maintenance and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Chinese government has listed multimedia
technology as a priority project in its technology development
plan and over the past several years, has focused on developing
multimedia chips, VCD machines, and multimedia computers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese information technology companies like Beijing Founder
Electronics Corporation Ltd, China Computer Software and
Technology Service Corporation, and the Legend Group are able to
compete with their international counterparts, and Chinese
computers account for 60 percent of China's market.
</P>
<P>
But China needs to develop its own information industry,
especially the multimedia industry, in order to survive and
prosper in the future world of information technology.
</P>
<P>
China will give priority to a nation-wide multimedia
information network, computer industry bases, the software
industry, smart-card businesses, and computer products and systems
for restructuring traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
Li Guojie, of the National Research Center for Intelligent
Computers, says that Chinese language processing is no longer the
advantage of Chinese IT companies and that Chinese companies have
to use multimedia as the core technology.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was part of the International Multimedia
Technology and Application Exhibition that is being held here from
Thursday to Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Asks Arafat Not to Declare Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
on Friday called on visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not
to declare a Palestinian state in 1999 in a bid to prevent the
Middle East situation from worsening.
</P>
<P>
"The unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state could make
things more critical," said Kinkel at a news conference here after
talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, however, said that he still intended to go ahead with
the plan which he said was justified by the 1994 Oslo peace accord
with Israel, an agreement that paved ways for further talks to
secure the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We must announce that a state will be created and that its
capital will be East Jerusalem," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
failing to live up to his commitments under the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will meet with Netanyahu in London next month when
the two leaders are to hold separate talks with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Arafat said he still had to see what
kind of offers Albright will put on table.
</P>
<P>
The United States is reportedly pressing for a further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel had opposed a 13 percent withdrawal from the occupied
land proposed by Washington, saying that it would just return less
than 10 percent land to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Kinkel, Arafat also called on Europe to
make more peace efforts in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kinkel said Europe would seek to strengthen
cooperations with the U.S. to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also due to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl later
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan is also in Bonn on Friday for
separate talks with German President Roman Herzog, Kohl and Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Both Middle East leaders will attend a ceremony this evening in
the southern city of Baden-Baden where King Hussein will be
honored with the 1998 German media prize for his contributions to
the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Candidates for HK Legislature Election Hit Record Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- There are a total of 167
candidates for the first Legislative Council election of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), hitting the record
number over the previous legislature elections.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by a spokesman for the Constitutional
Affairs Bureau at a press conference here shortly after a two-week
long candidates nomination for the May legislature election ended
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results released by the Registration
Electoral Office, the total number of nomination papers received
totals 120, involving 167 candidates after deducting seven
withdrawals and one invalid nomination.
</P>
<P>
Of the total candidates, 81 come from the geographical
constituencies, 61 from the functional constituencies, and 25 from
the Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he was pleased with the record number of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly encouraging that 81 candidates from 34
lists will contest in the geographical elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the candidates come from all walks of the
community, the spokesman said: "we welcome this. It gives voters
more choice. It also underscores widespread support for the
election."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Electoral Affairs Commission is finalizing the
necessary practical arrangements for the election.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the election will be conducted in an
open and fair manner, and the legislature so returned will be
credible and representative," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also step up publicity in the next few
weeks in accordance with the publicity plan to urge all eligible
voters to cast their votes on May 24, he added.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's press conference, the spokesman, in a reply to
questions on the qualification to be nominated as a candidate for
the Legislative Council election, repeatedly stressed that as
stipulated clearly in the Legislative Council Ordinance, except
for the 12 designated functional constituencies, a candidate must
be a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of Hong Kong with
no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
In the case of a candidate who has the right of abode in a
foreign country, this would require the completion of the process
of his giving up the right of abode of that country before the
close of nomination, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council election will produce all the 60
members with 20 to be returned from geographical constituencies
through direct election, 30 from functional constituencies and 10
from an 800-strong Election Committee.

<HEADLINE> EU Voices Concern over Renewed Violence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Friday
expressed grave concern over the renewed violence in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, appealing for "meanful dialogue" between the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country is the
current EU president, said in a statement on behalf of the
15-nation bloc: "We are deeply concerned by the reports of renewed
violence in Kosovo and in particular of increasing activity by the
Yugoslav army."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Serbian security forces killed 22
guerilla infiltrators from neighboring Albania over the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that the EU has consistently condemned the violence
by the security forces as well as the use of terrorism to achieve
political change.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is a political process and a start of a
meaningful dialogue, without preconditions, between the
authorities in Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership," Cook
added in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cook also urged the authorities in Belgrade and the leadership
of the Kosovo Albanian community to "do all in their power to
ensure that calm is restored and to assume their responsibility to
resolve by peaceful means the problems between them."

<HEADLINE> Positive Signs Emerged in CPC, CPJ Ties: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua)-- Some positive signs have emerged in
the relations between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
Communist Party of Japan (CPJ).
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao said this at a press
conference here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, said that the two parties had a
long-time contact in the past, but it was suspended later on.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that so long as the two parties proceed from the
overall situation of Sino-Japanese friendship and adhere to the
principles of independence, equality, mutual respect and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, it is possible
to realize the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the Sino-American and Sino-Japanese
relations, Hu said the U.S. is the largest developed country while
China is the largest developing country in the world. Anyone who
favors world peace, stability and development will support the
improvement of Sino-American relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people who care about peace and stability in Asia
and the world will also support the further development of
Sino-Japanese relations due to the influential status of the two
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of Sino-American, Sino-Japanese and
even Japan-American ties should not be directed at a third party,
Hu said, adding that only with this point of view could all
parties join hands to build a new century of peace, stability,
prosperity and progress.

<HEADLINE> Euro Clears Final Hurdle in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The upper house of the German
parliament Friday followed a similar move at the lower house a day
earlier by giving overwhelming support for the single European
currency euro, clearing the way for Germany to join the euro's
launch in January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious currency integration project of the European
Union was approved almost unanimously by the Bundesrat, which
represents Germany's 16 federal states, with the only abstention
coming from the eastern German state of Saxony.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, also
gave the green light to the euro project with a vote of 575 to 35.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's votes mean that Germany will be able to join
ten other EU states to start the new currency on January 1, 1999,
if their membership could be formally confirmed at a EU summit
meeting in Brussels early May.
</P>
<P>
Despite the broad political support, opinion polls show that
between 50 to 70 percent of the German public are still dismayed
about abandoning their rock-hard German mark in favor of the still
untested euro.
</P>
<P>
Created exactly 50 years ago, the mark has been cherished by
Germans as the symbol for the country's economic miracle in the
post-war era and a safeguard against skyrocketing inflations that
robbed their savings early this century.
</P>
<P>
German government officials, however, pledge that the euro is
set to be as stable as the mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Cherelene Barshefsky said at a press conference here this evening
that she welcomes China's new tariff-cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
The proposals China put forward at the seventh session
of the World Trade Organization China Working Group Meeting
at Geneva enearly April are "helpful", she said.
</P>
<P>
She also spoke about the "broad, in-depth and very
constructive" talks she had with Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng and State Councilor Wu Yi,
saying they have put negotiation back on track.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are designed to make progress on the WTO
negotiations as directed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin when the two leaders met in
Vancouver last November.
</P>
<P>
Those discussions included industrial and agricultural tariffs;
non-tariff measures, like quotas and licences; professional
services like accounting and legal services; wholesale and retail
distribution; telecommunications; and banking, securities, and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Acceptance in the WTO is a very complex process, she said, but
added that she is quite pleased with the overall tone and
seriousness displayed by her Chinese colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were "quite in-depth" and they were meant to
determine how best to proceed with negotiations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Her discussion with senior Chinese officials covered
agriculture, intellectual property rights, and the recent ban on
direct sales.
</P>
<P>
She said that her agriculture negotiator will be coming here in
about two weeks to discuss a range of issues on WTO accession and
on a series of bilateral disputes.
</P>
<P>
She said the piracy situation in China has "dramatically
reversed" in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed the next round of bilateral intellectual property
rights consultation may be held in early June in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain has the worst record for
childhood asthma in the world, with more than one million children
suffering from the condition, according to an international study
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood,
which was carried out in 56 countries and involved 463,801
children aged 13 and 14, found that only Ireland, Australia and
New Zealand have proportionately as many young sufferers as
Britain.
</P>
<P>
They are followed by North, Central and South America. But
eastern European countries, Indonesia, Greece, China, Uzbekistan,
India and Ethiopia have the lowest prevalence of the condition
among children of the same age group.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, as many as three million people suffer from the
disease, which causes some 2,000 deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
The study showed enormous variations in the incidence of the
breathing disease, with some places having 60 times the levels of
others.
</P>
<P>
It said that environmental factors were critical to the
development of childhood asthma, and dust mites, which live in
pillows and mattresses, are mostly blamed for triggering asthma
attacks in childhood.

Hague told the BBC his party would support the government if it

associates are still committing violence in any shape or form," he

Under the Northern Ireland peace deal struck on April 10, all
the jailed guerrillas involved in the Northern Ireland conflict
would be released in the next two years.

LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of UK scheduled flights
which were delayed for more than 15 minutes over the last quarter

The CAA said that only 73 percent of flights had arrived or

</P>
<P>
The figures were drawn from a study of the country's 10 major
airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton,
Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the delays were caused by passengers not turning up,
passengers checking in bags and then going missing and a variety
of technical problems, such as aircraft being taken out of
service," said a CAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that delays due to air traffic control problems only
stood at nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"Air traffic is rising and therefore so are the delays. The
more flights you have, the more flights will be delayed," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the London Heathrow airport also had a
record high number of flights which were delayed, with only 69
percent of its flights arriving or taking off on time.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Aid Workers Arrive in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The ten Red Cross workers
kidnapped by Somali gunmen on April 15 were set free Friday
morning and arrived at Nairobi in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some of them burst into tears when embraced tightly by their
family members who had been waiting for them at the Wilson
Airport for about one hour.
</P>
<P>
The workers, one of whom a French woman, were abducted by
nearly 40 armed militiamen nine days ago when they landed at a
small airstrip near north Mogadishu. However, they looked fit
and in good health.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages are two pilots from Kenya and South Africa
respectively, an American, a French, a Norwegian, a Belgian, two
Swiss doctors, a German and a Somali from the Somali Red Crescent
Society.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them (the kidnappers) were polite," the 47-year-old
Swiss said. He has worked for the International Committee of Red
Cross (ICRC) for ten years.
</P>
<P>
"We've been treated as hostages, been treated as people in
detention. We were confined to a sitting room... We had access
to food, water, sanitary facilities, and apart from a few tense
moments, generally-speaking, we were treated well," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Hope was always there... We all had a lot of faith in our
Somali colleagues who actually from the very first day we knew
</P>
<P>
... tried to find means to release us from the situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that their release was a result of the
joint and massive efforts by "all major players in Somalia" and
the ICRC and thus could not be contributed to a single major
political figure.
</P>
<P>
"The release of the hostages has been obtained
unconditionally; no ransom has been paid," said the Geneva-based
International Committee of Red Cross in a press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the kidnappers and negotiators indicated
to Xinhua correspondent in Mogadishu that 60,000 US Dollars was
given to the abductors Thursday night and 40,000 Dollars was
given to them Friday morning. The money reportedly came from
local Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers were once reported to have demanded a
one-million-U.S.-Dollar ransom. But ICRC regional office in
Nairobi claimed it has never been approached by any faction over
demands.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are said to be loyal to a renegade member of
northern Mogadishu's military leader Ali Mahdi's Hawiye clan but
not under the direct control of Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi and some other major leaders in Somalia expressed their
"strong regrets" about the abduction immediately after the
hostages were released.
</P>
<P>
"This has been an isolated incident and it is not representing
the Somalis in general," said Mahdi, who called on the ICRC and
other aid agencies to resume operations in the country as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Since the abduction happened, the Somali capital saw the
withdrawal of all relief agencies and expatriate staff. About 45
percent of the city's population is dependent on relief services.
</P>
<P>
So far the ICRC has not yet discussed when to resume their
operations in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were first moved around 8:25 a.m. Friday morning
from their place of captivity to the ICRC run hospital of
Keysaney, about a mile north of the capital, where they were
offered medical checkup and refreshment drinks and food and
talked with their families by phone.

<HEADLINE> First Genocide Culprits Executed in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The first 22 Rwandan genocide
culprits have been executed Friday at five different locations,
the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Kigali, four were executed in front of a huge
crowd of over twenty thousand people.
</P>
<P>
The four executed outside the Nyamirambo Stadium included
Froduald Karamira, the deputy chairman of the "Hutu Power," a
faction of the MDR -- the Republican Democratic Party that
opposed the Arusha peace accord and called all Hutus to unite
against their common enemy, the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The executed also included Silas Munyagishari, former Kigali
prosecutor who during the genocide was the ring-leader of the
massacres of Tutsis in one of the suburbs of the capital,
Nyakabanda.
</P>
<P>
The third was a Burundian national, Elie Nhimiyimana, who
played a leading role in the genocide of Tutsis in Gikondo suburb
of the capital. The other was a woman, Virginie Mukankusi.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, a heavy security apparatus was deployed in
and around Nyamirambo suburb so as to prevent any terrorist act
that could hinder Friday's ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning the whole capital Kigali was on the move,
triggering heavy traffic jams in all major arteries leading to
the site of execution.
</P>
<P>
At 10:15 am the culprits were brought in a heavily escorted
motorcade made of pick-ups, and a land-cruiser.
</P>
<P>
The culprits were first tied from ankles up to the neck, on
poles that were fixed early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
They were then covered with a black veil before the firing
squad made of six policemen was deployed and started shooting one
culprit after another.
</P>
<P>
In Kigali, the huge crowd which attended the execution was
somewhat relieved to see the criminals punished.

<HEADLINE> Mowlam Urges N.Irish Voters to Give Peace Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- As the vital referendum for
Northern Ireland peace deal is approaching, British Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam on Friday urged voters in the province
to give a historic opportunity to discard old hatreds.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of young people, Mowlam said in Belfast
that "young people have a chance to vote for a more peaceful
future."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland and the neighboring Irish republic will hold
referendums on the historic peace agreement to a conflict that has
cost more than 3,200 lives in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't worked for the last 12 months to find an agreement
for them to vote 'no' and go back to the old days. I am also very
clear that it's their decision and their choice. No-one will tell
young people how to vote -- they will make their own minds up,"
said Mowlam, a chief negotiator in the tough talks that achieved
the peace deal two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gerry Adams, leader of Irish Republic Army's
political wing Sinn Fein, said on Friday he will have a further
round of talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair in London on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he will also meet Jim Steinberg, U.S. deputy
national security adviser, who visits Belfast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein did not sign the Northern Ireland peace deal, but
political analysts expect the party to back the accord at a
special congress to be held on May 10.

<HEADLINE> Intra-Afghan Dialogue Likely to Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty shrouds the much-
trumpeted and first-ever talks between the Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia and their rival Northern Alliance as a senior U.N.
official and Afghan sources Friday hinted a delay in the dialogue
scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting of the two-member joint Coordination Committee could
not be held here on Friday, which was supposed to discuss
modalities for the Steering Committee's meeting, reported the New
Network International (NNI) Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban delegation, which was due in Islamabad Friday, has
not arrived in the Pakistani capital so far and this would delay
the scheduled talks Saturday, NNI quoted a U.N. official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting close to open the talks but just need to get
the Taliban here," said the official in the Islamabad-based U.N.
Afghan peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources said Friday evening that members of the Taliban
delegation, who had been waiting in Kabul for several days to fly
to Islamabad, have now gone to Kandahar, a big city in southern
Afghanistan, for consultations with Taliban's central leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban Friday reiterated their stance that the
main item on the Saturday's meeting with the Northern Alliance
should be the formation of Ulema (religious scholar) Commission,
according to the NNI.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the acting Head of the U.N. Special Mission
for Afghanistan, N. Gobi, the Taliban said that the Steering
Committee should discuss four issues including members of the
Ulema Commission, their qualification, authority and guarantee
from all sides for the implementation of its decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Northern Alliance has emphasized that the meeting
should also deliberate on a ceasefire, exchange of prisoners and
removal of blockade of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE>   Over 100 Kilograms of Heroin Seized in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 125 kilograms of
smuggled heroin were seized in Turkey on Friday and four suspects
were arrested, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The heroin, worthing about 9 million U.S. dollars was found by
Turkish police and gendarme during two separate anti-drug
operations in the country's western province of Edirne and eastern
province of Van neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that acting on a tip off, the police discovered
30 kilograms of heroin when they stopped a car at Kapikule Border
Gate in Edirne.
</P>
<P>
The heroin, packaged in 13 parcels and hidden in the ceiling of
the car was about to be delivered to Hamburg, Germany, the agency
said, adding that one person in connection with the drug smuggling
has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
In another separate anti-drug operation in Ortayol village of
Baskale town in Van province, Turkish gendarme soldiers tracked
down and seized 95 kilograms of heroin valued at 8 million
dollars. Three people were detained during the operation.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the heroin was brought from Iran through
mountains and would have been marketed after being processed in
the Ortayol village.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran are on the transit route of drug trafficking to
Europe from the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996,
Turkish police seized 4.4 tonnes of heroin, which accounted for 40
percent of the world's total haul.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe International Trade Fair Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian president Benjamin
Mkapa called on African countries to unite for the promotion and
defense of their commercial interests when he officially opened a
three-day Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in the country's
second largest city of Bulawayo this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said African countries needed to stand together to
promote and defend their interests in the emerging liberalised
world trade regime, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"In this new economic liberation war our weapons are maximum
collective self-reliance and regional economic integration which
begins at the bilateral level and proceed to the strengthening of
southern African countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector was the vanguard in this endeavour,
while the government would provide the rear base by creating the
requisite enabling environment.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged developed countries to assist poor
countries to weather the negative impact of the new world trade
regime.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate compensatory measures and facilities, including
tariff reduction and a system of preference, must be diligently
and urgently implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
As far as Africa was concerned, he said, concerted efforts
needed to be made to increase its share of international trade,
which fell from 3.1 percent in 1990 to a mere 2.1 percent by the
year 1995, translating into a loss of 200 billion U.S. Dollars in
potential export earnings over a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
He added the industrial development strategy of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) had outlined the way
forward, by gearing, among other things, towards reducing
dependence on imported manufactured goods from outside the region
from 46 percent to 35 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time it seeks to increase intra-regional trade
from five percent to 12 percent of the total trade by the year
2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 countries including the U.S. Germany, China,
Argentina, Singapore, Indonesia and Syria attended the fair and
are exhibiting their products.

<P>
LUANDA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Remnant militiamen of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
been attacking various areas in the central part of the country
in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday morning, dozens of UNITA soldiers launched an
armed attack at Ngove Town in the southeast of Huambo Province,
looting everything from the local office of the United Nations
observer mission along with properties of the local residents,
before retreating to the forests bordering with Huila Province,
local media Friday quoted police sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Diogo Joao, head of the local police, some
residents died while others sustained wounds during the attack.
However, he didn't reveal the casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Benguela Province in the central coastal region, UNITA
forces reportedly ambushed a fully-loaded bus on Wednesday
evening, killing one passenger, and wounding seven. One other
passenger was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
Local police said this was the fourth ambush to vehicles in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Reports said due to the insecurity caused by the UNITA forces,
residents in Benguela Province were seriously worried. Up to
26,000 refugees have gathered in Ganda city in the central part
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Dumilde Rangel, governor of the province, revealed that by now
nine regions in the province are still under UNITA's control.
Local government is making great efforts in safeguarding people's
life in the province.
</P>
<P>
Huambo, Benguela and Huila provinces in central Angola have
become a "dangerous triangle area" threatened by the UNITA
forces. The national police and U.N. soldiers in Angola have
enforced armed patrol in the region so as to prevent further
sabotage from the former rebel movement. Endiem

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Apologizes for Guernica Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Following a similar move made by
German President Roman Herzog last year, the German parliament
Bundestag Friday also formally apologized for the German air raid
of the northern Spanish town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil
War 61 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted declaration on Friday, the Bundestag
expressed its support for the apology made by Herzog last April on
occasion of the 60th anniversary of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Bundestag also said the apology made by the German
president and shared by the German parliament should serve to
improve the foundations for a peaceful and friendly future between
the German and Spanish peoples.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, German Nazis
sent bombers of the "Legion Condor" squadron to attack Guernica in
assistance of the troops of Francisco Franco against those of the
Republicans. The war ended in 1939 with Franco becoming dictator
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The attack reduced around three-quarters of the defenceless
Basque town to debris. The death toll has never been established,
with estimates ranging from 300 to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
Herzog's apology, which read "I want to face up to the past and
explicitly acknowledge the guilty part played by German aviators",
represents Germany's first official admission of responsibility
for the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reported to Link redeployment With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to propose to link
the further Israeli troop pullout with the final-status talks
during the forthcoming visit by U.S. special peace envoy Dennis
Ross, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zalman Shoval, the former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. and
currently head of the World Likud Organization, told Israel Radio
that Israel's response to the U.S. proposal on the second pullback
must be based on Palestine's readiness to enter accelerated
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the accords between the Israelis and the
Palestinians, they should settle the thorniest issues of
Jerusalem, final borders and Palestinian refugees in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Shoval is Netanyahu's close friend and is reported to be
reappointed Ambassador to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In his speech Friday, he urged Washington to explain to the
Palestinians that "if we approach the fast track in negotiations
on permanent status, then the exact percentage of the
second-phase redeployment may look like less important and less
crucial than it is today."
</P>
<P>
Ross is due in Jerusalem Saturday, together with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk, to begin a new round of mediation aimed at reviving the
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks was installed in March last year when Israel began
construction of the Jewish housing project on Har Homa in East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians wants as the capital of their
would-be state.
</P>
<P>
A meeting has been scheduled between Ross and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night. Ross is also then
to hold talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Top on Ross' agenda is to solve the dispute over the size of
Israel's second-phase troop withdrawal, thus setting the stage for
the planned four-way talks in London to be co-hosted next month by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Ross will demand that Israel accept the U.S. proposal for troop
withdrawal from a further 13.1 percent from the West Bank over 12
weeks, with each step met by Palestinian security gesture.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu has till now refused to accept any pullback
more than 9 percent, some reports said he is drafting a map on a
11 percent redeployment.
</P>
<P>
By agreeing to increase the extent of the second pullback,
Netanyahu may hope to pressure the Palestinian National Authority
to start immediately the final-status talks of Jerusalem, which
are long overdue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has made it clear that, after carrying out the
first two phases of the further redeployment, he would integrate
the third pullback into the final-status talks. He is fully
aware of the strong opposition to another redeployment by the
right-wingers who are dominating his government.
</P>
<P>
In proposing for accelerated permanent talks, Netanyahu also
apparently hoped to conclude a package deal in favor of
Israel by negotiating from an advantageous position when Israel
is still controlling large area of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
But this has been rejected by the Palestinian side which
demands for the accurate implementation of the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have finished troop withdrawal in three stages by
this summer under the Hebron accord signed in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated over the lack of progress in the peace process,
Arafat and PNA officials have recently repeatedly announced their
determination to declare an independent Palestinian state in May
next year, regardless of achieving a peace treaty with Israel
or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's opposition parties
called on Friday for a vote of no confidence on the country's
government after the escape of a child rapist and killer a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Johan Vande Lanotte
as well as Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck already resigned for
the escape of alleged paedophile Marc Dutroux.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also demanded Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene resign. The prime minister promised to start an
investigation into the incident that shocked the entire country.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux ran away from a court prior to a pre-trial hearing on
Thursday and remained at large for three hours and half before
being shot and recaptured by the police.
</P>
<P>
The alleged child killer managed to run away from one police
guard in a Neufchateau court and started his run with the shotgun
of the police in a stolen car toward the borders of Luxembourg and
France.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian police had to seal off the borders while the French
police did the same on their part. Altogether police in five
countries were mobilized to join the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was accused of killing four of the six young girls he
had abducted in mid 1996 as a nation-wide child sex ring was
exposed and shocked the Belgian public.

<HEADLINE> Stock Exchange Performs Well in Cyprus: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Friday that the Cyprus
Stock Exchange (CSE) had an impressive performance in the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
Addressing stockbrokers, investors and the CSE officials at
the floor of the Stock Exchange during a brief visit,
Christodoulou said the average daily volume of transactions 12
months ago was only 500,000 Cyprus pounds (about 1 million
U.S. dollars), while in the last three months it reached two
million pounds (about 4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The stocks' price index has increased by 12 points in the
same period, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed this performance to investors' and
brokers' belief that the CSE is founded on a "healthy
basis", the good work by the CSE Board, and the high level
of cooperation among the parties involved in the CSE activities.
</P>
<P>
Investors' and brokers' confidence in the island's economy
and the government measures such as tax cuts, which have been
already publicized, are also responsible for the CSE's good
performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou revealed that in the coming weeks he will
arrange a joint meeting with the CSE Board, the brokers and
the Securities Commission to discuss new measures necessary to
upgrade Cyprus' Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Dinos Papadopoulos, CSE Chairman, said that
the CSE's high performance reflects that of the island's
economy.

<HEADLINE> German Bank Predicts Euro to Start at 1.95 German Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- One of Germany's largest commercial
banks, the Dresdner Bank, Friday predicted that the planned single
European currency euro is likely to be launched at an exchange
rate of 1.95 German mark in 1999 and will remain strong against
the U.S. dollar at least for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Dresdner Bank's estimates, EU countries currently
have a world market share of about 20 percent compared with some
16 percent for the United States. However, only about 31 percent
of world trade are currently executed in EU currencies compared
with 48 percent in the dollar.
</P>
<P>
With the European currency integration, the demand for the euro
would rise automatically, experts of the bank said, adding that
especially petroleum-exporting countries would have a strong
interest in making the switch from the dollar to the euro.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bank was also upbeat about the euro's outlook to
rival the dollar as an international reserve currency.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Pledges to Help Mozambique to Remove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will continue
helping Mozambique to rid itself of anti-personnel landmines
planted during the liberation wars in that country, South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Landmines were a significant impediment to socio-economic
reconstruction and development in Mozambique. "South Africa
therefore views demining to be fundamentally a humanitarian task
of the highest priority and importance," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at the presentation of a
certificate to his Mozambican counterpart Leonardo Simao to
verify the successful completion of the demining of Maputo
Province by South African experts.
</P>
<P>
He also handed certificates to 10 Mozambicans who have been
trained in demining techniques over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 landmines were destroyed, clearing 163
hectares of land and unlocking the agricultural potential of the
Currumane Dam region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was to send a specialist to help Mozambique
continue its own mine-clearing operations.
</P>
<P>
Nzo repeated earlier calls on all African states to ratify and
put into effect the Ottawa Convention which prohibits the use,
production, transfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
The time had arrived to stop making political statements on
the dimensions of the landmine problem, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
"We now seek the active and sustainable involvement of the
international community towards the total eradication of this
silent killer from the soil of our continent," Nzo added.

TUNIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Italian aircraft landed at
Tripoli International Airport Friday in defiance of the
U.N.-imposed air embargo on Libya.

Italian Senator Victoreo Zegarbei and a delegation of media
people were on board the two aircraft, the Libyan News Agency

</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the air embargo on

United States or Britain two of its nationals who were suspected
of bombing a U.S. airliner on the Scottish town of Lokerbie in
1988. The incident killed 270 people.

Speaking at the United Nations Security Council's open debate
on Africa, Shen said in last year alone, China signed new
assistance agreements with 41 African countries.
</P>
<P>
Shen said to adapt to the changing situation, China reformed
the ways of providing aids and adopted additional methods,
namely, augmenting governmental assistance with the
involvement of financial institutions and companies.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said China provided preferential government
loans to Africa and set up joint ventures or cooperative projects
with local enterprises for the execution of assistance projects.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the purpose was to help the recipient countries
develop productive projects based on local demand and resources,
enhance the efficiency of assistance, boost local employment and
at the same time, train African technical and managerial personnel.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China signed framework agreements with up to 20
countries in Africa with over 10 such projects already in
operation. China does not attach conditions to its assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to enhance economic cooperation
and trade with African countries and support their efforts in
casting off poverty and realizing sustained economic development
at an early date.

<HEADLINE>   Cyprus Expects U.S. Role for Resumption of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is
expecting to hear formal proposals from the U.S. about efforts to
resume the intercommunal talks on the island, Government Spokesman
Christos Stylianides said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at his daily press briefing that the
Cypriot government "is pleased that there is such an initiative
by the international community and the U.S., which can exert
some influence on the Turkish side."
</P>
<P>
Referring to a visit scheduled by U.S. Presidential Emissary
Richard Holbrooke on May 1, he said "We expect that the visit will
be significant with regard to the resumption of the talks for a
solution to the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem remained unresolved since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that U.S. State Department Special Coordinator
for Cyprus Tom Miller has sounded out all sides on various issues
while making contacts with Nicosia, Athens and Ankara. But an
overall settlement for the Cyprus problem will be in
U.N. framework under the aegis of the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a Thursday declaration by Turkey and the Turkish
Cypriot side, the spokesman said it tantamount to "a torpedo in
current efforts", noting that their position is "indeed negative
and causes concern".
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash charged Thursday in a declaration in Ankara that
the European Union and Greece should be blamed for the continuing
deadlock in efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated their demand for international recognition
of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus,
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides pointed that the declaration went beyond the spirit
of U.N. resolutions about Cyprus, warning the Turkish side would
bear the responsibility for the absence of movement towards a
settlement if it insists on the position.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official in Cyprus for Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel does not rule out the
possibility of making a deal with Cyprus in defense cooperation
similar to that it has with Turkey, an Israeli Foreign Ministry
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after his talks with Cypriot
government, Director General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry
Eytan Bentsur said he discussed a large variety of bilateral
issues and the wide spectrum of cooperation in all walks of life
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any possibility of having a defense or
military agreement with Cyprus similar to the one Israel has with
Turkey, Bentsur replied "we did not discuss such an idea but I do
not rule out anything."
</P>
<P>
On Israeli military agreement with Turkey, Bentsur said "it
is designed and designated only to enhance relations with Turkey
and it absolutely has no intention to affect in any ways or
means our relations with Cyprus, which are very close and
friendly and warm."
</P>
<P>
On his talks at the Foreign Ministry, the Israeli diplomat
said they also discussed other issues including the Middle East
peace process, the Security Council resolution 425 and the planned
four-way talks in London in early May between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
He said he briefed Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
on the current situation in the Middle East peace process,
expressing hope that an agreement may be clinched on the current
stage of negotiations with the Palestinians after the London
meeting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on unauthorized Israeli flights in Nicosia Flight
Information Region (FIR), Bentsur said "there is a general
understanding between Cyprus and Israel on the flights of Israeli
aircraft."
</P>
<P>
"I assure you there is no intention whatsoever to violate the
air space of Cyprus, we would like to impose very strict measures
in this respect," he added.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Bentsur said there is room for
improvement that Israel would like to see its relations with
Cyprus extended on virtually all areas.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to
President Glafcos Clerides in a recent meeting "to engage in
talks on high-tech" and expressed his government's readiness to
make its know-how available to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of getting businessmen interested in
this and promote it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur arrived here Friday and will leave Cyprus on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Combat Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
will take part in a worldwide campaign against child labor,
Minister of Education and Culture Juma Kapuya has said.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting an anti-child labor march here Friday, the
minister said that he is worried about the child labor situation
in Tanzania which has become worse since 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by poverty, many children in Tanzania are subjected to
becoming street vendors and work in difficult environment like
sisal, tea, cotton, sugar estates and mines which are hazardous
to their health and are exposed to nasty behaviors like taking
drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The minister has expressed fears that children were among the
more than 90 victims who were buried alive two weeks ago in mine
pits in Meremani in the northern region of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Although child labor has been widely criticized in Tanzania, a
number of small-scale miners prefer to employ children. Teenage
boys who are more flexible and efficient in passing complicated
narrow passages in mines pits are nicknamed "snake boys."
</P>
<P>
Kapuya also appealed to international agencies dealing with
children's rights to provide financial aid to the educational
development in developing countries so that more children can
receive education since it is one of their basic rights.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents and students have participated in the
march Friday, led by international activities who are touring the
African continent campaigning against child labor.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that marches against child labor are also
taking place in other continents, such as Asia and Latin America.
Statistics indicate that more than 250 million children worldwide
are subjected to child labor.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya also urged parents, the community and children
themselves to participate in the war against child labor.
</P>
<P>
Speak at the function, the International Labor Organization
(ILO) resident representative, Christine Bockstal, said that
child labor is a blatant human right abuse and therefore should
be fought by concerted efforts of governments, Non-Government
Organizations (NGOs), research institutions, international
agencies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Bockstal said that child labor in many parts of the world has
been greatly reduced except in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The march will head to the Arusha Region Saturday, organizers
said.

<P>
DAMASCUS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left the Mediterranean resort Latakia Friday afternoon, ending his
one-day unscheduled visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Mubarak discussed with his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad the Mideast situation and the peace process,
especially Israeli offer to carry out a conditional withdrawal
from south Lebanon, a statement issued after their talks said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit is part of the two countries' efforts to
coordinate their position on the Israeli troop pullback offer
just before the upcoming visit to Egypt by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad visited Egypt on April 15 to discuss with Mubarak the
response of Syria and Lebanon to the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel endorsed on April 1 the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425, saying that it would pull back its troops from
south Lebanon after negotiating security arrangements with the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria firmly rejected the offer, urging Israel
to pull out its troops unconditionally in accordance with the
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Syria has great influence on Lebanon and is stationing more
than 30,000 troops there as peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Cairo expressed its support for the Syrian and Lebanese
position on the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its
northern areas from Lebanon's guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in response
to the escalating conflict in Kosovo, said on Friday that the
situation in Kosovo is "quite troubling, extremely dangerous".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin noted that the Yugoslav army has been engaged in a
firefight along the Albanian border, with many deaths resulting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the use of force against insurgents and
civilians recently has been disproportionate to the provocation.
</P>
<P>
"The United States strongly believes that the Contact Group and
the U.N.'s call for the immediate withdrawal of special police
units and the call for Belgrade authorities to meet with Albanians
in an unconditional dialogue is the only solution to this
problem," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Senior administration officials said the U.S. will seek a
freeze on Yugoslav assets held overseas and a ban on international
trade with Belgrade, the administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Robert Gelbard, chief U.S. mediator for the Balkans,
will propose the sanctions at a meeting Wednesday in Rome with
senior diplomats from Germany, Britain, Russia, Italy and France,
the so-called "Contact Group".
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the population of Kosovo is ethnic
Albanian. The Albanian extremists are seeking the region's
independence while the United States believes that Belgrade
should give them more autonomy.

since the Majertens equipped with six battle wagons have been far
well organized for the operation than those of the Marehan
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which stopped as night has fallen, broken out
Friday with even more intensity. The Marehan militiamen who had
only four battle wagons have received some militia reinforcement
and pushed back the attack of the Majertens to Gobwein village.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are no exact casualty figures on either
side, a spokesman for the Marehan militiamen has claimed that
their forces have killed 17 men from the Majerten men.
</P>
<P>
The militia spokesman who spoke with the journalists had
admitted that his forces had lost 13 of their men during the
clashes since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from the Majertens themselves over
the fighting, however a VHF radio operator in Kismaio said
several wounded militiamen have been brought to the hospital of
the town, but no exact figure is available at this moment.
</P>
<P>
Both clansmen have nowadays been preparing for launching armed
insurgencies on the militia bases of the other.
</P>
<P>
General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan who controls the town of
Kismaio accused the Marehan fighters of threatening the security
in Lower Jubba Region by instigating armed clashes, while the
Marehans are on the contrary accusing General Morgan, the
son-in-law of Somalia's late dictator, of being behind all the
political difficulties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The fighting now between the two Darod sub-clans in Lower
Jubba is covering a very large area and displacing hundreds of
people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Launch New Diplomatic Drive on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said Friday that Ankara would launch a new
diplomatic drive on Cyprus by explaining the island's historical
realities to young foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash, who arrived here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "the circumstances that created the Cyprus
problem and the developments before and after the (1974 Turkish)
intervention on the island will be explained to young foreign
diplomats, who do not know the realities or pretend not to".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the European Union's (EU) decision to start
accession talks with Cyprus, Ecevit said that has made solution of
a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation unrealistic, adding that "the
Turkish state on Cyprus is an undeniable reality".
</P>
<P>
Recently, the United States has stepped up efforts to find a
solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke
will visit the island in May in a bid to bring the parties
together and outline a framework for an ultimate settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Four Big U.S. Airlines to Form Two Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Four of the U.S. largest
airlines may form two huge domestic alliances that will bring
great impact for the transportation industry which has been
undertaking hot consolidation process in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The United Airlines, the No. 2 U.S. carrier, said Friday it has
suspended talks with No. 3 Delta Air Lines about a pact that would
include sharing frequent-flier deals and allowing passengers to
transfer easily between airlines.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides were very close to an agreement, they
would not disclose why talks were halted. The United said they may
not resume.
</P>
<P>
The news came following the American Airlines and US Airways,
the No. 1 and No. 5 carriers in the country, announced a similar
alliance later Thursday. Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest
carrier, has already announced it would buy a 519 million U.S.
dollars stake in the sixth largest Continental Airlines in a deal
that would link their route systems.
</P>
<P>
To form operational alliance between airliners has become a
global trend in the industry. because the alliances are important
cost-reducing way for airlines concerned about filling empty seats
</P>
<P>
In the American-US Airways alliance, the companies said they
will let passengers use frequent-flier miles on either airline and
may eventually code-share their flights, meaning they will allow
transfers between their planes.
</P>
<P>
Arlington, Va.-based US Airways has a strong presence
throughout the East, while American, based in Fort Worth, Texas,
has a wide route structure.
</P>
<P>
American has also formed alliances with Japan Airlines and
British Airways, but those deals are pending for approval.
</P>
<P>
Some industrial analysts have predicted that the nation's
largest carriers would form alliances to strengthen their position
in the global marketplace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Japan's Economic Stimulus Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
welcomed Japan's latest and largest package to stimulate its
economy, but still urged Tokyo to do more to pull other Asian
economies back to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the substantial policy measures announced today by
the Japanese government," Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Statement came after Tokyo on Friday announced a 128
billion U.S. dollars package of tax cuts, government spending and
low-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the (Japanese) government will put these measures into
place quickly and effectively and move forward with further
actions, including measures to strengthen Japan's financial system
and open and deregulate its economy, to help establish a basis for
long-lasting domestic demand-led growth," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the world, including Japan's Asian neighbors, has a
strong interest in seeing Japan succeed in generating a strong
domestic recovery that will contribute to recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
This was the message that was given to Japanese officials at
the International meetings in Washington a week ago, and Rubin was
this time reinforcing it on the occasion of the latest Japanese
stimulus package.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- It is important to support
African states' capacity to play their part in the maintenance of
peace in the continent, a French delegate told the United Nations
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the U.N. Security Council debate on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report on Africa, Ambassador Alain
Dejammet said U.N. actions should support the efforts of African
countries to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation at different levels should be strengthened
including with the Organization of African Unity and other
regional initiatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said France was maintaining its aid efforts in Africa with
half of its 7.5 billion U.S. dollar official development
assistance allocated to Africa.
</P>
<P>
His country has taken measures to write off debts to countries
in sub-Saharan Africa and in international forums, and it had
advocated alleviation of the debt of African countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report was submitted to the council on April 16 in
response to its request made at a meeting at the level of foreign
ministers last September to consider the need for a concerted
effort to promote peace and development in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's decision
to drop a World Trade Organization (WTO) complaint against the
U.S. over an anti-Cuba U.S. law may improve chances for a possible
agreement in the controversy, the State Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the fact that the decision was made not to go
forward with a case before the WTO indicates desire on the
Europeans' part to come to a solution," said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"But the next step is to see whether we can come to an
understanding that no country should want to see expropriated
property benefit the expropriator," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law was enacted in 1996 after two small U.S.
planes was shot down by the Cuban military when they flew into
Cuba's skies.
</P>
<P>
The law punishes foreign companys which uses confiscated U.S.
properties in Cuba. The EU insists it violates the free trade
principles and filed a complaint before the WTO in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Become Victims in Illegal Asbestos Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The homeless are increasingly
becoming victims in illegal asbestos removal scams where they are
employed without training or adequate protection, the U.S. Justice
Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department announced indictments against three Wisconsin
men, who are accused of bringing workers from a Chattanooga,
Tennessee, homeless shelter to their state to illegally remove
asbestos from a building being demolished.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno called such activity "a shameful
human exploitation" and promised the government would take every
step to prosecute illegal asbestos removal cases that involve
untrained homeless people, teen-agers and unqualified day
laborers.
</P>
<P>
"Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal," Reno told
a news conference also attended by Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Administrator Carol Browner. Using vulnerable people for
such activity violates "the basic standard of human decency."
</P>
<P>
Asbestos fiber, often used to insulate older buildings, is a
hazardous material whose fibers can become deeply imbedded in the
lungs and cause respiratory illnesses and even cancer. Its removal
is regulated closely and workers must follow special removal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The department cited prosecutions in nine states since
September involving the hiring of untrained workers, often
homeless people or unwary teen-agers, to rip out asbestos. They
included.
</P>
<P>
Reno said these cases are "the tip of the iceberg" since
violations often are not reported.
</P>
<P>
The department sent warning notices to homeless shelters and
announced a telephone hotline for people to call if they believe
someone is being hired for improper asbestos removal.

<HEADLINE> U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Urges Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations should create a stand-by international force in
support of humanitarian operations in Africa, Sadako Ogata, United
Nations high commissioner for refugees, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the council's open debate on the U.N. chief's
report on Africa, Ogata said the mixed nature of groups hosted in
refugee camps -- refugees coexisting with fighters, criminals and
genocidaires -- has been the greatest challenge to the work of her
office throughout the Great Lakes crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said the trend will expand further if no measures to deal
with mixed groups in a rapid and effective manner are designed and
implemented soon.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said maintaining the civilian nature of
refugee camps is the responsibility of host governments. However,
different situations may require a variety of responses. There are
situations in which building or supporting local capacity are
inadequate to maintain the civilian character of camps.
</P>
<P>
She said separation of refugees from criminals can then become
an important security requirement, and there may be no other
option but to deploy international police or military forces.
</P>
<P>
Ogata expressed her strong support for the secretary-general's
call for the creation of an international mechanism to assist host
governments in maintaining the civilian nature of camps.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner hoped that the Security Council will give
concrete follow-up to this recommendation and will examine the
possibility to create a stand-by international force in support of
humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said her office stands ready to help develop procedures
and techniques for police and military forces to carry out this
type of activity.

<HEADLINE> Albright's Trip Not Designed to Achieve Particular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's upcoming trip to China was designed to lay
the groundwork for the Sino-U.S. summit in Beijing rather than to
achieve particular negotiating outcome, a State Department
spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin told a press briefing that Albright would "prepare
the way and arrange for many of the details" of the summit meeting
scheduled for late June.
</P>
<P>
"This travel of the secretary of state to countries of this
kind is not designed to achieve a particular negotiating outcome
the way, say, a meeting of the Contact Group or some pre-prepared
negotiation would," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Albright will start her four-nation Asia trip Monday, which
will take her to Japan, China, South Korea and Mongolia. She will
stay in Beijing Wednesday and Thursday. This is the first of her
four planned visits to the region this year.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state will meet with Vice Premier Qian Qichen
and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in the Chinese capital on the
summit-related issues.
</P>
<P>
"What is important, however, is laying the groundwork for the
president's trip to China, trying to advance our agenda in terms
of getting concrete progress in human rights, in stopping the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as seeing
whether there's an opportunity to move China forward on its
application or attempt to join the WTO, the World Trade
Organization," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Washington has come to realize the importance of conducting
"strategic dialogue" with China on a number of issues instead of
pursuing a China policy of "containment." It stated repeatedly
that progress has been made on human rights and non-proliferation
through negotiations, but a lot of work still lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the U.S. officials will try to make progress on
the three specific areas of concern. He did not elaborate if an
agreement could be expected on China's admission to the WTO before
or during President Bill Clinton's trip to China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is now in Beijing
to assess the possibility. She told reporters in the Chinese
capital Friday that the negotiations had picked up momentum but
China could expect no favorable treatment in its accession to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite pleased with the overall tone and seriousness
displayed by my Chinese colleagues and we have reestablished
momentum," she said after two days of negotiations, adding she
still has some concerns.
</P>
<P>
China asks to be allowed in as a developing country but the
U.S. and some other industrialized countries oppose.
</P>
<P>
Albright will make stopover in London on her way back home on
May 4 to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to
break the stalemate on the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Support for Africa's Own Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) has called on the international community to
"be more human rather than statistical" in dealing with the
continent.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed here Friday by Machivenyika Maparanga,
permanent representative to the U.N. of Zimbabwe, the current
OAU chairman.
</P>
<P>
He told the U.N. Security Council's debate on Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's report on Africa that the international community
should go beyond facts and figures but see the true scene of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
News of economic growth has been communicated to the
international community mainly in terms of statistical figures
such as percentage growth of the gross domestic product, reduced
budget deficits, curtailed public spending and lower inflation
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some of African countries were actually
de-industrializing, and were no nearer to eradicating absolute
poverty among the majority of its people.
</P>
<P>
Many African countries continue to spend more on debt-servicing
than they did on education or health, or on education and health
combined in some cases, he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community to assist Africa by
recognizing its need for accelerated human resource training,
technology transfer, debt remission, capital investment and
access to international markets on the basis of equitable terms
of trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States of
America welcomed the U.N. Secretary-General's report on Africa,
which established a solid foundation for discussing the future of
Africa, Bill Richardson, U.S. representative to the U.N., said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the U.N. chief's report provides valuable
insights into the varied situation confronting Africa today. While
the report recognizes the historical failures of African countries
and the international community to prevent or resolve conflicts,
it urges all to move beyond the recriminations of the past and
focus on the possibilities of a brighter future for all Africans.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the open debate of the Security Council
represents only the first step in that discussion. The United
States strongly endorses the secretary-general's call for
ministerial-level meetings of the Security Council every two years
to assess how and what the international community can do more.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the international community must meet the
challenge put forward by the secretary-general and new partnership
among Africa, the United Nations and the international community
must be built in order to meet the challenge.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
Friday warned against any optimism on breakthrough in peace talks
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will hold on May 4 in London
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very hard to be optimistic and hopeful about the
Middle East peace process after a series of meetings in which
Secretary Albright and Ambassador (Dennis) Ross have used all the
ingenuity they can muster to try to find creative solution to
these problems," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks as Ross and Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk left for the Middle East to prepare for the London
meetings between Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Between Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Rubin described the peace process as "increasingly moribund"
and the obstacles to progress remained serious because of
reluctance of the Middle East leaders to compromise during the
past nine months of U.S. mediation efforts.
</P>

Albright and other U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that
the United States might stop its mediation efforts if there seems

end of the road, and that a judgment "will depend on where we
think we are."

<HEADLINE> French Gaullist Leader Not to Seek Succession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Seguin, president of
France's Gaullist movement, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), said
Saturday that he might not seek succession in the first election
of PRP presidency.
</P>
<P>
The election, by universal vote of party members, is to be
held in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons for me not to be the candidate are getting the
upper hand in my head," the 54-year-old RPR leader told a meeting
of his party militants in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Seguin took over the post at the demand of President Jacques
Chirac from former Prime Minister Alain Juppe after the right-wing
parties were routed by the Socialist-led left-wing coalition in
the legislative elections one year ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have an awareness of being ... one of the major obstacles to
the implementation of the strategy (of renewing the RPR)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As one step in the remoulding of France's mainstream
right-wing, the RPR is breaking with its ally, the centrist Union
for French Democracy (UDF), after some key UDF leaders allied
with the extreme-right National Front in the regional elections
last month.
</P>
<P>
If Seguin steps down, Nicolas Sarkozy, a rising star in the
RPR, is most likely to be the next Gaullist leader of
France.

In a letter sent to Third International Conference on the
embargo imposed on Iraq, which is being held in the Greek capital

Baghdad has accused the United States of using the U.N. weapons

<P>
"Many world advocates of justice have become fully aware of
the facts and that only the remaining imperialists and enemies of
freedom, justice and peace support the United States in adopting a

</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Iraqis will achieve their
ultimate goals with the great support from the international

As to the international meeting, the Iraqi president said that

BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene nominated two people Saturday to replace the resigning
ministers in the wake of the escape of the country's convicted
child rapist and killer.
</P>
<P>
The nominees are Louis Tobback for outgoing Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Johan Vande Lanotte and Tony van
Parys for outgoing Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was made and presented to King Albert II who
interrupted his vacation abroad and returned to his palace
following the news of the escape.
</P>
<P>
Vande Lanotte and de Clerck handed in their resignations after
Marc Dutroux managed to escape from a court at Neufchateau in
southeast Belgium and remained at large for three and a half hours
before being shot and recaptured by the Belgian police.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was charged with killing four of the six young girls he
had abducted in mid-1996 when a nationwide child sex ring was
exposed and shocked the Belgian public.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties called Friday for a vote of no
confidence on the current government and also demanded the prime
minister resign.

HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- African-Caribbean Pacific
Countries (ACP) will meet in Barbados next month to adopt a
common position on new Lome conventions which they will present
to the European Union in September, a Zimbabwean minister has
said.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said the ACP
countries would meet for four days from May 1 to 4 to draft a
position paper for their discussions with the European Union for
the renewal of the Lome conventions, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in an interview that the negotiations on new
conventions would last for one to one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Barbados meeting would review three main
areas, namely, non-reciprocal trade under which goods from ACP
countries enter Europe duty free, the!European investment fund
and assistance to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to keep the non-reciprocal facility because it is
important to us. In the case of Zimbabwe, if we were to pay duty
for our horticultural and clothing products it would make them
less competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lome conventions, in place since 1975, have been the basic
framework for trade, development and aid cooperation between the
71 ACP countries and 15 EU countries.
</P>
<P>
They will come to an end in February 2000 with the expiry of
the Lome IV convention.
</P>
<P>
ACP heads of state and government met in Gabon last year and
endorsed a framework for serious negotiations with the EU while
the latter has come up with a "green paper" which forms the basis
upon which debate on the future of the conventions beyond 2000
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
However, fundamental political and economic changes have so
far taken place, developments that make the future of EU-ACP
relations uncertain.

Many experts pointed out that Chinese colleges and universities
have lost their initiative due to rigid administration by the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang University President Pan Yunhe said "China's existing
system of higher education fails to meet the requirements of
modern times."
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that higher education of China should be
put under the overall leadership of the State Council, but the
powers of local governments in the management of higher education
should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some of the colleges and universities in China are
run by the Education Ministry and some others by local governments or
other ministries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a few private institutions of higher education
have also been established in the country.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources indicate that lawmakers will engage in
enthusiastic discussions regarding regulations on the
self-decision power of universities, their management system and
investments from governments at various levels.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian First Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam arrived here Saturday afternoon to exchange
views with Iranian officials on the developments of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Khaddam said that besides taking part in the
two countries' joint high committee, he would confer with Iranian
officials on "the issues of common interest."
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the Israeli proposal for conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon would be top the agenda in
Khaddam's talks with Iranian officials. The latest development in
Iraq and the military cooperation between Turkey and Israel would
also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided on April 1 to accept
U.N. Resolution 425, which called for unconditional withdrawal
from south Lebanon, but insisted on the negotiated security
arrangements by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed two military cooperation
agreements, arousing criticism from the Arab countries who fear
that Turkey is allying itself with the Jewish state against Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Khaddam is scheduled to meet Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami. Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, who is
accompany Khaddam, will meet his Iranian counterpart Kamal
Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-Syrian joint high committee meets every six months
in either of the two capitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen people were killed
and eight others were injured in a horrible accident near Cape
Town Saturday, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident, involving a minibus taxi and two cars, occurred
shortly before 7 a.m. (0500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the victims, 11 women and 4 men, were burnt to
death when the taxi burst into flames on impact, trapping the
occupants inside the vehicle, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
An occupant of a Mercedes-Benz was killed and another occupant
was injured. All five occupants of the other cars were injured.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town's mayor Theresa Solomon visited the scene but was
too overcome with grief to comment.
</P>
<P>
Minibus taxis, which usually transport black people, are
considered dangerous by South African road users. They may stop
at virtually any time and anywhere to pick up passengers and a
large proportion of their drivers do not have legal driving
licenses.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people died when two minibus taxis collided at an
intersection near Khayelitsha, about 35 kilometers from Cape Town
last Sunday. It was reported that one of the minibuses failed to
stop at the intersection before the red light.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China is actively exploring new
export markets across the globe in order to minimize the
adverse effects of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the ongoing 83rd China Export
Commodities Fair, which opened 10 days ago, has attracted over
50,000 businesspeople from 164 countries and regions, with a
decrease in the number of buyers from Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of customers from Africa, Latin America and
the Gulf region has increased, respectively by 39 percent, 17.75
percent and 31 percent, compared with the last fair.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Arabian businessman, who attributed his attendance at
the fair to his admiration for Haier, China's first brand name
home electrical appliance, has already inked Haier
contracts valued at nine million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rongshida, a major washing machine manufacturer in east China's
Anhui Province which attaches great importance to the development of
new products to fulfill the demand of new customers in Africa and
Latin America, has inked related contracts valued at over 10
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade departments dispatched trade delegations
to a number of countries, including Egypt and South Africa, prior
to this year's fair. The delegations focused on promoting Chinese
commodities and presented invitation letters to 5,000 foreign
importers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that exports to Gulf nations, Africa, the
Commonwealth of Independent States and eastern Europe have grown
by 20 percent during this year's fair.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of 26 Jordanian
families will arrive in Kuwait on May 4 for a three-day stay to
visit their relatives jailed in the Gulf state, a Kuwaiti official
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hamed Al-Refaei, head of the
International Organization Liaison Department said that the group
of 41 people will visit 25 Jordanian prisoners who have been
sentenced to imprisonment in Kuwait Central Prison for either
financial, criminal or security offenses.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit will be arranged by the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is keen to fulfill commitment to all international
human rights agreements, charters and declarations with an aim to
support international relations and strengthen cooperation among
international organizations, Al-Refaei said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth visit to be made by theses relatives
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The first two visits took place in June and September in 1995
and the last in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan had been strained
following the Gulf War in 1991 during which Jordan sided with Iraq
which occupied Kuwait for seven months before the U.S.-led allied
forces drove the occupation troops out.
</P>
<P>
But bilateral ties have been improving since last year within
the framework of a reconciliatory process by the Kuwaiti
authorities with the "former enemy states."

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature is set to
deliberate a new law governing higher education in order to
standardize the management of Chinese colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the Second Meeting of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC), scheduled to begin tomorrow,
calls for legislators to deliberate the draft Law on Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lawmakers are expected to be engaged in heated
discussions of the draft law, which outlines perspectives for
reforms of the nation's system of higher education, according to
reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Legislative Affairs Commission organized in-depth
discussions between NPC deputies and well-known educationists
prior to the law's submission to the nation's most authoritative
law-making body.
</P>
<P>
The educational system reform centers on the management of
higher education, which is in urgent need of new policies,
according to Lanzhou University President Li Fashen.
</P>
<P>
Education reform will flounder if the Ministry of Education
controls the management system like "a bird in a cage," said Lu
Qiang, a professor at Qinghua University and an academician with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Each university should be entitled to enroll new students,

NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Secretary Montel
Singh Ahluwalia said Saturday that the government was
contemplating more reforms in the banking sector on the basis of a
report prepared by the Narasimham Committee on the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a "Banking Technology Concept Center" in Bangalore
city, capital of Karnataka state in southern India, he said that
more changes were likely as the government took a view of the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Narasimham Committee, formed by the former United Front
government with former governor of the Reserve Bank of India M.
Narasimham as its head to study financial reforms in the country,
submitted its report to Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee favored the merger of strong public sector banks
and closure of weak ones where rehabilitation was not possible. It
opposed to the merger of strong banks with the weak on the grounds
that such a move would have a negative impact on the asset quality
of the stronger bank because of the "contaminated portfolio" of
the weak bank.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a working group of the Reserve Bank of India
has suggested freedom to banks and development financial
institutions to explore gainful mergers.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member group, which submitted a report to Governor
Bimal Jalan of the Reserve Bank of India Friday, recommended a
super regulator to supervise and coordinate activities of multiple
regulators in the banking sector to ensure uniformity in the
country.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The stage has been set for the
long-awaited intra-Afghan talks as the delegation of Afghanistan's
Islamic Taliban arrived here Saturday, one day late than the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The four-member Taliban delegation, who was greeted by U.N.
officials at the Islamabad airport upon their arrival Saturday
afternoon, made no comment to reporters. The fifth Taliban
delegate has already been here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign
Office announced that the Joint Steering Committee, which is made
up of five delegates from the Taliban and nine from their rival
Northern Alliance, will meet here Sunday morning under the
auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The first face-to-face encounter between the two sides was
scheduled to take place from Saturday morning. However, it became
impossible as the Taliban delegation did not reach Islamabad until
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Though the agenda of the forthcoming intra-Afghan talks has not
been known so far, it is believed the Taliban, who control two
thirds of Afghanistan, and the Northern Alliance, who controls the
remaining one third, will focus on the formation of the Ulema
(religious scholar) Commission, ceasefire and exchange of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
OIC Assistant Secretary General Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, who
arrived here Friday morning, will jointly preside over Sunday's
meeting with N. Gobi, acting head of the U.N. Afghan peace mission

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Swiss Release of Mossad's Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel expressed on Saturday
its welcome to the release by Switzerland of its Mossad agent,
saying such a move could further enhance the friendly relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Israeli government officials as saying
that Mossad's new director Ephraim Halevy has contributed a
lot for the release of its agent in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Five agents of Mossad, Israel's state intelligence and
spy organization, took part in a telephone bugging operation in
Switzerland in February this year and all of them were caught
red-handed by the Swiss police. The Swiss police let four of them
leave the country, but kept one agent for trial due to the failed
operation.
</P>
<P>
Swiss authority announced in Berne Saturday that the Mossad
agent was released on a heavy bail, but did not give the exact
sum paid by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss authority also said the agent was allowed to return
to Israel, but he would return to Switzerland when asked to stand
further trial.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad's failed operation in Switzerland was the second in
recent months following its failed assassination attempt on Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement) leader Khaled Masha'al last
September in Amman. The failed operations forced former
Mossad chief Danny Yatom to resign.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Protection of Land Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Land Administration
official said today that China plans to adopt strict land-use
regulations to protect its land resources.
</P>
<P>
"An amendment to the Land-Use Law scheduled for deliberation
tomorrow during the Second meeting of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee defines social interests as the top
priority for the use of land," according to Gan Zangchun,
department director of the State Land and Natural Resources
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment will play a decisive role in protecting land
resources," said Gan at a one-day seminar sponsonered by the
Chinese Association for International Understanding and the Japan
Academy of Land Law.
</P>
<P>
Gan, who is also in charge of drafting the amendment, said the
Land-Use Law, the first land-use law since 1986, failed to meet
the needs for enforcing land management and providing practical
protection for arable lands due to the transformation of both the
economic system and economic growth mode, as well as China's
accelerated industrialization and urbanization.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment will ensure an increase of arable land, and
the scale of land earmarked for construction should be fully
considered in the nation's overall planning, said Gan.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the draft includes measures for protecting
farmland, an approval system for requisitioning arable lands and
penalties for related violations.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources indicate that the draft is the latest step the
Chinese government has adopted to show its determination to
effectively protect land resources.
</P>
<P>
The one-year moratorium on the use of arable land for
non-agricultural purposes introduced last April effectively curbed
the trend towards land abuse and paved the way for establishing a
dynamic equilibrium for arable land.
</P>
<P>
Gan told Xinhua that China's land sectors are prepared to
cooperate with foreign counterparts to advance related domestic
legislations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the pending commercialization of housing in China
will proceed in line with the Land-Use Law and will promote the
rational use of land resources.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiangyang, general manager of the Beijing Eastern Huarui
Real Estate Consulting Co. Ltd. said the Land-Use Law and Law on
Real Estate will continue to guide development of the real estate
industry. He added that the draft will ensure better protection
for rational land use.
</P>
<P>
Liang expressed hope that regulations related to the real
estate industry, including housing prices, will be clearly
stipulated in order to promote the sound and timely development of
the industry.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Boris Yeltsin prevailed over his opponents in
the lower house of the Russian parliament and won confirmation
as prime minister of Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
-- The sudden burst of airline alliances has concerned
government officials who said that the proposed deals may
warrant a broad look at whether the airline plans would violate
anti-trust laws or result in unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Reacting to warnings that heavy fighting in Yugoslavia was
on the verge of spilling over into Albania, U.S. administration
officials said the United States would seek a freeze on Yugoslav
assets held overseas and a stiffer ban on trade with the
Belgrade government as punishment for the bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- A standoff between the United States and Russia apparently
derailed plans for a Security Council debate next week on
changing the emphasis of the Iraqi nuclear inspection process

<HEADLINE> Iran Against Transferring Oil Through Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister
for Training and Research Affairs Gholamali Khoshroo reiterated
Saturday that Iran is against the proposed contract between
Turkmenistan and the U.S. on transferring oil through the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Khoshroo as
saying that Iran opposes the contract because of its dangerous
ecological impacts.
</P>
<P>
Since the sea's movement is toward Iran, the country will be
more vulnerable to danger as a result of the transfer of oil through
pipelines on the Caspian Sea bed, he said, adding that the
slightest pollution will contaminate Iran's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan and the U.S. are reportedly trying to conclude a
contract on studying the possibility of laying pipelines on the
Caspian Sea bed to connect Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan for
transferring oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Wednesday announced
Iran's opposition to laying pipeline on the Caspian Sea bed,
saying that no party should take unilateral measures against the
rights of other littoral states of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Khoshroo also said that Iran is against unilateral utilization
of the Caspian Sea reserves and believed that any kind of
bilateral agreements in this respect must be approved by all the
five littoral states, namely, Iran, Azerbajan, Turkmenistan,
Russia and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the 6th seminar on Central Asia and Caucasia
will be held in Tehran on April 27-28 with the participation of
experts and researchers from 17 countries to review issues related
to energy and economy in the Caspian Sea as well as transfer of
oil and gas from this region.
</P>
<P>
He said the two-day seminar will discuss the role of regional
powers in resolving disputes and attaining economic development
and regional and extraterritorial viewpoints on security of the
Caspian Sea, oil and gas lines.
</P>
<P>
Due to the importance of the sea and under the proposal of the
participants, he said, a special gathering on economy and energy
in the Caspian Sea will be held on the sidelines of the
seminar.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Replica Ocean-going Ship Visits Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Pride of Baltimore II, a
replica of American commercial ship Topsail Schooner Circa 1812,
arrived here on Friday for a week-long visit on its first Asian
Tour.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill ambassador for the State of Maryland, Baltimore
and the Port of Baltimore, the ship had started "The Asia with
Pride Tour" last December from Baltimore's famous Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
After a four-month-long voyage, the ship arrived in Shanghai on
April 1, which was the first port of call on the tour. It later
visited Xiamen at China's southeastern coast, before arriving in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Baltimore Pride II and its 12-member crew will also visit such
Chinese ports like Guangzhou in South China and Kaohsiung and
Keelung in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After calls to South Korean and Japanese ports, the ship will
return to Baltimore around the end of November this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the destinations on the Tour schedule are corporate
headquarters of three of Baltimore's largest customers -- the
China Ocean Shipping Company in Shanghai, Evergreen Marine in
Kaohsiung and Toyota Motor Corporation in Nagoya, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Asia, which economy is developing so fast, is an important
part of the world," said Captain Jan Miles.
</P>
<P>
And he was obviously impressed by the amount of fishing ships
when Baltimore Pride II approached Shanghai in East China. "It is
really amazing to see so many Chinese ships around you," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter-long vehicle also features an instructional
program and a teacher aboard, Leslie Anne Bridgett, who is funded
through a federal "Christa McAuliffe" scholarship program and
selected through a statewide contest. She is sending back to
schools, via satellite and the Internet, log, pictures and stories
about life aboard Pride II and her adventures in the ports of call
on the tour.
</P>
<P>
"It is a once-in-a-life chance. And I really enjoy the voyage
and being part of it," she said. Five of the crew members are
female.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Combats Youth Crime: HK Security Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Peter Lai, secretary for
security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said here
Saturday that combating youth crime is one of the government's
priority tasks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the "Right Decisions
Program" organized by the Hong Kong Junior Chamber, Lai noted that
in coping with the problem of youth crime, a three-pronged
approach including prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation has
been adopted over the years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, an Action Plan to Tackle the Problem of Juvenile Crime
was announced, which has put forward a number of specific measures
to meet the objective of "prevention is better than cure," Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the main initiatives of the Action Plan was the
establishment of a Student Discipline Team devoted to the
provision of professional support to schools on matters relating
to student discipline.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997/98 academic year, the team provided professional
advice to about 150 primary and secondary schools on how to deal
with "problem students."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, training courses on the same subject were
organized for about 400 discipline teachers of primary and
secondary schools in Hong Kong, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
In order to reintegrate young offenders into the community,
cautioned young offenders are referred by the police to
non-governmental organizations under the Community Support Service
Scheme for followup.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, publicity efforts have been strengthened by making
"Fight Youth Crime" the theme of the Fight Crime Publicity
Campaigns in the past three years, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that compared with 1995, the total number of
young offenders in 1996 dropped by 8 percent, from which there was
a further decrease of 11.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend continued in 1998, with the total figure for
the first two months dropping by 12.5 percent when compared with
the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This persisting downward trend shows that the measures
mentioned above are effective in fighting youth crime," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is no room for complacency and we are committed
to further improving our existing services. In this connection,
the Research on the Effectiveness of Rehabilitation Programs for
Young Offenders was completed recently," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
As recommended by the research, the Correctional Services
Department (CSD) has set up a new Rehabilitation Division in
January to ensure better coordination of its rehabilitation
programs and aftercare services, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
The CSD and Social Services Department (SWD) have widened the
spectrum of practical subjects for inmates to include computer
studies and language courses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CSD has also increased the group counseling sessions
conducted by aftercare staff in half-way houses from five to eight
per week, Lai added.

<HEADLINE> Nomination for HK's Legislative Election Successful: Local papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers issued
editorials here Saturday, describing as a complete success the
nomination of candidates for the first Legislative Council
election in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The two-week-long nomination ended Friday with a total of 166
candidates nominated for the May 24 election, after deducting
seven withdrawals and two invalid nominations.
</P>
<P>
A commentary by Ta Kung Pao said the number of candidates for
the coming legislative election has exceeded those for the
previous Legislative Council elections before Hong Kong returned
to China last July.
</P>
<P>
This fully shows the local people's greater political
enthusiasm under the principles of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that continued efforts should be made to imbue
the 2.8 million registered voters throughout Hong Kong with the
same political zeal so as to ensure that the election will be
conducted in a fair and civilized manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wen Wei Po noted in an editorial that the record
number of candidates for the first Legislative Council election of
the HKSAR indicates that the Hong Kong people have really become
their own masters after Hong Kong's return to the motherland and
their consciousness about their civic duties and participation has
been greatly raised.
</P>
<P>
It also offers the registered voters more choices during the
election and helps implement the principle of balanced
participation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the 166 candidates come from various
sectors and strata of society in Hong Kong, thus laying the
foundation for the implementation of the principle of balanced
participation in the election which is an embodiment of the
democratic spirit and conforms to the actual situation in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The interests and demands of every sector and stratum of
society in Hong Kong should be fully reflected in the Legislative
Council. Only by doing so, can Hong Kong's social stability and
economic prosperity be maintained, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Macao Exports Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The export value of Macao between
January and February this year dropped by 10.4 percent from the
same period last year, the latest official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department on Friday nigh, exports in the first two
months of 1998 amounted to 2 billion patacas (about 250 million
U.S. dollars), down 236 million patacas (about 29.5 million
dollars) from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports also dropped in the period by 9.2 percent,
to less than 2 billion patacas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Macao recorded a trade surplus of 73 million
patacas (about 9.1 million dollars), down 35 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports and imports is believed to be a result of
the Asian financial crisis, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
About 81 percent of Macao's exports were garments and textile
goods, mainly to such destinations as the United States and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The leading import market for Macao was the Asian-Pacific
region, which supplied about 80 percent of its imported goods. The
imports of capital goods, raw materials and semi-finished and
consumer goods all declined.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Auction Aid Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will put
on public auction all fertilizers it receives as commodity aid
from donor nations instead of disbursing them as loans to traders
in the past.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest weekly Market Bulletin issued by the
Agricultural Market Information Center at the Ministry of
Agriculture, the fertilizers will be sold through auctioning.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism for auctioning aid commodities are being worked
out by the Ministry of Finance, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
"This is a departure from the system used to dispose last
year's commodity aid fertilizers which were disbursed as loans to
traders," it said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Host HIV/AIDS Workshop in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A workshop on HIV/AIDS
will be held next month in the isles of Zanzibar, the Guardian
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing a statement issued by the United Nations
Information Center, said that the workshop will be conducted by
the UN special sector based in Dakar of Senegal, which deals with
HIV/AIDS and social development.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will analyze the effects of HIV and propose plans
which the government, private sectors, non-governmental
organizations and donor agencies should follow to eradicate the
hazards of HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In major medical centers in Tanzania, such as Muhimbili,
Bugando and Bukoba, half of hospital beds are used by the HIV
infected patients leading to high costs of running health
services in the country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement further said that the hazards have hindered
economic development and caused discrimination and denial of
basic rights such as job opportunities, education and medical
treatment. A number of the infected persons have become social
outcasts.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop will be organized by the Zanzibar AIDS
Campaign Program, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Purchase Scheme Helps HK Tenants Buy Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's director of housing
said here Saturday that many former tenants of the Housing
Authority have realized the dream of owning their own homes
thanks to the smooth implementation of the Tenants Purchase Scheme
(TPS).
</P>
<P>
More than 190 former tenants at the six estates scheduled for
the first phase of the TPS, which was launched by the government
last January, have recently executed their assignments to join the
ranks of Hong Kong's proud home owners, Tony Miller told a
ceremony to mark the birth of the first batch of TPS home owners.
</P>
<P>
Under the TPS, more than 26,000 families from six estates were
invited to buy their own rental units at very attractive prices,
set at 12 percent of the assessed market value.
</P>
<P>
Miller reaffirmed the contribution of the TPS in fulfilling the
government's target of achieving 70 percent home ownership by
2007.
</P>
<P>
"The TPS has enjoyed overwhelming support from prospective
purchasers. So far, over 12,000 families have already made formal
applications for purchase while tenants from estates not yet
selected have also indicated strong interest in early inclusion in
the scheme," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Another 84,000 families are expected to benefit from the TPS
in the next three years in line with the long-term objective of
providing at least 250,000 families the opportunities for home
ownership over a 10-year period," he added.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- David Lan, secretary for home
affairs, said here Saturday that the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is placing priority on the
May Legislative Council election.
</P>
<P>
"We are attaching importance to it because this presents us
with the first opportunity to select our first legislature to show
that Hong Kong people are quite capable of ruling themselves as
promised in the Basic Law," Lan said at a press conference here.
"The eyes of the world media would be focused on us."
</P>
<P>
He reminded registered voters that they have not only a civic
responsibility to cast their sacred ballots, but that they should
also realize that their participation would affect the development
of the political process in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lan expressed the belief that the electoral arrangement is
fair, open and honest and it should culminate in the election of a
credible and representative legislature, provided the electorate
gives it the full support it deserves.
</P>
<P>
Announcing details of an election publicity program, Shelley
Lau, director of home affairs, promised an all-out joint effort
with local organizations to carry the election message practically
to the doorsteps of the electorate.
</P>

All promotional tactics proven to be effective are being
resorted to, she said. They include roving exhibitions, special
programs and regular announcements on the radio and TV, posters,
pamphlets, advertisements, briefings for various groups,
audio-visual presentations, parades and carnivals, appeal messages
from well-known personalities, a wide range of useful souvenirs
and speeches by senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the
Electoral Affairs Commission, briefed candidates on the guidelines
for election-related activities at the Hong Kong Convention and

<HEADLINE> HKUST Drive Raises Public Awareness of Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An Environmental Protection Day
organized by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
(HKUST) on Saturday called on the public to pay more attention to
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the campaign, Robert Law,
director of the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong,
said it is important for the public and the community to know and
understand environmental issues although the government has to
play a big role on such issues.
</P>
<P>
He described the HKUST effort as "valuable, saying such
activities will make it easier to solve the existing environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department also
urged public support and awareness on environmental issues. The
rich technological resources in Hong Kong's institutions of higher
learning should contribute to the protection of the environment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Environmental Protection Day organized by
the HKUST following a successful campaign on the same day in 1997.
Several hundred people, including the university's faculty members
and students, high-school students and some tourists, joined the
event.
</P>
<P>
Activities of the day included seminars on red tide and the El
Nino phenomenon, a workshop for paper recycling, tree planting and
beaches cleanup. An activity coordinator said the campaign focuses
on education concerning environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
This year participants paid particular attention to red tide,
which has caused millions of HK dollars in losses to the fishing
industry and other sectors in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Dismisses Western Sanction Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not be deterred by
any sanctions from the West, according to Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Alhaji Buhari Baba.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks Friday following the threat of
further sanctions by Britain and the United States after the
country's political parties nominated the head of state General
Sani Abacha as their consensus candidate for the August 1
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will continue to move on despite the threat, because
"this is not the first time we have been sanctioned, yet there
are functional projects in place," he said, quoted by the
Guardian Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Britain and the U.S. of "trying to undermine
the transition to civil rule program."
</P>
<P>
They don't recognize the sovereignty of Nigeria as a country
that has total control of its internal affairs, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
All the five registered parties in Nigeria last week adopted
Abacha as their sole presidential candidate. The development was
alleged by Britain and the U.S. to be a result of government
manipulation of the transition program.
</P>
<P>
However, Baba argued that all had been done under the guidance
of laws and in line with the established procedure and the
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"So it is not enough excuse for the U.S. or Britain to impose
any sanction on Nigeria or to interfere in Nigeria's internal
affairs," said Baba.
</P>
<P>
"They have done that (sanction) before, yet we have continued
to survive it. There are several road construction projects, we
have medicines in hospitals and our educational institutions are
functioning. So even if they impose sanctions, I don't see that
posing any problem to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the European Parliament of funding
pro-democracy groups in the country to "sabotage the transition
program".

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Citizens Demonstrate Charitable Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- On weekend mornings, middle
school students wearing ribbons printed with words "Messengers of
Charity in Guangzhou" can be seen walking urban streets to raise
money for charitable purposes.
</P>
<P>
They usually stick badges with the sign of a heart on the
clothing of those who donate money.
</P>
<P>
The charity program, launched two years ago, has attracted an
increasing number of local citizens with donations exceeding
800,000 yuan (96,380 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lu Beila, secretary of the Guangzhou City Charity Federation,
said that the donations are mainly used to help students suffering
a serious illness with insufficient funds for proper health
treatments.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the "Messenger of Charity," Guangzhou citizens
are also active in other charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
They donated more than 8 million yuan (963,850 U.S. dollars) to
build a children's welfare center. In 1996, they donated 5.03
million yuan (606,000 U.S. dollars) to help residents of the
earthquake-hit Lijiang area in Yunnan Province build two middle
schools, one welfare center and a concert hall.
</P>
<P>
"The Light of Charity Evening Party," another major program
launched in the city in 1995, has raised 15 million yuan (1.8
million U.S. dollars) during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The city charity federation has received more than 70 million
yuan (8.43 million U.S. dollars) in donations since it was set up
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Marchers Against Child Labor Arrive in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four Asian participants in
a global march against child labor have arrived in Iran from
Pakistan through Mirjaveh border point in the southeastern
province of Sistan-Baluchesan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA Saturday quoted the

Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American leg of the global march started on February
25 in Brazil and the African march began on March 21. In Europe,

<HEADLINE> Overseas Territories Against Paris Marking End of Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- France's overseas territories are
against Paris' plan for the 150th anniversary of the abolition of
slavery, describing it as hypocrisy and an insult for ex-slaves.
</P>
<P>
The French government is preparing a grand celebration for the
anniversary of the abolition of black slavery in its former
colonies, some of which are now called overseas territories.
</P>
<P>
The Second Republic issued a decree on the abolition on April
27, 1848.
</P>
<P>
However, the people of four major overseas territories -- the
Martinique, Guadeloupe in the Caribbeans, Guyana in the South
American continent, and the Reunion in the Indian Ocean -- are
sceptical and call it "the celebration of former slave owners."
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said in an editorial Saturday that France
should not celebrate the event "upside-down," because it should
not only mark those who contributed to the abolition of slavery,
but also should memorize the Africans who were sold from their
homes to servitude in America in three centuries.
</P>
<P>
The inhabitants of the four territories have been calling on
the French government to formally recognize slave trade and
slavery as "crime against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Deeply disappointed by Paris' indifference to their call, they
now feel that the celebration itself is "a slap in the face" and
"a dispossession" for them, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the United States, which has a tradition of separating
completely blacks from the whites, the French were more tolerant
with a mixture of race between the Africans and the French in
their colonies in America.
</P>
<P>
However, racism and discrimination still persist and are
strongly felt by the descendants of Africans in those territories.
</P>
<P>
"This injury and this sadness are in us and have never been
driven away," said Serge Chalon, a doctor serving the Medecin du
Monde humanitarian group living in Fort-de-France, Martinique.
</P>
<P>
The bitterness is worsened by the erection of a white stone
statue in Martinique in memory of a boat which sank during his
trip from Africa to America, drowning all the African slaves and
slave traders on board.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group Chief in Congo Republic for Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Jaffre, Chairman and
Managing Director of the French oil group Elf-Aquitaine, visited
the Congo Republic Saturday to discuss the country's huge debt.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso in
Brazzaville, Jaffre asked the Congo government to "convince the
fund donors to reschedule the debt," Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
With huge interests in the West African oil producing country,
Elf is said to help rebuild the economy devastated last year by a
war between Sassou-Nguesso and his predecessor, Pascal Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
The debt came from the credits provided by world oil groups
investing in Congo and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mathias Dzon said the former government of
President Lissouba owed international creditors 357 billion CFA
franc (about 595 million U.S. dollars), almost half the country's
annual oil income.
</P>
<P>
Dzon asked the creditors to reduce by 25 percent of the debt,
the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
and rival Northern Alliance will begin here Sunday their first
face-to-face talks in more than a year, a Pakistani Foreign Office
spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The first session of the (Afghan Joint) Steering Committee
will start here Sunday at 10 a.m.," the spokesman announced when
addressing a news conference Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides of the Afghan political divide are
getting together here in a preparatory process in the form of the
steering committee for eventual substantive negotiations to
promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is playing host to the first formal meeting
between the Taliban and representatives of Northern Alliance
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The steering committee is primarily to discuss and finalize
the modalities for the meeting of the Afghan Ulema (religious
scholar)," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance was
made possible after hectic diplomatic efforts by the United
Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Pakistan,
Iran and other countries which have influence on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It was first announced that the Afghan Joint Steering Committee
would meet here Saturday. However, according to sources in the
Foreign Office, the Taliban delegation will not reach here until
3:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Ulema Commission, which was proposed by the Taliban, will
bear the responsibility of deciding the future political setup in
Afghanistan if and when it is established.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been some differences between the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance on the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Friday reiterated their stance that the main item
on the talks agenda should be the formation of the Ulema
Commission while the Northern Alliance has emphasized that the
meeting should also deliberate on a cease-fire and exchange of
prisoners.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- When veterinarian Yang Qiqing
got to his clinic in Shanghai every morning, many patients had
been already waiting for him. Extraordinarily, his patients were
not people but cats, dogs, pigeons, parrots, rabbits and monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Yang said his patients usually suffer from cold, enteritis and
dermatitis, and some are plagued by infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the owners of the pets ask me to cut down the pets'
nails, or do beauty treatment, or carry out caesarean operation,"
said Yang as he was giving fluid infusion for a two-month-old dog.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the owners are very rich, and they are often at
leisure, and they live in large apartments. Some are foreigners
working in Shanghai, and some are senior citizens living alone,"
said Yang, adding, "They love their pets very much."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I was called at mid-night to give emergency
treatment. But I love my job, because I love those little
creatures."
</P>
<P>
Raising pets becomes increasingly popular in this metropolitan
in recent years. Statistics show the number of dogs with license
in the city exceed 50,000. Numerous pet markets, pet shops and pet
hospitals cropped up along streets.
</P>
<P>
Running pet hospital in the city should get appraisal from the
Shanghai Veterinarian Hygiene Inspection Institute, and the pet
doctors should also pass strict examination and get licenses. At
present, the city has more than a dozen pet hospitals, with over
50 qualified pet doctors.

The battle broke out last Sunday in Lamwo county, northern
Kitgum District when the Sudan-backed rebels tried to penetrate
further into the district, the official newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Khalil Magara, the Public Relation Officer of the
Fourth Division, the Ugandan army has killed 20 rebels Wednesday
alone.
</P>
<P>
The details of the battle on Thursday are sketchy and
commanders were trying to collect them, Magara added.
</P>
<P>
The captured rebels revealed that the number of invading
rebels is estimated between 200 and 400.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army and local defense units in Kitgum and
adjacent Gulu District have been put on full alert since Sunday,
the officer told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Marchall Odur, the regional police commander in the north,
confirmed the battle to the paper and noted that the fighting was
still under way up to Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group active in the northern districts of
Kitgum and Gulu. But it has now only hundreds of remnants and it
has some camps in southern Sudan. In previous years, it had some
2,000 fighters.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an earlier report said, the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), another rebel group active in west
Uganda, has been driven by the combined operations of the Ugandan
army and the troops of the Democratic Republic of Congo from the
hideouts in the border areas between the two countries into
Uganda and that will enable the Ugandan army to eradicate them
more easily.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Boasts Highest Per Capita Number of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, with a population of 4.2
million, boasts the highest per capita number of universities in
the Middle East region, the semi-official English daily Jordan
Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase of privately-owned universities during
the past years helps Jordan become the country to boast the
highest per capita number of universities in the region, the
paper quoted Munther Masri, head of Jordan's Human Resource
Development Center and former education minister, as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are now 20 universities - seven public and 13 private -
as well as 50 community colleges in the country, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Since the country lifted a ban on setting up private
universities in 1993, the number of such universities jumped from
five to 13. In the meantime, the number of publicly-owned
universities stayed stable.
</P>
<P>
The private universities were established to meet the
increasing demand of the influx of foreign students, Masri said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with 22 million people, has 13 accredited universities,
while Lebanon and Syria, with populations of 3.4 million and 16
million, respectively, have nine and four universities, according
to the newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac is
scheduled to visit Japan from April 27 to 29.
</P>
<P>
The visit, during Japan's "Year of France" cultural exchange
program starting last year, is to show France's "confidence in and
solidarity with" Japan amid a major economic crisis, said French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Another objective, said Colonna, is to boost France's two
percent share of Japan's market and to cut its five billion franc
(about 800 million U.S. dollar) annual trade deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The negative effects from Japan's economic crisis is being felt
in France, although not as strongly as other European countries,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will inaugurate the "Statue of Liberty" in the Bay of
Tokyo, a saloon of French farming products in the Japanese
capital, and address the Japanese employers' association Keidaren.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he will also hold talks with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and meet Emperor Akihito.

<HEADLINE> 80 Suspected Drug Traffickers Arrested in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- 80 suspected drug traffickers
were arrested in Zambia in the past 10 days, Zambia Daily Mail
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Drugs worth 20.9 million Kwacha (about 11,600 U.S. Dollars)
were seized in the continued crackdown on drug peddlers in the
country, according to the state-owned newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC), Mukutulu
Sinyani, said in Nakonde, northern Zambia Friday that the newly
established Mansa DEC office seized 52 kgs of marijuana, nearly
half of the quantity seized from the 80 suspected traffickers.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 227 grams of opium and 31 tablets of
valium were seized.
</P>
<P>
The threat of cocaine on the copper belt is steadily gaining
momentum, Sinyani said, citing the seizure from illegal peddlers
of 50 milliliters of lidocaine, a component of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
He warned the culprits that the commission will not leave any
stone unturned in combing the streets off the dangerous drug.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Immigration has in the past two
days arrested 26 illegal immigrants in its continued crackdown
operations.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Department Public Relations Official Royn Miyanda
said here Friday that of the arrested, 13 aliens were nabbed in
Kitwe in copper belt.
</P>
<P>
When they were in their operations, the Immigration officials
were almost attacked by a group of foreigners suspectedly mainly
of west African origin.
</P>
<P>
The aliens tried to resist and block the officials from
arresting them.
</P>
<P>
Six were arrested in Lusaka while an American woman has been
ordered to leave Zambia within seven days because she was found
to have over stayed, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany has donated 2.5
million deutsche marks (about 1.35 million US dollars) as an
emergency assistance to refugees from Rwanda, Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Republic of Congo, Dar es
Salaam newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a statement from the German embassy in Dar es Salaam,
the newspapers said the fund will be used to promote the
repatriation of refugees, provide international protection and
assistance in countries of asylum to refugees who cannot return
home and assist the rehabilitation of refugee-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The donation was in response to an appeal made by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for assisting
refugees and refugee-affected countries in the Great Lakes region
and west Africa, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the fund will assist UNHCR in protecting and
taking care of 330,000 refugees currently in Kigoma and Kagera
regions and preparing provision of assistance to projected 20,000
to 40,000 new refugees who may flow in from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It will also help the repatriation of some 50,000 refugees to
return to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> French Press Doubt Over Russia's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the Russian State
Duma's confirmation of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, the French
press Saturday expressed doubt over Russia's political stability.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said the new cabinet has a hard time: a
dying industry, falling state revenues, angry unpaid workers, a
60-percent deficit in the budget, and a disillusioned middle class.
</P>
<P>
"The success of Boris Yeltsin (in forcing the State Duma, or
the lower house of parliament, to adopt Kiriyenko) is mirrored by
a worrying political landscape: a president weakened by illness
and becoming more and more authoritarian, a fragile prime minister
and a strong parliament," said an article in Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
By adopting Kiriyenko, said the daily L'Humanite, a great
number of the Russian parliamentary members apparently wished to
keep their posts in the "new nomenclature" rather than risk a
universal suffrage by the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
The people of Russia "could have much to say" if they were
invited to vote, said the daily published by the French Communist
Party.

<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Five persons were killed and 14
others seriously injured when a suspected bomb exploded Thursday
night in the ancient city of Ile-Ife, in southwest Nigeria's Osun
State.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the incident occurred around 8:00 p.m. at a
busy spot in the Sabo area of the town, causing demages to nearby
vehicles and buildings.
</P>
<P>
The victims were rushed to the Obafemi Awolowo Teaching
Hospital Complex for treatment.

State police commissioner Sunday Agbede denied Friday that the
explosion has anything to do with the ethnic conflicts in the
town, which has led to dozens of deaths in recent eruptions of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Ile-Ife came barely 24 hours after a huge
explosion killed three persons and injured several others in
Lagos, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Osun State Administrator Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Obi, who
visited the site, condemned the explosions in strong terms, saying
that they were designed to derail the country's political transition

<HEADLINE> Talks With IMF Successful: Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations between the
Zimbabwean government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for financial support were successful, Zimbabwean Minister of
Finance Herbert Murerwa has said.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald newspaper Saturday quoted Murerwa as saying
the negotiations for three billion Zimbabwean Dollars (180
million U.S. Dollars) standby facility for the balance of
payments support have been successful.
</P>
<P>
The initial disbursement of the money is expected next month,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Friday, Murerwa said that the
negotiations were concluded in Washington last week and the IMF's
executive board was expected to come up with its final decision
early next month.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa, who led the Zimbabwean delegation to Washington,
dismissed the reports saying that the negotiations had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
He said that everything was still on course.
</P>
<P>
"Our negotiations with the IMF in Washington last week were
very successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that once the IMF board comes up with a decision,
some 875 million Zimbabwean Dollars (51 million U.S. Dollars)
will be made available, while the balance was expected to be
released in tranches based on the end-of-quarter performance
criteria.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has been satisfied with the Zimbabwean government's
budget proposals, which made it possible for the organisation's
board to consider the country's request for the three billion
Zimbabwean Dollars standby arrangement.
</P>
<P>
It had also been agreed that salaries and wages of civil
servants be within the stipulated limits so that they would not
be a drain on the country's financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister said an IMF delegation would visit Zimbabwe from
May 19 to 26 this year to be updated on the macro-economic
framework that had been agreed with the Zimbabwean government in
January.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Raises Import Duties to Fund Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Cabinet has decided to
increase customs duties on cigarettes by 10 percent and an
across-the-board 2 percent additional tax on other imports as
sources of revenue for the long-delayed salary scales for civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Information Minister Bassem
al-Sabaa following a cabinet meeting at the presidential palace
Friday night, the Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa said customs duties on cigarettes and all tobacco
produce were raised by 10 percent and the more general 2 percent
hike would cover all other imports, including petrol and
industrial raw materials, some of which had been exempted from
customs duties to encourage local industries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rise in customs duties, which range from 2
percent on necessities to 100 percent on luxury cars, would have
"no impact on the poor class and those with limited income."
</P>
<P>
All civil servants would benefit from the new scales,
including those who would have retired by the time the payments
begin, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Since Lebanese Parliament endorsed a bill to increase civil
servants' salary starting from January, 1996, the government has
owed 600 billion Lebanese pounds (about 394 million U.S. dollars)
to the employees.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy and Trade Yassin Jaber told the newspaper
that the tax increase could raise an annual sum of between 215
billion pounds (about 141 million dollars) and 240 billion
pounds (about 157 million dollars), but additional funds will be
needed to cover the amounts owed since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sabba said that the government would look into additional
sources of revenue for the salary scales during its regular
session on Wednesday before sending the bill to parliament for
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
By levying the additional taxes now and deferring paying,
government officials said, the government will be better placed
to keep the budget deficit at its forecast level of 42 percent for
1998.
</P>
<P>
This would help improve the country's credit ratings by
international institutions which have given poor ratings to
Lebanon's status, they added.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Causes Tattered Kenyan Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has no
money and corruption is rampant, leading to the current "tattered
economy" of the country, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae has
said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday at a think-tank meeting of
parliamentary members, bankers and foreign donors at the Indian
Ocean port of Mombasa, also Kenya's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
Corruption in high posts has contributed directly to the
mismanagement of Kenya's financial affairs, making the national
economy in bad shape, the minister was quoted by the daily Nation
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Corruption was holding back economic growth in the east
African country, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
"It was a rare occasion when the government accepted it was
not succeeding in its effort to stamp out corruption," a source
at the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae said the government can no longer pay for the bloated
civil service and cuts in this sector must take place "as a
reality" toward breaking the perennial budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
It was not possible to impose more taxes on the people as they
are already overtaxed, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya Micah
Cheserem said in western city Eldoret that the government has
stepped up measures to collect revenue and reduce corruption
which has caused shortage of funds to rehabilitate economy.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is really worrisome. But I am happy that
measures to reverse the trend are being effected seriously," he
claimed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Besieged by Postal Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The on-going postal strike in Sri
Lanka has severely affected the country's economy and
administration, government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 postal sorters at the country's Central Mail
Exchange have been on strike since March 11, demanding overtime
pay and other enhanced economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
The overtime boycott-turned-strike has left the country's
postal service nearly paralyzed as millions of letters have been
left undelivered and mail bags piled up at the Colombo harbor and
the Bandaranaike International Airport.
</P>
<P>
At the Central Mail Exchange more than 6 million letters remain
unsorted.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike, public examinations had to be postponed as
students did not receive their admission cards and timetables. The
strike also interrupted the scheduled sale of public debentures,
local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The worst-affected are pensioners, dependents of those employed
 abroad and police personnel serving in operational areas.
</P>
<P>
Government officials quoted Acting Minister of Posts Anura
Priyadarshana Yapa as saying cabinet ministers and ministry
officials have held protracted talks with the trade unionists in
an effort to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
But the efforts have produced no results as the unionists
changed their stance and added new demands during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The government actually had offered to meet all the demands of
the postal workers, but then the unions insisted on a final
demand, the removal of Postmaster General H. M. S. Kotakadeniya,
which the government rejected.
</P>
<P>
To increase pressure on the unions, President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Friday night promulgated emergency regulations to
declare the postal and telecommunications departments as
"essential services," effective from 06:00 a.m. (local time)
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, security forces and police moved into the
Central Mail Exchange on Friday night and arrested several union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Workers must return to work Saturday or face consequences under
the emergency regulations, said Kotakadeniya.
</P>
<P>
The consequences may include being forcibly brought to work
under military escort or being detained.

<HEADLINE> Over 200,000 Rwandans Need Food Aid: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 200,000 Rwandans need
food aid to carry them through to the next harvest in July,
sources at the World Food Program (WFP) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in seven prefectures in the tiny central
African state did not harvest a good crop earlier this year due
to the El Nino-charged rains and flooding over the past several
months, said the WFP Nairobi office.
</P>
<P>
Many of the areas where starvation bites "are traditionally
food-insecure," Gerard van Dijk, WFP's Representative in Rwanda,
was quoted by a WFP report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in these areas are forced to cultivate on arid
soils or steep slopes as a result of land pressure. Others are
living in villages where there are too many people trying to
survive on too little land," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, small setbacks in a harvest can be devastating
for these people," he said.
</P>
<P>
WFP's feeding centers there now are filling-up with more
children suffering from varying levels of malnutrition, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Food prices have dramatically increased over the last few
weeks -- a typical pattern that occurs when the country is
between harvests, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Prices for staple foods like beans are reaching record
levels," said van Dijk, "On average people are being forced to
pay 30-40 percent more for basic food items compared to last
year. Those living in urban areas are hit hardest since they
have to buy virtually all their food."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food aid agency now is seeking to increase its
assistance to Rwanda and has given the go-ahead for several new
projects, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
WFP said it is currently providing 3,500 tons of food every
month to 160,000 people in Rwanda. By May the agency hopes to
have raised its aid to more than 5,000 tons reaching some 360,000
Rwandans.

<HEADLINE> S. African Drug Dealer Jailed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A South African woman has been
sentenced to 15 years in prison by Zimbabwe's High Court, the
daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Beverly Esabel Parker, a drug courier, was jailed for
unlawfully importing into Zimbabwe cocaine worth more than 1.8
million Zimbabwean Dollars (over 106,000 U.S. Dollars), the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Chinhengo (only one name available) slapped Parker, 28,
with an additional 15,000 Zimbabwean Dollars (880 U.S. Dollars)
fine or in default of payment five years in jail for importing
3.62 kg of cocaine into Zimbabwe from Venezuela via Holland.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Police arrested Parker at Harare International
Airport on June 18 last year, following a tip-off by their
counterparts in Holland.
</P>
<P>
Parker was searched and found in possession of the cocaine
which was concealed in 10 sealed tins labeled as "Purina Chunky
dog food."
</P>
<P>
Judge Chinhengo noted that Zimbabwe was a signatory to
international conventions outlawing illicit drug trafficking
which has become a menace in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a duty to ensure that its territory is not used
to ship dangerous drugs across territorial boundaries, the judge
said.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Pollution Control on Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has spent 150 million yuan
(about 18 million US dollars) in building various kinds of
pollution control facilities on the Yangtze River, the longest in
the country, and will invest more funds in the years to come, a
leading environmental protection official said today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 meter-long barriers have been built around the
ports and harbors to block the spread of fuel oil from wrecked
ships, and a group of mobile pollution-monitoring stations have
been built and will become operational before June to help
environmental protection authorities keep a close watch on the
river's water quality, said Zhang Tongbin, senior engineer of the
Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of large ships for collecting waterborne refuse has
been patroling the river. These ships are also equipped with
wastewater treatment facilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a regulation issued jointly by the
Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Construction and the
National Environmental Protection Agency became effective in March
and prohibits vessels on the Yangtze from dumping garbage into the
river.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also calls for a halt to dumping household
garbage and industrial waste along the banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River used to be polluted with 30,000 tons of
refuse dumped by ships each year, in addition to more than 360
million tons of liquid containing fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, the third longest river in the world, flows
from the west to the east and meanders through 11 provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The river valley is one of the fastest economic-booming regions
in China, whose gross national product accounting for 40 percent
of the nation's total.

"Despite the relatively good water quality in the mainstream of
the river, a pollution belt stretching more than 500 km. has
formed between 25 coastal cities, with increasing water
contamination in many areas," said Peng Biao, senior engineer of
the monitoring center of the Bureau of Protection of Water
Resources in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
About 15 billion tons of waste water is discharged into the
Yangtze and its tributaries each year, a survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four of the 59 major cities in the valley suffer a water
supply shortage as a result of the pollution, and experts predict
the problem will grow with further economic expansion of the river.
</P>
<P>
Cities in the River valley are paying increasing attention to
the pollution treatment. The city of Shanghai has relocated more
than 800 enterprises from downtown to suburban areas; Chongqing
city has built three waste water treatment plants and closed down
more than 200 small paper mills and coke ovens.
</P>
<P>
The city of Wuhan has introduced funds of 1.7 billion yuan
(about 200 million US Dollars) into urban environmental pollution
treatment, and an urban waste water treatment project has also
been launched.
</P>
<P>
Thirty four large and super-large manufacturing businesses in
eight provinces along the Yangtze River have jointly proposed that
all enterprises along the river reduce their discharge of wastes
and polluting materials into the river at a forum held in January.
</P>
<P>
"The key lies in increasing people's awareness of environmental
protection,"said Zhu Ruming, deputy director of the the shipping
supervisory department of the Yangtze Harbor Superintendency
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Many ships on the river have special personnel to publicize
environmental protection laws and regulations, and they are
authorized to stop crew members and passengers from dumping refuse
into the water.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Develops Technique for Distinguishing Prints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have
developed four techniques to distinguish finger or foot prints
left by criminals.
</P>
<P>
With several pieces of test papers, an amount of special
powder, liquid and a hair-drier, policemen can make the finger or
foot prints of criminals clearly appear within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Luo Ruibiao, an engineer with the public security bureau of
Xinji City of north China's Hebei Province, and his colleagues
have developed techniques for distinguishing dust, blood prints as
well as sweat and body fluid traces.
</P>
<P>
He said finger and foot prints are important evidence for
determining criminals. However, it has long been an headache for
police that it is not easy to distinguish fingerprints on dust,
foot prints on glazed tiles and blood fingerprints on dark and
rough materials.
</P>
<P>
The four techniques have recently passed appraisal by the
Ministry of Public Security. The ministry has decided to spread
the techniques in public security organs nationwide.

<HEADLINE> More Rural Residents in Shanxi Use Clean Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Over one million rural residents
in north China's Shanxi Province have started to use sanitary
toilets instead of traditional ones which used to attract swarms
of flies.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, the old-style latrine was an earthen pit with
two boards on each side and earthen walls standing all around it.
Most rural residents used to build such latrines at a corner of
their courtyards.
</P>
<P>
In some villages of the province, new-style toilets are built
in a designated area, with manure pits underneath.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the provincial health bureau said that the
new-style toilets are clean and can help prevent the spread of
disease.
</P>
<P>
In some places with developed township enterprises, rural
residents have moved into multi-story buildings and they use the
modern toilets as urban residents do.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, farmers in the province's over 100 counties have
been involved in this move.
</P>
<P>
"Toilet Revolution" in Shanxi Province attracted the attention
of the World Health Organization, which sent an investigation team
to the province and decided to launch an "ecological toilet"
campaign in this north China province.

<HEADLINE> UN Fund Used to Curb Sand Shift in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts
in northwest China's Gansu province witnessed major progress in
shifting sand control, water resources development and grassland
improvement in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With the 1.36 million US dollars of funds from a UN body, the
Gansu provincial government started a project of "harnessing
deserts and promoting agriculture", which made great achievements
in introducing new technology, training personnel and eliminating
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a local school of higher learning undertook
22 programs, developed 13 kinds of agriculture technologies, and
improved 20,000 hectares of land for new agriculture products,
benefiting 1,534 peasant families.
</P>
<P>
It also provides various training and 300,000 kilograms of fine
brand seeds to local peasants. The project also improved personnel
quality and research level of the institute, and poured new
elements to traditional agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Due to the project, the living standard of local peasants
largely improved, the average annual income of peasants increased
from 500 yuan at the beginning of the project to the current 1,500
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Namebrand Garments Winning Bigger Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The sales volume of China's
name-brand garments is growing fast, thanks to the accelerated
urbanization drive in the country featuring a swelling
white-collar society.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a clothing industry seminar in Beijing, Wang
Zengjing, vice-chairman of the China Garment Society, said that
families with higher income than the country's average will be the
major consumer for name brands.
</P>
<P>
Once a marketplace mainly supported by a big low-income
population, China's garment market is transferring to a maturer
one oriented to the taste of high-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in the next decade, Chinese people's spending on
clothing will further rise, but the increase margin will be
reduced year on year. So, instead of the blue collars, the
families with middle or high incomes will be the most stable
consuming force on the market.
</P>
<P>
According to a statistics report from the State Economic and
Trade Commission, the combined sales volume of the top five brands
in the categories of suit, shirt, jeans, knitted underwear and
duck-down clothing reached a market share of 25 percent or more
last year. The figure for the top five knitted underwear brands
even hit 61.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yongpeng, president of the Guangdong Pengyun Garment Group,
said that it will be a rather arduous task for Chinese garment
brands to attain global-level reputation. Chinese enterprises have
to develop their own technical edge in addition to the production
scale, so as to survive competition on the international market.
</P>
<P>
As a new technology developed by Wu's company to maintain a
more straight shirt collar, the patent of "PML Magic Collar" was
awarded the golden prize at the '98 China International Garments
and Accessory Exhibition ('98 Chic), which concluded on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Another new technology is the "wooden pulp fiber" presented by
the Rouse Group, a clothing corporation in Zhejiang's Ningbo
City. This patent can largely reduce pollution in clothing
workshops.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yong, director of the organizing committee of '98 Chic,
said that the week-long exhibition, which is only accessible to
hard names from both Chinese and foreign clothing industries, was
attended by 15,000 trade representatives from 26 countries,
registering a direct transaction volume of 2.2 billion yuan and an
indirect one of 3.3 billion yuan.

XI'NING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province set a record in oil and gas discovery, and its combined
oil and gas reserve increased by 70 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 10 percent of the country's total for

<HEADLINE> High Representative Rejects Possibility for Dayton Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The international community's High
Representative Carlos Westendorp has rejected any possibility of
revising the Dayton accord and demanded consistent implementation
of the peace agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp's spokesman Simon Haselock was quoted by Hina, the
Croatian news agency, as saying Friday in Sarajevo that the high
representative had carefully considered proposals by Bosnian
Presidency member Kresimir Zubak's chief of staff Martin Raguz and
other Bosnian Croat officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials suggested in recent press articles the
possibility of new divisions inside Bosnia, which Westendorp had
viewed as inconsistent with the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said Westendorp insisted that the Dayton accord would
remain as the only base for talks on borders, entities and
cantonal divisions, Haselock said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Muslim-Croat Federation as an entity
formally established in Dayton was a responsibility for all sides.
</P>
<P>
The high representative will not support any proposals which
would undermine the peace process, Haselock Warned.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Westendorp, Haselock sent a message to the
initiators of the debate on revising Dayton that they aim their
attention at parts of the peace agreement which concerned
multi-ethnicity, freedom of movement and the rights of all
refugees to return to their homes in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Adamir Jerkovic, spokesperson for Alija Izetbegovic, chairman
of the Presidency of Alija Izetbegovic, said Friday any
discussions about revisions or amendments to Dayton were
unacceptable to the Muslim side.
</P>
<P>
He said the statements by some Croatian officials questioning
the workings of the Dayton accord were in essence an "anti-package
package".
</P>
<P>
Jerkovic said the Dayton agreement as a compromise achieved
with great efforts laid the foundation for the peaceful
coexistence of different nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are against any revision of the Dayton agreement,
because it makes a democratic, multiethnic and multicultural
Bosnia-Herzegovina possible."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the establishment of ethnically pure cantons
in the federation would be an reverse process against civilized
standards, and would also be opposed by the international
community.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 25 (Xinhua) -- "Since we began to use solar
heaters three years ago, we have never lost any animal due to cold
weather," says Bater, a herdsman from a village in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China.
</P>
<P>
Like Bater, all his fellow villagers have set up their own
solar-heated homes to protect the animals from low temperatures
which were a major headache for local herdsmen on the Mongolian
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Since the 80s, especially in the past two years, local
governments have made efforts to popularize the new technology
among grassland residents.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the autonomous region has built up
125,400 square meters of solar-heated residential housing, school
and office buildings, as well as nearly 6.8 million square meters
of solar-heated shelters for animals.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the regional office for new energy
says that by the end of this century, Inner Mongolia is expected
to increase its total area of solar-heated buildings to 150,000
square meters and to have eight million square meters of
solar-heated animal shelters.

<HEADLINE> ADB for Early Devaluation of Indian Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development of Bank
(ADB) has suggested an early devaluation of the Indian rupee to
maintain the country's external competitiveness in the wake of
East Asian currencies' massive depreciation, the Hindustan Times
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian rupee is now significantly overvalued compared with
the depreciated currencies of Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia,
the Philippines and Thailand, the newspaper quoted a recent
publication of ADB as saying.
</P>
<P>
The currency devaluations have increased their attractiveness
as locations for foreign direct investment and tourism, the ADB
publication said.
</P>
<P>
ADB has analyzed in details the challenge faced by India's
foreign exchange management in the context of the on-going
economic crisis in Southeast Asia. As exports are rising more
slowly than imports, the trade deficit will widen, leading to a
substantially wider current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, the Indian authorities must try to
ensure that India's exchange rate remains competitive, ADB said.

<HEADLINE> Albania Denies Bordering Crashes with Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Albania accused Yugoslavia of
"attempting to shift the responsibility of the Kosovo crisis on to
a foreign country," a statement released by the Albanian Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Yugoslavia announced 16 ethnic Kosovo
Albanians were killed in crashes between Yugoslavia's federal
border troops and some 200 ethnic Albanian gunmen attempting to
re-enter Yugoslavia Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There were no border conflicts between the two countries," the
statement said, "the claim of so-called border conflicts by the
Yugoslav government was completely untrue."
</P>
<P>
"The investigation from Albanian special authorities and the
report of the European Union observers group" on
Bosnia-Herzegovina showed that no personnel and arms had entered
Yugoslavia from the Albanian territory, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia attempted to deceive the world opinion with the
report of border incidents when the international "contact group"
on Bosnia-Herzegovina will have a meeting scheduled on April 29,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the international community to
immediately react to the Kosovo incident, and reiterated that
Albania will contribute itself to peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, a communique released earlier Friday by the
headquarters of the general staff of the Yugoslav army said the
Yugoslav army repulsed the attack of the ethnic Albanian gunmen
near Kosara village bordering Albania, and that no Yugoslav
soldiers were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
The frontier troops captured two of the infiltrators and seized
a great deal of weapons and ammunition in the fighting, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said the captured infiltrators confessed they were Kosovo
Albanians who illegally entered Albania, where they received
military training.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo province of Serbia is populated mainly by ethnic
Albanians demanding independence. In recent months, armed ethnic
Albanian guerrillas have begun fighting against the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Consumption Expanding in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, 8 million to
10 million households in China will be able to buy their own cars.
</P>
<P>
The figure will rise to 85 million involving a population of

<HEADLINE> Artificial Fertilization Helps Breed Rare Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists successfully
applied artificial fertilization for breeding a precious genus of
fox -- frosty-blue fox.
</P>
<P>
So far, more then 1,000 Chinese female blue foxes have given
birth to frosty-blue foxes with artificially fertilized sperm from
imported super silver male foxes from Finland.
</P>
<P>
China has established over a dozen frosty-fox breeding centers
nationwide and targets to breed 300,000 foxes of the genus by
2000, in an effort to boost its high-value added fur industry.
</P>
<P>
Kong Qinsong, an expert incharge of frosty-blue fox breeding,
said fox is one of the three kinds of animals that could produce
fur for coat-making. It has a great market demand.
</P>
<P>
He said though China now breeds more than 400,000 foxes, most
of them are small and frosty-blue fox fur coats enjoy a high price
in the domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The development was achieved by Chinese scientists at the Wild
Animal Resources College of Northeast China Foresty University
after 10 years research. To cater to the needs of growing market,
they began research in 1988.
</P>
<P>
So far, the pregnancy rate of the artificially fertilized
female foxes reached 88 percent and each female fox could give
birth to eight baby foxes at a time on the average.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the spreading of the technique can reduce the cost
of fox breeding as the number of male foxes could be cut sharply.

</P>
<P>
In Executing the campaign, the government will make efforts to

<HEADLINE> Home Electronic Appliances to Become New Rural Consumer Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- In a few years, home electronic
appliances will become a new consumer focus in rural areas,
predicted a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
Yin Shijie, a consumption specialist, told a seminar held
recently here that a survey showed that 22 percent of the families
in rural China intend to buy color televisions, as compared with
20 percent of urban families, and the proportion of rural and
urban families wanting to purchase washing machines remain more or
less the same at 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gap is large only concerning the purchase of cars and
cellular phones, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 20 percent of Chinese rural families possess
washing machines, less than 10 percent of them have refrigerators,
and 88 percent own televisions -- mostly of black and white screen.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1996, the net per capita rural
income averaged about 1,900 yuan (228.9 US dollars), which was
only about one third of the urban income.
</P>
<P>
According to the study by Yin, in five years, the rural
consumption level can catch up with the present urban level. And
if so, the rural areas will need 10 million sets of new
radio-recorders, and about 150 million sets of color television,
refrigerators, and washing machines respectively.
</P>
<P>
Many manufacturers are developing energy-saving and low-priced
machines to cater to the growing need.

<HEADLINE> China to Implement New System in Loan Classification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A new system for commercial banks
to classify their loans has been initiated in China in a bid to
strengthen credit management, improve loan classification and
enhance credit asset quality.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) today issued a norm on the
new classification system, according to which bank loans will be
classified into standard, special mention, substandard, doubtful
and loss.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC said that the new system is designed to reach three
targets: to reveal the actual value and risk degree of loans and
reflect the quality of loans in a real, comprehensive and dynamic
way; to discover problems in loan granting, management,
supervision, recovery and the management of unperforming loans;
and to provide the basis for judging the sufficiency of reserves
for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC demanded that to ensure the reliability of the new
classification system, all commercial banks should standardize
their management and operational practices.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks are also required to classify all of their
loans for at least every six months, and the central bank will
supervise loan quality of commercial banks through spot inspection
and non-spot monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC'S spot inspection of bank loans will be carried out at
least once a year, and stricter control will be laid on commercial
banks which are found to have serious problems with loan
quality.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Buy F/A-18 Jets From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has agreed in principle to
take over a squadron of eight F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets from
Thailand, Supreme Commander Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisith said.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Mongkol made the announcement after a meeting with
Kuwait's representative Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, who is
also president of the Olympic Council of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad arrived in Thailand on Thursday to follow
up progress in Thailand's preparation for the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Sheikh Ahmad has stressed clearly that Kuwait will purchase
the fighters," Gen. Mongkol told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad said after the meeting that the decision
to procure the two-engine jet fighters from the Royal Thai Air
Force would be in line with Kuwait Air Force's modernization plan.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Thai Air Force has set a 74.5-million-U.S.-dollar
deposit for its 392-million-dollar purchase of the fighters from
the American firm Boeing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed in March to allow Thailand
to cancel the deal because of Thailand's economic crisis and
decided not to impose a 250-million-dollar fine for the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. made it clear that Thailand would not get its
deposit back unless it resells the jets to a third party.

<HEADLINE> Peru Plans to Produce More Gold in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Peru plans to produce 86 tons of
gold this year, 13 percent more than last year's production of 76
tons, despite lower gold prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Committee of Peru's Mining and Oil National Society
(SNMP) said Friday that Peru's gold production grew more than 10
percent in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The committee said Peru could achieve by the year 2003 an
annual output of over 100 tons because of increasing investment
in exploration and the development of new projects.
</P>
<P>
A total of 480 million U.S. dollars is expected to be invested
in prospecting in 1998, despite the serious drop in the
international gold quotations.
</P>
<P>
The Barrick Gold firm is planning the biggest investment this
year with its Pierina Project due to start production before the
end of 1998, at a rate of 750,000 ounces a year.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the Minera Yanacocha company continues, with its
production surpassing one million ounces a year.
</P>
<P>
The SNMP said that although last year's gold output grew 18
percent over 1996, less income was obtained because of the drop in
the market quotation of the metal, which fell from 388 dollars an
ounce to 331 dollars on average.
</P>
<P>
The country produced close to 800 million U.S. dollars worth of
gold in 1997, and exported 500 million dollars worth in the form
of refined metal or contained in concentrates, and the remaining
40 percent was exported as manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
Production of this year may reach 900 million U.S. dollars,
the SNMP estimated.
</P>
<P>
It predicted a stable or even better outlook for gold prices,
now about 310 U.S. dollars an ounce, up from 270 dollars in the
previous months.

<HEADLINE> FAO Backs Cuban Plan for Aquaculture Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) backs a Cuban plan of cooperation in the
aquaculture sector "of which the impact must be immediate for
producers" in this island, the FAO representative office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, the sixth biggest Latin American country in the
development of aquaculture, will have rapid access to modern
technology of feed for edible fish thanks to this FAO project,
valued at 147 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plan foresees a substantial increase in the volume of fish
produced through the intensive or semi-intensive cultivation, and
plans to substitute imported fish with local products, and will
have positive repercussions on the supply of fish for domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Mamposton Center of Aquaculture Preparation in the Havana
province, a branch of the Fishing Industry Ministry, will execute
the FAO project on the Cuban side.
</P>
<P>
This international organization has also collaborated in the
war against the auger worm of cattle and the Thrips Plami plague
that attacked cultivations in the nation last year.

<HEADLINE> Venice in Peril from Sea, Needing Urgent Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Venice, the "Queen of the
Adriatic", is in peril as the sea level of the Mediterranean keeps
increasing, but there is still time to save it, a Italian expert
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Frassetto, chairman of the Italian Committee on Global
Change, made the remark after a London-based Venice in Peril
Committee issued a report earlier this week, warning that Venice,
one of the world's most beautiful cities, could be swallowed up by
the sea one day unless urgent preventive action is taken now.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the flooding which occurred in
1966 has not recurred, the city nevertheless is in increasing
danger as the tides swell higher each year. The committee called
on the Italian government to act now before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Frassetto downplayed what he called the "overly catastrophic"
terms used by one of the British scholars in the report, which
were quickly disseminated in the world press.
</P>
<P>
Venice did run "enormous risks" due to the fact that changes in
climate were expected to raise the level of the Mediterranean 20
centimeters over the next 50 years and 60 centimeters in a
century, Frassetto conceded.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the experience of Britain and the
Netherlands showed that prevention can avert a disaster which
would otherwise be of incalculable proportions.
</P>
<P>
The document approved in London bears the signature not only of
Frassetto himself but of those responsible for the defense of the
British capital against the perils posed by the River Thames and
for the protection of the Netherlands from encroachment by the North
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The equivalent of millions of dollars has been spent in
preventive work over a decade and it was becoming clear to
everyone that this investment had begun to bear fruit, both in
England and in the Netherlands, Frassetto said.
</P>
<P>
Such prevention was urgently needed for Venice too if it was
not to drown in an ever rising sea overwhelming its lagoon.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Announces Economic Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan government
announced a plan Friday to accelerate economic reforms and improve
the competitivity of public and private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims at maintaining the momentum of economic
transformations and reducing unemployment and inflation. It will
also tighten the control of the budget through the reduction of
public and private indebtedness and improve the situation of those
with the lowest income.
</P>
<P>
The government decided, in relation to the economic reforms, to
curb the public monopoly and promote private investment in the
fields of insurance, port services, alcohol and communications.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the government will continue concessions of
public services and works to private interests, such as road
maintenance, road and bridges building, ports and airports
operation, railroad transport, forest administration, water and
sewage works and gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take new measures to provide more
transparency and security to the credit market and long term
investment.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Govt Tries to End Postal Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has used
emergency regulations to try to force an end to a 44-day long
postal strike, official media said Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga Friday night promulgated
Emergency Regulations to declare the Postal and Telecommunication
Services "Essential Services" effective from 06:00 a.m. (local
time) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, contingents of security forces were sent to
take control of both the new and old Central Mail Exchanges, where
police arrested 10 postal union leaders.
</P>
<P>
The union leaders were being detained at different police
stations in the city.
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General H.M.S.Kotakadeniya said those who failed to
report for work would be dealt with according to the emergency
rules, under which they would be forcibly brought to work under
military escort and would be detained for further action if they
resist.
</P>
<P>
The striking postal workers have yet to issue a statement
following the arrest of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The postal strike began on March 11 when postal workers
demanded overtime pay and other enhanced economic benefits.
Protracted discussions with the government resulted in all issues
being settled, but by then the workers had included a final demand
for the removal of the postmaster general.
</P>
<P>
The demand was rejected and the strike is continuing.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Cut Staff by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government plans to cut
the civil service workforce by 10 percent in the next four years
as part of a sweeping bureaucratic reform, according to a source
at the Thai Government House.
</P>
<P>
The cutback was proposed by the Bureaucratic Reform Committee,
headed by deputy prime minister Bhichai Rattakul.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, from now until the year 2001 the government
will not increase civil service positions, and will also dissolve
80 percent of all the positions vacated by retirees every year.
</P>
<P>
A central workforce committee will then be in charge of
distributing the remaining 20 percent of the vacancies to state
agencies in dire need of positions for new staff. The remaining
posts after the distribution will be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The cutback was needed due to a rapid increase in the size of
the government workforce, the source was quoted Saturday by the
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a government survey, the government workforce
nationwide stood at 1,032,802 in 1981, and rose to 1,464,557 in
1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday welcomed the Russian parliament's confirmation of Boris
Yeltsin's candidate Sergei Kiriyenko as Russia's new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a ceremony at the White House,
Clinton said he hoped the breakthrough vote would lead to Russian
ratification of the stalled START II nuclear arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good news day for Russia and for the United States,"
Clinton said. "We have a high opinion of him," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I also very much hope this will free up the Duma to consider
the START II treaty because if they will ratify it, then we can
move on to START III and continue our effort of dramatically
reducing the nuclear threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, 35, was confirmed Friday by Russia's Duma as the new
prime minister after rejecting him twice.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Vice President Al Gore congratulated Kiriyenko in
a telephone call. They agreed to meet this summer.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Kiriyenko also agreed that the U.S.-Russia
Commission set up by Gore and Kiriyenko's predecessor, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, would continue its work on U.S-Russian issues.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that the U.S. looks
forward to and expects to have "a close working relationship"
with Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing that
Kiriyenko "clearly signals the kind of generational change that
is necessary around the world."
</P>
<P>
"He's well and favorably known in Washington," said Rubin.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The international
community must not lose sight of the universal dimension of its
individual character in dealing with Africa, Brazilian delegate
Celso Amorim said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Nations Security Council's open debate
on the U.N. chief's report on Africa, Amorim said the report of
the secretary-general was an objective analysis with thoughtful
recommendations which called for cafeful examination not only by
the Security Council, but also by the General Assembly, the
Economic and Social Council and other components of the United
Nations system.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said consistency was needed in the search for
solution to areas in crisis in Africa. The United Nations had been
instrumental in bringing peace and relief to many areas in Africa,
either through peacekeeping or through manifold programs directed
at improving the lives of the neediest, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, those efforts remained insufficient. The
problem was not only one of resources. There was a qualitative
dimension to be kept in mind. Technical assistance, for instance,
could not be "supply oriented" but must be targeted to the
specific needs of the recipient countries and should make full use
of their resources and potentialities.

of children as "zones of peace" and supported the idea of
establishing an international mechanism to assist host governments
on maintaining the security and neutrality of refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, a focused attempt must be found to deal
with the impact of so-called "armed labor" or displaced persons
roaming across borders with weapons, which had the potential to
destabilize entire subregion.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- West African states want
to see more foreign direct investment into their economies to
enhance their diversification of traditional exports essential to
their sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
This point of view was expressed by Nigeria's Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Ibrahim Gambari who spoke
here Friday on behalf of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) at a U.N. debate on Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the effectiveness of the investment would depend on
the alleviation by the international community of the external
debt burden of heavily indebted African countries, he told the
debate on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's recent report on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa's external debt totaled 328.9 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, according to U.N. statistics.
</P>
<P>
He said the ECOWAS believes that the Bretton Woods institutions
have a key role to play in the promotion of peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
These institutions should develop "Peace-Friendly" Structural
Adjustment Programs which do not undermine the ability of African
governments to fulfill their basic responsibilities in people's
education, health and welfare, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania: Int'l Community Should Consider Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The international
community should seriously consider the U.N. secretary-general's
proposal to examine further additional actions on the debt facing
Africa, particularly of the least developed countries, Tanzanian
delegate Daudi Mwakawago said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwakawago said the result of well-meant programs such as the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative of the Bretton
Woods Institutions has proven disappointing. And yet Africa
continues to face the crippling debt burden at a time when even
the frailest economies have just recently been ravaged by the
vagaries of the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said that while Africa does not desire to dishonor
its debt obligations, a cancellation of such debt burden would
release and make available to Africa critical resources it needs
to build appropriate infrastructure for its prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Security Council will work not
only with African countries, but also with the Organization of
African Union, in addressing the twin goals of peace and security
on the one hand, and development on the other in Africa.

UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
applauds the U.N. secretary-general's report on Africa, which
bring together many ideas and approaches as a comprehensive policy
towards Africa at a particularly opportune time, John Weston,
Britain's permanent representative to the U.N. said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union at the open debate of
the U.N. Security Council on Africa, Weston said the
secretary-general has provided a clear and candid analysis of the
sources of conflict in Africa and the reasons why they persist.
</P>
<P>
Weston said the report contains concrete recommendations on
ways to prevent and address conflicts in Africa, and how to lay
the foundations for subsequent durable peace. The historic
approach is most welcome, and the European Union looks forward to
further comprehensive discussion of the report, he added.
</P>
<P>
The representative said the European Union supports the
secretary-general's recommendations that the United Nations
develops closer relations with African regional and sub-regional
organizations and arrangements, and also supports increased
cooperation between the U.N. and Sub-regional organizations in the
areas of conflict prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union welcomes the U.N. chief's call for
all African countries to participate in the U.N. register of
conventional arms. The European Union will continue to support
efforts aimed at the establishment of effective national control
measures on the transfer of conventional arms, combating illegal
arms trafficking and the banning and clearing of anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
Weston said the European Union welcomes the emphasis placed in
the secretary-general's report on the further development of
regional cooperation and integration among African countries
across a wide range of different fields, and on the importance of
creating an environment where durable peace is sustained and
economic growth promoted.
</P>
<P>
The European Union believes, he said, that it is imperative
that the political momentum generated by this report must not be
lost, and is committed to working to ensure that Africa remains on
the international agenda at the highest level.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday welcomed the
Russian parliament's confirmation of Boris Yeltsin's candidate
Sergei Kiriyenko as Russia's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a ceremony at the White House,
Clinton said he hoped the breakthrough vote would lead to Russian
ratification of the stalled START II nuclear arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good news day for Russia and for the United States,"
Clinton said. "We have a high opinion of him," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I also very much hope this will free up the Duma to consider
the START II treaty because if they will ratify it, then we can
move on to START III and continue our effort of dramatically
reducing the nuclear threat," he said.

"Certainly the fact that the decision was made not to go
forward with a case before the WTO indicates desire on the
Europeans' part to come to a solution," said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.

"But the next step is to see whether we can come to an
understanding that no country should want to see expropriated
property benefit the expropriator," said Rubin.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Insists on Lowering Mortgage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Romano Prodi Friday
reiterated his government's commitment to bringing Italy's
mortgage interest rates down to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The declaration came in the midst of a heated dispute over the
reluctance of commercial banks to lower their rates in the wake of
the Bank of Italy's discount rate reduction on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During question time in the Lower House, Prodi said he was
satisfied with his government's involvement with banks and credit
institutions aimed at rolling back mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
"When I talked of the dream of five percent, the rate was 14
percent and now it is 6.25 percent. I think we can get there in a
fairly short time," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the five percent mortgage is a feature of
civilization, a way for workers to have a home.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Cabinet Undersecretary Enrico Micheli said the
banking system had to attain greater efficiency to help pave the way
to greater flexibility on mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that banks said they would be unable to
meet the five percent goal without government subsidies, Micheli
said he could rule out "state aid."
</P>
<P>
What was needed, he said, was "the independent action of the
banks" because subsidies were "old and outdated."

<HEADLINE> China's Medium, Small Enterprises to Get More Financial Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's financial arms will soon
adopt a series of new policies to further support the healthy
development of medium and small enterprises, according to a senior
official with the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor of PBOC Shang Fulin said that medium and small
enterprises play a significant role in the economy. Under China's
present situation, promoting the development of medium and small
enterprises will be a big help to reach this year's economic
growth target, and will create more jobs and help reduce financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
Shang said that China's financial institutions have always
supported the development of medium and small enterprises,
providing them with huge amounts of loans and a wide range of
financial services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of March this year, the amount
of outstanding loans from state-owned commercial banks to medium
and small enterprises was about 1.7 trillion yuan, constituting
some 38 percent of the total amount of outstanding loans of
state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, commercial banks have been active in providing
medium and small enterprises with account transference,
remittance, settlement, information, management consultation and
other necessary services, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PBOC is to adopt a series of policies in favor
of the development of medium and small enterprises, which involve
the rational increase of loans, the improvement of financial
services and the further improvement of the financial service
system.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that while giving support to medium and small
enterprises, attention should be paid to preventing financial
risks with loans granted to these enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Free of Quake Damage in Immediate Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Earthquakes rating 4 to 5 on the
Richter scale and jolting areas neighboring Beijing will not cause
damage to the city although they may fuel panic and rumors,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"A quake measuring 4-5 on the Richter scale is not strong
enough to damage the city's buildings, for most of the public and
residential buildings were constructed to withstand quakes of 6
degrees," said Ding Jianhai, director of the Department of
Earthquake Prediction's Center for Analysis and Prediction under
the State Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to Ding, round-the-clock feedback from the city's
quake prediction stations has ruled out the possibility of quakes
over 5 on the Richter scale in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Beijing boasts China's most sophisticated quake-prediction
network with more than 50 prediction stations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But rumor and panic about the potential of large-scale quakes
have been aroused by a 6.2 quake which hit Zhangjiakou near the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake killed 50 people, injured thousands and brought
down 100,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
The tension mounted when a 4.7 quake on April 14 hit Tangshan
in north China's Hebei Province, 175 kilometers from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The official said minor quakes may occur in the quake-active
circle including Tangshan, Zhangjiakou and Tianjin, and can be
felt in Beijing, which is located on the verge of the circle.
</P>
<P>
"The capital will not be the epicenter of quakes in the
quake-prone circle. You may feel it when quakes come, but that's
all," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Historical files indicate that nine quakes measuring over 6 on
the Richter scale have jolted Beijing and its neighboring areas
since AD 438. The first one struck the south part of Beijing in
1057. The city has no record of quakes of over 7 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the bureau also indicate that ten localities
across the country might well be hit by medium or strong quakes
this year. Local governments have been called on to take advanced
anti-quake measures.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said China is now going through its fifth active
quake period of the century, lasting from late 1988 to the
beginning of the next century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Dealing With Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- People from all circles in China
are asked to help unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
In China's most populous province, Henan, labor departments say
they will train 200,000 laid-off workers this year and find
employment for 70 percent of them. The province also decided to
give preferential loans to laid-off workers so that they can start
their own businesses, and to subsidize enterprises that want to
employ the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, the biggest port city in northern China, 59
reemployment centers have been set up and job firms of the
municipal trade union council give free aid.
</P>
<P>
The municipal trade union council also conducts a monthly
survey of unemployed workers' living conditions, and has
established 20,000 files on people needing special help.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu, one of China's most economicly developed provinces,
nearly 200 training bases for laid-off workers have been
established and those who have lost their jobs can draw relief
money from the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning province, where there are many state-owned
enterprises, many colleges and polytechnic schools have decided to
provide free training for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
China's Education Ministry recently asked 1,000 universities
and colleges, 700,000 middle and primary schools and other
vocation and polytechnic schools to do something for the laid-offs.
</P>
<P>
The Youth League, China's largest mass organization for young
people, also plans to help 100,000 laid-off workers find
employment in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Labor sources say that through the year 2000, the
country will organize training for 10 million laid-off workers and
this year China will try to employ at least 60 percent of the
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
In May the State Council will hold a working conference on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 10 million laid-off workers. According to
the Ministry of Labor, in the next three years the employment
situation in China could worsen, as 8 to 10 million more workers
will leave their jobs and wait for reemployment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Operatic Drama "Peony Pavilion" to Make Global Tour (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- People all over the world will
have a chance to see the operatic dream "Peony Pavilion", created
by Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu (1550-1616) about 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 55-act Chinese opera will make its American debut on July 7
at New York's Lincoln Center in a 20-hour show spreading over six
nights. It will be performed by the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe
under the direction of Chen Shizheng, a Chinese artist living in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The audience will be given a look at: a young woman's dream of
meeting her perfect match; a young man's dream of finding his
lover at the Peony Pavilion; the young woman's death; the young
man's pursuit of her ghost; the woman's resurrection; and finally,
their reunion after battles with the Judge of Hell.
</P>
<P>
"The opera is an epic spectacle that rolls out like a giant
Chinese scroll painting," Chen explains, and in his production, 22
actors and actresses will play 106 roles of Mongol invaders,
bandits, Taoist nuns, scholars, prostitutes, and a host of
others.
</P>
<P>
Chen is attempting to give the audience a look at the ancient
Chinese theater at the time of Tang Xianzu -- a contemporary of
Shakespeare and as great a creative force -- at a total cost of
500,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
There will be no wings or backdrops on the stage. The orchestra
will sit in full view of the audience and actors and actresses put
on make up and change costumes on stage, and on both sides of the
audience there will be bird cages with live birds, and the
performers will fish in a real fish pond at the front of the stage.
</P>
<P>
Actors and actresses who have finished their parts will mix and
chat with the audience, and at any time during the performance,
the audience can go to the lobby to get something to eat or drink.
</P>
<P>
Chen believes that this new type of drama will provide the
audience with a kind of relaxed enjoyment and give an
understanding of what real life, society, and people were like in
ancient China.
</P>
<P>
Tang lived at a time when the dominant philosophy was "Li Xue"
(Neo-Confucianism), a school of philosophy that taught that people
should regulate their behavior in accordance with feudal
propriety, says Sun Jiaxiu, director of the China Shakespeare
Research Insitute.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, Tang sought the liberation of individuality in his
works, and tried to celebrate love to counter feudal morality and
ethics, Sun says, adding, "Both Tang and Shakespeare's works fully
express the humanistic ideas of love -- the undying themes of both
Oriental and Occidental theater." And, he thinks that "Peony
Pavilion" will receive a warm welcome from foreign audience.
</P>
<P>
Kunqu Opera is one of China's classical operatic forms, which
originated in the Kunshan region of Jiangsu Province about 500
years ago. After centuries of development, it has established a
complete system of acting as well as its own distinct tunes.
</P>
<P>
The music and acting of Kunqu Opera have had a significant
influence on other traditional Chinese operatic forms, including
Peking Opera.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqin, of the Ministry of Culture, says that "Peony
Pavilion" has remained an important part of the repertoire of both
Chinese Kunqu and Peking Opera troupes.
</P>
<P>
"The opera was written about 400 years ago, but there is no
record in history of a complete performance of the whole opera,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
So, to reflect the tradition of ancient music on stage, Chen
decided to transcribe the original music into modern musical
notation according to a score for the opera in the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
"Peony Pavilion" will also appear at the Paris Autumn Arts
Festival in November, the Sydney Arts Festival, and the Hong Kong
Arts Festival next January.
</P>
<P>
A Western opera production of "Peony Pavilion" is also in
rehearsal by artists in the United States to match Chen's Kunqu
Opera in the Lincoln Center Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people often say Tang is as great as his contemporary
Shakespeare, but we have never shown his greatness to the world,"
Sun says, but now, people outside China are beginning to show an
interest in the art of this interesting Asian dramatist whose
works have been available in English for some time.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Kill 16 Ethnic Albanian Infiltrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Frontier troops of the Yugoslav
army killed at least 16 ethnic Albanian infiltrators in foiling
infiltration attempts by some 200 ethnic Albanian gunmen in a
border area on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by the headquarters of the general staff
of the Yugoslav army said the Yugoslav army repulsed the attack of
the ethnic Albanian gunmen near Kosara village bordering Albania,
and that no Yugoslav soldiers were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
The frontier troops captured two of the infiltrators and seized
a great deal of weapons and ammunition in the fighting, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said the captured infiltrators confessed they were Kosovo
Albanians who illegally entered Albania, where they received
military training.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Friday lodged a protest with the
Albanian ambassador to Yugoslavia on the illegal entry of the
armed Kosovo Albanians from Albania. Albania has denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
there had been "myriad deaths" in the border clash and that the
United States would press for new sanctions on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo province of Serbia is populated mainly by ethnic
Albanians demanding independence. In recent months, armed ethnic
Albanian guerrillas have begun fighting against the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Telephone Manufacturers Fighting for Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- People say if 1997 was the year
for different brands of video compact disc (VCD) players, then the
year of the tiger, 1998, will be known as the year for telephone
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all of China's major telephone manufacturers have
tried to obtain a bigger chunk of the market.
</P>
<P>
The Idall Electrical Appliance Company, a VCD giant, announced
it will elevate its share of telephones in the total product
spectrum to what is equivalent to VCD players.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made not long after it became the "king of
bidding" for advertising vacancies in prime time slots on China
Central Television, a nationwide TV network.
</P>
<P>
A senior manager with BBK (Higher Step by Step in Chinese)
Electronic Industry Corp. said the telephone is an opportunity for
his company to follow the electronic game machine and the VCD
player. It is determined to make ever higher gains in the
telephone market.
</P>
<P>
BBK telephones had the best performance in terms of sales
volume last year. Industry analysts attribute this to its TV
commercial that swept the country with the "Did the stock market
climb again?" line.
</P>
<P>
The great market potential for telephones in China has drawn
many enterprises into this business, according to an official in
the market department of China General Corp. of Posts and
Telecommunications Industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show less than 10 percent of Chinese households have
installed telephones, and 15 million telephones find their homes
every year.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 300 enterprises are involved in telephone
manufacturing, and others are entering the market.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say businesses, young or old, big or small,
are able to find a position in the competitive market because this
sector is not technology or investment intensive.
</P>
<P>
TCL Corp., which claims to control 17.01 percent of the
telephone market, is aware of the challenges from its many
competitors.
</P>
<P>
Apart from continuing to pursue flexible marketing methods, TCL
invested 10 million yuan in various kinds of advertising from last
year to early this year.
</P>
<P>
China is now the world's largest telephone producer. It
manufactures and sells 100 million telephones annually, accounting
for nearly half of the global figure.

Foundation (CEPF) praising the non-governmental organization on
its fifth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Tian Jiyun, a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), praised the CEPF for its efforts in environmental
protection during the past five years.

"With economic development, much greater efforts will be needed
in environmental protection," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the foundation will contribute more
to a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
The CEPF, established in April of 1993, is China's first
national environmental foundation. It has raised more than 12
million yuan and spent more than 3 million yuan in the promotion
of China's environmental protection drive.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC's Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee, and Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration, planted trees to
celebrate the foundation's fifth anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Says No to Foreign Mediation Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Final results of the referendum
held on Thursday showed an overwhelming majority of voters
rejected foreign mediation over Kosovo, General Secretary of
Serbian Referendum Organizing Committee Nebojsa Rodic said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rodic told a press conference that about 95 percent of the
voters cast a "NO" vote while only 3.4 percent of the poll goers
favored foreign mediation efforts over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Rodic confirmed the validity of the results by saying that the
voter turnout in the referendum totaled about 5.3 million and
accounted for about 73 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the results showed that the absolute majority
backed the Kosovo policies adopted by the country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Politika daily said on Thursday that the voters supported
the principled stand of Yugoslav and Serbian leaders that Kosovo
is an inseparable part of Serbia and the issue is an internal
affair which should be settled by political means.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on Thursday at a polling booth in Belgrade,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said all ethnic groups in
the country could and must solve their problems by themselves for
common interests.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic urged leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to open
talks with Serbian representatives as soon as possible, and hoped
that the Serbian authorities be fully sincere in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo have repeatedly refused to
meet the Serbian government delegation unless foreign
representatives are present.
</P>
<P>
At least 80 ethnic Albanians and Serb policemen have been
killed since ethnic conflicts broke out in the Serbian province in
late February.

on juvenile delinquency proposed by the Panamanian government,
UNICEF's Panama representative, Miguel Cuellar, said Friday.

"With the law proposed by the recently created government
