<HEADLINE> IMF Plans Code for More Openness on Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- As a preventive step to avoid
another bout of Asian financial trouble, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) wants its member countries to sign a code of
conduct requiring them to be more open about their finances.
</P>
<P>
Instead of setting standards for governments, the proposed
code would set up objectives for avoiding secret practices that
often make investors lose confidence and take their money
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The code will be presented to finance ministers and central
bank governors at the spring meeting jointly held here by the
World Bank and IMF next week.
</P>
<P>
Causes of the Asian financial crisis and how to prevent, manage
and resolve future crises will be a main topic at the meeting of
top government financial officials from 182 IMF members.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has mapped out rescue packages totaling some 120
billion U.S. dollars for trouble-ridden Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 24-member IMF executive board is expected to act on a draft
Code of Conduct on Fiscal Transparency prepared by the IMF staff.
</P>
<P>
Details of the draft, first reported by the Financial Times,
focus on four areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Clarity of rules and responsibility in governments and
between governments and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
-- Availability of comprehensive and timely fiscal information
to the public.
</P>
<P>
-- Open budget practices.
</P>
<P>
-- Independent assurance of fiscal integrity practices.

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Still Hopeful of N.Irish Deal by Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Both Britain and Ireland were
optimistic Wednesday that it was possible to strike a deal on the
future of Northern Ireland by Thursday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made after British Prime Minister Tony Blair
held talks with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, to try to
resolve outstanding difficulties in the Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"There are clear difficulties but both prime ministers believe
that an agreement can be reached in time to meet tomorrow's
deadline," a British spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister's general view is that it is difficult but
it is do-able," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair intervened into the Northern Ireland affairs Tuesday
after the largest pro-British political party the Ulster Unionist
Party rejected a draft proposal put forward by George Mitchell, a
former U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
The unionists fear that elements of the peace deal,
particularly plans for cross-border bodies linking Northern
Ireland with the Irish Republic, will fuel nationalist aspirations
for a single Irish state.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews also gave positive
assessment to the situation, saying, "We continue to be hopeful of
a successful outcome of the talks tomorrow evening. This is about
a settlement, it's not about victory."
</P>
<P>
Blair himself made it clear that winning the peace would be
difficult as he began a day of closed-door, one-on-one talks with
Catholic and Protestant politicians.
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of very hard questions to resolve,"
Blair told reporters. "I'm going to give it the very best try I
possibly can."

<HEADLINE> EU Drops Lawsuit Against Stade de France Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission decided
on Wednesday to drop its lawsuit against French World Cup
organizers for their infringement as regards public procurement
contracts.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation European
Union, decided to close the infringement procedure concerning the
construction works of the "Stade de France", the main stadium for
this year's World Cup grand finale.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission warned France in early 1996 about the
infringement upon European Community provisions and it decided to
refer the case to the Court of Justice last year after it did not
receive satisfactory explanation from the French side.
</P>
<P>
New contacts, however, were established between the commission
and the French side following the lawsuit and finally in a letter
dated March 23, 1998, to the commission, the French minister for
European affairs formally recognized the existence of the
infringement and agreed to commit himself to the respect of the
application of European Community provisions for further public
procurement contracts within the framework of this subject.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities also adopted an amendment to the
contract which eliminated the local preference clause, which had
been criticised by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, European commissioner in charge of single market,
said that he was satisfied with the conclusion of the case, in
that it proved that the action of the commission aiming for the
respect of community provisions as regards public procurement
contracts is useful and effective.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner added that he hoped that in future no similar
cases will occur.

<HEADLINE> Opposition to Single Currency Surges in Britain: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The British public's opposition to
the planned single European currency named euro has gathered more
momentum recently, according to the Guardian-ICM opinion poll
published early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which asked how people would vote in a referendum
on joining a single currency, revealed opposition to introduction
of the euro has surged by some 10 percent to 61 percent of British
voters.
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey made in February 1995, some 51 percent of
the British public were opposed to the euro, 26 percent were in
favor, and 23 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that majority opposition to the single
currency, due to be formally launched on January 1, 1999, is to be
found in Britain's all three main political parties, with Labor
supporters opposing it by 55 to 32, Conservatives by 73 to 21 and
Liberal Democrats by 60 to 28.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper explained that the latest surge in
opposition to the euro appeared to be fueled by those previous
"don't knows" deciding to make up their minds and come down on the
sceptical side of the argument.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government, fully aware of the public
opposition to the euro, has ruled out the country's first-wave
membership of the European Economic and Monetary Union.

</P>

The study, conducted among 6,166 children nationwide from 1988
to 1994, found that 14.9 percent of those examined had
low-frequency hearing loss of at least 16 decibels.
</P>
<P>
when applied to the general population, those figures mean more

<HEADLINE> World Metal Demand to Remain Stable: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- World demand for metals is to
remain stable as the drop of Asian consumption due to economic
turmoil in the region will be generally offset by the current
recovery in economic activity in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), the Financial Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by a commodities analyst at the ABN-Amro
banking group, the newspaper said that in the early to mid-1990s,
the reverse was true as the positive impact on metal demand caused
by Asian economic growth at that time was generally offset by the
collapse of the CIS industrial activity.
</P>
<P>
It said that the current recovery of the economies of Russia
and Kazakhstan, which together account for 90 percent of the CIS
population, suggests the decade-long contraction is over and the
recovery in CIS metals demand should be under way.
</P>
<P>
Although the present level of CIS metals demand is low and
comparable with neighboring eastern European countries, it will
recover in line with economic activity in the region.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the recent stabilization of CIS demand
following a fall of between 78 and 87 percent since 1986 may
suggest that a steady recovery could be seen over the next few
years.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills Near 500 Zimbabweans This Year </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps Wednesday said 499 people had
died from malaria by March this year compared to 486 during same
period last year, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference that there had been an
increase of 50 percent in the number of reported cases of
malaria.
</P>
<P>
He said some 338,950 malaria cases had been reported by the
end of March this year compared to 225,185 cases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
''Malaria had gone down because of the drought in the early
1990s, so the ministry's health awareness program was cut back to
save money. When the rains suddenly came back people were
ill-prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added in some areas when the use of DDT was abandoned
except for areas where there was no tobacco growing.
</P>
<P>
He, however, warned people to take precautions before
traveling during the forthcoming easter holidays.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Sees Good Chance for Compromise on EU Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union states will be able to
find a compromise on the dispute over who will head the future
European central bank before their summit in Brussels early May,
German government sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a good chance to reach a compromise on the personnel
issue before the meeting of EU government and state leaders in
Brussels on May 2," which is due to choose the founding members of
the planned single European currency, said German government
spokesman Herbert Schmuelling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the talks were still under way to find a
final solution.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after the French government denied a German
newspaper report that a deal had already been reached in favor of
the Dutch head of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), Wim
Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
According to the report carried by the German Sueddeutsche
Zeitung newspaper, France has agreed to drop the nomination of its
own central bank chief, Jean-Claude Trichet, for the top post of
the European central bank in return for an assurance that a French
national would take the job after the end of the full eight-year
term of Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was reported to be reached by German, French
and Dutch leaders on the sidelines of the Second Asia-Europe
Meeting in London, also foresaw that a Frenchman would again head
the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) to succeed former EBRD chief Jacques de Larosiere, who quit
the post at the end of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The French government, in a statement issued Tuesday evening,
dismissed the report as "groundless."
</P>
<P>
While the top post of the European central bank still remains
to be contested, the German government and the country's central
bank, the Bundesbank, are also reportedly in conflict over the
nomination of the German member of the bank's executive board.
</P>
<P>
While Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer appears to support
Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing in becoming the German
representative in the European central bank board, the Bonn
government reportedly favors the nomination of Juergen Stark, a
senior official with the German Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that if the government and the Bundesbank
failed to reach a consensus on the issue, it could raise questions
about the credibility and independence of the new bank.

CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
strengthened Wednesday after rumors that the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) would slash official interest rates proved
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar ended the local session at 65.85 U.S. cents,
up from 65.69 U.S. cents Tuesday.

Financial markets largely treaded water ahead of 0930 this

</P>
<P>
The central bank held its monthly board meeting to consider
monetary policy Tuesday and in the past has sometimes changed the

</P>
<P>
However, the central bank maintained its silence Wednesday and
the official cash rate remained at 5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There was no rate cut and the Australian dollar moved up early
on into the 65.80 U.S. cents," St George Bank manager of foreign
exchange trading Stuart Moore said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said strength in the Japanese yen also helped underpin
support for the local unit.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close at Record on Banking Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
reached a record close Wednesday as a surging banking sector
offset patchy performances elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 18.7 points higher at 2813.5,
with almost 90 percent of trade in industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
"Banks have been the main driver. It's very much the banks
following the U.S. lead of bulk up or shut up and that need to
grow," Stuart Smith from Henderson Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said speculation of a consolidation of the local banking
industry and some expectations of a foreign bid for one of the
major banks has driven the rise of the sector rather than some
suggestions of an official interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Smith said a buoyant Japanese market also helped the market
improvement, with the Nikkei index jumping 2.5 percent to 16,376
on expectations of an income tax cut announcement by the Japanese
government Thursday.
</P>

The all industrials index added 38.2 points to 4851.8.

<P>
Telstra interim receipts lost favor as investors sought capital
to put into banking stocks, falling six cents.

<P>
WMC lost 5.5 cents, BHP fell six cents while Rio Tinto improved

<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko said Wednesday that the Russian government has
taken economic measures against on Latvia to support the ethnic
Russians living in the Baltic nation.
</P>
<P>
The measures, including strictly limiting oil supply to Latvia
and imposing restrictions on Latvian goods and labor, were
formulated in line with instructions by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
He threated that Russia will impose sanctions on Latvia if
Latvia does not alter the policy against its Russian speakers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked the government to pressurizing Latvia to change
what Moscow sees as discrimination against the Russian-speaking
minority.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also asked the government to seriously
considering diversifying Russia's oil export routes, Yeltsin's
press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed building new ports for oil exports in
the Finnish Bay instead of depending on those in Latvia,
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Russia and Latvia have rapidly soured in
recent weeks due to a dispute over the rights of the 700,000
ethnic Russians in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
A bomb that went off near the Russian Embassy in Riga, Latvia's
capital, early this month prompted Moscow's denunciation. In early
March, the Latvia police forcefully dispersed a Russian-speaking
pensioners rally in the city.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches "People's Housing Policy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The South African Housing
Ministry has kicked off a drive for a self-built housing project
for the country's poor, Business Day reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy widened the housing consumer net to include people
who wished to build their own homes as a collective or
individuals, Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The policy focuses on the poorest of poor families living in
both urban and rural areas. It will affect people who settled on
fully serviced sites with or without ownership rights, those
settled informally on land without any tenure rights and those
without land living in hostels and backyard shacks.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 percent of South African population could
potentially benefit from the project, but any effect on low-cost
housing delivery would probably be realized only in the longer
term, the ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the policy, capital subsidies of up to 15,000 Rand
(3,000 U.S. Dollars) each will be released to support individual
builders' initiatives or projects and housing support centers
will be set up around the country.
</P>
<P>
These will form a central point where consumers can buy
building materials at a reasonable cost.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Economic Plan Stresses Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's economic development plan
for the 1998-99 fiscal year shed spotlight on developing its rural
communities, the Middle East News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which was ratified by the cabinet on March 3,
more efforts would be made to serve the needs of half of Egypt's
population living in the rural areas in obtaining a fair share of
basic services and investment for the creation of a healthy
society.
</P>
<P>
The plan also strives to narrow the gap between rural and urban
areas in a bid to ensure and preserve the healthy fabric of the
society for its security and stability.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released in 1996, Egypt had 1,074 main
villages, 4,902 affiliated villages and 20,942 smaller entities.
</P>
<P>
About 33.8 million people, or 57 percent of Egypt's population,
live in the countryside. Rural population increases by about 2.26
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rural development plan stressed just distribution of
investment between cities and villages and the realization of
integration and coordination at both central authority and local
levels.
</P>
<P>
The program to upgrade the countryside began to be carried out
in the 1995-96 fiscal year and has ever since been in full gear in
4,101 villages, costing some 408 million pounds (120 million U.S.
dollars) in investment, including 142 million pounds (41.77
million dollars) contributed by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Investments in these villages have included 179 million pounds
(52.65 million dollars) in infrastructure improvement, 94 million
pounds (27.65 million dollars) in rural economic development and
55.5 pounds (16.32 million dollars) for the local development fund.
</P>
<P>
In the current economic investment plan, some 158.2 million
pounds (46.53 million dollars) were allocated for investment, in
addition to other investment projects undertaken by the concerned
ministries and governorates.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Urges Higher Crop Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers should be
encouraged to increase the production of food crops, Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a policy statement for the 1998/99 agricultural
marketing season, Kangai said it was imperative to ensure that
agriculture remained the impetus for economic growth, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"My ministry, therefore, remains open to constructive ideas
from all stake-holders with an interest in maintaining the
pivotal role of agriculture as the engine for economic growth and
in providing food security and contributing to poverty
eradication in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year export earnings from agricultural commodities rose
to 11.5 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 700 million U.S.
Dollars) from 9.9 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 600 million
U.S. Dollars) in 1996, an increase of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 1997/98 rainfall season had on average
turned out to be better than anticipated at the beginning due to
fears of an El Nino induced drought.
</P>
<P>
Initial forecasts for major crops show that farmers would
produce between 1.4 million tons and 1.8 million tons of maize,
230 million kilograms of flue-cured and burley tobacco, 273,000
tons of cotton, 110,000 tons of soya-beann and 601,000 tons of
raw sugar.

<HEADLINE> Wat Phnom Gets Gussied Up for New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The re-opening celebration of
Wat Phnom, the best known temple in the capital of Cambodia, began
here Wednesday after nearly five months of renovation.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, including a display of fireworks and folk
arts, is scheduled to last until April 11 to welcome Cambodia's
traditional New Year on April 13.
</P>
<P>
The renovation, which is aimed at beautifying Wat Phnom and
boosting the city's tourism, involved efforts to clean and repaint
the temple and stupas, and light up the stupas and pathways at
night.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sophara, the first deputy governor and member of the
central committee of Cambodia People's Party, said the renovation
of the temple and its surrounding gardens cost more than 300,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For years Wat Phnom had been damaged and neglected by a
protracted civil war. The surrounding area was reduced to a place
of crime.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen speedy recovery of infrastructure
construction in Phnom Penh. Such main roads as Mao Tse Toung and
Sihanouk Boulevards have been repaved or expanded. The supply of
electricity has also been greatly improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires on the southern
Philippine island of Palawan have been placed under control and
mopping-up operations are now going on in the affected areas,
Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Department of Environment and Natural

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Speaks on Int's Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (xinhua) -- Peace, development,
stability and cooperation have come to form the mainstream at
present and international relations are heading towards
relaxation, the Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs
stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary meeting of the United Nations
Disarmament Commission, Ambassador Li Changhe also stressed that
the Cold War mentality is still lingering on, threatening world
peace and stability, and hegemonism and power politics are still
hampering the establishment of a fair and rational new world
order.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that summing up past experience and lessons
and preparing for future opportunities and challenges, the
international community needs to cultivate a new security concept
and to seek new ways to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
Li said that under the new international situation, activities
such as expanding military blocs, strengthening military
alliances, retaining and even extending the policy of unclear
deterrence, and conducting research and development of new types
of weapons systems that undermine global strategic balance, run
counter to the trend of the times and are detrimental to
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Li said China holds that all countries should abide by the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter as well as
the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, and
peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said this is the political basis and
prerequisite for international security, and every country is
entitled to choose the path of development in light of its own
national conditions. No country should interfere in the internal
affairs of other countries under whatever pretext; nor should any
country or group of countries seek absolute security by
compromising the security of others, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the economic basis of security, all countries
should, on the basis of equality and mutual benefits, strengthen
economic and trade ties, and promote scientific and technological
cooperation, so as to narrow the development gap between countries
and achieve common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said that as a practical way to maintain global
peace and security, all countries should enhance consultations and
cooperation in the field of security, further mutual understanding
and trust, and seek to settle differences and disputes through
peaceful means.

LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Eurostar, the Channel Tunnel rail
company, could face fines of more than 1 million pounds (1.65
million U.S. dollars) a month for failing to check a flood of
illegal immigrants into the UK.
</P>
<P>
According to several national newspapers Wednesday, the move
will follow government plans to tighten immigration control
legislation in an attempt to stop illegal immigrants using
Eurostar rail services to enter Britain.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to extend the 1987 Carriers Liability Act
to cover Eurostar's operations from Belgium. Under the act,
airlines and ferry companies face a fine of 2,000 pounds (3,300
dollars) for each illegal immigrant.
</P>
<P>
The government was alarmed at the large numbers of immigrants
without proper documents using Eurostar services from Brussels to
London.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that some 900 immigrants from Kenya and the
former Yugoslavia have arrived in Britain recently from Belgium by
Eurostar, with many of them having inadequate documentation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Speaks on Nuclear-Weapon-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (xinhua) -- The establishment of
nuclear-weapon-free zones should be in line with the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and principles of international
law, the Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs reiterated here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary meeting of the United Nations
Disarmament Commission, Ambassador Li Changhe said
nuclear-weapon-free zones play a positive role in facilitating
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, thus promoting world
and regional peace, stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that in recent years, the area covered by
nuclear-weapon-free-zones has further expanded, and countries in
the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia and Eastern Europe are
advocating or taking practical steps to establish new
nuclear-weapon-free-zones.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the four existing nuclear-weapon-free zones share
common objectives, but are different on some aspects. It is of
great value for the United Nations Disarmament Commission to sum
up and extend the successful experience acquired during the
establishment and operation of these zones, so as to facilitate
the consolidation of existing zones and guide the establishment of
new ones, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has always respected and supported the efforts by
non-nuclear weapon states to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones
on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among themselves,
and China has undertaken unconditionally not to use or threaten to
use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or
unclear-weapon-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reiterated that the establishment of
nuclear-weapon-free zones should be in line with the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and principles of international law.
The countries concerned should establish nuclear-weapon-free zones
on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among themselves
and in light of the actual conditions of their respect regions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the geographical scope of nuclear-weapon-free zone
should not cover continental shelves, exclusive economic zones or
areas of dispute between the states within the zone and their
neighboring countries over the territorial sovereignty and
maritime rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the status of nuclear-weapon-free zone
should not be affected by any other mechanism, and the states
within the zone should not exempt themselves from the Nuclear
Weapon Free Zone Treaty obligations under any pretext, including
their membership of military alliance.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Discusses Mideast Peace with Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Wednesday reviewed the latest Mideast peace standoff
over the phone with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conversation between them also dealt with the Israeli
proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon in accordance with
U.N. Resolution 425 on condition that the Lebanese government
offers security guarantees to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Resolution 425 is clear. It speaks of no strings attached to
the Israeli withdrawal," said Abdel-Meguid following the telephone
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel should adhere to the resolution in letter and spirit, he
said, adding that Lebanon will fully obtain its rights. The Arab
leader is scheduled to visit Lebanon on Thursday to further
explore the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel approved the adoption of the resolution
425. But it conditioned the withdrawal on a security arrangement
for the bordering areas with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria, which agree not to make peace with
Israel separately, have rejected Israel's offer. They insist that
the Jewish state withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally as
the U.N. resolution demands.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on Monday held talks with his
Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi in the Syrian capital of
Damascus, to coordinate the stances of the two countries on
Israel's offer to implement the U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Slammed for Interfering in Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The archbishop in Beira, a
central Mozambican City, Dom Jaime Goncalves, has been condemned
by politicians here for interfering in local elections.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Tome, General Secretary of the Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo), said that Goncalves is "launching an
anti-Frelimo movement," the Mozambican News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goncalves said in a television interview last week that the
local election scheduled to be held on June 30 in 33 cities and
towns "would not be free, fair and just," considering the
irregularities which occurred in voters registration last year.
</P>
<P>
The Frelimo leader said that the archbishop's words and deeds
should have been conducive to the country's political process,
not to create psychological chaos among voters.
</P>
<P>
Some statesmen in the country have said that the Catholic
priest should not interfere in the political life of the country,
not to mention to become a propaganda organ of a certain party.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique Daily said in a story that the meetings in
Beira between visiting Portuguese officials and the archbishop
bore some "political color", considering that Portuguese leaders
have never met Dom Alexandre Maria dos Santos, the archbishop in
Maputo, a city which they also visited.
</P>
<P>
But a Portuguese official in Beira said it is natural for
Portuguese leaders to meet the archbishop and talk about things
like religion and human right, and added that the meetings had
nothing to do with Mozambique's internal politics.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Urged to Speed up Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani Wednesday urged the government to speed
up the construction of a controversial Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of East Jerusalem, Kahalani said that the
tenders for the building of more than 6,000 houses on Har Homa
should be published immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, who was accompanied by Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert,
stressed that the Har Homa project should not be connected to the
next Israeli troops pullback from the West Bank and should speed
up.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been deadlocked for
over a year since Israel broke ground for the Jewish settlement on
Har Homa. The construction has been criticized strongly by the
Palestinians and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would postpone the issuing of tenders for Har Homa until
Israel reached an agreement with the Palestinians on the next
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to push forward the peace process, the U.S. reportedly
has presented a peace proposal to Israel and the Palestinians. It
calls on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
return for fulfillment of the Palestinians' commitment to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Olmert noted that Har Homa is in the boundary of
Israel and there is no reason for a delay. He stressed that he
will "use all political influence to make this happen as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Har Homa is located in East Jerusalem, which Israel
captured from Jordan in the Six-day War in 1967 and annexed
later.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared Jerusalem to be its indivisible capital,
while the Palestinians want to establish an independent state
with East Jerusalem as its capital.

blankets, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the government improve their conditions, give
them less crowded wards and decreasement of period of detention
before trials are held.
</P>
<P>
They also called for a general amnesty, which had been rejected
by Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations with representatives of the prisoners, the
interior minister promised to meet some of their demands, but
refused to grant them a general amnesty as it requires a
ratification of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conditions of the prisoners will be discussed
by the cabinet. His promises have eased the tension in the prison.
</P>
<P>
The revolt, which erupted on Tuesday afternoon, was
accompanied by a sit-in protest outside the jail held by the
relatives of inmates to demand information about the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Security has been tightened with hundreds of reinforced troops
and polices being deployed around the prison. Fire fighters were
called in to extinguish fires inside several cells.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that no one had escaped during the jail riot.
</P>
<P>
The Rumi prison, the largest one of its kind in Lebanon, is
reportedly holding 3,000 prisoners, about 75 percent of the
country's total.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief to Coordinate Cambodian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has accepted the Cambodian government's invitation to play a
coordinating role in the international observation of Cambodian
elections due on July 26, his spokesman announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Annan made the decision after carefully
assessing political developments in Cambodia, particularly the
progress in establishing a framework for multi-party elections and
following the retun of Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general made it clear in his response to
Cambodian leaders that he has continuing concerns on a number of
issues which "might hinder the prospect for free and fair
elections and their credibility thereafter."
</P>
<P>
In his letters to Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Mr. Ung Huot dated April 2, Annan particularly referred to "the
continued lack of prosecution of those responsible for gross human
rights violations and the resulting climate of impunity, the
absence of a permanent cease-fire, the presence of refugees in
Thailand who left during the events of last July and the need to
ensure the equitable access to the media by the principal
political forces."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. "stands ready to assist in addressing these issues and
thus moving the electoral process forward to an internationally
acceptable outcome," he said.

succeed without the participation of other factions opposed to
the Cairo Peace Accord which forms the basis of the Baidoa
conference.

Development (IGAD), the elder statesman of the region and due to
his past concern for and involvement in finding solutions to the
Somali crisis," they said in the press statement.

<HEADLINE> Erratic Supply of Foreign Exchange Confirmed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian finance minister Edith
Nawakwi confirmed here on Wednesday erratic supply of foreign
exchange in her country and attributed this to the banks which
are holding on the money, expecting the government will start
rationing it.
</P>
<P>
She said that the central bank of the country has assured her
that the country will service its debt at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
She said she is not going to start rationing the money or
auction it despite the cooperating partners not coming to the aid
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi also defended the government policy on the sale of the
country's copper mines, saying that what the government requires
is a sustainable program that will not be reversed by other
people the next day.
</P>
<P>
Zambians have invested and suffered a lot and therefore they
should get a fair price for their mines.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after the negotiations on sale
of Zambia's two biggest copper mines collapsed recently.
</P>
<P>
Zambian president Frederick Chiluba said on Tuesday that the
two mines will not be sold off at give away prices.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines failed
due to disagreements between the Kafue Consortium and the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) privatization team.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue Consortium was the leading contender for the
purchase of the two mines and it won the bid in 1997 after the
Zambian government went through a protracted process to pick the
best buyer of the two mines, which accounts for the biggest
copper production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Falconbridge, a leading Canadian mining company
pulled out of the Konkola deep project consortium citing lower
copper price as the reason for the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement, annual
copper output of the country, one of the biggest copper-producing
countries in the world, has decreased gradually to about 300,000
tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
magangement to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tender for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police have arrested four
persons in connection with a 420-million-Naira (about five
million U.S. Dollars) fraud at the Central Bank of Nigeria, the
official News Agency of Nigeria said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the suspects include a junior staff of the
Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, a director of
Finance and Supply in the Federal Ministry of Finance, and an
official at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested last week and were still being held
at the police headquarters in Abuja, the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the fraud involved a deal in which a
check of 420 million Naira for the Federal Ministry of Justice
was diverted with the active connivance of an unnamed official of
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The police deputy spokesman, Danjuma Ibrahim, was quoted as
saying that the suspects had confessed and were responding to the
advice to refund the money in their possession.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see how far they will cooperate before moving them
to the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report said one of the suspects have refunded a
substantial amount in his bid to secure bail.
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from the central bank at the moment.
According to the report, some of the officials contacted
described the topic as "too hot to touch".

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations says its
coordinating role in the international observation of the
Cambodian elections scheduled for July 26 is to "enhance the
quality of observers' assessments."
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum attached to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
letter to the Cambodian government leaders on April 2, the U.N.
said an element of its coordination is to establish an integrated
international observer network.
</P>
<P>
The network, called Joint International Observer Group or JIOG,
will compose electoral observers sponsored by foreign governments
and inter-governmental organizations to observe all phases of the
election, according to the text of the memorandum provided by the
spokesman's office of Annan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In playing its coordinating role, the world body will help to
ensure that observers are deployed to monitor the entire electoral
process, including registration and the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. requested the electoral authorities to provide
observers official accreditation, freedom of movement and ability
to perform their functions without any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said it reserves the right to withdraw or suspend its
coordinating activities if there is a fundamental deterioration in
the political situation that would undermine the elections in
accordance with internationally recognized criteria.

<HEADLINE> U.S., France Agree to Expand Air Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders in the United States
and France agreed Wednesday to expand air service between their
countries over the next five years, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and French airlines will be able to increase the
number of flights they make across the Atlantic each day, and they
will also no longer be restricted in the cities they can serve,
said the officials.
</P>
<P>
"This increased competition means more choice for American
business travelers and tourists alike," U.S. President Bill
Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the number of weekly flights will increase
from 149 currently to 212 total over the next five years. That
would mean a service increase of nine additional flights daily in
each direction.
</P>
<P>
Airline service between the countries has remained stagnant
since 1992 when France renounced its bilateral aviation agreements
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the latest step by the U.S. government to
increase worldwide airline competition.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 30, U.S. and Japanese authorities agreed to update a
46-year-old "Open Skies" treaty governing airline service between
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The four-year deal granted United and Northwest airlines and
Federal Express unlimited access to Japan and the right to fly to
Japan from any U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are still working with England to expand air
service between those two countries.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Alleged to Support S. Leone Junta Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG Wednesday accused Liberia of shoring up the
remnants of the junta forces and rebel allies, leading to the
slow progress in its mopping up exercise in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG task force commander in charge of south and east
Sierra Leone, Col. Buhari Musa disclosed that over 3,000 junta
forces and the allied rebels have entered Lofa County in northern
Liberia, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Col. Musa was briefing the press in Bo, Sierra Leone's second
largest city, about the offensive launched by the sub-regional
force and its allied pro-government militia known as the Kamajors
in eastern Sierra Leone to flush out the remnants of the junta
forces and allied rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
He announced that all the roads from the key town Kenema to
the Mano River at the border with Liberia had been closed to
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close these roads, according to Col. Musa, is
to stop the cross-border activities that have caused problems for
ECOMOG, which is determined to restore permanent and lasting
peace to the two brother countries.
</P>
<P>
Col. Musa further accused the Liberian government of allowing
the RUF rebels and defuncted junta forces to cause troubles for
peace-loving Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has captured two towns from the junta forces and RUF
rebels, who last weekend massacered 75 people, including children
and women, in the two towns near the border, the officer said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Zhu Rongji's Europe Tour (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
successful Europe tour has injected a new vitality into the
development of Sino-British and Sino-French relations as well as
the Asia-Europe and Sino-European cooperation, says a People's
Daily commentary to be published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that in the rejuvenating season of spring,
Premier Zhu attended the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM2) in
London and had a summit with the leaders of the European Union
(EU) and an in-depth discussion on Sino-European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It hails Zhu' tour as the first major diplomatic activity by a
Chinese leader following the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
On the ASEM achievements since its first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM1) held in Bangkok in 1996, the commentary says, ASEM members
have done tremendous amount of work to enhance political, economic
and cultural exchanges and cooperation among them. They have also
achieved remarkable progress in their cooperation in the fields of
economy and trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the commentary says, the ASEM1 has made great
contributions to the enhancement of the friendship between the
people of the two continents and the expansion of exchanges and
cooperation among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
It continues that with the approach of the 21st century,
countries in both Asia and Europe need more than ever to look
toward the future and deepen their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, the countries should seek common grounds
in political views while reserving their differences and enhancing
dialogue. In the meantime, they should expand economic cooperation
to seek common development.
</P>
<P>
In this spirit, Zhu exchanged views with leaders present at the
ASEM2 on a wide range of important international issues and the
furtherance of Asia-Europe cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The four-point proposal he put forward on the further expansion
and strengthening of cooperation in economy and trade, science and
technology and finance as well as the strengthening of political
dialogue and consultation have been widely applauded by
participants at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that the endorsement of the four
documents, namely, the Chairman's Statement, a framework for
Asia-Europe cooperation, the Investment Promotion Action Plan and
the Trade Facilitation Action Plan, affirms the fact that the two
continents have entered an important stage of development in their
endeavor to build a new partnership.
</P>
<P>
How to view and defuse the financial crisis in Southeast Asian
nations was a highlight of the conference.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zhu said the financial turmoil emphasized the
importance and urgency of improving cooperation between Asia and
Europe. He said that all nations on the two continents should, on
the basis of long-term development, prop up coordination and make
joint efforts to guard against financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Asian economy will be much more vibrant
and prosperous after the Asian nations tide over the financial
crisis via reform.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that heads of state in the meeting
universally hailed China for providing as much financial aid as it
could to the nations hit hardest by the crisis.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Zhu Rongji's Europe Tour (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the invitation of Britain and France, Zhu paid an official
visit to the two countries before and after the ASEM2. He held
talks with leaders of the host countries and had wide contact with
people from various walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Britain and France are two key members
of the European Union (EU), which is one of the largest economic
and political organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
These two countries and China are also permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that expanding cooperation, enhancing trust
and promoting dialogue constitute an effective way to develop
mutual ties between the countries. They also conform to the common
interests of various nations and are conducive to the promotion of
global peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are glad to see a growing momentum in the EU
and its members in developing relations with China, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-British relations, the commentary says that
exchanges between the two countries in various fields are
gratifying. The smooth return of Hong Kong to China has provided
new opportunities for the two countries to further bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As to the Sino-French relations, the commentary says that the
two countries have conducted effective cooperation in many major
issues since they decided in 1997 on building a comprehensive
partnership oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says the EU's policy document "Building a
Comprehensive Partnership With China", which was issued on March
25, signifies another important move by the union to readjust its
China policy and speed up the development of relations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
It says that European leaders are realizing that China is a
trustworthy partner and cooperating with a prosperous and open
China should become the core of Europe's policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the issue of a joint statement on the
China-EU summit shows that relations between China and Europe are
developing along a sound rail.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Zhu briefed European leaders on the Ninth
National People's Congress, the current economic situation in
China and the policy decisions including major moves on reform
adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
The premier also reiterated China's policy on further opening
up to the rest of the world and reaffirmed China's stand to
develop and enhance relations with other Asian countries and
European nations on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual
benefit, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and
deepening cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary concludes that today's world is increasingly
characterized by the trend of multipolarization. With the
furthering of economic globalization and regional cooperation,
international politics and economic relations are undergoing --
and will continue to undergo -- substantial changes. The deepening
of Asia-Europe cooperation, which well conforms to the trend,
offers broad prospects for the future.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Approve 650 Mln Dlr Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed here Wednesday a 650
million U.S. dollar debt relief package for Uganda, under the
Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
The two international financial institutions believed that
Uganda has established a strong track record of economic
management and policy reform in recent years and has met the
requirements for receiving the package.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC was initiated in September 1996 and Uganda was the
first country declared eligible for such assistance in April 1997,
and it now becomes the first country to receive debt relief under
the HIPC.
</P>
<P>
Discounted to today's values, i.e., in net present value terms,
relief from all of Uganda's creditors will be worth 350 million
dollars, to which the World Bank and IMF will contribute about 160
million dollars and 69 million dollars respectively. The relief
amounts to a 20 percent reduction in Uganda's external debt. Over
time, the contributions of the World Bank and IMF will relieve
debt service payments equivalent to some 355 million and 80
million dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
This debt relief will release resources, estimated at 175
million dollars in the next five years alone, for meeting the
country's high-priority development needs, particularly in health
and education.

<HEADLINE> Paper: U.S. Military Seeks New Stealth Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is working
under three secret programs to coat assets from missiles to
soldiers with a radar-absorbing material, the Defense News weekly
reported in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The material was developed five year ago by Spectro Dynamic
Systems (SDS) in North Carolina with funding from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency. It immediately was placed under
wraps by the Department of Defense because of its unique ability
to provide stealth at a low price, the paper said in its April
6-12 edition.
</P>
<P>
The material can be used in paint, camouflage netting, fabric,
plastic covers and films, gaskets, caulk or even face paint to
dramatically reduce the radar or infrared signatures of vehicles,
missiles or people.
</P>
<P>
It also is virtually invisible to targeting lasers, meaning
tanks covered with the material would be difficult to hit, the
paper said citing Paul Schutt, manager of SDS.
</P>
<P>
Schutt estimated a Tube-Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire
Command Link (TOW) missile could be coated for 500 U.S. dollars
and a tank for about 2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The material was discovered partly through chance when the
company was developing a highly conductive water-based paint. The
company put the new paint through routine reflexivity tests and
found it could develop paint that generates few reflected or
transmitted signals, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The material, it said, works much like that on the B-2 stealth
bomber, but is lighter and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
The B-2's iron-based coating is a problem for smaller aircraft
because of its weight. SDS' material would have to be laid on too
thick for larger application to match the B-2 material's
effectiveness. But it is ideal for trucks, tanks, ships, missiles,
unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.
</P>
<P>
And the coating can be tailored to work against specific
frequencies or bands of detection sensors to better counter known
threats.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has asked SDS to forbid exporting of the
material on grounds of national security.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Bosnian Serbs indicted for
war crimes were arrested Wednesday by the Stabilization Force
(SFOR) in Bosnia, the State Department announced.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin said the two, identified as Miroslav
Kvocka and Mladen Radic, were associated with a prison in the
Bosnian town of Omarska.
</P>
<P>
They had been officers in charge of the Omarska detention camp
outside Prijedor, where Moslems and Croats were rounded up and
some were allegedly tortured and killed, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four people are publicly acknowledged to have been
indicted by the Hague-based court for war crimes in connection
with the conflict in Bosnia. Twenty-five are now in custody,
including the two latest detainees.
</P>
<P>
Rubin urged former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his
military commander Ratko Mladic, the two most prominent figures
accused of war crimes, to surrender.
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly the space for the remaining indictees is
shrinking," he declared.
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly it's apparent to Mr Karadzic that he has no place
to run and no place to hide and that it's time he realized that
his only choice is to turn himself in, and that the noose is
gradually tightening around his neck," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Hopes All External Debt Be Remitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Planning
and Finance Tomaz Salomao Wednesday expressed the hope of his
government that all its external debt, some 5.6 billion U.S.
Dollars, would be remitted.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here on Wednesday, Salomao
said:"Considering that Mozambique is one of the poorest
war-ravaged countries, we hope all our debt could be remitted."
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambican News Agency, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund decided on Tuesday in Washington
to include Mozambique in the list of the heavily-indebted poor
countries and to offer the southern African country a special aid
of 3 billion U.S. Dollars to help it to reduce its debt.
</P>
<P>
On this, Salomao commented that it meant the international
community acknowledged the efforts we have made in our economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
What the international community has done will help Mozambique
to reduce its external debt of 5.6 billion U.S. Dollars in 1996
down to 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars in June 1999, Salomao said.
</P>
<P>
The latest decision made by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund is "a great effort of our creditors",
he said.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of capital with interest that Mozambique
should pay in 1997 was 80.3 million U.S. Dollars and the figure
is expected to go up to 86 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Royal Yacht to Be Converted into Conference Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) - The British government announced
Wednesday that Britannia, the royal yacht which has retired after
44 years of service, will rest at Leith near Edinburgh, Scotland,
as a tourist attraction and conference center.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson said Wednesday during the
question time at the House of Commons that the 6,000 ton Britannia
will become the focal point of a new 60 million pound (100 million
US dollars) ocean liner terminal at Leith.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, technically owned by the Defense Department, was
sold for an undisclosed sum to a charitable trust being promoted
by terminal owners Forth Ports Plc .
</P>
<P>
"I was particularly impressed by Edinburgh's proposal to retain
the yacht as a living entity by using her for prestige conferences
as well as the more traditional public display," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Forth Ports bid had narrowly edged out one
from the Manchester Ship Canal Company, which had wanted the
vessel to become the centerpiece of a 40 million pounds (66
million US dollars) Northern England theme park.
</P>
<P>
Britannia was taken out of commission last year after having
sailed for more than one million sea miles, the equivalent of more
than 40 times around the world.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Vice President Urges Moslems to Avoid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Dr. Omar Juma has called on Moslems to live harmoniously with
people of other religions and stop confrontation with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Omar, who was speaking after Id El Haji prayers at Simba
Mbali Mosque in Dar es Salaam Wednesday, stressed that the
government respects and treats all religions equally and has no
plans to interfere with freedom of worship provided by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen has the freedom to worship, but preachings
against other religions will not be tolerated by the government,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Omar challenged Moslems in the country to cultivate the
culture of loving each other regardless of religious beliefs and
learn to advise and educate each other on ways of solving
problems.
</P>
<P>
He also said burning of government vehicles will not help
Moslems solve their problems but rather create a rift not only
with the believers of other religious denomination but also among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The vice president warned genuine Moslems to be wary of those
people who set the government and its institutions rather than
religious believers as target of attacks.
</P>
<P>
The religious extremists have their own agenda and used the
genuine Moslems to accomplish their mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Moslems have problems or feel that their
rights have been denied they should forward their claims to the
government through normal channels.
</P>
<P>
Dr Omar said that Moslems in the country should work hard to
improve the socio-economic development of the nation for the well
being of the citizens rather than concentrating on petty issues
and believing baseless claims.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sheikh Shaban Said Chopa and Sheikh Selemani Kilemile
said that it is important for Moslems to use Id El Haji, the
pilgrimage day, to repent on their behaviors and follow the
religious teachings.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Moslems should unite and live harmoniously
with people from other denominations.
</P>
<P>
Since Mid-February, three riots have taken place in the areas
close to the Mwembechai Mosque in Dar es Salaam. The first riot
was reportedly to have erupted after the police went to seize
several Moslem extremists who had preached against other
religions.
</P>
<P>
The police have arrested hundreds of rioters who set fire on
government vehicles and caused bodily harm to people.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross
discussed ways of reviving year-long deadlocked Middle East
peace process with a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Wednesday in London, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the aide who
talked with Ross in London was Yitzhak Malcho, leading Israeli
negotiator with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Malcho was sent by Netanyahu to Washington for talks. It was
not immediately clear how the discussions between Malcho and Ross
ended up in London.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed by Ross and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the difficult situation
in the Middle East. And the president directed Ross to keep trying
to bridge gaps between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The United States is pressing Netanyahu to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in a new pullback phase to the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Israeli news reports said Netanyahu's government was
considering a plan under which Israel would turn over 9 percent
of the West Bank to full Palestinian self-rule, and 3 percent
more would be turned over to Palestinian civil control with
Israeli troops providing security.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said they expect far more than 15
percent in the next withdrawal, but privately have signaled they
would accept the American plan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have currently full and partial control over
27 percent of the West Bank and most of the Gaza Strip.

profit-taking, a weaker dollar and an unsteady Dow.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed at 6,055.2,

<HEADLINE> Trade Representative on China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Trade Representative Long
Yongtu has accused certain members of blocking China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by making insatiable demands
to China.
</P>
<P>
"Without referring to the average level of Uruguay Round
results as the parameters, it would be absurd and irresponsible to
say that China 'still has a long way to go' to make a tariff offer
to meet the conditions as a WTO member," Long said at the seventh
meeting of the Working Party on China's WTO accession here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Long, also deputy minister of foreign trade, and his delegation
brought to Geneva a comprehensive package of tariff reduction plan
which has been circulated to all the delegations.
</P>
<P>
China's latest tariff offer includes the reduction of the
average tariff rate for industrial products from the current level
of 16.6 percent to 10.8 percent by 2005, 35 percent lower than the
current level.
</P>
<P>
Long cited the documents compiled in 1994 by WTO's predecessor,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which contained
the statistics of post-Uruguay tariff levels for industrial
products of 13 members of developed economy and 27 members of
developing economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Long said, in terms of
trade-weighted tariff average of industrial products, five out of
the 13 members of developed economy have higher tariff rates than
China's current offer, and the tariff level of China's offer is
lower than that of 23 out of the 27 members of developing economy.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that, with regard to the so-called
tariff peak, developed economies on average have 15 percent of
their total tariff higher than the peak tariff, and the developing
economies have 75 percent of their total tariff higher than the
peak tariff, whereas only 19.7 percent of the tariff lines in the
current offer of China are higher than the tariff peak.
</P>
<P>
"China's latest tariff offer for industrial products is much
lower than the average level reached by parties to the Uruguay
Round tariff negotiations," Long told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Long stressed that those few countries "should be aware that
the current negotiations are multilateral trading negotiations on
China's WTO accession and are not for the purpose of satisfying
the insatiable demands of certain members".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for Japan's Strong Measures to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Washington, worried about
Japan's weak economy, is calling on Tokyo to take strong action to
save it from recession, White House chief economic adviser Janet
Yellen said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely concerned about the Japanese economy," said
Yellen, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers. She was
speaking one week ahead of a meeting of the Group of Seven major
industrial nations in Washington, which is expected to renew a
call for Japan to revive its stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
She said Japan was so depressed that only a substantial fiscal
stimulus could help the economy regain momentum and contribute its
part to recovery in crisis-ridden Asia.
</P>
<P>
"This situation in Japan is really very worrisome," she said.
"Demand is so weak and the problems there are so significant that
it calls for a substantial policy response that has not yet been
totally forthcoming."
</P>
<P>
"All of us in the administration feel that it's very important
for Japan to grow. It's very important for Japan, it's important
for us, it's important for the whole Asian region that Japan has
to be a source of growth -- not a problem, but part of the
solution," she added.
</P>
<P>
Yellen said the United States was looking for Tokyo to announce
strong fiscal measures -- in particular tax cuts -- to revive the
economy which she said was "in danger of serious deflation."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Visits Zambia on Security Along </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the United Nations
Security Council committee on sanction against Angola's former
rebel movement Unita, Njugura Mahugu, arrived here on Wednesday
to discuss with Zambian officials on the security along
Zambian-Angolan border.
</P>
<P>
Zambian acting foreign minister, labor and social security
minister Newstead Zimba told the U.N. envoy that his country is
looking forward to a successful and peaceful implementation of
the peace accord signed by the Angolan government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
Lusaka in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He commended the U.N. Security Council for its peace efforts
in Africa and other parts of the world, saying that peace and
stability are essential to social, economic and political
development of a nation.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said the four-day visit will give Mahugu an opportunity
to get first hand information on the allegations that Zambia is
violating the U.N. sanctions by supplying arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Magugu praised Zambia for playing a part in the peace process
in Angola when it hosted the signing of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction that Zambia will continue supporting
the peace process including maintaining a ban on the supply of
arms.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to tighten the security system at this point
of peace process in Angola," Mahugu sald.
</P>
<P>
Angolan ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto charged on March 5
that Zambians are supplying arms to UNITA through Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He warned that whilst his country does not wish to have a
repeat of the Congo-Brazzavile and Congo Kinshasa incidents where
the Angolan government participated in dislodging the governments
there. "Angola does not rule out any option if UNITA does not
stop getting arms from some territories."
</P>
<P>
But Zambian president Frederick Chiluba on March 12 denied
that his government has any involvement in the supply of arms to
any country.
</P>
<P>
The president however said that his government will investigae
allegations that Zambia is being used as a transit point for arms
to UNITA, which fought a civil war of about 20 years against the
Angolan government after the country's independence in 1976.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co. is adding a
smaller and sportier model to its luxury wide-bodied lineup,.
</P>
<P>
Its new model appears first on the New York International
Automobile Show, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The new Lincoln LS, which will go on sale next year, is about
the same size as the BMW 5-series and is expected to retail for
around 30,000 U.S. dollars. Lincoln will continue selling its
trademark Continental and Town Car.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said that they hope to attract potential
buyers who now drive import luxury cars such as BMW, Mercedes and
Lexus. But industry watchers said it may be difficult for Ford to
push the new model in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the company hopes to capture some import
buyers, and in the short term sell the cars to people who drive
domestic brands.
</P>
<P>
Foreign luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus have
been sharing greater U.S. market. Sales by BMW and Mercedes-Benz,
for instance, grew 16 percent and 19 percent, separately last
year, while Lincoln-Mercury sales grew just 3 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Crack Down on Noisy Car Alarms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The reckless screaming of car
burglar alarms, long a headache for Beijing residents, should
become less strident soon.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday, the alarms will be placed under government
regulation according to a circular jointly issued by local
departments including the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau
and the Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The circular regulates reckless alarming through four
procedures including the production, sale, installation and use of
the device.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 1.2 million vehicles, 300,000 of which are owned by
individuals and have alarms.
</P>
<P>
Mistaken alarm sounds produced by the city's private vehicles
are estimated at one million times every day and seriously disturb
the normal life of Beijing residents. These vehicles are often
parked in residential areas.
</P>
<P>
The circular requires that a qualified alarm device shall not
sound from such activities as thunderstorms, hail, vibration
caused by passing vehicles or someone's touch.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle users are not allowed to set off the alarm when opening
doors or searching for their vehicles. When the alarm sounds,
users must take immediate action to stop it and must not allow the
noise to continue.
</P>
<P>
Producers and dealers of the alarms must also take measures to
avoid noise pollution caused by mistaken theft information, the
circular says, adding that if the device disturbs nearby residents
by mistake, its user will be fined no more than 50 yuan (6
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Planning to Capture Pol Pot for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is planning
to seize former Khmer Rough leader Pol Pot for trial, the New York
Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said President Bill Clinton had ordered the
Departments of Defense, State and Justice to devise plans for the
arrest and trial of Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
Under one plan being discussed within the Clinton
administration, an American military plane would take Pol Pot from
Thailand to a third country, possibly the Netherlands, where
international tribunals are prosecuting war crimes carried out in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military official said the Pentagon had drawn up a list
of interim sites where Pol Pot might be held until a location for
the trial was selected.
</P>
<P>
These include the Northern Marianas Islands and Wake Island --
both American territories in the Pacific -- or the American naval
base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Western diplomats as saying that the Thai
government has suggested it would be willing to take Pol Pot into
custody as long as the United States agreed to spirit him out of
Thailand within hours of his capture.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the Thai government "is being cooperative,
and their cooperation will be essential if we're to pull this out."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has ordered the State Department to oversee
negotiations with Thailand, the Netherlands and other nations that
might be involved in the apprehension and trial.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has been asked to review the legal
authority that would be needed under international law for the
United States to become involved in the detention of Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
The Western diplomats said prosecutors at the international
tribunals in the Hague had already tentatively agreed to organize
a trial for Pol Pot for crimes against humanity, as long as the
United Nations Security Council empowers them to oversee the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France and other nations have begun drafting
a Security Council resolution to deal with such a trial, the
Western diplomats said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Statistics Bureau
said today that the number of persons from other parts of China
who make a living in Beijing has decreased by 13 percent over 1994
figure.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest census, Beijing now has some 2.80 million
persons of this kind, down 400,000 over the figure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
That is because that since 1994, Beijing has worked out 11
sets of management rules regarding the fields of employment, public
security, housing and family planning, said Gu Yanzhou, deputy
director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
An official from Beijing Public Security Bureau said more than
300,000 persons without legal employment certificates were forced
to leave Beijing in 1997 alone. And almost 40 trades don't employ
non-natives any longer.
</P>
<P>
These persons mainly came from Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Sichuan,
Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- It is not an unusual scene to
see over 150 prominent figures from the commercial, professional
and government sectors of Hong Kong gathering for a luncheon
party, but definitely the occasion on Thursday afternoon carries a
much wider meaning.
</P>
<P>
It evolves from a long-time tradition, dating back to the
1930s. In the form of a luncheon party, community leaders and
government officials avail themselves of the opportunity of
meeting socially once a month to exchange views on an informal
basis.
</P>
<P>
Formally titled the "Monthly Thursday Luncheon" (MTL), it is
held every second Thursday of each month, except when the date
falls on a public holiday and the luncheon will be canceled for
the month.
</P>
<P>
As in the past, the luncheon is presided over by the Convenor
of the Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
Attended by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, as guest of honor, Thursday's party
was patronized by 158 celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the party, Executive Council Convenor Sze-yuen Chung
said: "With the re-unification of Hong Kong with the motherland
and the progressive development of democratic government, it is
thought that there should be a closer interface and more frequent
exchange of views between the government and the private sector.
This luncheon party is organized with this purpose in mind."
</P>
<P>
The MTL has now a membership of some 250 persons. Members are
drawn from two groups -- the three branches of the government and
the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of CPC Style of Work Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's leading officials at all
levels were urged today to improve their style of work to promote
social development.
</P>
<P>
They should strictly implement the eight stipulations on
curbing extravagance and squandering of public money set by the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
State Council, said Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wei made a nine-day tour of southwest China's Sichuan Province
which ended today. Accompanied by local officials, he went to
factories, research institutes, rural areas, and high-tech
development zones.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sichuan has made remarkable achievements in
implementing the stipulations, which include strict controls over
building and interior decoration of office buildings and on
holding all kinds of meetings and celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials are forbidden to use public funds to hold
banquets, install household phones or purchase mobile phones, and
must use cars strictly according to regulations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the investigation of major cases, stress must be
put on cases involving leading officials, and corrupt officials
must be punished severely, said Wei who is also secretary of the
CPC's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Corrupt officials are very few in government or Party
organizations, he said, stressing the importance of halting
extravagance and squandering of public money by leading officials.
</P>
<P>
"We must both crack down on corruption cases that have already
cropped up, and prevent corruption at its very source," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to "Streamline" Relations with Latvia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky Thursday denied that Russia is imposing "economic
sanctions" on Latvia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia's decision to take economic measures
against Latvia is designed to "streamline" the relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that Russia may "streamline"
Russian-Latvian customs relations, tariff on railways and for road
carriers.
</P>
<P>
He also said Russia wants to build new ports on the Gulf of
Finland to protect itself from political fluctuations in relations
with states through which Russian oil is exported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refuted reports that Russia's measures against
Latvia testify to changes in Moscow's Europe policy.
</P>
<P>
Russian acting Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko Wednesday said
the government has prepared a number of economic sanctions against
Latvia for its "discrimination" against ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
Latvian Ambassador to Russia Imant Daudis alleged Thursday that
Russia's economic sanctions on Latvia in fact have taken place.
</P>
<P>
The other two Baltic countries, Lithuania and Estonia,
denounced Russian attempts to impose sanction on Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Latvian relations have become tense since early March
when Latvian police forcefully ended a Russian-speaking rally in
Riga, the capital of the Baltic country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Issue New 20 Dollar Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is to roll
out a new 20-dollar bill, aiming at using high-tech to combat
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the country revamped its 100 and 50 dollar bills
and seemed to be effective in the anti-forgery battle.
</P>
<P>
This time, the introduction of the 20-dollar bill is more
significant, analysts said, because it is printed by the U.S.
Treasury in numbers second only to the one-dollar bill, and it is
the most widely counterfeited bill.
</P>
<P>
The new bill will be unveiled in late May but won't be
available until the fall, according to sources reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Like the 50 dollar and 100 dollar notes, the 20 dollar note
features enlarged portrait, concentric fine lines, a watermark and
a far left vertically embedded polymer thread.
</P>
<P>
The government will begin a public awareness campaign with the
new bill's debut.
</P>
<P>
The country will also issue the new 10-dollar note in the
summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. newspaper reports, the dollar value of
counterfeit money has shown a downward trend in recent years --
from 108 million U.S. dollars in 1995 to 72 million U.S. dollars
in 1997. The genuine U.S. currency circulated worldwide stands at
450 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the number of people involved in making funny money is
growing fast. In 1995, a total of 1,856 were arrested. In 1997,
the number grew to 2,436.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industrial Sectors' Profits Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The performance of most Chinese
industrial firms registered a sharp decline in the first two
months of this year with profits of 1.617 billion yuan, down 83
percent over the same period in 1997, according to the latest data
from the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The results of a survey by the bureau of 170,000 businesses
nationwide indicates that the state-owned sector suffered the most
in the slump, registering 7.61 billion yuan in losses, more than
three times the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The collectively owned sector turned out 4.72 billion yuan in
profits, up 11 percent on an annual basis. The profits of
stock-holding companies amounted to 536 million yuan, down 49
percent. That of overseas-funded enterprises was 3.39 billion
yuan, down 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
SSB officials said the heavy losses were mainly caused by
declining consumption and low prices on the domestic market. The
central government's efforts to stimulate the investment and
consumption demand is expected to take effect no earlier than this
summer.
</P>
<P>
They said that the temporary profit upsurge in Chinese
enterprises last year was the result of interest cuts by the
central bank to relieve the financial burden on industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
An analysis released by the State Development Planning
Commission said that the country's economic growth should gain
momentum in the second half of this year. As long as the
year-on-year increase margin in investment remains at 15 percent
or more, China's gross domestic product could grow by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the sources of capital and cash circulation scale
in China, such an increase in investment can be guaranteed, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Banks Discovers Counterfeit U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean police authorities said
Thursday that three commercial banks in Seoul found bogus
U.S. notes with a total face value of 10,300 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police said that out of the 103 fake one-hundred-dollar notes,
95 were found at a Korean Exchange Bank branch, six at a Seoul
Bank branch and two at a Hanil Bank branch.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for passing the counterfeit money will face
criminal charges, said police.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. notes were found after the banks exported them to a
U.S. bank in Hong Kong. The notes were returned to the Korean
banks.
</P>
<P>
The fake greenbacks were all deposited late last year when the
nation started a drive to collect foreign currency to ease its
economic difficulties due to corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said they once found and stamped bills with the
word "counterfeit" and returned them to the depositors.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Exchange Bank has so far retrieved 89 of the 95
released fake notes from depositors.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that even more bogus U.S. dollars are in
circulation in the financial crisis-engulfed country, which is in
dire need of foreign currency, said police.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities are stepping up their efforts to
investigate domestic commercial bank officials. They also urged
local banks to guard against possible fake greenbacks in
circulation.

ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said Pakistani and Indian leaders are expected to meet
during the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The annual SAARC summit is scheduled to be held in July in the

India, the two biggest South Asian nations, are to attend the
summit.
</P>
<P>
According to a report Thursday by the Associated Press of
Pakistan, Ayub Khan made the remarks in an interview with the
Voice of America (VOA).
</P>
<P>
When asked about any possibility of holding dialogue at the
foreign secretary-level between Pakistan and India, Ayub Khan
said, "we have yet to watch because SAARC summit is due to be held
on July 15 on the occasion of golden jubilee of Sri Lanka."
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan noted that since all the heads of government and
heads of state of the seven South Asian nations will take part in

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Develop 500-meter Radio Telescope (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China Plans to develop a 500-meter
aperture-active, spherical radio telescope which can fill the
geographic vacancy for the global deep-space exploration and
communication network, a Chinese senior astronomer said today.
</P>
<P>
The telescope will be built in a 500-meter-diameter Karst
Valley in southwest China's Guizhou Province, Professor Li Qibin,
head of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory (BAO), told the Third
Annual Meeting on Large Radio Telescopes.
</P>
<P>
He said a group of small spherical pieces, which can be
adjusted by computers, will be placed in the valley to form a
300-meter effective aperture for the telescope.
</P>
<P>
The telescope will have high sensitivity and resolution for
China's deep-space exploration project and will make up for the
vacancy in longitude between the current three deep-space
exploration and sensing stations, which are located in the United
States, Spain and Australia, and complete a global,
round-the-clock remote control and communication service, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The telescope will have a capacity 10 times stronger than the
world's current largest radio telescope, for observing faint and
distant objects in space. It can also raise the ability of human
beings to search for extraterrestrials in outer space, said
Professor Nan Rendong, deputy-director of BAO, who is in charge of
the project.

<P>
The 100-meter aperture telescope in Germany is now the largest
active single-dish telescope in the world.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that studies on some key problems of astronomy,
such as the evolution of stars and galaxies and the exploration of
"black holes," require large radio telescopes with higher
sensitivity and resolution.
</P>
<P>
At an international conference of the Union of Radio Science
International (URSI) held in 1993, scientists from the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, China and five other countries
suggested building a one-square-kilometer telescope, which
would have a sensitivity 100 times higher than the one in Germany.
</P>
<P>
China formed a special committee in 1996 to promote the
construction of the large telescope. The committee suggested to
URSI building the telescope in China's Guizhou Province, where
Karst valleys can provide a natural spherical shape for the
telescope.
</P>
<P>
The development of a 500-meter aperture telescope is only
part of the project.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from BAO, the Research Institute of Remote Sensing
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Academy of Space
Technology are now working to reduce the cost of the telescope to
25 million U.S. dollars, which is much lower than the world
average, Nan said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Civil Aviation Sees Buyer's Market (1) by Xinhua writer Wang Weiping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's aviation market has been
regarded as a "big cake" attracting many overseas and domestic air
carriers. The industry, however, is entering a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, while the growth rate of civil aviation transport
has declined, the country's airline and aircraft fleet scale has
been expanding, causing a surplus of transport capacity.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that on domestic air routes, the average
occupancy rate was 75.9 percent in 1995. That figure fell to 72.4
percent in 1996, and to 68.8 percent in 1997, although the total
number of air travel trips rose by 1.3 percent on a yearly basis
to reach 56.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Spring Festival this year, airlines began to
sell various "discounted tickets." Shenzhen Airlines offered a
60-to-80 percent discount on ticket prices. China United Airlines
offered new preferential policies on the basis that its price was
already 15 to 20 percent lower than that of other companies.
Actually, the discount system was put forward for the first time
in July of 1996 by China Eastern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
This is both a breakthrough for the price reform of civil
aviation and a result brought about by fierce competition from
other means of transportation such as by motor vehicles and
trains, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The country now has more than 4,700 kilometers of expressways
after several years of development, posing a strong challenge to
air transport.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Taiyuan expressway, which went into operation in
June of 1996, captured more than 20 percent of travelers who used
to fly. After the Chengdu-Chongqing expressway was put into
service in 1996, air traffic dropped to 11.8 percent of the
original figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, railway departments won back part of the
market share after adopting such measures as raising trains'
speed, operating "arrive-in-a-night" trains, and selling monthly
train tickets.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers carried by trains went down 12.3
percent in 1996 on a yearly basis, while the figure inched up in
1997, the Ministry of Railways said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign airlines have also "eaten up" part of the market
share. At present, 19 foreign air carriers have direct flights to
China. Although China still has some "air space protection"
policies, domestic airlines have begun to feel the pressure from
their foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xinghua, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC), said the air transport network cannot match
foreign airlines because the "large and scattered" network of 34
airlines is not competitive enough.
</P>
<P>
Another source said that the country is considering the
formation of a number of big air transport groups through mergers
with Air China, China Eastern Airlines Group, and China Southern
Airlines as the core.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the current "price war" among airlines is
temporary and will stop when the price reaches a reasonable level,
but the service competition of air carriers will continue,
providing the impetus for further development of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Extra Tax Cut to Stimulate Economy in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan will cut four trillion yen (31
billion dollars) in individual income taxes over two years to
revitalize their stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on a nationally
televised news conference the Japanese government will implement a
two trillion yen income tax cut this year and another two trillion
yen cut next year.
</P>
<P>
"I resolved to take necessary and sufficient economic measures
to restore confidence at home and abroad in the Japanese economy
and the government's economic management," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
The tax cuts will be part of the government's pump-priming 16
trillion yen (about 121.2 billion dollars) spending package, the
largest in the country's history, which is expected to be unveiled
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business circles had demanded large tax cuts to revive
the worsening economy, once the world's second largest, which has
been stalled since 1992.
</P>
<P>
But the government had hesitated to do so because of the Fiscal
Structural Reform Law, under which fiscal austerity policy is
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to revise by June the Fiscal Structural Reform Law, the
prime minister said that he would convene the fiscal structural
reform council on Friday, which he chairs, as a first step.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also said he wants to lower the corporate income tax
rate to match the international standards as early as possible in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The maximum corporate income tax rate in Japan now stands at
49.98 percent, considerably higher compared with the about 40
percent in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Quanxing Trounce Shenhua in Chinese Pro League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Zoran Masic scored
twice to lead Sichuan Quanxing to a surprising 4-1 win over the
visiting Shanghai Shenhua in the fourth round of the Chinese
soccer professional league here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were deadlocked at 0-0 in the first half, with
both having few chance throughout.
</P>
<P>
Quanxing, who had never defeated Shenhua in their eight
privious encounters, pulled ahead right in the 57th minute through
an own goal from Shenhua's captain Fan Zhiyi when he tried to
clear a cross from Masic.
</P>
<P>
Masic, who was transferred from Yugoslavian club Rad Beograd,
made it 2-0 in the 62nd minute with a close-range shot in the box.
</P>
<P>
Camargo Moura of Brazil revived Shenhua's hope by pulling one
back in the 73rd minute.
</P>
<P>
But Quanxing's scoring spree continued before a fervent home
crowd when Masic found the net again five minutes later by beating
Shenhua goalie Ou Chuliang in the pealty area after making a
spectacular solo run.
</P>
<P>
National player Li Bing anchored the win for Quanxing just five
minutes before the final whistle, shaking off a defender and
slotting the ball into the far corner of the goal.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Qingdao Hainiu edged Shenyang
Haishi 1-0, Dalian Wanda overpowered Wuhan Yaqi 7-0, Guangzhou
Apollo drew with Guangzhou Songri 2-2, Yanbian Aodong upset
Vanguards Huandao 1-0, Chinese Army ousted Shenzhen Pingan 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Nation Urged to Prepare for Fighting Floods, Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The whole nation was urged today
to prepare for the coming high-water season and to make sure
that big rivers and reservoirs across the country do not burst.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said today at a working meeting of the
State Flood Control Headquarters (SFCH) that all related
departments and localities should make early efforts to guarantee
that cities will not be inundated.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have some major flooding south of the
Yangtze River this year. Southern China had unusually heavy
rainfall this winter. In Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian and Zhejiang
provinces, rainfall was as much as four times normal.
</P>
<P>
"Good preparations should be made at all localities to ensure
the safety of people's lives and property as well as the smooth
progress of reform, opening-up and economic construction," said
Wen, also the director of the SFCH.
</P>
<P>
Top local leaders should be made responsible for anti-flood
work, input should be increased through various channels and
preparations should be made right away as the high-water season is
only two months away, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also called for efforts to fight the expected
severe drought in northern China. They include developing water
resources by all means, building more reservoirs and spreading
water-efficient irrigation techniques.
</P>
<P>
"All effective measures should be adopted to guarantee
spring farming to strive for a good harvest this year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nu Maosheng, minister of Water Resources, and Yan Hong, deputy
director of National Meteorological Bureau, also spoke at the
meeting.

TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Two strong earthquakes jolted
northern Japan Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties and no tidal wave warning were issued, the
Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the open-ended Richter scale
rocked Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on Thursday

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Slower Agriculture Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
projecting a zero- to-2-percent growth for the farm sector this
year with the El Nino weather pattern continuing to wreak havoc on
agricultural crops in the country, a local television reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), the Manila-based ABS-CBN television said the
NEDA is still confident of a 3-to-4 percent economic growth this
year as measured by gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The NEDA, the country's economic planning agency, expects
domestic output as measured by gross domestic output (GDP) to
expand between 2.4 and 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NEDA projections assume that the industry and services
sectors would continue to post positive growths this year, albeit
slower than last year.
</P>
<P>
The NEDA projections show that the industry and services
sectors expected to record a combined growth of 4.4 percent on the
"low" side, and 8.6 percent on the "high" side.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito was quoted as
saying that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy pace
this year, albeit somewhat slower than the 1997 GNP growth of 5.8
percent on account of the effects of the financial crisis and the
El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture last year grew by 2.8 percent, but it was the
combined 5.7-percent growth of the industry and service sectors
that helped the country's GDP expand by an encouraging 5.1-percent
level.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture's share of GDP is seen to slightly decline to 20.02
percent this year from 20.5 percent last year, while the industry
and services sectors are expected to account for almost 79.98
percent of GDP this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines plunged by 47 percent in the first quarter this year
to 11,133 units from 20,950 units sold in the same period last
year, local television reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sales in March dropped by a heftier 56 percent with total sales
reaching only 3,126 units or less than half of the 7.064 units
sold in the same month last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the February sales of 3,750 units, the March
performance was 16.6 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said the sharp drop in car sales reflected
the impact of the foreign currency crisis that hit the country.
</P>
<P>
Although interest rates have shown signs of slowing down,
officials said, consumers prefer to put on hold plans to purchase
new cars to a later time when the rates have finally settled down
to a more stable level.
</P>
<P>
Industry data showed that Toyota Motor Philippines Corp remains
the industry leader with total sales in the first three months
reaching 3,050 units. But the figure is 19 percent decline from
3,760 units in the same period in 1997.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls for Israeli Pullout of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Thursday called on Israel to withdraw
its troops from south Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the AL
chief told reporters that the United Nations resolution 425 is
very clear and does not need to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Israel had formally announced it was ready to implement the
resolution and withdraw its troops from south Lebanon provided
negotiated security arrangements are made with the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
The offer has been rejected by Lebanon, which argued that the
U.N. resolution cannot be negotiated and must be implemented
unconditionally and immediately.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the U.N. in 1978 after Israeli first
invasion of Lebanon calls for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the AL supported Lebanese government's
stance over the Israeli proposal, adding that the Israeli offer is
a "maneuver" aimed at separating Lebanese track from Syria during
peace talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's News Economic Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- zimbabwe's new economic reform
program launched by President Robert Mugabe here Thursday commits
the government to ambitious and specific targets.
</P>
<P>
These targets involve the reduction of the high budget
deficit, the increase of economic growth, macro-economic
stability, the creation of employment and reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The five-year program (1996-2000), dubbed Zimbabwe program for
economic and social transformation (Zimprest), seeks to promote
economic empowerment as a way of reducing disturbing high levels
of poverty, through encouraging entrepreneurial initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Other major objectives of the Zimprest, a successor to the
economic structural adjustment program (Esap) which ran from 1991
to 1996, are urgent restoration of low levels of inflation and
interest rates, a stable exchange rate, and mobilization of
public and private savings to boost investment needed to spur
growth.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit, which at around 10 percent of gdp is seen
as the most destabilization factor in the macro-economic
environment, should be reduced to under five percent with a
corresponding fall in inflation from over 20 percent to single
digit levels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the need for export-led growth, the government
envisages continuous growth in exports at a rate of nine percent
per annum in U.S. Dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
''The economy must grow by eight percent to 10 percent in
non-drought years in order to restore per capita levels of
income, consumption and employment to 1990 levels at the start of
the next decade,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
''Policy changes to encourage labor intensive technologies,
and market friendly initiatives to redistribute access to
existing productive resources and make better use of them will
play a role, but durable success can only be achieved in the
context of strong and sustained economic growth,'' the document
says.
</P>
<P>
Investing in human resources development would be another
highlight of the program.
</P>
<P>
The program would also seek to complete unfinished business
from Esap which includes parastatal reform, reforming the
financial sector and the civil service while new challenges are
formulating drought preparation programs and awareness programs
to mitigate the effects of the AIDS pandemic on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Economic empowerment and private sector development will
remain a priority under the Zimprest. Crucial to the program will
be the removal of obstacles to black economic empowerment which
is seen as central to the program's growth and employment
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Land will continue to be acquired for the purposes of
settlement and the mechanisms to authorize sub-division of large
commercial holdings into smaller viable units would be
streamlined.

<HEADLINE> Deaths From Illness Down Sharply in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The rate of death due to illness
declined by 33 percent over the past 25 years in Israel, local
daily Haaretz reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted figures released by Israeli National Bureau
of Statistics (NBS) as saying that in this period the rate
has declined by 38 percent for woman and 29 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
The largest decrease was recorded in deaths from pneumonia. The
drop was more moderate for vascular diseases affecting the brain,
heart disease and infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
In a study comparing Israel with 10 European countries, North
America, Japan and Australia, NBS revealed that Israeli males are
more likely to die of ischemic heart disease than their Japanese,
French, Greek, Italian and Dutch counterparts, but less than in
North America, Australia, Norway and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Israeli women, however, are more likely than North American
women to die from these diseases.
</P>
<P>
Israeli men are less likely to die of cancer than men in all of
the other countries in the survey, but Israeli women die of cancer
more frequently than their Japanese, Greek, Finnish, French,
Italian and Australian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the suicide rate is lowest in Israel, Greece and
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Balance of Payments Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) posted a surplus of 429 million U.S. dollars during
the first quarter this year based on the change in its net
international reserves (NIR), according to the country's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published Thursday, the Central Bank of the
Philippines said the surplus was reversal from the 3.4 billion
dollar BOP deficit for the whole year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials attributed the BOP surplus to the rise
in the inflow of portfolio capital into the country that was
invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reported earlier that net foreign portfolio
funds in the country amounted to 425.3 million dollars as of the
first quarter, a seven percent increase from 398 million dollars
recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The BOP is the record of the inflow and outflow of foreign
exchange in the country arising from trade, investments, and
foreign borrowings of residents. It has two categories -- the
current account and the capital account.
</P>
<P>
The current account records trade in goods and services as well
as transfer payment. The capital account records purchases and
sales of assets such as stocks, bonds and land.
</P>
<P>
A surplus in the BOP means that the country is earning more
foreign exchange than it is spending.
</P>
<P>
Persistent BOP problems in the country in the past forced the
country to accept support programs from the International Monetary
Fund which always prescribes structural reforms and policy
overhauls in exchange for financial backing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producers Prices Continue to Decrease in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producers prices fell
0.3 percent in March, marking the sixth consecutive month without
an increase, the Labor Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So much like the previous declines, the biggest price restraint
came from energy costs, down 1.9 percent, and computers, also down
1.9 percent. Meat prices fell sharply too, pushing food costs down
by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for
finished goods has fallen at a 4.2 percent annual rate, compared
with a 1.2 percent drop for all of 1997, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices dropped at a 25.9 percent annual rate during the
first quarter and food prices fell at a 1.5 percent
rate. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices
were unchanged in March and unchanged for the first quarter as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released here Thursday, the department
said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for
unemployment benefits inched down to 308,000 last week, from
310,000 the week before. Both numbers depict a thriving job market
with most employers anxious to maintain full staffs.
</P>
<P>
Both prices and the economy's growth this year have been
affected by an unusual mix of overseas turmoil, domestic strength
and weather.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices are slipping because demand is down in
trouble-ridden Asia, and also warm weather associated with the
Pacific Ocean current El Nino has curbed heating oil use and
oil-exporting countries haven't been able to agree on production
cuts.
</P>
<P>
Prices paid to gasoline producers tumbled 7.6 percent in March
and are 29.5 percent lower than a year earlier. Heating oil fell
4.5 percent in March, and residential electric power, 0.4
percent. Natural gas, however, rose 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices too have been influenced by El Nino's warmth.
Because feed remained available through the winter, ranchers and
farmers slaughtered fewer animals than usual, leaving an abundant
supply as spring began.
</P>
<P>
However, El Nino's rains have drowned vegetable crops in
California. Vegetables rose 5.5 percent last month, including
increases of 115.8 percent for cauliflower and 58.9 percent for
onions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from food and energy, the drop in computer prices, pulled
down by declining component costs from financially troubled Asia,
helped offset moderate increases for other items. Passenger car
costs inched 0.1 percent higher after falling during the two
previous months as a result of competition with cheaper Asian
imports.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco costs, which had been rising in anticipation of the
industry's expense of settling liability lawsuits, were unchanged
in March.
</P>
<P>
Prices also fell at earlier stages in the production process.
Intermediate goods by 0.5 percent and crude goods by 1.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Holds Seminar on Improving China's Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A two-day seminar on how to
improve the operation of China's medium- and small-size
enterprises by applying advanced information technology opened
today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Managers and experts from more than 1,000 enterprises are
attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The medium- and small-size companies have maintained an annual
growth rate of 30 percent in output value since the 1980s, said
Bao Guoqiang, an official from the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, he said these companies need to improve their
awareness of management skills and efficiency by using information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the 270,000 overseas-funded enterprises in
China have been established by countries from Southeast Asia, the
Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The
financial crisis has been a negative influence on these firms.
</P>
<P>
With the purpose of raising the efficiency of China's medium-
and small-size enterprises, James W. Jarrett, president of Intel
China, said that his firm would cooperate with the country's
computer companies and provide a series of information
technological products which are simple and convenient to install
and operate.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Corp., IBM and Hewlett-Packard from the United States
and Beijing University Founder Group displayed their advanced
products.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is being jointly sponsored by the Intel
Corp. and the State Economic and Trade Commission.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Support for New Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the economic
reform program was launched here Thursday by President Robert
Mugabe amid calls for macro-economic stability in Zimbabwe after
the first phase's failure to meet some of the set targets.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the five-year program, Mugabe said, as a
Program for Economic and Social Transformation (Zimprest) in
Zimbabwe, its success depended very much on Zimbabweans'
commitment as a nation.
</P>
<P>
"My appeal to all Zimbabweans is to rally behind Zimprest with
unity of purpose. Let us cast away the negative spirit of
despondence, cynicism, creeping anarchy and suspicion, and make
the implementation of this policy a turning point," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe underscored the need for leaders in all sectors of the
economy to balance concerns for increased productivity of an
higher growth with those for equitable distribution of resources
and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The recent civil disturbances, he said, reflected frustration
not only with the escalating cost of living in Zimbabwe as a
result of macro-economic instability, but also with the growing
disparities in incomes.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that when Zimbabweans fail to observe the law
and integrity of their institutions in the way that had been
demonstrated in recent food riots, this did not only retard the
process of strengthening these crucial pillars of independence,
but the country ran the risk of undermining the political
stability already there.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in an environment in which the private sector
was increasingly playing the dominant role in the economy, the
government expected its leadership to be more accountable for the
attainment of the country's social objectives.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Interest in Egyptian Stock Market Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners are flocking to the
Egyptian stock market and bringing their investment banks with
them, Al-Ahram Weekly reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Egyptian Stock Exchange show that
foreign share-holdings represent 33 percent of 500 million
U.S. dollars overall market turnover during 1997, the highest
level for foreign investment since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The figures for the first quarter of 1998 are still unknown,
but experts estimate that foreign transactions in the first three
months of this year will amount to some 1.84 billion pounds
(541.18 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Not only has there been constant growth in foreign investment
but buy orders far exceeded selling activity, Abdel Ibrahim,
chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted by the
English newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 9.8 billion pounds (2.88 billion dollars) worth of
shares traded by foreigners in the 18-month period ending March
1998, buying orders accounted for 6.8 billion pounds (2 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The foreign interest is mainly concentrated on companies which
enjoy international recognition, including those listed on the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investable Index and those
with Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) traded abroad.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 54 Egyptian companies listed on the IFC
index and about six companies whose shares trade as GDRs on the
London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Foreign interest in the country is increasing as Egypt
committed to a serious privatization program and liberal economic
policies. This trend also encourages more financial institutions
to set up business in Egypt, including such heavyweight global
financial groups as Flemings and ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
However, as foreign investors are attracted to companies which
not only have good growth prospects but also enjoy large
capitalization, the stock is highly liquid, Khaled warned.
</P>
<P>
In face of increasing foreign activity, Egypt is quick to calm
fears that it might cause a crash on the lines of some emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros Ghali said last
week that the rise in foreign investments does not represent a
threat, as it contributes only a minimal percentage of the
country's gross national product.

<HEADLINE> Declaration on Safeguarding Historic Cities Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Mayors from 22 Chinese and foreign
cities issued a declaration here today to take every possible
means to protect the historic features of their cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to technical, economic and financial measures, an
effort to increase legislation, improve planning and raise the
public's awareness of protection should be taken to guarantee the
continuity of different cultures in historic areas, said the
Suzhou Declaration on International Cooperation for the
Safeguarding and Development of Historic Cities, which was signed
today at the International Conference for Mayors of Historic
Cities in China and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The 3-day meeting is being attended by more than 150
representatives from 15 Chinese and seven European historic cities
-- Beijing, Xi'an, Suzhou, Luoyang, Pingyao, Lijiang, Xiangfan,
Zhenjiang, Kunming, Nanjing, Lhasa, Qufu, Hangzhou, Chengde,
Harbin, Spain's Barcelona, France's Bordeaux, Chinon and
Strasbourg, Italy's Naples, Britain's Bath, and Sweden's
Visby. Other participants include experts from the UNESCO and
China's Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The meeting participants agreed that the safeguarding of
historic cities should not be limited to the individual historic
sites but instead should include the pertinent environment and
cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
China has 99 historic cities. Due to rapid population growth
and overemphasis on economic development, the features of many of
the cities have been destroyed. To reverse the trend, the Chinese
government has formulated an urban planning law. The meeting is
believed to help improve the Chinese city authorities' ability to
safeguard historic cities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investors Embrace Investment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese investors have found new
money-making chances in the country's first two securities
investment funds, which hit the market on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fund Jintai, which has been listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, rose a 10 percent limit to end at 1.55 yuan today. It
opened the Tuesday session at 1.45 yuan and ended at 1.41 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the fund's relatively small turnover of 240
million yuan today indicates that fund-holders are unwilling to
sell as they expect to get higher returns by holding their
positions longer.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Fund Jintai's net earnings were
12.24 million yuan between March 30 and April 3, the first week
after the fund was officially established. The earnings have
raised the net asset value of the fund to 1.0175 yuan from one yuan
per unit.
</P>
<P>
Fund Kaiyuan was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on
Tuesday. It opened the first session at 1.37 yuan and ended at
1.36 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the investment funds have been well received
mainly because the risks involved are comparatively smaller than
those for stocks while the investment cost is lower.
</P>
<P>
Both Jintai and Kaiyuan are closed-end investment funds worth
two billion yuan each. They are mandated to invest 80 percent of
their capital in stocks and the rest in treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The two funds will publish their net asset values on a monthly
basis and their investment portfolio every three months.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) - The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has urged the international community
to supply emergent food to the East Africa hit heavily by the El Nino
rains since late last year.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Thursday, the FAO said that substantial

The FAO said that the El Nino-led floods over the past few months
have caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and housing,
leaving many villages isolated or displaced in these countries.
</P>
<P>
To repair the damage is an immediate priority, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
"Assistance is needed to repair the damaged infrastructure in
eastern Africa in order to resume normal food supply lines," it said.

<HEADLINE> Hutu Militia Kill 26 Civilians in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A large number of armed Hutu
"Interahamwe" militia killed 26 people in Bulinga Commune near
Gitarama Town in central Rwanda in a pre-dawn attack Wednesday,
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The attack was carried out between 4:00 and 5:00 am by a huge
number of Interahamwe militiamen from southern Gisenyi
Prefecture," Rwanda News Agency quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the assailants came from Kibilira, one of the
communes in northwest Rwanda which are considered the hotbed of
the Hutu armed insurgency. Others are suspected to have flocked
out of Ndiza forests where they might have been hiding.
</P>
<P>
"The victims, most of whom women, children, and the elderly
were either shot dead or hacked to death," one Bulinga resident
told RNA.
</P>
<P>
Their houses were looted, then burnt down, he said, adding
"The militiamen also abducted an unknown number of local
residents."
</P>
<P>
According to officials from Gitarama Prefecture, Bulinga
government buildings, including the residence of the bourgmaster
(mayor) were also attacked and set afire, while the local prison
was stormed.
</P>
<P>
So far no details have been given as to how many prisoners,
most of whom genocide suspects, have been released in Wednesday's
attack.
</P>
<P>
Following a quick intervention by the army, the militiamen
tried to flee back to southern Gisenyi and Ndiza forests.
</P>
<P>
"A hot pursuit is underway," military sources in Gitarama told
RNA, affirming that calm had returned to Bulinga.
</P>
<P>
This the third time the Bulinga Commune was raided by armed Hutu
militia from southern Gisenyi or Ruhengeri prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Early December last year, about 300 militiamen attacked the
same commune and burnt government buildings. They also stormed
the local prison, releasing about 600 genocide suspects, most of
whom later handed themselves back to authorities.
</P>
<P>
Late February this year, there was another attack on Bulinga
and its neighbouring communes. Over 300 militiamen were killed in
clashes ensued, while 12 government soldiers also died, and
8 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen killed seven genocide survivors over the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Pledges to Be Surety of SADC Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will act as
surety for loans between Japan and countries of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), local daily Sowetan
Thursday quoted a reliable source as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The measure follows a lack of confidence by Japan in giving
loans to some of the SADC countries. One of the first
beneficiaries is to be Mozambique, which will receive 1.2 billion
Rand (240 million U.S. dollars) for an aluminium smelter.
</P>
<P>
"We find that Japan has confidence in South Africa and when we
want to raise loans there is no problem. But when we raise issues
about loans for countries like Mozambique and Angola, there are
hestations," said the unidentified source, who is currently
travelling in Tokyo, Japan, with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"We have now agreed that the loan will be given to South
Africa and we will pass the money on to Mozambique and they will
repay it to us. Then we pass it back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This way we hope to prove to Japan that they can trust
Mozambique," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues raised by Mbeki during his trip to Japan included
the extension of export credit facilities to Japanese companies
which invest in SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
Such facilities serve to boost confidence of business in
investing in those countries. Many countries, including the
United States and Britain, are providing such facilities to
encourage foreign investment in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Director General in Mbeki's office, Frank Chikane, said
Mbeki's visit was to convince Japan that Africa was undergoing a
renaissance and that it was the place to do business in.

<HEADLINE> W. Africa to Reduce Cost for Transit Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The cost for handling transit goods
in seaports within the west and central African sub-region is
expected to be reduced and regulated soon to promote shipping and
trade in the area.
</P>
<P>
A transit cost control body is to be set up by the Port
Management Association of West and Central Africa (PMAWCA) to
undertake this exercise, The Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Transit goods are those that pass through a port in a country
to another. They are not subjected to regular tariffs and taxes
in any country where they are handled. Rather, taxes designed
for such categories of goods are imposed on them at different
rates fixed by each country.
</P>
<P>
At its recent 22nd yearly council meeting, the 24-member
association resolved that the reduction of the cost for handling
transit goods will be preceded by an assessment which will
involve the collation of the various charges in each country.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a measure of control will be imposed on the level
of charges to be imposed by each member country.
</P>
<P>
PMAWCA, established 25 years ago, has urged its members to
develop an integrated information system to link port community
members in order to reduce transit time and costs, particularly
the administrative operational hurdles in handling transit goods.
</P>
<P>
The member countries are specifically urged to link their port
authorities with the internet, the world's information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
On the modernization of services, member ports are urged to
consider developing quality circles and ensure that all port
operators have the same objectives in terms of efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Organized Crime in Africa on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Organised crime, especially drug
trafficking, is on rise in Africa due to an underdeveloped
extradition system, The New Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Isam Abugideri, Director of the United Nations African
Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of
Offenders (UNAFRI), said the continent's extradition procedures
are the least- developed ones in the world.
</P>
<P>
Extradition is the surrendering of fugitives to the country
where their alleged crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking cases are increasing in recent years in
Uganda. The criminals used the country as a intermediate station
en route to South Africa, west Europe and north America. But the
Ugandan authorities have no enough fund to buy adequate equipment
to fight the criminals, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Kirenga, the Ugandan State Minister for Justice, said
Uganda's extradition law is formed in colonial days and is
"absurd in its inadequacy."
</P>
<P>
Uganda has extradition agreements with Chile, Finland and
Australia, but has no such agreement with its neighbors such as
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kirenga said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed to legislators to simplify the
extradition procedure in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fixed Assets Investment Slowing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's investment in fixed assets
was up 10.2 percent in January and February on an annual basis, an
increase that is 7.9 percentage points lower than the year-ago
period, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
China spent 37.8 billion yuan on capital construction during
the first two months, up 12.3 percent, but the growth rate is five
percentage points lower than for a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of investment in technical improvements was
down 25.7 percentage points and in real estate, 1.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The country spent 1.4 billion yuan on primary industry, in
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and water
conservation, up 7.5 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Energy, machinery and electronics, and raw materials got 13.4
billion yuan, 3.2 billion yuan, and 4.7 billion yuan,
respectively, up 20 percent, 79.4 percent and 0.6 percent.
Communications got 10.8 billion yuan, up 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that only a growth rate of 15 percent or more can
guarantee eight-percent growth in GDP this year, so the central
government will have more preferential policies to stimulate
investment to start a rebound in investment in fixed assets in the
second half.

<HEADLINE> Arab Mini-Summit to Be Held in Two Weeks: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A mini-summit of Arab states will be
held in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh within two weeks, Egypt's
Arabic language newspaper Al Akhbar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad, Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat are expected to
participate in the summit, the paper quoted an official Egyptian
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss the present deadlock in the Middle East
peace process and ways of saving it, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another daily newspaper Al-Ahram reported Thursday
that the mini-summit might be expanded to include leaders of
Morocco, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
These reports came five days after Egypt's presidential
political aide Osama el-Baz ruled out the convening of an Arab
summit in the near future. Cairo hosted the last Arab summit in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cairo Watch, an Egyptian Nile TV Channel
program last Saturday, el-Baz stressed that a summit will be
possible only "if it really serves the Arab cause in a specific
point or augments the Arab rights in a definite area."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who failed in his
last shuttle mission in the region more than a week ago, is
expected to return in two weeks in a "last-ditch" effort to bring
the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
He will be trying to persuade the Palestinians and Israelis to
reach a compromise over Israeli troop reployment in the West Bank,
the major sticking point in setting the peace wheel running again.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit, Ross was unable to talk both Israel and
the Palestinians into accepting a new U.S. proposal on a 13.1
percent Israeli pullback from the West Bank. Israel rejected the
U.S. plan, saying that any pullback more than 9 percent will
jeopardize its security.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled over a
year due to Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March last year and its long-delayed troop reployment
in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Leader of Italy's Major Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of

president, said here today that the Sino-EU relationship is an
important part of China's pursuit of an all-faceted foreign
relations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China attaches great importance to its ties with the
European Union (EU), Jiang said during his meeting with Massimo
D'alema, general secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left
(PDS) of Italy.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no conflict of fundamental interests
between China and the EU. On the contrary, he said, the two sides
hold identical or similar views on many major international
issues, and their economies are complementary.
</P>
<P>
China would like to establish and develop long-term,
trans-century friendly ties with EU countries including Italy on
the basis of mutual respect, each other's complementary
advantages, equality and mutual benefit, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that so long as the two sides
make joint efforts, the existing Sino-EU friendly ties will
develop further.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled his Italy visit 20 years ago, saying that the
long history as well as culture and art of the country deeply
impressed him.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy, which have enjoyed a long history of friendly
ties, have advanced their cooperation in various fields, Jiang
said, adding that China appreciated Italy's positive policy toward
China.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the CPC is pleased at the sound development
trend of its relations with Italy's PDS in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As party-to-party ties are an important component of China's
foreign affairs, Jiang said the CPC would like to pursue exchanges
and cooperative relations with all foreign parties that would
like to set up ties with the CPC, such as the PDS.
</P>
<P>
D'alema and his party arrived here today as the CPC's guests.
</P>
<P>
The PDS, founded in 1991 on the basis of the former Communist
Party of Italy, is now that country's biggest political party and
among the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
D'alema said that China has experienced great changes in recent
decades and its significant achievements in modernization have an
important bearing on the world.
</P>
<P>
Europe and the world at large are paying attention to China and
advancing ties with China, he said, adding that China's ties with
other countries in the world play an important role in the
establishment of a new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that exchanges and dialogues between the
PDS and the CPC would be furthered to promote the development of a
relationship between the two parties and the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Build Gun Plant in U.S. to Evade Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel Military Industries
(IMI), a state-owned company of Israel, will set up a gun plant in
the United State in a bid to evade an import ban on assault
weapons ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz reported on Thursday that IMI will
manufacture a civilian version of its noted Uzi submachine gun in
the factory, which will operate jointly with American
manufacturer Mossberg.
</P>
<P>
IMI has received the go-ahead of the Israeli Defense Ministry
for the project. And the initial connection with the U.S. firm
began about two years ago. The two firms set up a joint company to
market the so-called "Uzi Carbine."
</P>
<P>
The modified Uzi shotgun was on the list of 85 weapons banned
from being imported to American civilian market. The list was
published on Monday by the White House.
</P>
<P>
IMI and Mossberg have been examining ways to evade the
restrictions imposed by the presidential edict. Under U.S. law,
if the body of a weapon is manufactured in the U.S. and the weapon
is assembled there, it is considered a wholly American product.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with Mossberg, all the blueprints for
manufacturing the body of the Uzi will be transferred to one of
the company's plants in the U.S.. The rest of the parts will be
manufactured in Israel and sent to the U.S. for assembly.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Oceans Important to Chinese Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese young people pay close
attention to issues involving the oceans, especially oceanic
environmental protection and oceanic sovereignty, according to
survey results released today.
</P>
<P>
The China Youth Daily, which is considered influential among
Chinese youth, jointly conducted a nationwide survey with the
China Oceanic Oil News on oceanic awareness.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 youngsters were surveyed, of whom nearly 97 percent
expressed a love for the ocean, and 80 percent said they believe
the ocean is "very important" to their lives.
</P>
<P>
The majority of those surveyed said the ocean is mankind's
future living space. About 99 percent agreed that "the ocean is a
treasure house of resources."
</P>
<P>
Some 74 percent of the people surveyed said that China has
fallen far behind developed countries in developing the oceans,
and nearly 99 percent expressed their wish that the government
should increase spending on oceanic research and development.
</P>
<P>
Oceanic environmental development is also a priority for
Chinese youth. Some 97 percent of those surveyed said that laws
should be formulated to prohibit fishing during certain periods,
and 97 percent said that urban garbage should not be dumped into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that most of the youngsters have increased
their knowledge of the ocean through the news media, movies,
textbooks and scientific readings.
</P>
<P>
Some 91 percent of those surveyed expressed their wish to learn
more about the ocean, and the majority of them say that the state
should enhance oceanic education.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a half of the youngsters surveyed have received
university education, while only 5.4 percent did not advance past
junior middle schools.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Size and Food Shortage Led Ape-man's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that the
disappearance of gigantopithecus, a pre-historic man-like creature,
was the result of its huge size and lack of sufficient food.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was reached by Huang Wanbo, who discovered the
fossilized remains of 1.15-million-year-old Lantian Man in China's
Shaanxi Province in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Huang was head of a team that collected a great
number of fossilized bones of human beings and animals in the
Wushan Mountains near the city of Chongqing, where Wushan Man, who
is believed to be the earliest ancestor of the modern Chinese,
lived some two million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Huang has found that 14 teeth from gigantopithecus indicated
that its features were more than those of an orangutan of homo
sapiens and he also discovered the problem of size and shortage of
food in hard conditions.
</P>
<P>
Many questions still remain, however, he says, like: "Is
gigantopithecus more homo sapiens or ape?" and "Are the Bigfoot of
Hubei Province and Snowman of the Himalayas the offspring of
gigantopithecus?"
</P>
<P>
Scientists now are trying to find answers to these and other
questions, and there will be more excavations in the Wushan
Mountains to find evidence.

BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Marathon, one of the 10
listed marathons in the world with a history of 17 years, will
have its route changed this year, according to organizers here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The race, which scheduled for October 10, had its starting and
ending points at the Beijing Workers' Stadium over the past
years. The original route is fast and flat, but often made too
much traffic problems during the race since most part of the
course is in downtown area.
</P>
<P>
The starting point for the new course will be set at Tiananmen
Square and the the closing line will be arranged at the Olympic
Stadium. The race will be shifted from a return-route to an
one-way run this time.
</P>
<P>
The organizers also announced that besides the 42.195-kilometer
marathon races for the men and women runners, this year's event
will include half marathons for the men and women, as well as a
10km race and a 4.2195km race for children over 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
"Over 10,000 runners are expected to take part in the event.
The Chinese Athletics Association has issued out invitation
letters to more than 20 member associations of the International
Amateur Athletics Federation," said Shang Xiutang, vice president
of the CAA at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He also added that so far a total of 3,000-strong local runners
have registered.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expects Less Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Tourism Forecasting
Council (TFC) said Thursday that the Asian financial crisis will
prompt a 4.7 percent fall in the number of visiting tourists,
while the rapid fall in prices in the Asian region will lead to
Australians heading overseas in increasing numbers well into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
But the crisis is not expected to have a lasting effect on
tourism arrivals. The TFC predicted that the number of visitors
coming to Australia will recover in 1999 with growth bouncing back
by 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
TFC spokesman Grant Bowie said the most dramatic fall in
numbers would come from Indonesia and South Korea (each a 70
percent decline), followed by Thailand (50 percent) and Malaysia
(40 percent).
</P>
<P>
"The rapid fall in prices of overseas holidays, particularly in
the Asian region, is expected to result in more Australians taking
an overseas holiday rather than one in Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result the number of Australian residents traveling
overseas is forecast to grow by an average 5.4 percent a year to
2006-07," according to him.

PRAGUE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Referee Karel Vidlak and his two
linesman have been suspended after several bad calls in last
week's match between Sparta Prague and Slavia Prague.
</P>
<P>
Vidlak was imposed by a Czech Football Referee's Association
commission a four-game suspension, while linesman Petr Petrik was
given a nine-game ban. A second linesman, Jiri Vodicka, was banned

<P>
With Slavia leading 1-0, Vidlak awarded Sparta a penalty
kick at the end of the first half after a Slavia foul that

</P>
<P>
The penalty was missed but several other questionable calls
followed in the second half before Petrik failed to rule an
offside against Sparta in the dying minutes.
</P>
<P>
That allowed the Czech league leaders to keep up pressure on
Slavia which led to Vratislav Lokvenc's equaliser in the 84th

<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said today
that the NPC is ready to expand its exchange and cooperation with
Tanzania's parliament to further enhance Sino-Tanzanian friendly
ties.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Tanzanian President Benjamin

have reached consensus on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that he is satisfied with the outcome of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and Tanzanian parliament started mutual contact in the
1960s, and the two have already formed a cooperative relationship,
Li said. Sino-Tanzanian relations have stood the test of time and
changed with developments in the world situation.
</P>

Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has
made progress, with some Sino-Tanzanian joint-ventures turning a
profit, Li noted, adding that he hoped the two sides would
consolidate existing cooperative projects and explore new ways of
collaboration.

joint-ventures in the country, Mkapa said.

Li also briefed the Tanzanian president on the formation and
function of the NPC as well as China's political system.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Further Liberalize Investment Restrictions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue to
liberalize further investment restrictions in order to promote
competition and accelerate the revival of capital flows, visiting
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce,
Anwar, who is here on a two-day visit since Wednesday, said that
the policy of the Malaysian government is to "introduce more
competition in key domestic trading activities, particularly for
products subject to price controls, and reduce investment
restrictions (domestic and foreign) in the financial sector as
well as in other key sectors to alleviate capital shortages and
enhance efficiency."
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we have already raised the limits on foreign
investment in the telecommunications sector to 49 percent, in the
insurance sector to 51 percent and in the stock-broking industry
to 49 percent," said the deputy prime minister, who is also
Malaysian finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also called on the private sectors of Malaysia and
Singapore to expand their commercial partnership, pointing out
that this is to fully utilize the synergy of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The potential for collaboration in the private sector, though
much enhanced, is yet to be fully realized, he said, adding that
both have yet to see a joint trading house, as earlier envisaged,
to venture into a third country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade between Singapore and Malaysia forms the
largest factor of intra-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) trade and Singapore is Malaysia's third largest trading
partner after the United States and Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- In less than a week, there have
been three disastrous coal mine explosions in Henan Province in
central China, leaving 82 dead and 48 injured.
</P>
<P>
The first one occurred at 9:50 a.m. (Beijing Time) on April 2,
in a mine in the city of Hebi belonging to the Huaheng Industrial
Development Corp. Of the 26 people in the mine at the time, 21
were killed.

And, an explosion at 5:10 a.m. on April 6 in a mine in the city
of Pingdingshan left 47 dead and 11 injured.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials have gone to the sites, where rescue
workers have been busy looking for the injured and dead.

Two of the three mines had no license and the other did not
have proper certification of approval, provincial officials say.

The provincial government has urged local governments to
improve safety controls and take steps to stop coal-mine accidents
and no new coal-mines will be opened and mines operating illegally
will be closed.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Impose Anti-Dumping Duties on Corrugating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday announced
to impose anti-dumping duties between 8.1 percent and 35.4 percent
on corrugating medium paper from six countries following the
completion of investigations by the investigating authority.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers or exporters involved are from Australia,
Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Indonesia and South Korea, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
MITI said the investigations confirmed that dumping of
corrugating medium paper exported from these countries still
continued and the domestic industry was materially injured.
</P>
<P>
The duties collection would be enforced by the Royal Customs
and Excise Department and the final measure would be in effect for
not more than five years from the day the government gazettes the
final determination of the investigation on April 3, 1998, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The investigations were carried out following a petition lodged
on June 25, 1887 by the Malaysian Pulp and Paper Manufacturers
Association (MPPMA) on behalf of the Malaysian domestic industry
requesting anti-dumping measures be imposed on corrugating medium
paper.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Probe Military Intelligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Thursday
appointed a ministerial commission of inquiry into the
transformation of military intelligence services, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The commission's brief included reviewing past and present
covert structures, their representativity and lines of
accountability and reporting, Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie
Kasrils said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The eight-man commission, chaired by advocate M. Moerane, will
complete its work in three to six months and report directly to
the defense ministry, Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
The country's intelligence body had failed to provide
information on what was happening in the country over the past
four years, Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been serviced with the kind of information we
were looking for... We have found a dearth of data and processed
information to indicate to us what is actually occurring in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils said he and other defense officials were astounded
when they learnt of an intelligence report claiming that senior
African National Congress (ANC) members were plotting to topple
the government.
</P>
<P>
"There has been great concern whether defense intelligence has
been abiding by its mandate in terms of the national strategic
intelligence act of 1994," he said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was not prompted by the recent controversy of
the intelligence report, which resulted in the resignation of
South African National Defense Force (SANDF) chief George Meiring
on Monday, Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in December last year, and the current
developments testify to the need for transformation of defense
intelligence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the evaluation is to ensure that defense
intelligence is transformed and not reformed," Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has allowed opposition parties to
view the controversial intelligence report, which Meiring handed
to President Nelson Mandela in February, but only under
conditions of secrecy.

<HEADLINE> China Can Soon Make a "Titanic" of Its Own  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will soon have the sort of
technology used for producing the Oscar-award-winning film
"Titanic", according to Yang Buting, the deputy director of
China's Film Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He says that, since last year, the Chinese government has spent
26 million yuan (3 million US dollars) on a joint program of the
China Film Science and Technology Research Institute, Beijing Film
Studio, and Qinghua University, and that, "technologically
speaking", there will be no problem to do that.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese film goers dropped by more than a million
in the 1990s, and most film studios are running in the red, so,
Yang says, they are using state-of-the-art technology and
equipment from the U.S. to rejuvenate the nation's sluggish film
industry with science.
</P>
<P>
"Titanic" won 11 Oscars at last month's award ceremony,
including the one for best visual effects. Film critics say that
the successful application of digital technology is one of the
major reasons for the film's tremendous success. Many people have
said they felt that they were really in a disastrous situation
when they were watching it.
</P>
<P>
A combination of computers, lasers, and virtual reality
technology was used to achieve the sound and pictures that could
not be produced under other movie-making conditions, and this was
the main thing used to lure TV watchers back to the cinema in the
1990s in the West.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's biggest potential audience and films have
long been used as the major means to affect people's personalities
and behavior. So, the Chinese government is now urging film
producers to make movies more entertaining by joining the market
competition.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the films distributed in China are Chinese
products -- and most of them are boring. So, since the early
1990s, China has been importing Hollywood movies to satisfy
popular taste.
</P>
<P>
However, critics are complaining that Hollywood movies have
spread too much Western culture and are threatening the Chinese
film industry.

<HEADLINE> Iran Has Four Nuclear Bombs: Israeli Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran received four nuclear
warheads from Kazakhstan in early 1990s, local English daily The
Jerusalem Post reported Thursday, citing Iranian government
documents it obtained.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the documents contained correspondence between
Iran's government officials and leaders of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that discussed Iran's successful
efforts to obtain nuclear components from former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
These documents appeared to bolster reports from 1992 that
Iran received enriched uranium and up to four nuclear warheads
from Kazakhstan, with help from the Russian underworld, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
A detailed report released in 1992 by the United States
asserted that by the end of 1991, Iran had already all, or
virtually all, of the components required for two to three
operation nuclear weapons made with parts purchased in former
Soviet Muslim republics.
</P>
<P>
In one document dated December 26, 1991, a deputy head of the
IRGC told Rezi Amrullahi, then Iranian vice president and head of
the Atomic Energy Agency, that "two war material of nuclear
nature" had arrived from Russia and were being held by the guards.
</P>
<P>
An engineer is quoted in another document dated January 2,
1992, as saying that the nuclear warheads were being stored in
the Lavizan military camp in the Tehran area. He added that the
warheads contained flaws in the safety mechanism and was waiting
for Russian experts to arrive and repair them.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and U.S. officials appeared to believe in the
authenticity of these documents, the paper said. A senior Israeli
official was quoted as saying they "look awfully real" while a
U.S. government consultant said he was certain for the
authenticity of the documents.
</P>
<P>
The documents were obtained at a time when U.S. envoy to
Russia on the missile issue Robert Gallucci held talks here with
Israeli officials and intelligence heads on Russia's continued aid
to Iran's ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed on the amount of progress made by Iran in
developing a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers that is able
to reach Israel. This has caused deep concern in the Jewish state,
which regards Iran as the leading military threat in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel is considering to push the U.S. government to pass
sanctions against Russia for assisting the Iranian missile
development program.

Kiyonga revealed the figure on the World Health Day Tuesday in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Responding to his address, parliament member Timothy
Mutesasira told a meeting of his colleagues and their Cameroonian
counterparts here Wednesday that Ugandan girls started their sex
from an average age of 15.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga said that safe motherhood in Uganda is seriously
affected by high fertility rates, poor maternal and neonatal care
and high incidence of disease.
</P>
<P>
Only 48 deliveries are attended by trained health worker,
whereas three or four percent are seen by a doctor, he added.
</P>
<P>
But still, immunized children have risen from four percent in
1986 to 47 percent now, Kiyonga said, adding that the government
is setting up primary health care system and launching
initiatives to improve the condition of pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
Some traditional practice such as elongating the labia majora
in the country causes sexual excitement and impose negative
influence on early sex of Ugandan girls, said Lydia Balemezi, a
woman MP, at the meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are 15 percent of pregnant females in their 15 to 24 in
Uganda who resorted to abortion in crude ways, Metesasira said.

<HEADLINE> China Can Soon Make a "Titanic" of Its Own (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has a 5,000-year history and a lot of stories that can be
adapted for films, and it is not short of well-known directors,
Yang says. The country's policy is to learn from every other
culture and to develop a national culture of its own, he says.
</P>
<P>
Lu Da, who studied digital technology in the US last year and
is responsible for China's digital film program at Qinghua
University, says that many Chinese movies have good themes and
storylines, but their problem is that they use out-of-date
techniques that destroy their artistic effect.
</P>
<P>
However, Gu Xintai, the chief engineer at the August First Film
Studio, says that the goal of China's digital movie program is to
cut costs, and that making a film like "Titanic" would involve too
many problems in funding, scripting, and getting actors.
</P>
<P>
China's most expensive movie was "The Opium War", which cost
100 million yuan -- or about a twentieth of what "Titanic" cost.
</P>
<P>
So, Yang explains, the technology will first be used for some
experimental movies, and then for war movies and sci-fi.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Raises $4 Billion Through Issuing Overseas Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has raised 4 billion
U.S. dollars through issuing dollar-dominated bonds in the United
States, 1 billion more than its original target, the Finance and
Economy Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five-year bonds, which are worth 1 billion dollars, carried
a spread of 3.35 percent more than the Treasury Bond, the
long-term U.S. Treasury securities, while the 10-year bonds valued
at 3 billion dollars specified a 3.55 percent spread over the
Treasury Bond.
</P>
<P>
The holders of the five-year bonds will be paid interest of
8.95 percent every single year while those of the 10-year bonds
can get 9.05 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
The success is believed to be very favorable for the
improvement of the financial crisis-engulfed nation's credit
ratings in the world and could attract loans from foreign
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South Korea filed for the registration and
insurance of the dollar-dominated bonds with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission to raise foreign currency for stabilizing
its foreign currency market.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in a financial crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions since late 1997. It is in
desperate need of foreign currency to return a large part of its
debts of 163 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The nation, with its foreign exchange of 24 billion dollars,
has been seeking to raise 40 billion dollars by the end of the
year to help overcome the current crisis.

TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following two tremors which hit

There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties and no

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weighed Down as Weak Jobs Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Early strength in the Australian
dollar was largely wiped out Thursday as weak jobs figures
reignited speculation of a cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the local session at 65.93 U.S.
cents, only slightly higher than 65.85 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It had begun the session on a much stronger note at 66.27 U.S.
cents thanks to a resurgence in the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
However, a report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) showing a rise in the unemployment rate quickly reversed the
bullish tone of the market.
</P>
<P>
The ABS reported that the jobless rate rose to a seasonally
adjusted 8.2 percent in March following a slump in part-time
employment.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts had predicted the unemployment rate would hold
steady at 8.1 percent, with an extra 15,000 people in jobs.
</P>
<P>
But instead the ABS data found the total number of people
employed fell by 15,500 - all in part-time work - to 8.514
million, adjusted.
</P>
<P>
"The data surprised financial markets, reinforcing market
speculation of a further rate cut," HSBC Markets chief economist
Anthony Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished at 86.71 from 87.65 against
Japanese yen and at 1.1982 from 1.2085 against Deutsch marks.

<HEADLINE> Investments Continue to Flow into Malaysia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
sector continues to witness an inflow of investments, including
foreign investments, especially for technology and capital
intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said Thursday 155 projects with a proposed investment of 7.64
billion ringgit (2.087 billion U.S. dollars) were approved in the
first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the projects accounted for 81.2 percent, or 6.2
billion ringgit (1.694 billion U.S. dollars), of the total capital
investment, she said at a function in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
"This large percentage shows the capital intensity of the
projects," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 155 projects, 67 were for expansion and diversification
and 88 were new projects while only 36 projects were approved with
tax incentives while 119 projects were approved without tax
incentives, she said, adding "Certainly this reflects that the
investors regard Malaysia as an attractive investment location
even if the project does not merit tax incentives."
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the Capital Intensity Per Employee (CIPE) for the
investments in the 155 projects was 473,200 ringgit (129,289 U.S.
dollars), which is substantially higher than the 361,400 ringgit
(98,743 U.S. dollars) CIPE for the total investments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
She said that however, due to the economic downturn new
investors could be expected to take a wait-and-see stance before
making an investment decision and they want to see positive signs
of economic growth and the momentum towards economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"While cautiousness may be justifiable, it must be emphasized
that the Malaysian government has undertaken and will continue to
take a broad range of measures to strengthen the economy's
capacity to generate long-term growth with price stability. This
is complemented by regional efforts to enhance regional resilience
and economic cooperation," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the investors to look towards the region's long-term
potential and opportunities, saying that investments channeled
into the regional economies will directly aid the process of
economic growth and recovery, especially in sectors that can
contribute to exports.

regarding policies for promoting growth with equity in the
region, the survey placed high priority on enhancing agricultural
productivity, human resources development, development of
small-and-medium-size enterprises, education for women and
enhancement of child health care.
</P>
<P>
in reference to the economic situation in the region, the
survey said that while economic growth in developing economies had
decelerated in 1997 as a result of the serious economic turmoil
faced by several countries of Southeast and East Asia, countries
of South and Southwest Asia maintained robust growth.
</P>
<P>
it said "most central Asian republics staged a significant
recovery from the prolonged recession which had plagued them since
the early 1990s."
</P>
<P>
the survey cites a trade slowdown and reduced financial flows
to the region as two major elements in the international economic
situation that have adversely affected the economies of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise For Fourth Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices advanced for the fourth
consecutive day in Tokyo on Thursday, on buying spurred by
expectations that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
announce larger-than-expected income tax cuts later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 160.04 points, or 0.98
percent from Wednesday's close to 16,536.66.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 12.40 points, or 1.00 percent to
1,254.74.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 380 million
shares, down from Wednesday's 450 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Thursday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
News reports that Hashimoto is discussing with ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) members whether to expand the planned income
tax cut to a total of 4 trillion yen (about 30.3 billion dollars) from
the previously suggested 2 trillion yen (about 15.2 billion dollars)
encouraged the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is expected to unveil later in the day his pump-priming
plan that will likely deviate from the current fiscal austerity
program, possibly through an earlier revision of fiscal laws than
predicted, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,328 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 720 to 387, with 153 remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Australia Backs Stronger IMF to Avoid Asian-Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello Thursday gave Australia's backing to moves to strengthen
the surveillance powers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to avoid another Asian-style financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Preparing for next week's international meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors in Washington, Costello said
the IMF should be given stronger powers to ensure countries
enacted sufficient regulation to control their financial systems.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that in the modern world, with interconnectedness
and the way in which funds move so quickly, probably the role of
the IMF is going to be greater than ever before rather than scaled
down," Costello told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Australia last year committed 1 billion U.S. dollars to
Thailand, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea each as part of
IMF-negotiated international rescue packages in the aftermath of
the region's currency meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer supported the efforts of the IMF before the Asian
upheaval, saying the organization had been giving warnings of the
problems which culminated in a regional currency slump last
October.
</P>
<P>
He said surveillance remained the organization's most important
role.
</P>
<P>
Costello will take that message to the United States next week
when he attends the finance ministers meeting called by U.S.
President Bill Clinton in response to the Asian financial
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors
from 22 economies coincides with the half-yearly meetings of the
IMF and the World Bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The economies invited to the meeting to be hosted by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin are Australia, United States,
Britain, France, Japan, Canada, Germany, Italy, Russia, China,
India, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, the Republic of Korea,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Poland and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> China to See Moderate Growth in Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- If there is no serious natural
disaster this year, China is expected to have moderate growth in
agriculture and its rural economy, a senior agricultural official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official's forecast is based on five factors: agriculture's
increased role in the nation's economy, increased government
investment in agriculture, macro-economic controls in agriculture,
improved rural economic structure, and increased demand for farm
products.
</P>
<P>
Grain output this year is expected to be around 500 billion
kg. Corn, rice, soybean, and cotton output will show a slight
increase, while wheat and early-ripening rice are likely to be
down a bit.
</P>
<P>
Grain crops are being threatened by droughts in the north and
flooding and late frost in the south. The Agriculture Ministry is
doing what it can to see that this year's harvest is good.
</P>
<P>
Because of plentiful supplies of fodder and increased demand in
urban and rural areas, meat, egg and dairy output will be up by a
big margin.
</P>
<P>
The new use of various forms of ownership is expected to help
change rural industries and their management.
</P>
<P>
The growth in farmers' incomes seen in recent years may slow
down as a result of a decline in grain prices and the smaller
number of laborers employed by rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another official source says that rural markets have great
potential because 900 million of China's 1.2 billion people live
in rural areas, where the standard of living has improved, and the
cost of living is giving a push to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To increase consumer spending in rural areas, the living
conditions of farmers need to be improved by electricity and water
supplies. And, manufacturers should take farmers' special needs
into consideration and produce goods that are adapted for rural
use.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Campaign on Eradicating Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday launched an
awareness campaign on eradicating software piracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 30-day campaign kicked off with a one-day seminar attended
by top management of medium and large corporations in the country,
which was aimed at helping businesses to legalize computer
softwares used in their operations.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is jointly organized Malaysia's Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs Ministry and Business Software Alliance (BSA), an
association of software developers that acts as an industry
watchdog against software piracy.
</P>
<P>
Launching the campaign here, Domestic Trade and Consumer
Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said companies using
pirated computer softwares have a month's reprieve from the day to
"legalize" the software by subscribing to the licensing system
introduced by the BSA.
</P>
<P>
The minister advised companies to check softwares used in the
their respective organizations, saying the BSA would explain to
the companies the options available to them.
</P>
<P>
Megat Junid reminded companies of the severe consequences if
they were found guilty of using pirated software. Those who were
found guilty would be fined up to 10,000 ringgit (2,730 U.S.
dollars) for every illegal copy seized and jailed for up to five
years.
</P>
<P>
BSA vice president Lee Tse Mei urged companies to take
advantage of the campaign to understand software-licensing issues
and avoid breaking the law inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
"The 30-day window period shall give them ample time to seek
clarification from the software companies on licensing issues and
comply with the requirements," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Megat Junid, last year, his ministry received 776
complaints relating to copyright infringements -- 467 for
violating the Copyright Act 1987 and 309 under the Trade
Descriptions Act 1972.
</P>
<P>
Thirty of these cases are in respect of computer software where
goods valued at 2.9 million ringgit (0.79 million U.S. dollars)
were seized.

<HEADLINE> Important Part of Grand Canal Discovered in Downtown Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A major bridge on China's
historic Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal has been discovered in
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Dongbuya Bridge was discovered during construction work on
the Ping'an Avenue in Dongcheng District.
</P>
<P>
Hou Renzhi, a history and geology scholar at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, says that the finding shows the importance of
the Grand Canal and will provide information about Beijing's
history.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Canal was built during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)
and was mainly used for transporting grain from southern parts of
the country to Beijing. The Beijing section went from Shichahai
Lake in downtown Beijing to the North Canal in Tongzhou District
in eastern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that most parts of the canal in downtown Beijing
were inside the city walls of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing
(1644-1911) dynasties and have been covered since the beginning of
the century.
</P>
<P>
According to the cultural relics department, research on the
Dongbuya Bridge is still going on.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese, followed by Americans,
continue to top the foreign investors list in the Philippines'
special economic zones, the Philippine News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing records of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority
(PEZA), the agency said that Japanese and American investors
continued to lead foreign investors in the country's economic
zones.
</P>
<P>
Next to the Japanese and Americans, the other big investor
groups include South Koreans, Dutch and Singaporeans, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not give any figures of the investments
in the economic zones by foreign investor groups.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines said Tuesday that foreign
investments in both government and listed securities, money market
instruments and bank deposits for the first quarter of this year
amounted to 425 million U.S. dollars, 8 percent up from the 397
million dollars recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The agency said most of the investors in the country's economic
zones are electronic product manufacturers, who account for 74.6
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The other sectors of investment include transport and car
parts, fabricated metals, wood and furniture, and plastics, it
said.
</P>
<P>
To strike a more desired balance mix of investments, it said,
PEZA is currently working on schemes to attract other product
groups into the economic zones not only to balance the investment
mix but also to diversify exports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy May Recover in Four Years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy, currently
gripped by the throes of a deepening crisis, will recover in four
or five years if the government sincerely implements the new
rescue program agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
a prominent analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed a new agreement on economic reform with the
IMF on Wednesday in exchange for a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
The government should fully and consistently implement the new
agreement to gain the confidence of the world, Professor Anwar
Nasution, dean of the economics faculty of the state University of
Indonesia, said here Wednesday at the launching of the 1998
Economic and Social Survey for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The survey was sponsored by the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Antara News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many economic analysts predict Indonesia will get its economy
out of the present crisis in between three and 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Nasution said Mexico, whose economy was much healthier than
Indonesia's, and which received more IMF bail-out funds than
Indonesia would be getting from the body, had required a
"relatively long time" to pull out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's economy returned to recovery two and a half years
after it was gripped by a serious financial turmoil in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Nasution, Indonesia needs much longer time than
Mexico to escape the worst economic crisis in decades, because
"besides showing inconsistency (in economic reforms), Indonesia
also wasted time" when it did not immediately implement the IMF
rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the value of Indonesia's rupiah has lost
more than 70 percent against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the
country has been facing spiraling inflation, growing unemployment
and other economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the ESCAP survey, in 1998 Indonesia will have a
negative economic growth of 1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Attends Sino-Tanzanian Trade Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said today that Tanzania will continue to improve
its investment environment to encourage Chinese enterprises to
engage in various forms of economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks while addressing the China-Tanzania
Economic and Trade Cooperation Symposium, hosted by the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade between the two countries has increased
steadily in recent years, with last year's trade volume standing
at 102.1 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has abundant natural resources and China has capital
and technology, said Mkapa, adding that the complementary economies
of the two nations offer vast potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the notable achievements scored by
Chinese-funded projects in Tanzania. He cited the positive results
achieved from the successful restructing of the Friendship Textile
Mill into a joint venture under Chinese management.
</P>
<P>
The two governments have agreed to adopt a new cooperative
approach to increase the direct participation of Chinese
enterprises in areas such as joint ownership.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted the encouraging trend in bilateral economic
cooperation and stressed the vast potential for new forms of
expansion in areas of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
On the investment environment in his country, Mkapa said
economic reform in the past years has created a safe, secure and
profitable heaven for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania will continue to carry out reforms in order to
create an even more reliable investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed his hope that China will increase investment
and enhance cooperation in the textile, light industrial, mining
and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides need to strategically redesign bilateral
cooperation to make the best use of opportunities in international
and regional trade as the 21st century approaches.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed his full confidence in the bright future for
bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Repeal, Amend Old Time Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will repeal some 40 laws
and amend about 50 others enacted between 1948 and 1957.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill seeking the repeal and amendment of these laws was
approved in principle at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina recently, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill also seeks changes in 14 laws to conform with
the "terms and expressions" of independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting asked the law minister to go ahead with the
task and seek the cabinet's final approval later.
</P>
<P>
A special committee has reviewed a total of 94 laws enacted in
the 1948-1957 period, and suggested that 40 of them be repealed,
50 amended and 14 acts be changed.
</P>
<P>
When became independent in March 1971, Bangladesh inherited
about 1,000 laws enacted between 1836 and 1971 by the then
governments.
</P>
<P>
But a number of those laws had been in practice till 1973 when
the Laws Revision and Declaration Act was enacted by the first
parliament. Under the act, a number of laws enacted between 1836
and 1896 were declared redundant, some were repealed and some were
amended in accordance with the changed situation.
</P>
<P>
Another law was enacted in 1974, under which some laws enacted
between 1897 and 1947 were declared irrelevant, some repealed and
some amended.
</P>
<P>
However, with no further initiative by the successive
governments, the old laws enacted between 1947 and 1971 remain
unscrutinized in general.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Does Not Accept U.S. Sanction Law: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's companies will
continue to invest abroad including in Iran and Libya despite the
U.S. threat of punishment under its Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, a
Foreign Ministry official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national oil corporation Petronas and other
companies "will continue to invest abroad wherever economic
opportunities exist, including in Iran and Libya," Malaysian
Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary for the Americas John Tenewi Nuek
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act is a U.S. national legislation,
Nuek said in a statement after meeting U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Energy, Sanctions and Commodities William
Ramsay here.
</P>
<P>
Ramsay arrived here Wednesday to discuss with local officials a
2-billion-U.S.-dollar gas field project in Iran undertaken jointly
by Petronas, France's SA Total and Gazprom of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia does not accept this extra-territorial application,"
Nuek said, adding that Petronas' involvement in the consortium to
develop the gas field did not contravene Malaysian or any
international law or that of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian position on the whole issue remains the
same as explained to Ramsay during his earlier visit in November
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said Ramsay briefed him and other Malaysian officials on the
latest developments of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. act contains provisions for sanctions to be imposed by
the U.S against foreign companies making investment beyond 20
million U.S. dollars a year in the oil and gas sector of the
targeted countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was further clarified that the act also provides the U.S.
president with the discretion to waive or delay the imposition of
sanctions under certain circumstances," Nuek said.
</P>
<P>
He said his hour-long meeting with Ramsay was held in a
friendly and cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the differences between the two countries on
the interpretation regarding the applicability of the stated U.S
legislation, both sides agreed that the foundations of
Malaysia-U.S relations remain strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Petronas announced Wednesday that it was going ahead
with the project despite the threat of U.S sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ramsay told reporters after meeting Nuek that the United States
will continue to have dialogue with Malaysia on the involvement of
Petronas in the project.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, we will continue to exchange views. We have long
standing dialogue and will continue to dialogue," Ramsay said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Looking at Reducing Unemployment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists warned that rapid rise in the number of laid-off
workers will undermine public security and economic development by
affecting the GDP.
</P>
<P>
But they noted that a large number of laid-off workers is
inevitable in a period of economic transition, when there is a
change from high rates of employment, where several people do one
job, to new methods more in compliance with market requirements.
Technical renovations have also replaced a great number of jobs,
without creating new ones.
</P>
<P>
Economists see the urgency of the problem and have asked the
government to come up with long-term policies and programs instead
of resorting to expedient measures like individual employment
projects.
</P>
<P>
Giving priority to employment does not go against China's
state-owned industry reforms, Hu said, and in fact the two can
complement and help each other. To help control unemployment, he
recommended that economic growth involve a process of continuous
creation of jobs, and labor-intensive industries are a means.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth and capital input are no magic solution for
unemployment, he said, and China should have industrialization
characterized by low capital input and high labor utilization over
a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Other economists and sociologists have also called for a
Chinese "New Deal" that improves both infrastructure and social
security, providing more job opportunities and basic welfare
guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Looking At Reducing Unemployment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have urged the
government to give priority to providing job opportunities for the
vast army of workers who have been laid off so that China's
economy will have "a second soft-landing".
</P>
<P>
The "first soft-landing" refers to the Chinese government's
success in maintaining high GDP while reining in inflation for the
past few years, something that has been considered worthy of a
Nobel Prize by some economists.
</P>
<P>
A second soft-landing would lower the unemployment rate while
keeping relatively high GDP, something that would in some ways be
more difficult and challenging than the first, according to the
economist, Hu Angang, who said that it took China four to five
years for the first, and the second could take the same amount of
time or more.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have been laid off has grown since the
debt-ridden state-owned industries started being changed in
1993. The previous Labor Ministry had estimated the total number
at from 11 to 13 million, an unemployment rate of 6 to 7
percent. This is a record high in the fifty-year history of the
People's Republic, and the number is still expected to grow in the
next couple of years.

<P>
State-owned enterprise reforms have both benefits and losses,
they say, and suggest that the government help unemployed workers
with subsidies for money-losing state-owned enterprises and in
finding new jobs, and by raising non-state sector taxes and
individual income taxes.
</P>
<P>
China wants to build competitive markets, but it also wants a
caring and equal society, they say, and the government's
responsibility is not merely to find jobs for the out-of-work, but
in developing a positive labor policy and a labor market.
</P>
<P>
Some economists suggest that the government encourage people to
shift from the state sector to the non-state sector, from the
agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector, from the
country to cities, and from the less-developed areas to developed
ones.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for China's emergence as an economic power in the
next century, some economists say, the immediate job is to prevent
dramatic economic ups and downs and macroeconomic stability, and
for this, unemployment must be stopped.

SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Oakland Port Authority of

KATHMANDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in the Himalayan
district of Humla of Nepal are fleeing their homes in hundreds to
India because of a poor harvest this year, The Kathmandu Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents have been living on nettle leaves, and
the government food depots, which sell food grain at subsidized
rates, have failed to meet the demand that has shot up due to the
poor harvest caused by drought last year, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
At the village of Dakshini Maila, only 10 families can survive
with the crops they grow, while the remaining 850 families are
dependent on the Nepal Food Corporation depot for their daily
ration, which has been reduced to five kilograms of rice per
person per month.
</P>
<P>
Many schools do not have regular classes due to the food
shortage, and students have gone in search of food, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's better to do something in a foreign land than die of
hunger," a villager who left for India was quoted as saying. The
1,750-kilometer-long border between Nepal and India is open.
</P>
<P>
The central government has been informed about the situation,
and some rice has been airlifted to the area, the daily added.

XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
is in the process of downsizing its textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The Five Ring Group Co., a large textile enterprise in Shaanxi,
has recently destroyed over 100 obsolete spindles.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, deputy minister in charge of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, and provincial officials visited the company
and watched workers melt the spindles.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, home to world famous tera cotta warriors, plans to
eliminate 476,400 spindles and lay off 36,000 workers over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The province has opened a training center to ensure the basic
needs of laid-off workers and help them learn new skills.
</P>
<P>
China plans to destroy 10 million obsolete cotton spindles over
the next three years, with some 1.2 million workers slated for
dismissal during the period. The goal of the downsizing program is
to develop reduced but more efficient production needed to
extricate the sector from the current loss-making situation.

SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales of consumer goods in
Shanghai, China's largest economic center, totaled 36.2 billion
yuan for the first three months of this year, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an 8.2 percent rise on last year's

</P>
<P>
Shanghai joined many other parts of China in experiencing a

stimuli. Shanghai's commercial sector is attempting to reverse the
trend by introducing various measures to improve service and
encourage consumption. Related efforts include readjusting the

First quarter sales figures indicate that the measures are

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Banking Sector to Have Mass Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- About two-thirds of the banking
and financial sector workforce in Indonesia could be laid off as a
result of the economic crisis and reforms which need to be taken,
the Federation of All-Indonesia Workers Union (FSPSI) said.
</P>
<P>
The mass layoff in the banking sector is a logical consequence
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid package calling for
reform of Indonesia's banking industry in return for more than 40
billion U.S. dollars in rescue aid, said the leader of the FSPSI's
commercial and banking industry sector.
</P>
<P>
"It will be dangerous to let the laid-off workers to remain
unemployed because nearly 95 percent of them are educated
workers," Bomer Pasaribu was quoted as saying by Antara News
Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bomer did not say exactly how many people could eventually lose
their jobs. But he said the seven banks suspended by the
government last Saturday and seven others which are now under
state management employed a total of 24,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has about 240 state-owned and private banks. The
government closed down 16 private commercial banks last October
and suspended the operation of seven private banks last Saturday
in a bid to improve the efficiency of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 40 troubled banks are also under the
supervision of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency,
government officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, sold more than 490,000 color TV sets in 1997, up
35 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Also last year the retail price of color TV sets of various
sizes dropped by more than 40 percent in average from three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that a total of 45 brands of color TV sets
were marketed in Shanghai last year, with the top ten accounting
for 87 percent of all sales.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, color TV sets with screens of 29 inches
made up 46 percent of total sales, while domestic-made color TV
sets gained 16 percentage points in market share.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that while the overall market will keep expanding,
the supply of color TV sets will continue to exceed demand in
Shanghai this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of new types of color TV sets made with high technology
are expected to stand firm, while those of older types will
decline, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
The experts urged domestic color TV makers to develop new and
high technology in order to meet the emerging demand for new type,
multi-functional TV sets.
</P>
<P>
To stand up to increasing competition, cross-region and
cross-sector alliance is imperative, said the experts, who
noted that competition through blind price reductions must be
avoided.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Tighten Monitoring of Indonesia's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said that a new agreement with Indonesia on economic reforms
would be closely monitored to ensure its full implementation.
</P>
<P>
IMF Asia-Pacific director Hubert Neiss said in Jakarta
Wednesday night that Indonesia's Economic and Monetary Resilience
Council would monitor progress daily in cooperation with the IMF,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the IMF reached an agreement Wednesday on revised
economic reform programs, with the government pledging to minimize
the impact of the monetary crisis on members of the community
considered economically "vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
Neiss, who has been negotiating with Indonesian officials since
March 19, said in a statement that "the credibility of the program
depends on its full implementation."
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreed in October last year to raise a 43-billion-U.S.-
dollar package for Indonesia to help the country overcome its
monetary crisis. The Indonesian government has promised to conduct
wide ranging economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF has delayed the disbursement of the second
3-billion-dollar tranche of the bailout package due to the
government's reported backtracking on the reform program.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said the next disbursement of the loans to Indonesia
would be made after the agreed actions were implemented.
</P>
<P>
On the new reform agreement, Neiss said: "the main objectives
of the program are to stabilize Indonesia's financial situation
and to establish the foundations for a resumption of economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
He said the Indonesian government would soon publish its
economic memorandum, which will give an outline of the economic
program and specify the complete set of policy commitments.
</P>
<P>
"Their resolute and sustained implementation should gradually
restore market confidence and bring the Indonesian economy back to
health," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer
warned Wednesday in Tokyo that the IMF would halt its program if
the promises were not kept.

<P>
China has mainly been using its ground network to transmit

</P>
<P>
The satellite disruption in transmission and reception has also
upset some 400 stock brokerages, 100 pager servicers and one
million people nationwide served by the satellite.
</P>
<P>
To date, the disruption has not been eliminated. "This has been
an accident that has the longest duration," said an official with
ChinaSat. "The cause of the disturbance has not been
identified. Perhaps, it is caused by the mis-operation of the
ground satellite station."
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat said that the disturbance is from a high-power
ground source, and its signal is 10 decibels higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
The company has excluded the possibility that the source is
located on the mainland. "The disturbance may be from Hong Kong,
Macao, or Taiwan," the official said.
</P>
<P>
ChinaSat has taken steps to guarantee the operation of its
customers' businesses, such as using other transmission and
reception facilities. However, the satellite quake-warning network
of the SSB must wait until the satellite returns to regular
operation because its obsolete equipment cannot change
frequency.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A top U.N. official has applauded
Malaysia's proposal to boost regional trade through the use of
local currencies.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would help redress the regional economic slump
that is likely to last until at least the year 2000, said Adrianus
Mooy, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
He urged all countries concerned to continue work on the
proposal to create complementary systems in participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Without improving the complementarity, it will be very
difficult to increase trade among developing countries," Mooy was
quoted by Thursday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mooy promised that ESCAP could step in to promote possible
expansion of the local-currency system to other developing
countries once members of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) settle on the idea.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia put forward the idea last year in the hope of reducing
the dominance of the U.S. dollar in ASEAN economies. Thailand,
Singapore and Indonesia have expressed support for the idea, but
have not yet gone into detail on which currency should be used.

Meeting U.S. Senator John Warner and Joseph Lopez, commander of

On his part, Warner said Azerbaijan, enjoying a geographically

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The coffee price in
Colombia dropped by 1.09 percent Wednesday in a continuing
downward trend on the international market
</P>
<P>
The price, to remain 327,750 pesos (241.79 U.S. dollars) per
125-kilo sack for a week, was fixed by the Fondo Nacional del

on the New York's international market in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the second largest export product in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The international quote has dropped 30 percent since February
and is expected to fall further, warned Gabriel Rosas Vega,
president of the Asociacion de Exportadores de Cafe, a group of
private coffee exporters.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the price drop to a predicted bumper harvest in
Brazil and the coming of summer in many consumer countries leading

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Fault Line Found Beneath Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Geologists have found new
evidence of a fault line beneath Los Angeles that could cause
damaging earthquakes in the future.
</P>
<P>
The fault, running through the hills north and east of Los
Angeles, an area full of older buildings, could cause a quake
with a magnitude of 6.5 to 6.8 degrees on the Richter Scale --
roughly the strength of the deadly 1994 Northridge quake.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no way of knowing if such a quake is
imminent, according to Kerry Sieh, a geology professor at the
California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and co-author of a
report on the fault.
</P>
<P>
The new study concerns an 11-mile geological fold that runs
through the hills north and east of downtown Los Angeles. This
fold provides indirect evidence of an underlying fault.
</P>
<P>
"Our evidence from the surface is that the fold is still growing,"
said Michael Oskin, a graduate student at CalTech. "This indicates
that the fault that lies beneath it must also be active."
</P>
<P>
The length of the surface features suggests that the underlying
fault is about 11 miles in length and may extend some 10 miles down.
</P>
<P>
Sieh said the rate of deformation suggests a tremor on the
scale of the Northridge quake might occur, on average, about once
every 1,000 to 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Because of the population density and the prevalence of old
buildings in the area, experts say the possible loss of life and
property would be worse than the Northridge quake, which killed 72
and caused more than 25 billion U.S. dollars in damage.

Incarnation", created by young Myanmar technicians, has been
launched here, signifying an important step in the progress of
computer technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CD, the first one on Myanmar to be distributed to the
world, was launched by the CSS Computer Center of the Yangon
Division Cooperative Syndicate Store Ltd on Wednesday, the New
Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian Ship Record
finished the 1997 fiscal year with 91.1 million gross tons, the
"El Boletin" weekly reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
With such a tonnage, the report quoted the Lloyd's Register of
Ships as saying, Panama stood in the first place of ship register,
followed by Liberia with 60 million gross tons.
</P>
<P>
"The Panamanian Ship Record has a 50 percent advantage over the
closest banner," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Following Panama and Liberia with considerable distances were
Bahamas, with 25.5 million tons, Greece, with 25.3 million tons,
and Cyprus, 23.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But a local source said the Panama is under pressure to
introduce the code of international maritime security and improve
its training and certification standards for seamen.
</P>
<P>
At the International Maritime Organization conference last
November, Panama pledged to inspect over 70 percent of the 6,212
ships of 100 and more gross tons carrying its flag.
</P>
<P>
"However, the progress of the inspection program ... depends on
how well the scope of the maritime authority and the General
Management of Merchant Fleet is cleared out," the weekly said.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Sector of China Seeking New Ways of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
attract more overseas tourists this year to offset losses
caused by the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
China annually receives about one million travelers from
Southeast Asia, which accounts for 60 percent of the total number
of overseas tourists coming to the country.
</P>
<P>
The economic slump has shown no signs of ending. As a result,
China's tourism business will suffer a subsequent decline in the
number of travelers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quoted Yang Wenzhen, an
official of the National Tourism Administration (NTA), as saying
that to minimize the losses, the NTA is devoting major efforts to
modifying China's tourism services to adapt to the changes.
</P>
<P>
Yang said, China is creating programs to attract budget
conscious tourists, especially from Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia, the three countries which are most seriously hit.
</P>
<P>
Tours co-sponsored by airlines, travel agencies and hotels will
target mainly China's close neighbors, including Japan, South
Korea, and also Singapore and the Philippines, which have been
less detrimentally affected.
</P>
<P>
China should also develop tourist sources in other countries to
offset the negative impact of Southeast Asia's currency
depreciation.
</P>
<P>
last year, China received 810,000 visitors from Russia,
accounting for 1.4 percent of the total 57.5 million overseas
tourists to the country. Russia has replaced South Korea as
China's second largest source of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The booming situation greatly contributed to the establishment
of the "strategic partnership relationship" between the two
nations early this year, which has fostered a prosperous border
tourism, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Causes Great Losses in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Smuggling and counterfeiting cost the
Peruvian government 800 million U.S. dollars in tax revenues every
year, said industrial sources here.
</P>
<P>
In a typical year, officials from the Sociedad Nacional de
Industrias (SNI) said, some 1.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
goods are smuggled into this country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said, counterfeiting causes the loss of some
20,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
There is a kind of "interrelations" between smugglers and drug
dealers, said Raul Saldias, president of the SNI's smuggling
commission.
</P>
<P>
"People who get dirty money in drug trafficking have to invest
it in something unlawful, like laundering the money on smuggling
activities," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Most of the smuggled products entered through the southern part
of the country, especially Puno, close to the border with Bolivia,
due to the extreme poverty reigning the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Raul Saldias called for a more effective supervision mechanism
for imports into Peru.

<HEADLINE> Poland Calls for Dialogue to Solve Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek said here Wednesday it is imperative to carry out a
dialogue to resolve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Geremek, current chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), made the remark after meeting with
foreign ministers of Norway and Danmark, OSCE's previous and next
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
Geremek noted the Yugoslav authorities still have time to
accept OSCE proposals and begin dialogue with ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing Yugoslav territorial integrity and absence of
terrorist activities are the basis of the dialogue, Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the Kosovo issue, he said, requires the Yugoslav
authorities to agree to admit OSCE's observers to the troubled
province.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sank into chaos since the ethnic Albanians calling for
independence from Serbia clashed with the local Serb police.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected any
international mediation or the internationalization of the issue,
arguing it is Serbia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to win popular support, the parliament of the Republic
of Serbia adopted a resolution on the holding of a referendum to
decide whether to accept foreign mediation in the current Kosovo
crisis. The referendum will be held within Serbia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
On such a referendum, Geremek said, it violates the principles
of international organizations and is not conducive to the
settlement of conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Conglomerate Finances Biomedical Center in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A genetics research center
financed by Swiss conglomerate Novartis will open this year in
southern California, it is announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Financed by a grant of 250 million U.S. dollars, the Novartis
Institute for Functional Genomics, will study how individual genes
contribute to diseases and therefore develop treatments for them.
</P>
<P>
La Jolla, where the center will be built, hosts a big, thriving
biomedical community and is nicknamed "Biotechnology Beach."
</P>
<P>
Novartis chose the site for the abundance of biomedical
research facilities there, including the University of California
at San Diego, the Salk Institute and the Scripps Research
Institute, available for possible collaborations.
</P>
<P>
Those institutions have formed the core of the area's research
labs for three decades.
</P>
<P>
Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, was created in 1996 when
two Swiss giants merged. Heart and eye-care drugs, genetically
engineered crops and pesticides are among its main products.
</P>
<P>
Its 250-million-dollar grant reportedly should finance the
lab's entire operation for a decade.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is distinctive in its focusing solely on
understanding how genes contribute to diseases.
</P>
<P>
Many medicines now treat symptoms rather than eradicating the
diseases themselves. And many diseases have at their source a
problem with genes.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that many genes are implicated across a
range of diseases. The work at the new center will focus on
understanding the many steps by which a genetic abnormality can
result in a disease, a study scientists call functional genomics.
</P>
<P>
Once such pathways are determined, researchers expect to be
able to intervene with a therapy that averts the problem.
</P>
<P>
Novartis will have the priority right to products coming from
the new lab, but would pay a fee or royalty for use of
discoveries.

<HEADLINE> New Rules to Silence Automobile Theft Alarms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has just released new
regulations designed to reduce noise pollution caused by
automobile anti-theft devices, local sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that about 300,000 privately owned
automobiles in the city are equipped with anti-theft devices which
mistakenly emit high-pitched warning sounds more than one million
times a day.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles are parked mainly in residential areas, and the
noise emitted by the anti-theft devices disturb nearby residents
day and night, according to officials with the Beijing
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Citizens have been complaining about this new source of noise
pollution in the city, while many delegates to the municipal
people's congress urged the local government to make concerted
efforts to control this problem.
</P>
<P>
Departments in charge of environmental protection, public
security, industrial and commercial administration, and
technological supervision joined in formulating the regulations to
control this new source of noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
The interim regulations state that the automobile warning
devices should not be allowed to be set off inadvertently by rain,
barking dogs, blowing wind, or by people touching the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Companies, work units and individuals producing, selling,
installing and using automobile anti-theft devices should take
corresponding measures to prevent the devices from disturbing
nearby residents with high-pitched noises, according to the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The public may report such incidents to the local public
security and environmental protection bureaux. The owner of the
vehicle which causes noise pollution when there are no attempts to
steal the vehicle will be fined up to 50 yuan (six US dollars),
according to the new regulations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Provisional Legislature's Work Fruitful (1) By Feng Xiuju </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) fulfilled its historical mission here
Wednesday with fruitful results achieved through the arduous work
by all the members over the past 16 months.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that during the period PLC members have
always taken responsible, prudent and highly efficient attitude
towards the work and scrutinized and subsequently passed a total
of 63 bills, and considered 104 requests for provisions. They have
also raised 529 written and oral questions with the government and
moved 57 motion debates.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) described the work of the PLC as
"outstanding", adding: the members of the PLC "have played a
crucial role in maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity
of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
As soon as the PLC was established in December 1996 in order to
avoid "legislative vacancy" in the HKSAR, it immediately threw
itself into the tense work.
</P>
<P>
From January to the end of June last year, members of the PLC,
shuttling between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, held a total of 11
plenary sessions and 46 committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a total of 13 bills, which were absolutely
essential for the smooth running of the SAR, were examined and
adopted by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PLC also adopted a motion on the appointment of
judges of the Court of Final Appeal and Chief Judge of the High
Court. The Hong Kong Reunification Bill adopted by the PLC in the
early morning of July 1 last year defined the above mentioned
appointments, thus laying a foundation for the smooth formation of
the judicial departments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, 29 bill committees were set up and 25
subcommittees were installed for studying subsidiary legislations
and resolutions. The PLC members examined and approved a total of
50 bills submitted by the SAR government and more than 300
subsidiary legislations and 86 government resolutions.
</P>
<P>
As the local newspaper Wen Wei Po said that the approval of the
Societies (Amendment) Bill 1997 has properly settled the issue
concerning the full protection of the Hong Kong residents' rights
and freedom of association, and of demonstration, thus effectively
guaranteeing the reasonable balance between individual freedom and
social orders.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the Immigration Bill has solved the issue
concerning sons and daughters of the Hong Kong people, who were
born in China's inland areas, to settle down in Hong Kong in an
orderly way.

The adoption of a motion urging the government to abolish the
port of first asylum policy for Vietnamese people arriving in Hong
Kong illegally in future plays an important role in dropping the
heavy burdens of the Hong Kong people for many years.
</P>
<P>
The work by the Provisional Legislative Council after Hong Kong
 returned to China on July 1 last year covers a wide range of
important areas, effectively ensuring the smooth operation of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional legislative Council has also maintained close
ties with the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Members of the PLC took an earnest attitude towards the
examining of the first budget of the HKSAR including the
government's expenditure submitted by Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Before it was approved by the Provisional Legislative Council,
its members raised more than 1,000 questions during their heated
debates on the budget.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the PLC has also laid a basis for the selection of
the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR and ensured the
forthcoming legislature election to be conducted in an open, fair
and transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council has played an important
role in the crucial historic period of Hong Kong, and its fruitful
work will surely go down in Hong Kong's history forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo on Wednesday called for the establishment of an
Albanian-Macedonian committee for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Milo raised the proposal during a 40-minute talk with his
Macedonian counterpart Blagoj Handziski in Skoplje, the capital of
Macedonia, after concluding his visit to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Milo said that the Albanian-Macedonian relations were
developing quickly and bilateral political ties have already been
at a high level. The two nations hold similar views on major
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should speed up their economic cooperation,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Handziski said that the two governments needed to further
strengthen their contacts and consultations in international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, Handziski said that it was necessary for
an authentic third party to work out a concrete plan and the two
conflicting parties in the Serbian province of Kosovo should make
political concessions on the basis of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Milo agreed, saying that the international community should
actively participate in mediation.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected
foreign mediation in the Kosovo crisis, saying that it is an
internal affair of Serbia.

SHENYANG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a major grain producer
in northeast China, has completed spring sowing despite of a
severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Wheat has been sown on 200,000 ha of land. Farmers are busy
ploughing and raising seedlings in an effort to increase the grain
output to 16 million tons this year and achieve an eight-percent
growth in agricultural added-value.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a severe drought in spring, the water storage at
local reservoirs was reduced by 34 percent compared with ordinary
years. Some 1.3 million ha of farmland were affected, said Li
Wenke, director of the provincial agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government spent 100 million yuan on digging
10,000 water wells and bringing 24,000 ha of arid land into

<HEADLINE> Port Cities Urged to Speed Up Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- With further economic reform,
China should speed up the internationalization of its major port
cities, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quoted the Tianjin-based Port
Economy magazine as saying that at the end of 1996, the Chinese
economy achieved a "soft landing". The momentum of high growth and
low inflation laid a good foundation for the internationally
oriented development of China's port cities.
</P>
<P>
However, China's coastal cities are still lagging behind their
international counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The magazine suggested that some problems should be addressed
during globalization.
</P>
<P>
First, the governments of large port cities should optimize
the industrial structure by giving priority to the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Second, governments should improve the investment environment by
injecting more money into public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Third, city authorities should also deepen reform of trade and
financial systems and set up an economic operation system
compatible with international practices.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, a cultural environment better suited to international
tastes should be fostered.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, big port cities should pay attention to environmental
protection while seeking economic development.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producer Battles to Meet Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China Offshore Oil Nan Hai East
Corp (Conhe) pumped out a total of 3.374 million tons of crude oil
in the first quarter of this year, compared with 3.51 million tons
for the same period last year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Beijing-based newspaper quoted a company official
as saying that Conhe's oil output in the first three months met
only 86.8 percent of the company's target. Conhe had planned to
produce 3.885 million tons of crude oil during the first three
months this year.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of crude oil also witnessed a decline in the
first quarter this year because of the dropping price in the
international market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Conhe still has an output target for this year of 12.6 million
tons of crude oil. To this end, Conhe will continue to introduce
technological advances and equipment in exploration and production
in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Also, Conhe will continue to invite overseas oil groups to join
it in exploring for oil in the east district of the South China
Sea, which is believed to have five billion tons of reserves. The
east district covers 131,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Conhe, a subsidiary of the China Offshore Oil Corp, is China's
major oil exploration company in the South China Sea. It accounted
for 80 percent of the country's total offshore output last year.
</P>
<P>
Conhe, which has nine oilfields in operation, pumped out more
than 11 million tons of crude in the past two years and is China's
biggest offshore production base.
</P>
<P>
Conhe is now the fourth largest petroleum producer in
China. Daqing, which has an annual oil output of more than 50
million tons, is China's biggest oil producer, followed by the
Shengli Oilfield company in Shandong Province and Liaohe in
Liaoning Province, the paper said.

</P>
<P>
Kocharian told the Russian daily, Izvestia, that Azerbaijan's

</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan was "proposing a solution which supposes that the

apart".

"Karabakh already has de facto independence and will never give
it up," he added. "No one in Karabakh wants to refuse all ties
with Azerbaijan, but no one thinks Azerbaijan should run Karabakh."
</P>

Kocharian, 44, was elected president March 30 following the

BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China is taking active steps to
eliminate an unidentified disturbance to the Apstar-I satellite to
solve the communication problems affecting some departments and
companies.
</P>
<P>
The China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite
Corp. (ChinaSat), which rents the satellite, said that it is
investigating the disturbance source and will bring the satellite
into regular operation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Apstar-I experienced a powerful disturbance on March 14,
which forced a transmission and reception breakdown and affected
the normal operation of 17 Chinese systems using the satellite,
including an earthquake-warning network.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Sumin, an expert from the Earthquake Warning Center of the
State Seismological Bureau (SSB), said that the nine satellite
quake-warning centers in the country are temporarily unable
to transmit data to Beijing because of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The nine centers are located in the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner
Mongolia autonomous regions, and the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan,
Guizhou, Hubei, Fujian and Liaoning and the municipality of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China normally transmits quake data via ground and satellite
networks. The satellite network enables Beijing to see real-time
data and make the transmission more accurate and rapid.
</P>
<P>
"It played a positive role during the earthquake in north
China's Zhangbei County in January of 1998," an official with the
SSB said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Huaiwen, an official with SSB's monitoring section,
said: "Although the satellite quake-warning network is
paralyzed, China's quake-warning system has not and will not be

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian waterfront entered a new era of deregulation
Wednesday night as non-union stevedores began to work in
Australia's western port of Fremantle, less than 24 hours after
the nation's second biggest stevedoring company Patrick LTD's
dramatic sacking and locking out 1,400 Maritime Union of Australia
members.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government's waterfront strategy was in
confusion Wednesday night as a federal court froze Patrick's plan
to sack its 1,400 unionized workers and replace them with
non-union labor.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The waterfront will be at flashpoint Thursday when hundreds
of sacked workers defy an unprecedented assault by the government
and employers and try to reclaim their jobs at Patrick stevedores.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Frantic last-minute negotiations Wednesday night between
Prime Minister John Howard and independent Senator Brian Harradine
failed to find a compromise on the government's Wik native title
bill, which now appears certain to become a trigger for the
government to call an election as the bill failed to pass the
parliament for the second time since late last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Frank Vandenbroucke of Belgium
won Wednesday's Gent-to-Wevelgem cycling race to add another title
to his victory of last month's Paris-to-Nice race.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian rider clocked five hours 21 minutes 21 seconds for
the 208-kilometer race of which most of the stretches were
cobble-paved roads.
</P>
<P>
Lars Michaelsen of Denmark finished six seconds behind at
second place, followed by Nico Mattan of Belgium at one second
further away.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Tchmil, a Russian-turned Belgian cyclist, was 29 seconds
adrift from Vandenbroucke to come in fourth.
</P>
<P>
Vandenbroucke, Michaelsen and Mattan pedalled away at around
the 190-kilometer mark to open up a 40-second gap from the chasing
pack and Mattan, who was leading the trio toward the finish, waved
to let Vandenbroucke charge past Michaelsen and himself with
some 1,500 meters left to pass the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
Both Vandenbroucke and Mattan are from the same team of Mapei.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's finish will affect both the team and individual
standings on the current classic and semi-classic cycling races
being held around France and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Ford to Install Side Air Bags in All New Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co., the second
largest automaker in the U.S., plans to offer side impact air bags
on all its cars within three years.
</P>
<P>
Ford doesn't yet offer side air bags on any of its U.S. models,
and hasn't decided yet on which models the air bags will be
standard and on which ones they will be optional.
</P>
<P>
A company official said that 30 percent of all accident
fatalities result from side-impact collisions and side air bags
have become increasingly important.
</P>
<P>
Ford will start by using the side air bags as optional
equipment in its 1999 Cougar, out later this year, then as
standard equipment in its Lincoln LS sedans next year. The rest of
its models will follow by 2001, the company announced at the New
York International Auto Show here today.
</P>
<P>
Although often found in expensive European cars, side air bags
are now offered on about a dozen models, produced by General
Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota and Nissan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 7,000 Americans die each year in side-impact crashes
involving two vehicles, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
But automakers are uncertain about how many consumers want the
air bags.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. has no plans to add side air bags on its cars.
Its officials said they aren't sure how much they improve safety
and what type of air bag they would use.

NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar dropped 2 yen
against the Japanese currency and was down against German mark
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 131.18 yen,
down from 133.35 yen late Tuesday. The U.S. currency also was
changing hands at 1.8123 marks, down from 1.8356.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the main stock index rose Wednesday in anticipation
of a major tax cut expected as part of an economic stimulus
package. The rise of the Nikkei index helped spur the yen's rise
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold dollars and bought marks as new economic reports
indicate that Germany was likely to raise interest rates later
this Spring.
</P>

Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.5068 Swiss francs, down from 1.5235; 6.0790 French francs, down

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Accession Contributes to Multilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Trade Representative Long
Yongtu said here on Wednesday that history will prove that China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will contribute
positively to the consolidation and development of the
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Long, China's deputy minister of foreign trade, was speaking at
the seventh meeting of the Working Party on China's Accession.
</P>
<P>
"It is puzzling that when certain members raise excessive
requests on China's WTO accession, they always say they are
defending the integrity of multilateral trading system," Long
said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to them that if China does not meet conditions of one
or two WTO members, China's accession will bring disaster to the
whole multilateral trading system," he said. "This kind of
statement is, to say the least, based on ignorance."
</P>
<P>
Long outlined the following facts to refute the absurd saying:
</P>
<P>
- China has participated in many multilateral organizations,
both political and economic, including the United Nations, and has
played a positive and constructive role in promoting peace and
development in these multilateral organizations.
</P>
<P>
- During the recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia, China
has participated within its own capacity in the bailout plan of
international financial organizations. China has paid the price
and made the sacrifice for the stability of Asian economy by not
devaluing its own currency.
</P>
<P>
- In spite of the difficulties caused by the Southeast Asia's
financial crisis, China, at the current Working Party session,
still decided to honor its commitment and tabled its latest tariff
offer.
</P>
<P>
Long said that those facts have shown that China is a
responsive member, willing to undertake the obligation in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time that major players of WTO demonstrate some
degree of responsibility towards China's WTO accession," Long
pointed out.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
slid again Wednesday, although technology stocks held ground after
two days' drop.
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished 65.02 points lower at 8,891.48 after sliding
nearly 95 points earlier in the session, extending Tuesday's
76-point drop. Even with the two-day slide, the Dow is still up
nearly 1,000 points, or more than 12 percent, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 612.01 million
shares as against 664.13 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.90 to 1,101.65,
and the NYSE composite index fell 4.07 to 573.68.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.29 to 1,807.00 after sliding
more than 55 points during the prior two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.18 to
475.33, and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 1.85 to 737.50.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators were mixed, with the technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index posting a slim gain despite a weak
first-quarter report from chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's close, AMD reported a bigger-than-expected
loss. Today, AMD's shares slid more than 10 percent in heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured throughout the session by the bond
market, where interest rates rose sharply.

<HEADLINE> UK Confident of Deal Before Thursday Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- British Northern Ireland secretary
Mo Mowlam said on Wednesday she was confident of a deal before a
deadline expires at midnight on Thursday as progress in the
troubled all-party talks was made.
</P>
<P>
"It's important to note that progress is being made across all
fronts," Mowlam told a news conference in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said the talks had gathered a "fair bit of
momentum...They are beginning to build to the deadline that has
been set." She said no one should underestimate the parties'
determination to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair held talks in Belfast with
concerned parties to try to save the peace process after the main
pro-British Protestant party rejected a draft settlement peace
proposal on Tuesday put forward by the talks chairman, former U.S.
senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said Blair, who was exerting
last-ditch efforts to iron out differences among the parties by
the deadline, remained "stubbornly optimistic" about reaching a
deal on time.
</P>
<P>
"There's a real sense in there that people have come this far
and they can't go back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern also paid a visit to Belfast
on Wednesday and urged all sides to make compromise for a deal to
be reached.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland are co-sponsoring the peace talks, seen as
offering the best chance in a generation to end decades of
conflict between majority Protestants and minority Catholics in
Northern Ireland in which more than 3,200 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the positive British mood, the chief protagonists
seemed as far apart as ever.
</P>
<P>
"Unionists are trying to block everything right across the
whole raft of issues," said Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein,
the Irish Republican Army's political wing.
</P>
<P>
"The century comes to an end with the same acoustics as it
began," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble was
equally blunt about what he sees as Irish interference.
</P>
<P>
"We want to avoid a situation where people outside the United
Kingdom can control or determine aspects of social life within
Northern Ireland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Libraries in Peru and United States Designated UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Two libraries, located in
Peru and the United States, have been designated United Nations
depository libraries, becoming part of an international network of
364 libraries in 141 countries and territories, the Department of
Public Information of the United Nations announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They are the Biblioteca Central de la Pontificia Universidad
Catolica del Peru in Lima, and the Farmington Public library in
Farmington, New Mexico, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, a private
university, was founded in 1917. Several schools, institutes and
centers are attached to the university, which has an enrollment of
12,000 students and 1,500 faculty members.
</P>
<P>
The Central Library has a collection of 300,000 volumes and
radio-visual items. The Library has electronic access to external
databases, and is in the process of computerizing its operations.
</P>
<P>
The Farmington Public Library was founded in 1921. It provides
services to patrons in the greater Four Corners area of Arizona,
Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.
</P>
<P>
The Library has a collection nearing 200,000 volumes and has
been a community leader in providing electronic access to
documents, publications and other information.
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, the Dag Hammarskjold Library at United Nations
Headquarters in New York, which is part of the Department of
Public Information, has arranged for the distribution of United
Nations documents and publications to users around the world
through its depository library system.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 364 United Nations depository libraries:
53 are located in Africa, 98 in Asia and the Pacific, 30 in
Eastern Europe, 84 in Western Europe, 46 in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and 53 in North America. These libraries receive United
Nations materials, with the understanding that their collections
will be maintained in good working order and be available to the
public free of charge.
