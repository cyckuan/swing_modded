CHILDREN'S WRITER FINDS READERS AND A PRIZE BY PUBLISHING ON THE
WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Karen Byrum wrote in near obscurity for
years. The only people who saw the children's stories she wrote
were friends and the book publishers who mailed back rejection
after rejection.
</P>
<P>
   That changed a few weeks ago when Byrum, of North Kansas City,
built an Internet site, published her work on the Web and entered a
contest sponsored by a Massachusetts software company. In the last
five weeks, more than 5,000 people have seen the rhyming children's
stories she has written, according to the counter on her Web page.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Byrum learned that her writing and the Web site
had paid off in a more tangible way. She won the top prize _
$20,000 _ in the contest sponsored by the Trellix Corp. Her Web
site at neonpeach.tripod.com was chosen from among more than 1,000
entries nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Trellix sponsored the contest to show off its partnership with
Tripod, an online site where more than 4 million people have built
Web sites. Tripod is one of the largest of dozens of Web
``communities'' where members register and then build and publish
Web sites, all for free.
</P>
<P>
   Eric S. Sall, a Trellix vice president, said it also showed the
power of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it's been so hard to find a place to express
yourself,'' Sall said. ``But with the explosion of the Web, all
these people suddenly have a creative outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows for sure, Web communities such as Yahoo's
Geocities, Tripod and Xoom play host to Web pages built by 25
million or more computer users around the world. Some pages simply
tell a little bit about the person who built it. Many are used by
families to communicate and share photos. Others are in-depth sites
talking about hobbies or family histories.
</P>
<P>
   Until taking a class at Penn Valley Community College last year,
Byrum said she didn't even know how to turn a computer on and off.
She bought a computer about 18 months ago. Using other software,
she built her first Web site last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the ugliest thing you've ever seen in your life, but I
was pretty proud of it when I got done,'' Byrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum, who works for Digital Graphiti Studios, said Trellix made
it easy to build the Web site, which has more than 200 pages. She
said the software made it possible to create the page without
knowing any computer code and _ with one click _ publish it on the
Web. That eliminates a lot of steps traditionally involved with Web
publishing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, called Katie Did &AMP; the Neon Peach, is a collection
of rhyming stories written by Byrum. Many of the stories are
illustrated by Eddie Henry, a full-time casino worker who doubles
as illustrator for the Katie Did site. In the stories, Henry became
``Dr. Doodles.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said she hesitated before putting her work on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, people said, `Don't put your stories on the Web;
people will steal them,' '' Byrum said. ``Finally I figured you
have to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said she saw a notice about the contest, which was
organized into seven one-week contests. She saw that week's winner,
downloaded the Trellix software and ``built my page from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of the Web site, Katie Did, is described by Byrum as
her alter ego. ``Can't you tell by the glasses and the belly and
the hair?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Did falls down a hole at the beach and ends up in a
strange world under the sand ruled by the ``green goopy hand.'' The
stories are the tales of that underbeach world.
</P>
<P>
   The site has Byrum's stories, Henry's illustrations, and more
than 200 jokes and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum said she started writing the stories in 1992 and had been
rejected by 200 or more publishers. Although she doesn't have
children, she said she liked writing children's stories.
</P>
<P>
   Sall said the competition was tough. Winners of runner-up prizes
included a father recounting the story of his 4-year-old son's
diagnosis for leukemia, a photojournal of a trip to Nepal and
India, and a business Web site from a company selling scented bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site was the standout,'' Sall said of Byrum's work. The
bright green and purple colors used on the site and the use of
Trellix features to link pages and create special effects ``were a
great use of the software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sall said Trellix was aiming for the ``mere mortal'' market with
its software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see our role as helping people create great content without
having to spend all their time worrying about computer code and the
actual mechanics of making the site,'' he said. ``A lot of people
are creating multiple Web sites _ some pages as a creative outlet,
some pages for things they collect, pages about their family. We
think that's going to be the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future is what Byrum is thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   For the grand prize, Byrum had her choice of the cash or a 2000
Volkswagen Beetle. She picked the cash, hoping to use it to somehow
further her writing.

AMATEUR KANSAS ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER A COMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Give a child a telescope for Christmas, and
who knows what might happen?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hug got one years ago, and now he and a friend are going
down in astronomical history.
</P>
<P>
   Hug, 49, of Topeka, Kan., and Graham Bell, 64, of Maple Hill,
Kan., are believed to be the first in Kansas to discover a comet.
The two amateur astronomers saw it early Friday morning while
peering into a dark sky from the Far Point Observatory, about 20
miles outside Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking for comets off and on for about 25 years,''
Hug said Tuesday. ``It was a terrific thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   The find was announced over the weekend by the International
Astronomical Union, the world's leading astronomical organization,
after professional astronomers confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hug-Bell comet, as it has been named, could well be the
faintest comet ever discovered by an amateur, as Hug and Bell
believe, said Brian Marsden, a member of the union and director of
the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard//Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hug-Bell should be visible to earthbound astronomers every seven
years, which is how long it will take to go around the sun,
according to the calculations made by the two Kansans and other
astronomers who have studied it, Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hug and Bell) did a great piece of work on it,'' Marsden
said. ``It's really quite an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 comets have been discovered over the years, Marsden
said. This year, about 50 have been found. Ninety percent of them
were found by either a large astronomy outfit affiliated with the
U.S. Air Force in New Mexico, he said, or by a satellite that picks
them up while observing the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is booming,'' he said, mostly because of the
sophisticated detection equipment now available. ``We are seeing
more and more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hug and Bell, who belong to the Northeast Kansas Amateur
Astronomers League, went to their club's observatory about 9 p.m.
Thursday night to look for asteroids. They noticed the comet about
1 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little fuzzy,'' Hug said. ``It didn't sharpen up like
the rest of the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were using an electronic camera, a 12-inch telescope and
other electronic and computer equipment worth about $10,000. They
took more pictures of the sky, increasing the exposure time to 10
minutes, and then to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally began to show a tail,'' Hug said.
</P>
<P>
   A comet is basically a dirty ice ball. It's made of frozen gases
and ice mixed with dust. The sun's heat causes the outer layer of
the comet to evaporate and release dust and gases that form a tail.
</P>
<P>
   The Hug-Bell's orbit is believed to extend to Jupiter. Hug
estimates that the comet's width at a third of a mile to 1.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Hale-Bopp comet, which passed by Earth in
1997, measures about 25 miles across. It was one of the biggest aghtest comets this generation is expected to see.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointing thing about the Kansas discovery, Bell
said, was that no one will ever be able to see the comet with the
naked eye or even a backyard-type telescope. It's too faint for
that.
</P>
<P>
   Hug expects he will be able to see the newly found comet for a
few more weeks. It probably will be out of sight about the time the
glow of Christmas fades.

THE WAY TO RELIGHT A FIRE IN BURNOUTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ohio, N.Y., Minn.)  (rk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The signs of burnout in a teacher who
has reached a certain age are timeless: the sigh of resignation
upon opening a daily instruction plan yellowed from repetition; the
realization that while the students never seem to get older, you
certainly do; the gnawing sense that a can't-miss lesson has long
ago lost its punch.
</P>
<P>
   If such emotions are universal, no matter the profession, then
so, until recently, has been the recourse. Teachers, like lawyers
or journalists, have often had little choice but to take the path
toward retirement when reaching such a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   Now a small but growing number of school systems, including Palm
Beach County's 9,000-teacher district, are trying to change that.
The districts have begun relieving some of their best teachers of
classroom duties and enlisting them as mechanics of a sort, their
sole job to service worn-out teachers who may have logged over
100,000 miles on their odometers but who, with proper retooling,
can travel thousands more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mentors sit in the back of the veterans' classrooms, suggest
techniques, books and lesson plans that they may not have tried and
provide a sympathetic ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the attitude that this was a good teacher at one time,
but something has changed,'' said Lisa Grives, an elementary-school
teacher for 17 years here who now works exclusively as a coach of
fellow veterans. ``We're there to redirect them into thinking about
what they came into teaching for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to succeed,'' added Ms. Grives, one of three
mentoring teachers in the district. ``If they see that they can't
succeed, I'm there to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the forces pushing for such intervention are the
nation's two largest teachers' unions _ the American Federation of
Teachers and the National Education Association _ which previously
paid little heed to burnout.
</P>
<P>
   The unions and the districts are facing crises on two fronts.
With many school systems already short of teachers, and with
hundreds of thousands who were hired to teach the baby-boom
generation preparing to retire over the next 10 years, school
systems risk losing their elder statesmen and their institutional
memory unless some veterans can be persuaded to stay on longer than
they might have imagined possible.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have also realized, with the rush of charter schools
and voucher programs, that the educational reform movement will
proceed with them or without them. With their support for mentoring
some senior teachers, and for coaxing those considered hopeless
into leaving, the unions hope to demonstrate that they have heard
the clamoring for new ways to elevate student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   With as many as half of all new teachers in some schools
quitting within five years of their first day, dozens of districts
across the country have developed mentoring programs intended to
build the skills of rookies. California recently made such programs
mandatory. But what districts like Palm Beach County _ as well as
Columbus, Ohio; Rochester, N.Y., and Minneapolis _ have realized is
that developing young teachers is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, a diverse district that stretches from
bejeweled Boca Raton to hardscrabble Jupiter, the results of
raining assistance on veterans are already visible: of the 94
teachers who have entered the one-year program since it began in
1995, either referred by a concerned administrator or volunteering
for it, one-third have since received a favorable evaluation from
their principals, their jobs secure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, another third have resigned, retired or been fired, and the
remaining third either are being reassigned outside the classroom
or are still in limbo. But the district and the Palm Beach County
Classroom Teachers Association point with pride to those 29 success
stories, teachers who as recently as five years ago would most
likely have never continued in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain teachers' trust, the program emphasizes
confidentiality, and one successful graduate of it, a 43-year-old
elementary-school teacher, agreed to be interviewed only if she was
not identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years in front of her classroom, the teacher said, she
had grown so tired of ``doing the same things'' that she began
taking her pupils on wild tangents that never got back to the point
at hand. Her principal eventually noticed, and offered her the
mentoring program as a way to rescue her career.
</P>
<P>
   After a ``day and a half of crying,'' during which she seriously
considered a job selling school supplies, she accepted her
principal's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the next year, her mentor, Ms. Grives, worked
to rebuild her into the teacher she once was, modeling new lesson
plans, drawing out her frustrations and rekindling the joy of
molding a young mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can't wait to go to work,'' she said. ``And it was
cheaper than therapy.''

WIRE BARRIERS ARE PREVENTING CROSSOVER ACCIDENT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When a car stopped suddenly in front of his
tractor-trailer on Interstate 435 early Monday, Jaime Thompson
slammed on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   His 80,000-pound rig swerved, overturned and skidded across the
grassy median near Bannister Road.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of smashing into the oncoming northbound traffic,
the vehicle slammed into flexible steel cables installed to prevent
crossover accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 29, of Anniston, Ala., walked away with minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Had Thompson's accident happened six months ago, the result
might have been more serious, Missouri Department of Transportation
officials said. While they could not state definitively that the
cables saved Thompson's life, officials said they helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really designed to stop a semi, but in this case it
did help,''said Steve Porter, a department spokesman. ``It's
gratifying to see it helped to stop an accident that could have
been a fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Three strands of steel cable have been strung along about 15
miles of I-435 so far, part of a $3 million state transportation
project.
</P>
<P>
   When the project is completed in mid-January, the cables will
stretch 20 miles along I-435, from the Grandview Triangle north to
the I-435//Interstate 35 interchange in Clay County.
</P>
<P>
   Since the project began in mid-July, vehicles have struck the
cables 33 times, state transportation officials said, but no fatal
crossover accidents have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there were 12 accidents in which cars crossed the
median along I-435, resulting in eight deaths, said Kansas City
police Sgt. Randy Sims with the accident investigations unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we know will save lives,'' Porter said.
``Before, if you went in the median and you were going at a high
speed, you could become airborne. Now, you shouldn't become
airborne. You should stick, like in a net.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials project that there may be as many as
267 collisions with the wires next year.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri transportation officials began sorting through ideas
last summer to make commuting on I-435 a little safer.
</P>
<P>
   They considered concrete barriers. But they estimated that they
would have cost about $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Called New Jersey barriers, they are stronger than the cable
system but a lot more expensive, Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has replaced cable wire barriers with New Jersey
barriers, said Mick Halter, metro engineer for the Kansas
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Halter said Kansas removed most, if not all, of the cable wire
barriers from its highways about 10 years ago because they did not
meet the safety designs of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had met the current standards, but it was old stuff,''
Halter said. ``The wire barriers were from the old 1950s design and
weren't nearly as good as what is available today.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable wire barriers also require a lot of space in the
roadway's median, which often is not available in metropolitan
areas, Halter said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey barriers have a special shape that deflects
vehicles back into their lanes, preventing them from crossing the
median into oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Such barriers can be found along Interstates 35, 70 and 635 as
well as along parts of I-435.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/The Missouri cable project is being done in three phases.
The first leg, which runs from I-435 north of the river to the
I-435//I-35 interchange, was completed in late August. The second
phase, completed in late November, runs from the Grandview Triangle
north to U.S. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials estimated that the third and final
phase, which will extend from U.S. 24 to the Missouri River, will
start within a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some local residents were skeptical when we first started,''
said Joel Blobaum, a Missouri Department of Transportation
spokesman. ``But we're hoping it's proven its worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's operating as we'd hoped it would.''

EDMONTON GETS JUMP ON THE ISLANDERS IN 4-2 WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ On paper, it seemed like a draw _ a team with
only two victories on the road visiting a team with only two
victories at home.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where any similarity between the Edmonton Oilers and
the New York Islanders began, and ended. Tuesday night, before a
crowd of 6,526 at Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders dropped their
seventh straight home game, 4-2, to the quick-skating Oilers, who
are unbeaten in three straight road games.
</P>
<P>
   Much as they did against the New Jersey Devils on Saturday in a
3-1 victory, the Oilers were quick to pounce. Right wing Bill
Guerin scored Edmonton's first goal at 4 minutes 56 seconds, and
right wing Pat Faloon made it 2-0 at 12:22 on a shot that slowly
rolled across the goal line after eluding the grasp of the rookie
goalie Roberto Luongo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get the first goal at home,'' Islanders coach
Butch Goring said. ``We're fragile. We can hear the boo-birds
coming out early. We just made a mistake on the first goal and then
another one eight minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders trimmed the deficit to a goal at 6:46 of the
second period when Mariusz Czerkawski scored his 12th goal of the
season. Taking the feed from Zdeno Chara, Czerkawski shot the puck
off an Oiler's skate and past goaltender Tommy Salo. Czerkawski had
a chance to tie the score a few minutes later on a shot from right
in front of the net, but Salo was able to make the save with his
body.
</P>
<P>
   As the Islanders grew more frustrated, the Oilers scored two
goals late in the second period to put the game out of reach. Mike
Grier, despite being tied up with defenseman Jamie Rivers in the
slot, was able to shoot the puck past Luongo for a 3-1 lead at
16:49.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers made the score 4-1 when Janne Niinimaa's shot from
the left point on the power play beat Luongo on his glove side as
Ryan Smyth and Rivers were about to fall on him. Referee Bernard
DeGrace ruled that the collision came after the goal was scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I could reach the puck because those guys
were in the way,'' said Luongo, who stopped 27 shots. ``I don't
know if that's supposed to be a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' Mats Lindgren made the score 4-2 with an
unassisted goal at 13:56. The Islanders, now 6-17-4, were unable to
score again, and were 0-5 on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brain dead as far as the power play goes,'' Goring
said. ``We did a lot of standing and thinking instead of skating
and reacting.'' &QL;

ORACLE'S 2ND-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Oracle Corp. soared Tuesday evening in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The gains came after the company reported second-quarter
earnings that beat estimates and defied predictions of a slowdown
in software sales as corporations focused on Year 2000 computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' expectations were dampened in September, when Oracle's
first-quarter earnings just met estimates and revenue growth fell
short. Oracle executives, at the time citing a seasonally weak
quarter and a few big sales that slipped past the closing date,
predicted a strong year. Today's results were sweet vindication for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Y2K quarter, and I expected it to be tough,''
said William Epifanio, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. Oracle's
database and big applications like accounting and human resources,
he said, are exactly the kind of software purchases that analysts
had expected corporations to defer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They defied Y2K,'' he said, ``and I think from this point
forward we can expect even better performance. With everything
happening in e-commerce, the market is moving in Oracle's
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle reported after the close of the Nasdaq market, which had
seen its shares drop 2 7/8, to 76 15/16. But in after-hours
trading, they jumped 7 1/16 to 84 and were expected to lift opening
stock prices Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Oracle earned $384 million, or 26
cents per diluted share, up 40 percent from $274 million, or 19
cents per share, last year.

   Revenue grew 13 percent, to $2.32 billion, compared with $2.06
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected per-share earnings of 22 cents, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said revenue from software licensing grew 18 percent year
over year. Database software sales increased 17 percent, to $651
million, while applications software sales grew 31 percent, to $168
million. Services, which include education, consulting and support,
rose 10 percent, to $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sixth quarter in a row that we've improved our
margins,'' Jeff Henley, the chief financial officer at Oracle, said
in a telephone interview. ``That's something we think will continue
as we convert to an e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman and chief executive, said six
months ago that the company would transform itself into an Internet
company by moving most sales to the Worldwide Web, replacing
multiple computer systems around the world with central
Internet-based servers and procuring supplies electronically. His
goal was to cut $1 billion in costs within 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also updated its products, including its core database
program, Oracle 8i, and all applications to operate over the
Internet, so that users need no software except a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also claims to be the only vendor now offering a complete
suite of business applications, including both back-office
programs, like human resources and accounting, and front-office,
like sales force management and purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can just buy it all from Oracle and it all works
together and it all works over the Internet,'' Ellison said in a
conference call with analysts. ``My summary for the quarter is,
`Gentlemen, you ain't seen nothing yet.'''

BRODEUR, OFFENSE PROVIDE PRODUCTION AS DEVILS DOWN KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the first eight minutes of the second
period Tuesday night, the Los Angeles Kings took the only six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings swarmed Martin Brodeur, the New Jersey Devils'
goaltender, with intensity at the north end of Continental Arena.
But Brodeur held his ground to the delight of many in the crowd of
10,807, the smallest turnout in a season without a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Making his 20th start in the last 21 games, Brodeur was
magnificent during those minutes under fire, to such a degree that
his saves inspired the Devils, who went on to an easy 7-1 victory
over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty made the saves when he had to,'' Devils captain Scott
Stevens said about Brodeur, who made 34 saves and allowed only a
goal _ to Donald Audette. Brodeur's best save came against Jason
Blake when two Kings broke in alone during the second period.
Brodeur stormed out of the Devils' net for the save.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were desperate to redeem themselves for an awful
first period in their previous game here, a 3-1 loss to Edmonton
Saturday afternoon. They played with vigor for the most part, and
had some luck when the game's outcome was still in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good first period, which was important after what
happened in the last game,'' Stevens said. ``We got a couple of
good bounces, too.''
</P>
<P>
   John Madden was the luckiest of the Devils during a short-handed
situation for New Jersey with 7 minutes 41 seconds left in the
second period. His weak shot from center ice, about 80 feet away,
bounced once after it was slightly deflected around the blue line
and then the puck eluded Stephane Fiset for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Madden's third goal of the season, and gave the Devils a
4-1 lead. Fiset was so rattled after it that he allowed another
goal, to Jay Pandolfo, 49 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Madden was one of seven Devils scoring, a development that
pleased coach Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see it spread around,'' Ftorek said. ``We got
all kinds of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux and Patrik Elias scored the first two goals 48
seconds apart, starting at 5:04, and Randy McKay gave the Devils a
three-goal lead with 2:13 left in the first period before Audette
beat Brodeur at 8:02 of the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   The first three goals for the Devils came when they gained
possession in the Kings' zone after poor clearing attempts by the
visitors. Lemieux's eighth and Elias' second of the season were
also scored with no one from the Kings near them.
</P>
<P>
   The three goals by the Devils in the first period prompted coach
Andy Murray of the Kings to replace goaltender Jamie Storr, who
faced 14 shots. Fiset faced 22 shots and allowed four goals.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott scored the sixth goal for the Devils (16-10-3) with
1:58 left in the second period and Sergei Nemchinov iced the
victory with 2:25 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take the goals any way we can get them,'' Ftorek said.
``We got all kinds of goals tonight because guys were going to the
net and we got some nice, pretty plays, and we got some ugly
ones.''

HIGH SCHOOL REGULATORS BLOW CALL ON POOR SHOWING BY PRIVATE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just when the world of pro and big-time college sports
can't get any more preposterous, an episode in high school sports
sets the bar even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Kedzie Gunderson is a junior basketball player, a good one, on
Bellevue High School's girls basketball team. At least she has been
for the past couple of weeks, once the governing board of state
prep sports reinstated her eligibility to end a sorry saga of bad
results from good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing harassment by teammates, Gunderson in the fall of 1998
transferred from Gig Harbor High School to Bellevue, where she
played her sophomore season, helping lead the 25-4 Wolverines to a
fifth-place finish in the Class 3A state tourney.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, some officials and parents at Gig Harbor
questioned whether Gunderson and her family actually moved to
Bellevue, suspecting they were skirting rules about establishing
residency in a new district.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association snapped
into action, in a way the agency had never done before.
</P>
<P>
   It hired a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The guy followed Gunderson. He tailed her on the freeways, into
the school parking lot and back to her Bellevue home. He recorded
the comings and goings of cars at the Gundersons' former residence
in Gig Harbor, now rented to the mother of Gail Gunderson, Kedzie's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the Gundersons were keeping dual residences.
</P>
<P>
   But he never interviewed the Gundersons, nor anyone who had
knowledge of them. Neither did the WIAA , which received the
evidence. Nor was there due process to allow the Gundersons a
chance to rebut the findings.
</P>
<P>
   What there was, was an Oct. 25 letter from WIAA attorney and
associate athletic director John Olson to Bellevue athletic
director Chris Hoffman, saying Gunderson, because of the
dual-residency finding, was ineligible and must sit out the
1999-2000 athletic year.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to tell whether Gail and her husband, Jim, both
psychologists and social workers, were more shocked or angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kedzie was the happiest she'd been in school, and all of a
sudden, she's ineligible because some people said her parents were
liars,'' Gail said. ``It's as if the sheriff had knocked on your
door and said, `You've been tried, convicted and sentenced. Didn't
you know?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Gundersons hired an attorney for an appeal and received a
hearing before the WIAA executive board on Nov. 23. Jim Gunderson
provided evidence that he kept an office in a studio at the Gig
Harbor residence to serve area clients, and produced income tax
statements, drivers' licenses, bank accounts, utility bills and a
lease to prove their new residence was Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Kedzie and her mother also established that they showed up
occasionally at the old Gig Harbor house to visit Gail's mother,
who lives alone and is limited by severe vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30, the board agreed with the Gundersons, saying it
``questioned the accuracy and reliability of the information that
had been provided by an independent investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of eligibility was a rebuke for Mike Colbrese,
the WIAA executive director who ordered the hiring of the
ineffectual gumshoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've done this,'' Colbrese said this
week. ``We've been talking about something like this for four or
five years because of the increasing number of cases where there is
suspicion of more aggressive families seeking a way around the
eligibility rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbrese said eligibility questions take up more than 80 percent
of Olson's work time in an organization that has administrative
authority over 200,000 prep athletes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he ``would not hesitate'' to hire a spy on another
kid in a similar circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was warranted in this case,'' he said. ``Would we
do a better and more thorough job next time? I would hope they
would do a thorough job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gundersons also hope the WIAA does a thorough job of
thinking out its policies and procedures. The affair cost the
Gundersons nearly $10,000, not to mention the heartache and lost
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   They also were dumbfounded that anyone at Gig Harbor would, a
year after the transfer, stir this up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said this isn't working well, Kedzie was ostracized, and
our only option was to move,'' Gail said. ``So we moved. We never
complained to the WIAA, we never put anything in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are people picking on a 16-year-old? Why attempt to
destroy us? Why aren't they just happy we left?''
</P>
<P>
   Gig Harbor principal Mike West said there was no vendetta. He
said he and coach Bob Boback brought the Gunderson matter to
Colbrese's attention during a routine meeting in August that
covered eligibility issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Mike that there were reports that Kedzie was still in
the community,'' West said. ``People said to me, `You're the
principal. Why do we have rules if they're not enforced? What are
you going to do about it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So Mike said he would look into it, and that was it from my
standpoint. If we were out to get somebody, why would we wait a
year? As far as Kedzie, she's a nice young lady, and I wish her the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   According to those familiar with the situation, Kedzie
Gunderson's talent created resentment among older players, and the
elder Gundersons were seen by some as overbearing. The Gundersons
denied any interference, although they often disagreed with Boback,
a longshoreman in Tacoma who walked into the controversy in his
first year as a head prep coach and his first time coaching girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad deal, it really is,'' said Boback. ``The idea they
were picked on is totally untrue. It was more like a case of a
talented freshman and her family expecting special treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the did-too, did-not aspect of the episode _ and it
is considerable _ the WIAA's hamfisted handling of the case fairly
screams for reform regarding policies about fairness and students'
rights. As anyone who has had a high school civics class can
recall, the Gunderson case is not how honest business is done in
America.
</P>
<P>
   But Colbrese and the WIAA are also flailing almost helplessly
against a national problem _ overwrought parents who futilely jerk
their kids from school to school and badger coaches and
administrators in search of playing time, glory and the elusive
college scholarship. The scourge is driving legions of quality
coaches from the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely troubling to have to hire from outside the
school system to determine residency records of this student or
that student,'' Colbrese said. ``I don't like being there. But some
(parents) are getting more aggressive and subtle and secretive
about getting around the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than do nothing more than cough nervously over the
Gunderson case, the WIAA and its member schools would do well to
use the mess to jump-start a discussion about moving from the
autocratic to the democratic, as well as finding fresher, more
effective tools to curb those parents who are squeezing the
vitality and fun from high school sports.

GRIFFEY'S POSITION BINDS M'S, BUT GILLICK PERSEVERES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr. will accept a trade only to
the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds will not trade for him. But in the
minds of the Mariners, one plus one doesn't always equal two.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners general manager Pat Gillick left the winter meetings
Tuesday morning with the same team he had coming in. He will
continue to try to make deals, including one for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody on the ballclub _ forget about Griffey _ if you can
improve and get better, then you've got to try,'' Gillick said. ``I
don't think you ever cease trying to improve your club, no matter
who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners still consider Griffey their most tradable player,
even if the past six weeks have proven no player may be tougher to
move. The M's have found no interest in other players they have
shopped, and continue to turn away inquiries _ from the Mets, White
Sox and probably others _ about shortstop Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves Gillick with two options: Make more deals like
Monday's with the Mets and take them to Griffey for almost certain
rejection, or give up and start the season with Griffey on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the Anaheim Marriott Tuesday morning, Reds GM
Jim Bowden reiterated that he didn't blame Gillick for the asking
price Bowden rejected. But Bowden implied the Mariners might have
miscalculated once they knew Griffey had cut his list to one team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Gillick) was never going to back off that player
(infielder Pokey Reese), it was never going to make any
difference,'' Bowden said. ``But if he thought there was one club
the whole time, I would think he would make the best deal he could.
... You may end up with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Mariners' risk. Griffey has changed his mind before,
but he also has been stubborn about things. Griffey apparently
feels challenged by the Mariners' statements that he changes his
mind often, and he is determined to stick to his
Cincinnati-or-Seattle stance.
</P>
<P>
   To Gillick, bringing back Griffey doesn't sound so bad.
</P>
<P>
   With Griffey, Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and John Olerud, Gillick
said, the Mariners have a lineup that includes four of baseball's
top hitters. The GM dismissed the suggestion that uncertainty over
Griffey's future will become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distraction?'' Gillick said. ``When he gets on the field,
he's going to play. I think that's overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the organization believe Griffey's sensitivity could
affect his play, and the Mariners certainly remember Randy
Johnson's departure under similar circumstances in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillick's chance of appeasing Griffey with a Cincinnati
trade is remote. Bowden said all the Reds' offers are gone, and
explained that he already has lost the chance to maximize Griffey's
impact on Reds ticket sales. He sounded relieved to be keeping his
young nucleus intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the number of calls I got from our
players saying thank you for not breaking up this team,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   With no workable trades in place, the Mariners will continue
their efforts to sign free agents, including leadoff hitter Mark
McLemore, starter Chuck Finley and relievers Arthur Rhodes and
Kazuhiro Sasaki, a closer. The Mariners have included closer Jose
Mesa in trade talks, possibly indicating they believe they can sign
Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, however, was in Cleveland Tuesday night and met with the
Indians' top officials. His travel plans indicate he is not
scheduled to leave Cleveland until Thursday, which could mean an
announcement is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   A-ROD MEETING OFF? Gillick is still hopeful of meeting with
Rodriguez again this winter, but Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras,
said he doubted a meeting would take place. Rodriguez, who has no
desire to negotiate before he becomes a free agent next fall, met
with Gillick and other officials last month after the club
presented an eight-year contract offer worth more than $15 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of the parties was made clear then, so there's
nothing pressing,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Does Boras think the breakdown in Griffey trade talks might
cause the M's to shop Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're contemplating,'' he said. ``Alex has
made it clear that he wants to stay and try to win there.''

CLINTON HAILS FEDS AS READY FOR Y2K 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government has licked nearly all of its
year 2000 computer problems, the Clinton administration announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 16 days remaining before the New Year, a quarter
of the states and territories are still scrambling to correct and
test computer systems affecting some major, federally funded
programs, from food stamps to Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget reported Tuesday that 99.9
percent of the key computer systems at the government's largest
agencies are ready for the year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 6,175 ``mission critical'' systems are not yet Y2K
compliant, but work on those systems is slated to be completed by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing the report, President Clinton said: ``The facts are
clear. We have done our job. We have met the deadline, and we have
done it at below cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is expected to spend a total of $8.38
billion to deal with the so-called ``millennium bug,'' the
seemingly omnipresent computer glitch that can render computers
unable to read the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While hefty, the government's Y2K bill will be a far cry from
the $50 billion cost some were predicting, administration officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
   With the vast majority of the work at the federal level now
completed, officials in Washington are now trying to help those
states and territories still struggling to complete their computer
work on time.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget identified nine states, four
territories and the District of Columbia as jurisdictions which
still needed to complete computer work for programs ranging from
child nutrition to unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands have the
most work to finish, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas was not listed among the laggards. But the state's child
nutrition program, the report noted, had yet to be certified as Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Sherron Heinemann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of
Human Services, said state officials sent the necessary paperwork
to Washington more than two months ago but had had trouble getting
federal officials to update their database.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the five agencies critical to the operation of the federal
government still to be corrected, two affect military intelligence
systems. Pentagon officials noted, however, that one of those
systems is to be retired at the end of the month, while the other
will not be needed until the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug also affected a clock on the Abrams M-1A2
tank. Pentagon officials said that was only a ``cosmetic'' problem
that would be corrected by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The computer bug could also affect office automation projects at
the Drug Enforcement Administration and at the Justice Department's
tax division.
</P>
<P>
   Officials conversant with the Y2K issue at these agencies could
not be reached for immediate comment, although the Office of
Management and Budget report noted that both agencies had
contingency plans in place.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has not been alone in its Y2K efforts.
The Commerce Department estimates the nation as a whole will spend
$100 billion fixing the millennium bug. And despite all the blood
and sweat, not all of the work will be completed on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously too early to declare victory and go home,''
John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar told reporters Tuesday at
a speech at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition to the new century will not be perfect,''
Koskinen noted. ``Not every system will be fixed, and even some of
those that have been fixed and tested may experience glitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of continuing concerns, Amtrak, the nation's passenger
rail service, said Tuesday it plans to halt all train service
before midnight on New Year's Eve as a safety precaution. Service
will resume once Amtrak officials are confident the Y2K problems
will not endanger its passengers.
</P>
<P>
   To keep passengers happy during the service lull, Amtrak plans
to throw New Year's parties on its trains.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's chemical plants, meanwhile, plan to shut
down over the holiday rather than run the risk of encountering a
surprise Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no free lunch,'' Koskinen said. ``When you shut
complicated systems down and then start them up again, you have a
risk, in the shutdown, in the start-up. And the consensus of the
chemical industry and the nuclear industry is that people need to
do that if they think there are risks. If you thought there were no
significant risks, then you've increased the risks by requiring
everybody to shut down and start up. And the chemical plants
especially (those) that run continuously are very sensitive about
that issue.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ When the Dallas Mavericks upset San Antonio late last
season at Reunion Arena, there was a lot of yelling going on in the
Spurs' locker room after the game.
</P>
<P>
   No such screaming took place Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defending NBA champs used a torrid second-half to squash the
Mavericks, 111-93, before 13,685 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the return of power forward Gary Trent could prevent
the Mavericks from losing. Trent started the game and finished with
12 points (6-of-14 shooting) and four rebounds in 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't nearly enough to offset a Spurs team that came in a
bit antsy after losing Saturday at home to lowly Washington, 99-89,
dropping them to 1-4 in a five-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were mad or angry at all,'' said Cedric
Ceballos, who led the Mavericks with 27 points and 10 rebounds. ``I
just think they dug down and did the things it took to win the
basketball game, and we didn't have all of our players at full
strength shooting very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the world champs, and they did the things they needed
to do in the stretch to win the basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks trailed only 51-46 at halftime. But little-touted
Chucky Brown scored 10 points in the third period, and the Spurs
took an 83-70 lead into the final period and poured it on from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He surprised us with those jump shots,'' said Robert Pack, who
scored 14 points and handed out eight assists. ``He got some easy
ones on the breaks, but also was able to hit some shots from 15
feet that really dug a hole for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After an impressive two-week period, Mavericks guard Michael
Finley had a subpar performance. Finley was 5-of-15 from the field
and collected 15 points, two rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an off night,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said. ``I
thought they played him real well. They crowded him ... and made
him be a passer, and he tried to make good passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did have some shots, they just didn't go. He didn't
have many good looks, but when he did, he struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks forward Samaki Walker scored eight points and
snatched four rebounds in 17 minutes. Walker, who left the
Mavericks during the off-season via free agency, was booed when he
entered the game in the second and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised (to get booed), but it happens like that,''
Walker said. ``It's a home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was to stay focused and not make this a personal
issue. It's not Samaki against the Mavericks; it's the Spurs
against the Mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 29 points and 12 rebounds, Avery
Johnson scored 16 and David Robinson had 10 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the way back up,'' Duncan said. ``We went down for a
little while, and we hadn't been playing real well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of film sessions and a couple of practices,
and we're on our way back to where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent hopes he's on his way back, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to come back and get a feel,'' he said. ``I'll
give it a few weeks, go to practice tomorrow and work on some
things and come back Thursday and give it another try.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs shot .506 percent from the field in improving to 16-7,
while the Mavericks dropped to 8-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came and we played hard,'' Pack said. ``We didn't do a lot
of things particularly well mentally, but we played hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go back to practice tomorrow and hopefully
come back against New York and have a better effort.'' nn

YOUTH MIGHT SERVE RANGERS BEST IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's annual winter meetings have come and gone, and the
question lingers:
</P>
<P>
   What happened to all the drunken sailors?
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the free-spending Jerry Colangelos and the
Kevin Malones? Where are the Brinks trucks? Why hasn't anyone
signed Chuck Finley for $60 million plus weekly use of a Boeing
727?
</P>
<P>
   And most of all, why doesn't anyone want to play for the
Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   You know it's time to check your girdle when a pudding-soft
streak hitter like Todd Zeile, though presented a $16 million
Christmas gift, turns up his nose at the Rangers' offer and opts
instead for the friendly environs of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful how you overreact on this one. Zeile's midnight
signing Saturday likely says more about him than it does the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The talk-show talk has been that the home team can't close a
deal _ that general manager Doug Melvin is better at wheeling and
dealing than he is at courting and wooing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year's Randy Johnson World Tour. Not to
mention the Stottlemyre Family Rent-A-Todd Summer Package and, of
course, the Roger Clemens No Place But Texas Sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and the Rangers landed none of the three. Nor have there
been any alleged sightings of Ken Griffey Jr., scouting for a new
house in Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the one player who did want to sign with the Rangers
is now in Detroit _ right, Juan Gonzalez?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has heard all the can't-close-the-deal talk. He quietly
reminded a caller Tuesday that John Wetteland, Ken Hill, Pudge
Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro all wanted to play for the Rangers
and signed on the dotted line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each of those other cases, there were reasons,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lived in Arizona and was able to match his family's
wishes with Colangelo's genuflecting checkbook. Ditto for
Stottlemyre, who made only 17 starts yet banked a 1999 salary of $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   In Clemens' case, you could argue that owner Tom Hicks was the
main one who failed to hook-'em his man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm better at trading for people,'' Melvin said, only
half-seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, this is a franchise that paid a reported $80,801,598
in players salaries in 1999. Only the New York Yankees ($92
million) spent more.
</P>
<P>
   With a superstar nucleus already in place _ Rodriguez, Palmeiro,
Wetteland and, until recently, Gonzalez _ an agent would have been
wise to shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks expressed his concern last week that baseball's ``drunken
sailors'' needed to be reined in. Around the NHL, they probably
choked on their back-bacon when they heard that one. Hicks has been
hockey's alleged drunken sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if you're going to moan about the Rangers' free-agent
failings, don't forget the Stars. Owner Hicks dug deep to sign,
among others, Ed Belfour and Brett Hull, the two heroes of the
Stanley Cup finale.
</P>
<P>
   This baseball franchise isn't stingy, and Hicks can give you
80,801,598 reasons why it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Like Melvin said, there instead can be ``reasons'' why an agent
shepherds a player elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Tony Attanasio, for instance, was confident that Mark
McLemore could get _ and wanted _ a two-year contract. The Rangers,
who had previously signed McLemore to three-year and two-year
deals, this time offered one year at $2 million, a $250,000 pay
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff happens. McLemore, who was popular among fans and
teammates, could have had the starting second base job again, and
who knows? If young Kelly Dransfeldt's struggles continue, McLemore
might have ended up with two more years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes Mark McLemore more than I do,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McLemore reportedly is on the verge of signing a
two-year deal with Seattle to play left field.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's fault? Or Attanasio's?
</P>
<P>
   To all things, however, there is a reason. In the Rangers' case,
an infusion of young blood, necessitated by juggling the payroll,
might be just what the surgeons ordered. Melvin tells a poignant
story about a conversation he had at the winter meetings with
crusty Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds were rife with youngsters, yet finished 29 games over
.500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put them out there and let them play, and it was fun,''
McKeon told Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the Rangers, too, have to answer to their farm
system. ``At some point,'' Melvin said, ``you have to find out who
can play and who can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst-case scenario,'' he said, ``would be if we
were trying to pretend to catch the Yankees and July 31 comes, and
we're having to trade away a Francisco Cordero, a Gabe Kapler or a
Mike Lamb to try to think we can beat the Yankees again.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is right, and so was McKeon. As a consolation prize for
finishing second in the Zeile Sale, the Rangers may well get a
first-hand look at their future.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Lamb, Kapler and Ruben Mateo if they want to play here. nn

TRANSIT WORKERS AND MTA REACH AGREEMENT TO AVERT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating and rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's transit workers and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority reached a deal on Wednesday morning to
avert a threatened strike, union officials said, as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said he expected that bus and subway service would be near
normal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no strike tomorrow,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference at 10:30 on Tuesday night. ``The most that we'll have to
deal with are work stoppages here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said early Wednesday morning that after five
days of intense talks, the two sides had reached agreement on all
issues, including wages.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Calhoun, the secretary-treasurer of Local 100 of the
Transport Workers Union, said, ``I'm absolutely delighted.'' As
soon as the union leaders reached an agreement, they headed to
union headquarters to present details to the transit workers'
46-member board. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials
did not immediately make an announcement about an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While transit workers were still awaiting the details of a new
contract, the tense wait among subway and bus riders appeared to be
over after two weeks of often-heated rhetoric. As the mayor and
transit union leaders traded jibes during that time, millions were
left to wonder how they would cope with the shutdown of the transit
system.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and workplaces had put plans in place to stagger hours,
and the city drew up elaborate contingency plans to speed
transportation into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides moved toward an agreement on Tuesday, Giuliani
warned of the possibility of disruptions on Wednesday from wildcat
actions by disgruntled transit workers. He also warned that any
workers who participate in such actions would be subject to
draconian fines starting at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the state sought to pressure the union not to
strike by getting a state judge to sign an order on Tuesday that
threatened the union and its members with crippling fines if they
went on strike in defiance of state law.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of attacking the union, Giuliani changed
course on Tuesday and praised the union's leaders, saying they
provided assurances that the union would not shut down New York
City's transit system on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday night,
rank-and-file members expressed relief that a strike had apparently
been averted, but, despite the olive branch the mayor extended to
union leaders on Tuesday, they also expressed anger over the way he
handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's portraying us as criminals, and we are all hard-working
people looking for a decent wage increase that we earned,'' said
Jerry Baker, 45, a bus driver from Staten Island. ``To hold a gun
to our head and say, `You take this or you're going to be fined
$25,000' is absurd and ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the agreement calls for a 14.3 percent
increase in wages and benefits over three years, including a pledge
by management to make larger contributions to the workers' pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides reached an agreement on wages after starting out
far apart. The union last week called for a wage increase of 9
percent a year over three years, while the MTA offered 12 percent
over four years.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Fans poured onto the court again. OK, so it was just one fan. And
the Rockets were not beating the Knicks for the 1994 NBA
championship. They were not even beating the Knicks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But as the Rockets begin the longest training camp in league
history, scheduled for 60 games, any success is worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   So as Matt Bullard, the only healthy Rockets player left from
1994, hit a 3-pointer while being fouled by Larry Johnson, Bullard
found himself in a tight embrace from one of the first-row fans
still showing up for games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like 1994,'' Bullard said, after his late four-point
play helped the Rockets lose by only 101-90 on Tuesday night at
Compaq Center. ``It was like high school.''
</P>
<P>
   It also might have been how things must become for the
learning-to-crawl Rockets. Frustrated by maddeningly close losses
in the first month, the Rockets could not help but notice the
improvement since their debacle in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under usual circumstances, it might not have merited hugs from
fans during the game, but the Rockets left usual circumstances
behind last week. For the first time this season, other than
because of injuries or suspensions, they shook up the starting
lineup, sending Thomas Hamilton and Cuttino Mobley into the
starting mix. And for most of the night, they stayed within range
of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   That did not last, of course. In the fourth quarter, the Knicks,
the top defensive team in the league, put on the defensive clamps
and the Rockets missed five of their first six shots to allow the
Knicks to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a pretty good job for a good part of the game,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We stayed in the game. I
thought we missed some pretty good shots. There was just not enough
firepower. They sort of wore us down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets considered that a vast improvement. They were
within six after three quarters. The Knicks pushed their lead to 13
in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But goals have changed. The Rockets didn't get blown out. After
the ignominy of falling 27 points behind the Nets on Saturday and
rallying to lose in a rout, giving the Knicks a game was considered
a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely look at it as progress,'' said Mobley, a guard
who started for the first time this season and had 14 points. ``The
whole aspect of the game. We passed the ball around a little bit.
We played better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets never really had an answer for the Knicks'
stars. Mobley gave Tomjanovich a second quick-footed starter, with
Shandon Anderson, to match up with Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell, playing with the flu, made eight of 13 shots for
22 points and had five assists. Houston made 10 of 17 shots for 20
points. Patrick Ewing, playing his third game since returning from
an injury to his left Achilles' tendon, had 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, they were just
unbelievable the way they could shoot the ball,'' Mobley said. ``I
couldn't believe that. It's not about getting them; it's about
making them. I got them. I didn't make them. They made them.
Shandon and myself stayed in their faces, and they still made their
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup change is not necessarily long-term, Tomjanovich
said. He said he plans to adjust nightly based on matchups and
insisted he was not sending any sort of message. But struggling
forward Walt Williams, who had started every game, never so much as
removed his warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to piece the puzzle together,'' Rockets forward
Carlos Rogers said. ``We're making changes to see what pieces fit.
If they don't, we'll go to something else. Right now, we're trying
to find out what works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult part is losing and trying to stay focused and
still be ready and prepared for the next game. If we stay really
focused, we can do it. If we can just put our thoughts into
preparation for next year, we'll be a better team. But that's the
hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to match up with the Knicks was difficult enough.
</P>
<P>
   There were many times when the Knicks seemed to be on the brink
of blowing the game open. They had gotten pretty much any shot they
wanted most of the night. Sprewell and Houston seemed capable of
getting open jumpers at will.
</P>
<P>
   But they finally did race beyond the Rockets' reach with their
usual game, shutting down the Rockets for almost six minutes to
lead 87-74.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had hung around despite not shooting nearly as well
as the Knicks, largely by making enough 3s to keep pace. Down by
six midway through the second quarter, Anderson found Bullard for
consecutive 3s to tie the score. By halftime, the Knicks had made
52.8 percent of their shots, the Rockets just 41 percent, and the
Rockets trailed by just a trey.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets stayed within range, heading to the fourth quarter
within six. But as the Knicks consistently got wide-open looks, it
was just a matter of time before enough fell to end any doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Knicks had sealed the win, the Rockets did
something to regain hope for the night, and perhaps the months of
rebuilding to come. Ewing had made four consecutive free throws to
regain the 13-point lead when Bullard nailed his third trey of the
night, drawing a foul and making the free throw to pull the Rockets
within nine with 1:13 left.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the fan was more excited to find that he and
Bullard shared musical tastes. But these days, they'll celebrate
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had said something to me before when I was taking the
ball out of bounds,'' Bullard said. ``He said he saw me at the Rush
concert. I already gave him five. I was trying to give him five,
and he gave me a big hug.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros on Tuesday night finalized a deal sending outfielder
Carl Everett to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for shortstop Adam
Everett and a minor-league pitcher.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox targeted Carl Everett in their efforts to acquire a
run-producing outfielder and, according to sources, became willing
to complete a trade for the talented switch hitter despite the
possibility of having his services for only one year. A stumbling
block in the trade negotiations had been Boston's inability to
discuss a long-term deal with Everett, who can become a free agent
after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who is eligible for arbitration, earned $2.4 million in
1999 and will command a substantial pay raise after batting .325
with 25 home runs and 108 RBIs in helping the Astros win a third
straight National League Central title.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's first order of business will be to work out a multiyear
agreement with Everett, 28, who likely would get at least $5
million for next season through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have entertained trade talks regarding several
players who are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season.
Others besides Everett include lefthanded starting pitcher Mike
Hampton and right fielder Derek Bell. The club is keeping a close
eye on its payroll, which is approaching $60 million. Another
consideration is the fact the Astros eventually hope to make room
in the outfield for younger players such as Richard Hidalgo, Daryle
Ward and Lance Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Adam Everett, 22, who batted .263 with 10
home runs at Class AA Trenton last season, helps address one of the
Astros' weaknesses, incurred with the departure of Ricky Gutierrez,
who was not offered arbitration and became a free agent. Everett,
the Red Sox's No. 1 draft pick in 1998, is considered an excellent
defensive prospect.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known which pitcher the Red Sox will send to
Houston. Among the possibilities is lefthander Greg Miller, who was
10-6 with a 3.10 ERA and 146 strikeouts in 136 innings last season
for Boston's Class A affiliate at Augusta, Ga.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN he was in his prime, I asked Muhammad Ali if there were any
tricks he used to psych himself before, or even during, a fight.
His eyes glowed. He looked up with those deep, dancing eyes and
said, ``Oh, yeah, I think about my bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Your what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``I worked hard for that bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said when he was a kid back in Louisville, Ky., known as
Cassius Clay, he had a job sacking groceries. He found a bike he
just had to have, second hand, but blue and really sharp. So he
saved his money for months to buy the used wheels and, proud and
happy, he parked it behind the grocery.
</P>
<P>
   And somebody stole it. Nearly broke his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He walked all over Louisville that summer, he said, looking for
his bicycle. This was 15 or 20 years later, and his eyes were still
hard with the memory. ``I walked and looked, looked and walked,''
he said. ``Never found it. But every time I got into a ring, I
looked across at the other fighter, and I said to myself, `Hey,
that's the guy that stole my bike!'''
</P>
<P>
   Any writer who ever crossed the path of Ali may have an anecdote
or a personal yarn to tell. It wasn't difficult acquiring one. He
rarely let a writer go away hungry. The first time I ever
interviewed him one on one, it was two in the afternoon, and he was
still in bed in a Houston hotel, the covers pulled up to his chin.
</P>
<P>
   This was during the darkest days of his exile from boxing, a
43-month absence that saw him matched against the U.S. Army. His
legal costs were staggering, and his standing with the public had
plunged to depths below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   But he was confident for two reasons. ``People forgave
Hirohito,'' he explained. ``They forgave Khrushchev, Rommel and
Jack Dempsey. If I lay low, the fans will forget about this problem
I have with the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As a secondary issue, he felt he understood the temporary nature
of fame. ``Look at Wyatt Earp,'' he said, meaning the actor who had
played him on TV. ``Look at Dave Garroway. Look at Malcolm
X.'' The world had not yet forgotten Malcolm. He was simply no
longer around to enjoy his fame, having been shot and killed by a
rival Muslim faction.
</P>
<P>
   If we have to explain to you why Ali is now the consensus choice
as the Athlete of the Century, there is really no point in trying.
Through good times or bad, through war and divorce and across the
racial divide, he took us on one of the wildest and merriest rides
in the history of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a central figure in American justice, and wherever
he goes today he is more than a hero, more than a legend. He is a
measuring stick for the last four decades, since he returned from
Rome in 1960 with a gold medal as a young boxer on the American
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can walk into any village in Africa,'' Evander Holyfield
said, ``and they know him and call out his name. Do you think they
know Michael Jordan's name in the villages in Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   His ``problem'' with the government, of course, dealt with his
refusal to be drafted during the war in Vietnam. Seeking a more
enlightened draft board than the one in Louisville, he became a
temporary resident of Houston, a city friendly to him for most of
his career. Mi casa es su casa; my house is your house. My draft
board is your draft board.
</P>
<P>
   The government won that battle, but in time the verdict was
overturned. Almost without our being aware, he went from a brash,
20-year-old Olympian to a loud-mouthed champion (who seemed
perfectly paired with Howard Cosell) to America's villain and then,
suddenly, an elder statesman who would win the title not once but
three times.
</P>
<P>
   He told outrageous stories and amused us with his poetry. It was
grade-school quality, but he recited it with the seriousness of
Yeats. He was meant to be enjoyed, not psychoanalyzed, but in the
early 1990s you found yourself fighting the temptation to feel pity
for him.
</P>
<P>
   He had grown soft with age and puffy from medication, his speech
was thick, his hands trembled, and he moved like a man pulling a
wagon. But he wasn't dying, and he wasn't punch drunk. He had not
lost his sense of humor, nor his ability to inspire awe and
affection _ among most of us.
</P>
<P>
   He has lived now for 15 years with Parkinson's Syndrome, known
to some as Left Hook Disease. But the early scare stories turned
out to be wildly exaggerated. On the day the New York Post ran a
front-page headline that read: ``ALI FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE,'' he
left the hospital in a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier, he had been jiving with the press and fighting
for an extra serving of banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   In his time on the world stage, he has been the master
puppeteer. He set the tone. He set the mood. He even set the prices
_ at least for a heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Smoking Joe Frazier in two out of their three classic
matches. He wore out George Foreman in Zaire, and he took the sport
of boxing to new levels and far-away places. Many of us grew up
with him and saw sports make the turn from a place where champions
ate Wheaties, loved humankind and spoke well of dogs to an era of
megamillions and television spectacles that devour the world.
</P>
<P>
   The voice is low and slow and slurred now, but in the ways that
count, it is the voice of sports in the American century.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the previous failure of the Bluebonnet Bowl to survive,
Gallery Furniture owner Jim ``Mattress Mac'' McIngvale said Tuesday
his firm will be the title sponsor for a postseason college bowl
game in Houston at a cost of approximately $2 million over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The contest will be known as the galleryfurniture.com Bowl with
the first game, pending NCAA certification, Dec. 26, 2000, in the
Astrodome. Officials hope eventually to move the game to the new
stadium in which Houston's NFL expansion franchise will play.
</P>
<P>
   McIngvale said lessons were learned from the bankrupt Bluebonnet
Bowl, and he thinks he has the means to get the message out for the
new game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be different because I spend so much money on
television and radio that I can help promote it,'' McIngvale said.
``That's one of the reasons, to be honest with you, that (bowl
officials) wanted me. I run a thousand radio and TV spots in this
market a week. So we can help promote it and sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a football town. We have been without the NFL for
several years now, and it is coming back. And the college bowl game
is coming back. It's my job and Jerry's job (promoter Jerry
Ippoliti, president of Bowl Series Inc. in Houston) to market it
and make it exciting. Our other job is to make it a good time for
the players and teams when they come here so they will want to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the bowl faces many of the problems the Bluebonnet Bowl
found to be insurmountable. The Bluebonnet Bowl was doomed in part
because it was usually played on New Year's Eve and featured teams
that were not ranked. Similarly, the Dec. 26 date of the
galleryfurniture.com Bowl would require out-of-town fans to be away
from home for Christmas. That may force the bowl to be dependent on
local ticket sales, which waned in the final years of the
Bluebonnet Bowl. The 29th and final game, between Texas and
Pittsburgh, drew 23,282 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for the Bluebonnet Bowl was that it did not have
a solid television package. Houston's bowl has no TV deal for 2000,
but Ippoliti, the former commissioner of the Mid-American
Conference, said he is talking with Fox, Turner Sports and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have that much history on (the Bluebonnet Bowl),''
Ippoliti said. ``I don't particularly care what happened in the
past, because a lot of things have happened in football today.
There is more parity, there are fewer scholarships, and there is no
one dominating football today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not criticizing who handled the Bluebonnet Bowl. But I
think there is a better structure in NCAA policy than we had.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 61 Division I-A teams had winning records to qualify
for spots in 23 bowls. If the Houston bowl is certified, there
would be 25 bowls in 2000, with the Silicon Valley Bowl in San
Jose, Calif., also coming on line.
</P>
<P>
   Ippoliti said that is not too many bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility means a lot to teams, and that means being in a
bowl game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The galleryfurniture.com Bowl currently has no conference
tie-ins. Ippoliti has talked with the commissioners of several
conferences, including the Big 12, Southeastern, Conference USA,
Mountain West and Western Athletic. All the commissioners have told
the Chronicle they are interested but will take a wait-and-see
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Ippoliti said he thought a successful bowl had to have tie-ins
with two conferences. Houston bowl officials have targeted the Big
12 as an anchor conference because it makes the most geographic
sense.
</P>
<P>
   If the bowl secures a tie-in with the Big 12, it would get the
No. 7 team from the league. The Big 12 supplies one team to the
Bowl Championship Series and teams to five other bowls (Cotton,
Holiday, Alamo, Insight.com and Independence). If the Big 12
supplies two teams to the BCS, then the galleryfurniture.com Bowl
would get the eighth team from the Big 12. The Big 12 has bowl
contracts for two more years, and the Houston bowl wants to
negotiate with the league to get a team higher in the pecking
order, Ippoliti said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Astrodome-based bowl would have gotten Texas
Tech, the Big 12's No. 7 team, which was bowl-qualified but did not
have a spot. In two previous seasons, however, the Big 12 did not
qualify enough teams to supply its current obligations, which
forces the game or games on the bottom of the Big 12's list to look
elsewhere for a team.
</P>
<P>
   A Big 12 official said the league also has been approached by
bowls other than the ones it has contracts with, meaning the
galleryfurniture.com Bowl would have to compete with other cities.
Commissioner Kevin Weiberg was noncommittal toward Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the possibilities but are withholding
comment until after the bowl is certified,'' Weiberg said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Certification is almost a foregone conclusion as long as the
bowl can come up with a $2 million letter of credit, an NCAA
official said. Ippoliti said he has the money from a bank in the
Midwest but declined to name it. He said he is trying to get a
local bank to put up the letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Another conference official said the bowl will have no chance
unless it gives a large payout to each team. The NCAA-mandated
minimum payout is $750,000 per team, which is what the
galleryfurniture.com bowl is guaranteeing in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This financial arrangement we have now secures the payments
(for the galleryfurniture.com Bowl),'' Ippoliti said. ``They (the
Bluebonnet Bowl) weren't financially secured (in the last two games
that were played).''
</P>
<P>
   Ippoliti said plans are to increase the fees given to the teams
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In several years, we hope to pay out more than the Cotton Bowl
in Dallas,'' Ippoliti said.
</P>
<P>
   McIngvale does not consider this action much of a business risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole lot less gamble than I took when I started a
little furniture store on the side of the freeway,'' McIngvale
said. ``Even my wife, Linda, didn't get nervous about this. And she
gets nervous about everything.''

LAKERS ROUT CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For everyone who's ever had an unwelcome roommate,
Tuesday night's scene at Staples Center had to be rewarding. The
Los Angeles Lakers finally met the rowdy young boys from down the
hall _ and promptly served them the NBA's version of an eviction
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a 27-point rout might qualify more as a deportation.
And after a 95-68 Lakers plastering, the Los Angeles Clippers might
just consider fleeing the country to save further embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first meeting of the Lakers and Clippers in their
shared home, and it pretty much made a mockery of any debate about
who's king of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal brutalized Michael Olowokandi. Kobe Bryant
showed up Lamar Odom. And Maurice Taylor, presumably the best power
forward in town, barely showed up at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Clippers pulled a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on us
from last night to tonight,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.
``However I misunderstand a team, I certainly misunderstood this
team. We did some nice things out there defensively, and
offensively I thought we played OK at times, but it wasn't a pretty
game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find a single area the Lakers didn't dominate.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal muscled his way to 21 points and 19 rebounds in an
abbreviated 29-minute stint. Foul-troubled Olowokandi started
slowly but finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Odom didn't end up guarding each other, but Bryant
still sent a clear message to those who contend the Clippers' young
phenom is the best prospect in town. Odom struggled to contain an
ill Glen Rice, and wound up with more fouls (five) than points
(two).
</P>
<P>
   Bryant simply dazzled. He scored 11 consecutive points in a
first-quarter run that established the rout and finished with 18
points.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor never found his way. He hit 1 of 7 field goals and fouled
out early in the fourth quarter with two points and two rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' rough night included 20 turnovers, a three-point
second quarter in which they made 1 of 18 shots and an injury to
forward Brian Skinner (high left-ankle sprain).
</P>
<P>
   Even the Lakers' often-subdued bench beat its counterparts,
29-21, as the Lakers improved to an NBA-best 18-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' first half raised, or perhaps lowered, the bar for
futility. Their 19 points was an all-time NBA low for a half in the
shot-clock era, and their second-quarter total _ three points _ was
one higher than the league record for a low quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Lakers managed to avoid doubling over in laughter,
or pouring it on. After a 20-0 run from the first to the second
quarter, the Lakers had established a 21-point lead, and they set
the engine on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal played just six minutes in the second quarter as the
Lakers downshifted to score 17 points, taking a mere 49-19 lead
into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, battling a lingering illness and Odom, easily beat both in
the first quarter. He played the first eight minutes and hit 3 of 6
shots for seven points as the Lakers took a 32-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rice barely left his house the prior two days, suffering from a
102-degree fever. His first attempt to play came during the
afternoon shootaround, and he felt the effects immediately _ ``My
chest started burning.... It was difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get out there and work really hard, real quick and
see where I was at, and quickly found out it's going to be a long
night,'' he said before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   His words proved prophetic, albeit only for the boys in red.

KINGS ROUTED BY DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was like something out of the Larry
Robinson years, which was fitting since he was behind the bench of
the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Kings now are Andy Murray's team and it will
be interesting to see how they respond to Tuesday's grim 7-1 loss
that was played in front of far less than the announced crowd of
10,807 at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he can say about this one,'' Luc Robitaille
said of Murray. ``He wasn't out there stinking it up. Games like
this used to do us in for awhile. The best part is that we get to
play right away. You don't want one like this to linger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (16-9-6) end their four-game trip tonight against the
improving New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Glen Murray,
who was on the ice for six of the Devils goals Tuesday, will be
there. So will Rob Blake, who returned from his groin strain only
to wish he hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   So will Stephane Fiset, who appeared for the first time in five
weeks and allowed an ugly, bouncing 50-footer by John Madden for a
short-handed goal just when it looked like the Kings might get back
in the game in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But if the first 30 games of Murray's coaching career are any
indication, the bad games have not started a trend.
</P>
<P>
   The team has played five bad games before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   __Oct. 6: Took a 2-1 lead into the final minutes of the third
period against Florida before allowing three goals. Beat Tampa Bay
5-2 the next night.
</P>
<P>
   __Oct. 22: Had a 3-1 lead and a power-play opportunity against
Phoenix before allowing five consecutive goals. Two nights later
beat division rival San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   __Nov. 6: Manhandled by Philadelphia 5-3 but came back to tie
Edmonton and win their next three games.
</P>
<P>
   __Nov. 20: Lost to lowly Montreal 5-3 then beat Northwest
Division-leading Colorado 6-2 in maybe their best game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   __Dec. 4: Gave up two goals in the final three minutes of a 3-3
tie with Tampa. Crushed expansion Atlanta in their next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that has faced adversity well,'' Murray said.
``It just seemed like after the first shift we weren't in it. We
came out well in the second and cut the lead to 3-1, then played
worse. This is a team built on its work ethic. Tonight that wasn't
there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The game got so bad by the end of the second period Murray
listed nine players he would have liked to keep off the ice for the
third. But then he thought they might like that so he sent
everybody out for the end.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who was listless in his first game back from a groin
problem, and Palffy, who looked stiff after missing four games with
a sore lower back, did not play the final five minutes as a medical
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot for the Kings was a second-period goal by
Donald Audette, which beat Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. But
Audette, who was benched for much of the third period Saturday
against Montreal, also was on the ice for four of New Jersey's
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a complete nightmare,'' said Audette's linemate
Glen Murray, who came in with eight goals in his past six games.
``I blame our line for what happened tonight. We just didn't have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray was so upset that his usual postgame talk to the
team was delayed until the Kings returned to its hotel for the
traditional team meal.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of a food fight, which probably would have
made Murray happy. He isn't sure just how upset his team is over
the loss, but sure is glad they have a chance for redemption
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the NFL where you have seven days to lick your
wounds,'' he said. ``The Rangers are getting better and they want
to keep that going. We certainly want this to stop.''

BRYANT'S TRULY THE BOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is not a true story. Kobe Bryant did not swat
a would-be Lamar Odom jumper into the second row Tuesday night,
turn to him, eyes huge, and scream:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get that weak game out of here. Man, you couldn't even play
for my team in Milan!''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, but possible. Bryant is now the only player in the
NBA, or any other known professional sport, to own another team.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is the proud half-owner of Olimpia Milano, the
professional Italian team his father _ Joe ``Jelly Bean'' Bryant _
once played for. Joe is in Italy and will run the team.
</P>
<P>
   This also makes Kobe, who reportedly paid over $1 million for
his 50 percent take, his father's employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the boss,'' he laughed. ``Nah, he tells me what's going
on. We're both very, very excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is the only player trying to win championships at the
same time. Which means he has a better chance of winning
simultaneous titles before the Clippers win one.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Kobe Bryant, the NBA's boy wonder, is now the owner of a
professional basketball team. At age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you hadn't noticed, but things do tend to move a little
differently in his unique world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my career, it seems like everything kinda
happens before you expect it to happen,'' Bryant said. ``The gun
just sort of goes off before anybody expects it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the season in Italy coincides with the NBA's, only
it ends about four months sooner. So the prospect of Bryant
watching his new investment in person is weaker than a Shaquille
O'Neal one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson said he isn't overly
concerned with Bryant's interest wandering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long ways to Milan,'' Jackson said. ``It's not like he
can follow the team. Keeping a hand on is going to be a summer
occupation for him. I think he's probably not going to get involved
with them at that level until he's through playing basketball
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Jackson said he has previously had a player who
owned a team: A Puerto Rican who owned the team he was coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest scorer in Puerto Rican history,'' Jackson said.
``I got fired from that job. I couldn't find an offense to match
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant spent eight years of his youth in Milan, said he would
like to return and raise a family there.
</P>
<P>
   He said after he purchased half the team from Pasquale Caputo,
his father told him Milan residents got plenty excited over the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expected me to show up tomorrow,'' he said. ``Everybody
got all excited, like I was going to come out there and suit up or
something. Slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said there could never be any double playing duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do that,'' he said. ``Jerry (West) would have a
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bryant has already added former Clipper Pooh Richardson to
his 5-8 Milan team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father mentioned it to me and I said, `Can Pooh still run?'
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said it is the unexpected beginning to his branching out
in other businesses. For now, he just plans to enjoy his new
profession, if from a distance. Already, though, he can sound like
an owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it one step at at time,'' he said. ``It's like a
basketball game. You pick and choose players. Then you start
dealing with the agents, and they're a pain in the butt.''

RICE KEEPING HIS COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 and RANDY HILL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 and Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trade rumors involving Glen Rice are again heating
up, but coach Phil Jackson said the Los Angeles Lakers'
sharpshooter has done an admirable job of ignoring the chatter and
focusing on his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Glen. I really congratulated him on keeping
himself as professional as possible during a period of time in
which so much speculation is always on his availability, his being
a part of a trade or situation,'' Jackson said. ``And I thought
he's kept his head in the game, he's kept his mood positive, he
hasn't lost his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't shot as well as I'd like him to shoot. Glen came to
me, simply because he was disappointed that he wasn't playing
better than he felt he should play.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest rumors have Rice being involved in a highly unlikely
trade for overpaid Washington Wizards power forward Juwan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson does think Rice has been a bit distracted by the trade
talk _ he's shooting 41.9 percent _ ``but he's still found a way to
compete and help us play. And I told him I have a lot of respect
for his game, because almost every night he comes out and outplays
the opponent that's at the other side at that position.''
</P>
<P>
   As of today, NBA teams can trade players who signed new
contracts this summer, and deals are expected to begin unfolding
soon as a result. Rice remains a commodity, and as a free agent
next summer, could be available if the Lakers can acquire a
defensive-minded power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We'll) try to improve ourselves if we can,'' Jackson said,
``and we're short big guys obviously. ... Behind Shaq (O'Neal) we
look rather sparse back there, as far as big guys go.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson ailing: Clippers shooting guard Derek Anderson _ who
missed 26 games in his first two NBA seasons as a Cleveland
Cavalier _ has returned to the wounded list. He left the fourth
quarter of Monday's victory over Vancouver with a second-degree
lateral sprain of his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be miss two weeks, a time span that would
cover at least six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys are going to have to step up,'' said teammate
Maurice Taylor of losing the 6-foot-5, 195-pound Anderson, whose
fearless style often works at cross purposes with his thin
physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very high-strung out there,'' Taylor said, ``but I feel
like that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers coach Chris Ford also is fond of Anderson's reckless
approach, but isn't very excited about losing his 17.8 points, 5.4
rebounds and 4.1 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we thought things were going to be OK ...'' Ford
said. ``It could be as long as two weeks; I'm hoping he's a quicker
healer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers do have a precedent for surviving without Anderson.
During the season's first extended road trip, a concussion put him
on the bench for the last three games. The Clippers won two of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it before,'' center Michael Olowokandi said. ``But
we obviously will miss part of his offense and what he does for us
on defense, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandi Man vs. Shaq: Olowokandi's learning curve as a rookie last
season included co-starring in a few poster dunks by Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi entered Tuesday night's time-share showdown averaging
17.5 points and 11.5 rebounds in the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be better equipped to play the game, per se,''
Olowokandi said, addressing his increased level of competence since
last season, ``but I'm not sure I'm better equipped to guard him.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi admitted that because of the strength of the Lakers
powerhouse, O'Neal may be his toughest matchup problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing you can do,'' he said, referring to
available tactics against O'Neal's barge-like post-up game. ``When
you get behind him, daylight just sort of shuts down.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SIX weeks after his arena referendum went down in a bigger ball of
flames than the Hindenburg, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander finally
crawled out of the hidey hole in Florida and returned to his
courtside seat.
</P>
<P>
   One might presume Alexander's exile was spent wallowing in a sea
of self-pity, alternately licking his wounds of rejection and
howling at the moon over the injustice of it all.
</P>
<P>
   But that can't be the case with the Chairman of Clutch City.
After all, isn't this the franchise that carved out its niche in
NBA lore by fighting in the darkest hour? Surely, he has not gone
soft to the point where just one loss makes him take his ball and
go home. Or to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   No, Alexander was certainly waiting for the dawn of the Thomas
Hamilton era, which is big in every way.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first quarter Tuesday night when the partial crowd
for the early-starting cable affair made the quiet scene look and
sound like a glorified Clippers game, Shandon Anderson launched a
22-foot jumper that missed the mark badly and TV color commentator
Calvin Murphy could be heard saying, ``That was a perfect shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the silence of a library, coach Rudy Tomjanovich turned,
smiled and said, ``No, it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening minute of the second quarter, Carlos Rogers was
stymied by the New York defense as the shot clock ran down and had
to let fly with a shot-put heave from 24 feet out. It swished.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our Statue of Liberty play,'' Rudy T said.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this already in the broken season, keeping tabs
on the comings and goings in the front row and trying to stay sane
with gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   The losing streak is four, and at the rate they're going Charles
Barkley might give his Hall of Fame enshrinement speech before
there are signs it's going to get better.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an embarrassing thrashing by the New Jersey Nets _
which is akin to losing a national anthem singing contest to
Roseanne _ Rudy T gave his starting five the kind of noisy, nervy
jolt that was like putting a chihuahua in a paint shaker.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley for Walt Williams, who couldn't hit water if he
were a passenger on the Titanic, was an obvious move. But His
Hugeness Hamilton for the $42 million Kelvin Cato was a shocker.
And surely intended to get a rise out of someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Rudy T said. ``It was all about matchups. I just
felt that Kelvin is a role player and with Patrick Ewing in there
for the Knicks we wanted somebody who could be an inside offensive
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and if you'll swallow that one, then I've got a fat guy in
a red suit who's going to come down your chimney in nine more
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing managed to outduel the inside presence of Hamilton 20-8;
Cato responded to having his fire lit by making one of four shots
and grabbing all of two rebounds in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This was another night of eiderdown-soft defense with the Knicks
shooting 53 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really trying out there,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to say it, then it just doesn't quite ring so true.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there will be plenty more opportunities for trying and
experimenting in the lab by the time Hakeem Olajuwon returns to the
lineup, and maybe not all of them will blow up in the Rockets'
faces.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, before we are so quick to write off the remaining
time between now and late April as just a 59-game tryout camp for a
new-look expansion franchise, maybe somebody could take a quick
look at the Knicks and their supposedly over-the-hill center Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have griped about him, talked behind his back and
moaned that he makes them less of a team, yet are 3-0 since his
return. This is today's NBA, full of punks and poseurs and Latrell
Sprewells with no respect for the past and management types who are
too quick to throw in the towel and start over.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Knicks make the NBA Finals because Ewing was hurt? Or
was it because Miami choked again? Or because Jess Kersey made a
horrendous call that killed Indiana? Or because the Eastern
Conference was easier than Madonna?
</P>
<P>
   Before Ewing came back, the young, athletic Knicks were
struggling to stay above .500. Now, bad wheels and all, he gives
them the presence of a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Which is something to keep in mind when the schemers start
plotting ways to begin life without Olajuwon prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be so easy to do that. Then coaches, players,
everybody gets a free pass, because they wouldn't ever be expected
to win. Just like it is now.
</P>
<P>
   But that wouldn't happen, couldn't happen here. Could it? Not in
Clutch City, where the owner sits front and center and tells us
nobody ever quits.

TWO COACHES LEAVE TROJANS AMID SHAKEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a major shakeup within the USC football
coaching staff, assistants Ken O'Brien and Mike Wilson quit Tuesday
while Hue Jackson was promoted to quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who entered private business, was expected to resign,
but O'Brien's departure was spurred by USC coach Paul Hackett's
decision to remove him as quarterbacks coach in favor of Jackson,
the Trojans' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had been offered the tight ends position by Hackett, but
preferred to coach USC's wide receivers. When Hackett declined to
hire him as wide receivers coach during a meeting Monday night,
O'Brien quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the restructuring of the staff, he wasn't going to coach
the quarterbacks any longer, I think that's the bottom line,''
Hackett said. ``I feel strongly about Ken. I was surprised. The
best thing for him would be tight ends. I'm disappointed because I
had a place for him in the staff. It's a blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two years of (him) coaching quarterbacks, we needed a
change. It's very rough. Obviously, I didn't anticipate this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Cal assistant Dan Ferrigno is a leading
candidate to become the wide receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of O'Brien stunned quarterback Carson Palmer, who
met with Hackett on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and sad,'' Palmer said. ``Anytime you lose a
person like Coach O'Brien it's tough. Anytime there's a coaching
change it's different. The good thing is (Jackson's) a coach I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson coached USC running backs the past two seasons, but has
always wanted to coach quarterbacks, which he did for the Trojans
under John Robinson in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson is the new quarterbacks coach, it was clear
Tuesday that Hackett will also work closely with Palmer, senior
Mike Van Raaphorst and Chatsworth High quarterback Matt Cassel, who
committed last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very, very involved,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett stressed Tuesday that the changes are the result of
USC's 6-6 season, as he searches for ways to improve the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be different,'' Hackett said. ``This season is not
going to be put on Carson Palmer (being injured). We're going to
make waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been expected to resign for at least a week. But
O'Brien had been waiting since the end of the season to hear what
role he would play, and according to sources, forced the meeting
Monday because he was tired of waiting for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wilson nor O'Brien could be reached for comment. Wilson,
40, joined the staff in 1997 while O'Brien, 39, was hired by
Hackett in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett now has three openings to fill: tight ends, wide
receivers and running backs. He fired offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood two weeks ago and replaced him with tight ends coach
Steve Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he hoped to hire a wide receivers coach right away,
and a tight ends coach by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come during a critical recruiting period, when many
high school players are making campus visits. USC has 11
commitments and 11 scholarships remaining.

LAKERS ROUT CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For everyone who's ever endured an unwelcome
roommate, Tuesday night's scene at Staples Center had to be
rewarding. The Los Angeles Lakers finally met the rowdy young boys
from down the hall _ and promptly served them the NBA's version of
an eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this might qualify more as a deportation. The Los
Angeles Clippers might just consider fleeing the country to save
further embarrassment after a record-setting 95-68 loss to their
Staples Center co-tenants.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first meeting of the Lakers and Clippers in their
shared home, and it pretty much made a mockery of any discussion
about who's king of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal brutalized Michael Olowokandi. Kobe Bryant
showed up Lamar Odom. And Maurice Taylor, presumably the best power
forward in town, barely showed up at all.
</P>
<P>
   All that talent, so little production. It left both teams a
little bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played,'' said Taylor, ``like we didn't even know how to
play basketball. It was a horrible performance by all of us. I've
gotten to the point where I think I should be apologizing for the
way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of mea culpa company.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers just missed setting an NBA record for ineptitude by
scoring three points in the second quarter. Their 19-point first
half lowered the bar for futility, setting a new NBA mark for
fewest points since the advent of the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   In other measures of the Clippers' misery, they set Lakers
opponent records for fewest points in a game, worst field-goal
percentage in a half (18.4 percent) and fewest field goals made in
a half (seven). That included a 1-for-18 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lakers forward Glen Rice said, ``I've never seen
anything like that. And I'm sure we won't see that again from them.
I think tonight was just an off night for that team. It's a team
that's very talented, a team that's a dangerous team, and tonight
they just didn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find a single area the Lakers didn't dominate as
they cruised to a 49-19 halftime lead and snoozed through the rest
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal muscled his way to 21 points and 19 rebounds in an
abbreviated 29-minute stint. Foul-troubled Olowokandi started
slowly but finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Odom didn't end up guarding each other, but Bryant
still sent a clear message to those who contend the Clippers' young
phenom is the best prospect in town. Odom struggled to contain the
ill Rice, and wound up with more fouls (five) than points (two).
And Rice, in bed with a 102-degree fever the past two days, played
his best game in weeks, hitting 8 of 11 shots for 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant simply dazzled, scoring 11 straight points in a
first-quarter run that established the rout. He finished with 18
points.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor never found his way. He hit 1 of 7 field goals and fouled
out early in the fourth quarter with two points and two rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Clippers pulled a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde on us
from last night to tonight,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.
``However much I misunderstand a team, I certainly misunderstood
this team. We did some nice things out there defensively, and
offensively I thought we played OK at times, but it wasn't a pretty
game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And a miserable game to play if you were wearing red.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' rough night included an early injury to forward
Brian Skinner (high left-ankle sprain) that left the Clippers
defenseless in the paint. Odom was already nursing a sore right
hip, and Derek Anderson (left ankle sprain) didn't suit up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pitiful sight, but former Clipper and current Laker Ron
Harper had no sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for anyone or anything,'' he said.

SONICS BLOW OUT NUGGETS WITH BIG THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Remember when the Charlotte Hornets came into KeyArena
and impersonated the Harlem Globetrotters, throwing down dunks and
racking up points as if the rims were seven feet high?
</P>
<P>
   That was the Sonics Tuesday night, and the supposedly
much-improved Denver Nuggets were nothing more than the Washington
Generals.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, to understate the Sonics' 109-84 victory would be to
simply say that it was an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton and Ruben Patterson were the stars, but Jelani McCoy
or Vladimir Stepania could have walked off the floor as the heroes.
Both missed free throws in the final two minutes, hurting the
chance for fans to receive free Taco Bell chalupas when the Sonics
score 110 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Jelani and Vladimir, they ought to donate about $5,000
and buy chalupas for everybody,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal joked.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the 11,879 in attendance, the Nuggets were fast
food for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (10-11) was at the end of a road trip in which it played
six games in nine nights. The Nuggets had beaten Milwaukee,
Philadelphia and New York along the way but brought very little
energy to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sonics took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In winning their third straight home game, the Sonics outscored
the Nuggets 63-37 in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had their way with the Nuggets, especially in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 50-40 when the second half began, the Sonics scored 14
consecutive points. Patterson started the run when he converted a
three-point play. Payton then pulled up and dropped in a 3-pointer.
That was followed by a pair of dunks and another layup from
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary always finds me,'' said Patterson, who scored 10 of his
16 points in the third. ``I came out with a lot of energy, and we
said let's put this game away and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans barely made it back to their seats after halftime before
the Sonics led 64-40. Meanwhile, the Sonics harassed the Nuggets
into missing their first seven shots and turning the ball over
three times to start the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had come back a couple of times in the third
quarter from 16 down, so we just knew that we had to keep
pressuring and keep running them,'' Payton said after scoring a
game-high 25 points. ``We did a good job of doing that. They're a
good team. ... We had a lot of rest, so we just came out and played
the way we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   A better hope for the Nuggets would have been to finish the game
with star forward Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess left midway in the third quarter with back spasms and
did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, McDyess exited shortly after shooting a
pair of free throws. This is for sure: McDyess didn't strain his
back at the foul line. After badly missing the first attempt, he
shot an airball on the second.
</P>
<P>
   That trip to the line epitomized Denver's travails in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give us a little credit for coming out and playing
aggressive defense,'' said Sonics cente Horace Grant, who recovered
from a strained knee ligament and started against the Nuggets.
``Once we got them out of (going inside), they couldn't find
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics focused their defense on slowing down McDyess in the
paint after he collected 11 points and 10 rebounds in the first
quarter. At one point, the Sonics trailed 16-6.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics forced the Nuggets outside, their defensive
rotations disrupted Denver's guard play. Nick Van Exel, Ron Mercer
and Chauncey Billups combined for 7-for-32 shooting and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed with them for a while but all of a sudden those guys
started hitting shots out of nowhere,'' Mercer said. ``No excuses,
they gave us a good whipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Garbage time, er, the fourth quarter, began with the Sonics in
front, 85-59. Their biggest lead was 93-61 with 7:43 left in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed one of these,'' Sonics guard Brent Barry said.
``Every now and again we'll take a game like tonight when everybody
gets to play. Unfortunately we can't make the chalupa free throws,
but maybe next time.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The Sonics changed the start time of the Dec. 26 game
against Philadelphia to 5 p.m. The game was originally scheduled
for 12:30 p.m., which conflicts with a 1 p.m. Seattle Seahawks
kickoff that day. The Sonics suffered one of their lowest turnouts
this season on Dec. 5 when they played Charlotte opposite the
Seahawks at 12:30 p.m.

RUSH TOOK CASH FROM AGENT, SOURCES SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Suspended UCLA forward JaRon Rush accepted several
hundred dollars from a Los Angeles-based sports agent that UCLA
believes is Jerome Stanley, according to sources close to Rush.
</P>
<P>
   One source pegged the figure at approximately $300; the other
said it was ``considerably less than five hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's not a large amount in the grand scheme of
agent-related infractions committed by NCAA athletes. Former USC
football player Shawn Walters received $16,000 from an agent in
1995; he was dismissed from the team, then regained his eligibility
via the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a sophomore from Kansas City, Mo., is suspended
indefinitely while UCLA investigates a possible violation of NCAA
rules. UCLA gave no time frame for a resolution, but athletic
director Peter Dalis said Rush won't play Saturday against DePaul
or accompany the team to Hawaii for a three-game tournament next
week.
</P>
<P>
   If Rush accepted improper gifts and/or payments, he could be
suspended and asked to make restitution, or he could have his
eligibility revoked.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is investigating two situations: Rush's relationship with
Stanley, who couldn't be reached for comment but has denied
involvement, and Rush's dealings with former AAU coach Myron
Piggie, who sources said is being investigated by the FBI for fraud
and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Rush testified about Piggie before a grand jury last month in
Kansas City _ and did it without legal representation, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said to tell the truth and everything would be OK,'' Rush
told a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Rush told the grand jury enough about his relationship with
Piggie for the FBI and a U.S. attorney to conclude he might have
violated NCAA rules. They informed UCLA, which suspended Rush last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's brother, Kareem, was declared ineligible by Missouri on
Tuesday while the school examines his relationship with Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source close to Piggie, the FBI and Internal
Revenue Service are investigating what Piggie did with Nike cash
and merchandise intended for his AAU team: did he give it to
players, did he declare it on his income taxes, and did he sell
Nike products, then pocket the cash?
</P>
<P>
   ``Piggie got money from Nike, and he might have given some of
that money to JaRon,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't necessarily a violation of NCAA rules.
Ultimately, Rush's future might hinge on the NCAA's interpretation
of his relationship with Piggie, who knew Rush before he was a
recruitable athlete. A pre-existing relationship could eliminate
application of the NCAA's extra-benefits rule.
</P>
<P>
   There's another factor to be considered: the role of Tom Grant,
who bought Rush a car, paid for his schooling and took Rush on
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is a Kansas booster, but his relationship with Rush was
approved by the NCAA because it began before the recruiting
process.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was also benefactor of Piggie's AAU team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Piggie gave Rush money, how will they determine if it came
from Nike or from Grant?'' the source said. ``If (the NCAA) makes
Rush ineligible because of money he took from Piggie, but they let
him take money from Grant, he might have a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rush, nor Piggie could be reached for comment. Piggie
has also denied involvement.

 BUSH PLANS GRASSROOTS EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, may be arm
wrestling for first place against Sen. John McCain in New
Hampshire.
<P>
   But today in California, Bush is expected to unveil a broad
network of ground troops and volunteers whom he expects to play a
key role in his strategy to carry the state in the March primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, California has been viewed as a place where
grassroots politics takes a second seat,'' said Bush campaign chair
Gerald Parsky in an interview Tuesday. ``We're going to demonstrate
that, with this candidate, we will challenge that conventional
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   With three months to go before the primary, the Bush campaign
says its organizational network is a measure of just how aggressive
it will be. The campaign plans to divide the state into five major
geographic regions, 18 sub-regions and 81 counties and
congressional districts, and then name 115 lieutenants to oversee a
statewide network of 1,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a California face on George Bush's message,'' said Bush
campaign spokeswoman Margita Thompson, who says campaign volunteer
leaders range from mayors to community activists. ``It will help us
create a sustained presence in the state and allow us to build on
the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Texas governor has collected a total of $57 million
in campaign contributions, far outpacing his rivals for the GOP
presidential nomination, including McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The money alone gives Bush a decided advantage in California,
where the cozy retail politics of New Hampshire are likely to be
replaced by an air war in the state's 13 major media markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush himself determined that ``the air game is very
important, but the air game alone in presidential politics in
California won't be enough for a Republican,'' said Parsky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged the widespread belief that organizing in
California could be tough for the Republicans, who suffered
landslide defeats in last year's state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the last election, many people thought we would had hit
rock bottom,'' said Parsky. ``But 99 percent of the credit goes to
the candidate. When he first called me and asked me to do this, he
said he was committed to California and would come often. He really
wanted to make this a full blown campaign here, and he's lived up
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's hardly unusual for political campaigns to make big
projections about the troops on hand for their cause _ failed GOP
gubernatorial hopeful Dan Lungren predicted thousands would toil
for his cause last year _ the Bush campaign's effort already looks
different.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky said the organization is ``unprecedented this early in
the primary season'' _ in part, due to the candidate's early
momentum and astounding success at fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political analysts warn that Bush, despite being
dubbed the presumptive GOP nominee months ago, may need that help,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if he loses to McCain in New Hampshire, Bush will
have to win big in California to have the momentum to carry him
forward,'' said Mark Baldassare, state director of polling for the
Public Policy Institute of California.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush may have money, but ``McCain has assembled quite a
bit of California intelligence,'' signing on respected veteran GOP
political strategist Ken Khachigian and communications director Dan
Schnur, the former spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is inching up here,'' said Baldassare, ``and he will
get a lot of free attention between February and the March 7
primary. (Bush) has got to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And others argue that the Bush organization, by touting its
strengths, is merely engaged in the political equivalent of
chest-pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared. They're articulating a scared philosophy.
They're envisioning people following McCain around California,
saying, `Will the juggernaut be stopped?' '' said one veteran
Democratic strategist. He added pointedly, ``There are no such
things as volunteers in a GOP primary _ unless it's the Christian
Coalition.`
</P>
<P>
   But volunteers involved say that they're confident that the
Texas governor has been farsighted enough to weather any storms in
the campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``His infrastructure is in place. The people in Austin have done
a tremendous job. They haven't publicized it, but the way the
structure is now _ it's for a winner,` said Jim Blair, a San Diego
financial counselor and former marine who worked the White House
detail and has signed on to organize for Bush. ``Momentum will
build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``My phone is ringing off the hook.''

DODGERS ADD NAULTY FOR BULLPEN DEPTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Trying to add quality depth to the bullpen,
the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired right-hander Dan Naulty from the
New York Yankees in exchange for minor-league first baseman Nick
Leach as the winter meetings ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched well for the Yankees and our reports were he can
help us,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``This is
another piece of the plan. We're trying to reach our objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had to move Naulty or lose him after designating him
for assignment last week. It gave them 10 days either trade him,
outright him to the minors or unconditionally release him.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the roster, the Dodgers designated right-hander
Robinson Checo, the principal piece of the ill-fated Dave Mlicki
trade last April, for assignment. Checo was 2-2 with a 10.34 ERA
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Naulty, who made $300,000 last season, was 1-0 with a 4.38 ERA
in 33 games for the Yankees. He has one minor-league option
remaining, and Malone said Naulty would go into spring training
needing to win a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll throw him into the mix,'' Malone said. ``(Yankees
general manager) Brian Cashman didn't want to lose him. It was a
numbers game for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Naulty, 22, attended Cal State Fullerton. He is 5-5 with a 4.54
ERA in four major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, 22, hit .283 with 20 homers and 74 RBI last season at
Single-A Vero Beach, but Dodgers brass didn't think he projected
into a major-league player.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre banter: Malone said the Dodgers may move into the
free-agent market this week and sign a pitcher to aid the bullpen,
but the club will probably wait until a decision is made on third
baseman Adrian Beltre before pursuing any position players.
</P>
<P>
   If the commissioner's office rules Beltre remains the property
of the Dodgers, Malone said the club will map its offseason plan
based on that, even though a grievance from the players union is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only holdup is going to be waiting on Beltre,'' Malone
said. ``If it's a decision where he's still a Dodger, we're going
to move forward based on that. But you always have to be prepared
the best you can, though that's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of a guy: Derrick Hall, former director of media relations
for the Dodgers and morning man for XTRA-AM 1150, was re-hired as
the club's senior vice president of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Hall will oversee the communications and publicity side of the
Dodgers and also have input on player-personnel situations. He will
join the Dodgers on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also hosted ``Dodgers Game Day'' on XTRA, the team's
flagship station, and also worked for Channel 4. He will phase out
his radio and television duties over the next few weeks.

FISET PICKS A POOR TIME TO COME BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Goaltender Stephane Fiset returned
Tuesday after missing five weeks with a deep bone bruise in his
right hand and skated right into the Los Angeles Kings' worst game
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-1 loss to the New Jersey Devils, Fiset took over to start
the second period after Jamie Storr allowed three goals in the
first. He then gave up three more in the second, including a long,
bouncing shot by John Madden that gave the Devils a short-handed
goal and a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the best way to come back, that is for sure,'' Fiset said.
``Things are OK physically and even if they weren't I wouldn't say.
It was just good to return to the ice. That's probably the best
thing you could say about a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray went with Fiset in the second because he
didn't feel like burying Storr, who has played well since Fiset
went down with a hand injury 15 games ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team wasn't playing well for Jamie,'' Murray said. ``Steph
was ready and it was a good time to get him some playing time.
Unfortunately he came back in a awful game.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr will play tonight against the Rangers. But Fiset, who
started 14 of the Kings' first 15 games, is not merely working
himself back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have come back until I was ready to play
everyday,'' said Fiset, who left Continental Airlines Arena with an
ice pack on his right hand. ``Everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster moves: In addition to Fiset, captain Rob Blake and
leading scorer Ziggy Palffy returned. To make room, defenseman Jere
Karalahti and goaltender Marcel Cousineau were sent to minor-league
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti, who signed with the club last summer but was held up
in Finland with visa problems, was recalled Friday and made his NHL
debut Saturday in Montreal. He was teamed with Blake's defensemate
Mattias Norstrom and did not play well.
</P>
<P>
   The move was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Center Jozef Stumpel, who has missed five weeks
after abdominal surgery, has started skating with the Ice Dogs. He
originally was scheduled to make the trip, but the plan was shelved
because of unpredictable practice time. The team played
back-to-back games with two days off in between. The Kings hoped to
have Stumpel back by Christmas.... In addition to Larry Robinson,
who is now a Devils assistant, New Jersey coach Robbie Ftorek
coached the Kings for two seasons from 1987-89. Devils defenseman
Lyle Odelein faced the Kings in the 1993 Stanley Cups Finals when
he played for the Montreal Canadiens.

SCIENTISTS MAP OUT SEISMIC HAZARD LEVELS AROUND THE GLOBE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
After nearly a decade of work, an international team of earthquake
scientists has produced the first estimates of seismic hazard
levels for the entire world.
<P>
   At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union on Tuesday, the
team's leaders unveiled a new global map assessing many of the
better-known danger regions, such as California's San Andreas Fault
and the Big Island of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But the map also incorporates many far more remote and
little-known areas such as the tangle of new nations north of the
Himalayan plateau in south-central Asia where the Soviet Union once
held sway and the dangerous border region between China and Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico Giardini, director of the Swiss Seismological Service
who led the project, and Kaye M. Shedlock, his colleague from the
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the project involved
hundreds of scientists and engineers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was launched by the United Nations 10 years ago as part of
the U.N.-sponsored International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction. The map, with regional close-ups and detailed
descriptions of the hazard levels, is available on the Internet at
http://seismo.ethz.ch/ GSHAP.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, scientists were recruited from virtually every nation
where earthquakes had struck to gather the best estimates of hazard
levels. More than 60 regional workshops estimated the probabilities
for ground shaking in their regions, and those estimates were then
scrutinized by more international experts.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists used a common measurement of ground shaking known
as peak acceleration. It is the same as G-forces that astronauts
use to measure the force of gravity. Astronauts undergo three to
five Gs during blast-off, while even the most powerful earthquakes
seldom exceed a peak acceleration of one G.
</P>
<P>
   The map's estimates of future ground shaking range from ``very
low'' hazards through ``moderate'' and ``high'' to ``very high.''
Most regions of the world's continents have few or no seismic
hazards, but in a small number, dangers are extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   Hazards are high all around the ``ring of fire,'' where volcanic
eruptions and major earthquakes circle the Pacific Rim from the
southern tip of South America through Alaska, eastern Siberia and
down through Japan and the Philippines to New Zealand, the report
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations lie on the edges of great slabs of the Earth's
crust that are constantly in motion _ either sliding past each
other as the Pacific plate and North America do along the San
Andreas or diving under each other in a process called subduction,
which generates the great earthquakes that so frequently ravage
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Earth scientists have long known that for millions of years the
great subcontinent of India has been moving inexorably northward.
Its ponderous motion crushes endlessly against the Asian continent
and thrusts the high Himalayan Mountains ever upward to create
great networks of long and dangerous seismic faults north of those
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It is there that the hazards are among the highest in the world,
according to Giardini and Shedlock. From northern Tibet and
Afghanistan to newly independent nations such as Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, the land is in almost constant upheaval
and major quakes have struck over and over for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   Compiling the hazard estimates, Shedlock noted, has demanded
every technique available, including the most modern scientific
instruments, ancient records maintained in China, and even the
Bible, where the Book of Revelations recalls a ``great earthquake''
that struck a mountain pass called Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those high hazard levels pose major risks to many areas
of the world where building standards are low or nonexistent,
Giardini said, and also to many of the world's ``megacities'' with
huge populations but inadequate building codes.

EXPERTS WARN OF COLLAPSING VOLCANOES  &HT;     BY CARL T. HALL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Even without the risk of an eruption, volcanoes can be deadly for
anybody nearby because of a higher risk of an avalanche or
mudslide, scientists warned Tuesday.
<P>
   Soft spots that could give way almost any time are found on the
steep upper slopes of hundreds of volcanoes, perhaps as many as
2,000 worldwide, experts said at the annual meeting of the American
Geophysical Union.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery eruptions and lava flows may be more ``glamorous'' natural
disasters in the public mind, but increasing scientific interest is
being focused on the threat of collapsing volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have been killed in the dozen or so big
volcanic debris slides, known as lahars, that have been cataloged
during the past century. The worst, at Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia,
killed an estimated 23,000 people in 1985 _ despite advance
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just fantasy,'' said David Zimbelman, a
volcanologist at a consulting firm called G.O. Logic in White
Salmon, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the known hazards, the volcano specialists conceded that
warnings have had little effect, even on people in communities
living directly in the path of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It generally takes a disaster,'' said Robert Watters of the
University of Nevada at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every tall, steep-sided volcanic peak _ including
Mount Shasta in Northern California and several others along the
West Coast _ has some potential to let go, particularly when a
couple of things happen at once, such as an earthquake combined
with a heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now using satellite observations and field study
to take stock of the hazards, although a detailed risk assessment
that takes into account human settlement, as well as geology and
other natural conditions, has yet to be attempted.
</P>
<P>
   The thickly settled areas in the drainage systems of Mount
Rainier in Washington state now loom as by far the biggest
potential disaster waiting to happen in this country, experts say,
with tens of thousands of deaths conceivable in a worst-case
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense _ too late for many areas _ would be strict
zoning laws to keep floodplains clear, or at least populations
sparse, in the most slide-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other protective measures might include audible warning systems
linked to alarms in urban areas and perhaps even draining mountain
reservoirs to form catch basins for cascading debris. Short of all
that, even a simple public education program could be effective if
enough people took the risk seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It often requires only a few minutes warning and a slight climb
in elevation to escape harm, said Michael Sheridan, geologist at
the State University of New York at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in some of the most deadly disasters of the past,
people instinctively headed downhill when they heard the first
rumblings of a rock slide miles away, vainly hoping to outrun tons
of mud and rock capable of attaining speeds in excess of 100 miles
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   People should instead scout around for a small hill, even if
only 150 to 300 feet above the floodplain, they can reach within 15
minutes or a half hour of home or work.
</P>
<P>
   From such a perch, ``You're going to be watching the thing go
by,'' Sheridan said.

 SHOPPERS, IT'S A JINGLE OUT THERE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
AHoliday Mystery: If everyone is doing their holiday shopping on
the Internet, who are all those people in the stores and what are
they doing?
<P>
   Are they all shopping for computers to use for online shopping?
</P>
<P>
   I guess you could shop for a new computer online, too, using
your old computer. But that seems kind of cruel, doesn't it? Like
asking your dying spouse if he or she has any cute friends.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping is unhealthy. In most of us, anger, frustration
and depression build up over the holiday season, and the No. 1
method of relieving all that pent-up hostility is by going
Christmas shopping.
</P>
<P>
   If people deny themselves the outlet of screaming and cursing at
sales clerks, pushing and trampling fellow shoppers and flipping
off fellow motorists, we're going to see a lot of people either
snap or become professional wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   THE MARRIAGE of Albertson's and Lucky has already lost its
electricity, notes Cammy Blackstone, sadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the market sign at the Lakeshore Plaza,'' reports the
Camster, ``some letters are burned out and it now reads `AL E SO
S.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One rumor is that Albertson caught Lucky getting lucky with
Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   IN ONE EAR and out the other:
</P>
<P>
   Karen Nicoletti was shopping (what else?) at the S.F. Shopping
Centre and noticed, near one of the makeup counters, a
well-dressed, thirtyish man cell-phoning. He reached over and
picked up a Q-tip from the counter and went to work on his free
ear, enthusiastically excavating.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, at least he didn't use the tip of his necktie.
</P>
<P>
   And because we all lead busy lives, why doesn't someone invent a
cell phone with a dental floss attachment near the mouthpiece?
</P>
<P>
   CELL BLOCK: At P.J. Mulhern's, the new North Beach restaurant
co-owned by Golden State Warriors' coach P.J. Carlesimo, Rich
Herrera noticed that none of his fellow diners were cell-yakking.
</P>
<P>
   Rich asked co-owner Bob Mulhern, what's the deal? What kind of
place are you running where the customers aren't self-important
enough to be cell-phoning through their meals?
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a cell?'' Mulhern asked. ``Try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera got his out, switched it on ... No dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   The old building is wired in such a way that it blocks out cell
signals. Either that or the place is haunted by a ghost with a
sense of class.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S FUNNY, the reward system in the National Basketball League.
A couple years ago, then-Warrior Latrell Sprewell choked his coach,
the above-mentioned Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sprewell has been found guilty of causing a very
dangerous accident (on the 680 Spreway), whined about the way he
was treated by his new team (N.Y. Knicks), skipped part of training
camp without bothering to call before or apologize after, been
informally accused of jury tampering and been fined for cursing at
fans. He continues to blame Carlesimo for the choking incident.
Upshot: Spree recently got a new contract, $61 million for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo continues to coach the Golden State Sow's Ears. Having
produced no silk purse, he is about to be (or so rumor has it)
fired.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE GOLD Coast, on California, they'll start New Year's Eve
at 8 a.m., toasting the stroke of midnight in Fiji with appropriate
Fijian libations and customs, and whatever satellite TV feed they
can get from that time zone.
</P>
<P>
   And so on, welcoming a new New Year every hour, circling the
globe like barstool-glued Magellans, until 2 a.m. (S.F. time), when
they'll attempt to pronounce ``Aloha'' and wonder why someone is
spinning the globe so damn fast.
</P>
<P>
   PEEL BACK the cold facade of big cyberbiz in Silicon Valley and
what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   No, not a peeled facade. You get a little human compassion.
Dozens of major SilVal execs will haul themselves into court today
and sentence themselves to be warmhearted sons-of-dot.com-guns.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives of the biggest companies will stand before Judge
Leonard Edwards and pledge their major long-term support for the
Y2Kids Initiative, which assists children tangled in the juvenile
dependency court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid is a startup, and they need capital,'' says Guy
Kawasaki of Garage.com, spinning corporatespeak into poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The cybermoney and moral support go to Child Advocates (to
volunteer your cash and/or love: 415-398-8001 or 408-436-6450).
It's an organization based on the principle that if you think you
have a hard time fighting The System, imagine how tough it must be
for a bruised, abused and abandoned 4-year-old.

HAND-HELD COMPUTERS ABLE TO DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a holiday present, for sure, and you've scratched off
enough wrapping paper to determine that it's a handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the planning.
</P>
<P>
   You can enter home and work phone numbers into the device, but
you've got those memorized anyway. Being a sports fan, you're
probably wondering how to really take advantage of the new 3Com
Palm VII, Microsoft's Windows CE or IBM WorkPad personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the really good news. Thanks to the popularity of
these 4- to 6-ounce devices _ Forrester Research predicted 15
million of them to be in use by 2000 _ the capabilities of handheld
computers for Web use are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Content providers for sports abound, but New York-based
FOXSports.com and ESPN.com are the apparent leaders in providing
sports channels for hand-held computer users.
</P>
<P>
   FOXSports.com is the old hand, forging an agreement with
AvantGo, a mobile information company in Mateo, Calif., in June
1998 to facilitate its FOXSports On the Go content. According to
AvantGo, FOXSports.com is accessed the second-most of its 250
content channels. ESPN.com, the Internet's most-visited sports
site, has provided content for its wireless users for a year.
</P>
<P>
   With FOXSports.com's On the Go, handheld users with a
subscription to the service can call up tiny FOXSports.com-produced
pages and surf to headlines and scores. The channels are updated as
soon as the handheld device is synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to expand FOXSports.com's content and package it by
regions in much the way FOX Sports Net does with its broadcasts,
said Danny Greenberg, vice president of FOXSports.com. It fits into
FOXSports.com's strategy of extending its content to mobile phones
and pages and ``all forms of electronics,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com's content is much the same as FOXSports.com and
includes news, scores and standings for major professional and
college leagues, extreme sports and golf.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld devices have other functions for sports fans. They can
be used to play games such as Tiger Woods' PGA Golf Tour. Handheld
device users can access portals sites, such as Hurst-based
GoPDA.com, for news, reviews, message boards and softwares to
download.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld computers are also tearing away at the last line of
defense of Internet detractors who say the medium is fine but it
can't go to the bathroom with them. Of course, handheld computers
have limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Personal digital assistants won't susbstitute for
general-purpose Web surfing, said Jesse Berst, who monitors the
Internet industry on ZDNET.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they'll be used to access specialized Net services
like stock quotes, weather, maps and sports scores,'' Berst said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Greenberg: ``It's not true Internet where you can download
pictures. You can't do much because the screen size is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all about delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   ANTICYBERSQUATTING: The NFL has made one of the first challenges
related to the new Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,
which will fine people who register the domain names of people
without their consent. The league filed a suit last week in U.S.
District Court in New York against an Internet site operator for
extensive unauthorized use of NFL and team trademark names. Ken
Miller of Clearlake Park, Calif., has sites identified under
addresses as NFLtoday.com, NFLtoday.net and NFLtoday.org, which
promote gambling on NFL games. Miller told The Associated Press
that the NFL had offered $270 for the names, and he countered with
$120,000. Quokka Sports also filed a suit on behalf of the New
Zealand America's Cup yachting team because it wants to use the
americascup.com. The address is owned by two New Zealand men. A
temporary injunction has been granted.
</P>
<P>
   NOTEWORTHY: FOXSports.com, which announced its creation of
regional sites to mirror its regional networks last week, plans to
cybercast Saturday's Class 5A (Garland vs. Katy) and Class 4A
(Stephenville vs. Port Neches-Groves) Division II state football
championship games ... NBA.com yesterday launched a multimedia
feature called NBA Decade: The 90s, which highlights the greatest
moments, players and coaches of the past decade ... Dallas-based
Beckett.com has listed its top athletes according to the total
number of sports memorabilia items available. Michael Jordan
slipped from No. 1 to No. 4 in this year's rankings. St. Louis
Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire replaced Jordan has has 7,772 items
available on the sports memorabilia portal. Cowboys running back
Emmitt Smith is sixth (4,581) and quarterback Troy Aikman is 10th
(3,787) ... Quokka Sports (www.quokka.com) plans exclusive live
coverage of a climbing team's three-week ascent of the Mandara
Mountains in Cameroon, Africa. Quokka's online coverage includes
still photography and the athlete's perspective through e-mail and
audio dispatches sent via satellite by the climbers.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),
telescopes missing lenses, ivory dolls, mounted moose heads reeking
of pesticide, space suits lacking gloves, delicate toe bones of Ice
Age mice.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful
day that moves them front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, will never glimpse a paying customer.
Real-estate realities work against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as
relics encroach upon their work space. Here balding grizzly bears
guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISPLACED MENAGERIE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxidermist Tim Bovard must skirt an alligator, a Komodo dragon
and a Galapagos tortoise to reach his office each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County dutifully
adopts donated trophy heads and mounted animals and usually
relegates the pieces to storage.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the animals do a stint in temporary exhibits but,
for the most part, Bovard is their only company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an annual dusting, he rarely gives his roommates a
thought: ``I walk right past them because I see them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CANCELED FLIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center keeps Armory Hall closed to the
public because it's not earthquake-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The vast main hall houses file cabinets, office furniture and
aerospace artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The biplane is a full-scale replica of a 1911 Model B Wright
Flyer, the first aircraft ever contracted by the U.S. government
from Orville and Wilbur Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Other hangers-on include and ultralight aircraft, a 1/10-scale
Titan rocket, an experimental aircraft with a rear propeller and a
full-scale Air Force Agena spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLITARY CONFINEMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This prototype of a Mercury mission training suit, like those
donned by the first U.S. astronauts, was designed by the BF
Goodrich Company.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, California Science Center aerospace curator
Kenneth Phillips trots it out for classes with area schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually let them come up and touch it,'' he says. ``It's
cool and smooth, like it has a metallic coating.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit had a brief brush with fame in 1997, when Tom Hanks'
production company borrowed it for the HBO film ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' And it will see more action in 2001, when it will go on
permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are not authentic Mercury footgear; Phillips plans to
replace them with the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STOREROOM STOOGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backstage lunacy prevails in wax sculptor David Robert
Cellitti's studio at the Natural History Museum, where figures from
exhibits that never came to fruition have taken up permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
   An Aztec shaman schmoozes with Larry, Moe and Curly while Jean
Harlow's headless body slinks in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti budgets two to three months and about $5,000 to craft a
single figure. All flesh-colored parts are poured from a mixture of
beeswax, cerisin and carnauba wax and affixed to fiberglass bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To give Curly his signature near-bald buzz-cut, Cellitti spent
three days implanting human hair into the figure's skull, then
shaved it all off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKROOM BUSTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti doesn't understand why his profession inspires such
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think its mysterious, like Argentinean nuns off in a
cave making this stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces are first shaped from clay, cast as fiberglass prototypes
and poured in wax. Finally, Cellitti decorates them with makeup,
using techniques he practices on smaller fiberglass heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the same process as making a boat,'' the wax
sculptor says. ``Only in the end, I have Jean Harlow, not a
skiff.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKELETAL STALKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is that? A spider monkey? An alley cat?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what they're seeing without the skin,'' says
Natural History Museum taxidermist Tim Bovard.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a bobcat, but it will take about two weeks of
work before that becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard first removes the skin and the underlying muscle, sculpts
clay over the resulting skeleton _ as shown here _ and takes a cast
of his sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fabricates a mannequin, onto which he glues the tanned
hide. the original bones, sans clay, are stored separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level,'' Bovard boasts, ``this is an art.''

   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),
telescopes missing lenses, ivory dolls, mounted moose heads reeking
of pesticide, space suits lacking gloves, delicate toe bones of Ice
Age mice.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful
day that moves them front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, will never glimpse a paying customer.
Real-estate realities work against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as
relics encroach upon their work space. Here balding grizzly bears
guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISPLACED MENAGERIE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxidermist Tim Bovard must skirt an alligator, a Komodo dragon
and a Galapagos tortoise to reach his office each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County dutifully
adopts donated trophy heads and mounted animals and usually
relegates the pieces to storage.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often the animals do a stint in temporary exhibits but,
for the most part, Bovard is their only company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an annual dusting, he rarely gives his roommates a
thought: ``I walk right past them because I see them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CANCELED FLIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center keeps Armory Hall closed to the
public because it's not earthquake-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The vast main hall houses file cabinets, office furniture and
aerospace artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The biplane is a full-scale replica of a 1911 Model B Wright
Flyer, the first aircraft ever contracted by the U.S. government
from Orville and Wilbur Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Other hangers-on include and ultralight aircraft, a 1/10-scale
Titan rocket, an experimental aircraft with a rear propeller and a
full-scale Air Force Agena spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLITARY CONFINEMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This prototype of a Mercury mission training suit, like those
donned by the first U.S. astronauts, was designed by the BF
Goodrich Company.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, California Science Center aerospace curator
Kenneth Phillips trots it out for classes with area schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually let them come up and touch it,'' he says. ``It's
cool and smooth, like it has a metallic coating.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit had a brief brush with fame in 1997, when Tom Hanks'
production company borrowed it for the HBO film ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' And it will see more action in 2001, when it will go on
permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are not authentic Mercury footgear; Phillips plans to
replace them with the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STOREROOM STOOGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backstage lunacy prevails in wax sculptor David Robert
Cellitti's studio at the Natural History Museum, where figures from
exhibits that never came to fruition have taken up permanent
residence.
</P>
<P>
   An Aztec shaman schmoozes with Larry, Moe and Curly while Jean
Harlow's headless body slinks in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti budgets two to three months and about $5,000 to craft a
single figure. All flesh-colored parts are poured from a mixture of
beeswax, cerisin and carnauba wax and affixed to fiberglass bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To give Curly his signature near-bald buzz-cut, Cellitti spent
three days implanting human hair into the figure's skull, then
shaved it all off.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BACKROOM BUSTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellitti doesn't understand why his profession inspires such
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think its mysterious, like Argentinean nuns off in a
cave making this stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces are first shaped from clay, cast as fiberglass prototypes
and poured in wax. Finally, Cellitti decorates them with makeup,
using techniques he practices on smaller fiberglass heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the same process as making a boat,'' the wax
sculptor says. ``Only in the end, I have Jean Harlow, not a
skiff.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKELETAL STALKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is that? A spider monkey? An alley cat?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what they're seeing without the skin,'' says
Natural History Museum taxidermist Tim Bovard.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a bobcat, but it will take about two weeks of
work before that becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard first removes the skin and the underlying muscle, sculpts
clay over the resulting skeleton _ as shown here _ and takes a cast
of his sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fabricates a mannequin, onto which he glues the tanned
hide. the original bones, sans clay, are stored separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the highest level,'' Bovard boasts, ``this is an art.''

<P>
   On Sept. 1, 1970, a 9-month-old boy was brought to a hospital in
Basankusu, a small town in what is now called the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was covered with a horrible rash _ large, painful
pustules that radiated out toward the face and the extremities. It
looked just like smallpox, a virus that had supposedly been all but
eradicated from the face of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in Basankusu took samples, which eventually ended up
in the hands of renowned Soviet virologist Svetlana Marrenikova.
She grew the virus and inoculated it into a rabbit skin, where it
produced a lesion she'd seen before, but never on a human.
</P>
<P>
   This was not smallpox but monkeypox, a disease first identified
in 1958, when it was found spreading among Asian and African
monkeys that had been captured for laboratory research.
</P>
<P>
   Four cases in Liberia soon followed, and other reports of the
disease began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   Because smallpox was so rare, doctors could more easily diagnose
monkeypox, which had apparently infected forest-dwelling Africans
for centuries but was completely unknown to most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smallpox, one of the most virulent and highly contagious
human diseases, monkeypox did not easily spread from person to
person. Most victims were children who had caught and eaten small
animals from the forest, including monkeys, squirrels and rats.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators learned from outbreaks during the next 20
years, African monkeypox, like smallpox, could kill as many as one
out of every 10 persons infected.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Health Organization study carried out from 1981 to
1986, investigators identified 338 monkeypox cases in Zaire (now
the Congo) but concluded that it wasn't a major problem. For one
thing, the disease had relatively few victims in a country haunted
by malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and AIDS. It also did
not spread very quickly and was rarely transmitted through human
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before anyone thought much about the monkeypox
virus changing. New outbreaks of the disease indicate that it could
be breaking free of its natural confines and spreading from person
to person ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, civil unrest engulfed the Congo. A rebel army seized
power and installed Laurent Kabila as head of state. In the
province of Kasai Oriental, forest-dwelling Batetela peoples were
forced to rely more on hunting and gathering for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   The Batetela lived in leaf-roofed huts built on the edge of the
forest. Their children foraged there for squirrels, rats and voles.
When they were lucky, they caught the occasional monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, some of the local children became very ill _
monkeypox again. But this time, a new and troubling characteristic
had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Two traits are crucial to determining the severity of infectious
threats: virulence and transmissibility. The virulence of this
outbreak of monkeypox, the percentage of its victims dying, didn't
seem to be increasing. But transmissibility, how the virus spreads,
was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In previous outbreaks, human contact appeared to have spread
only about one-fourth of the cases of monkeypox. Most cases came
from trapping and skinning an infected animal. Reports from three
separate missions conducted by the World Health Organization over
the past three years indicate that the overwhelming majority _ at
least two-thirds _ of the cases are now originating from
person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 511 cases had been diagnosed since the 1996
outbreak. But the disease continues to spread, and no one can be
certain at what rate, given the state of the war-ravaged Congolese
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately some scientists fear that monkeypox could kill a lot
more people than more horrifying viruses like Ebola or Marburg or
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the emerging diseases that attract media attention _
Ebola, hantavirus and the like _ probably pose little threat of
causing epidemics,'' says evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald of
Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

   Deep in the bellies of two science museums in Los Angeles,
Calif., lurk mountains of treasures full of old tales. They dangle
in darkened warehouses, huddle in basements, chill in industrial
freezers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hidden wonders museum visitors rarely see: trays
of dried butterflies (some tattered, others perfectly intact),
telescopes missing lenses, ivory dolls, mounted moose heads reeking
of pesticide, space suits lacking gloves, delicate toe bones of Ice
Age mice.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts seem to bide their times, waiting for the fanciful
day that moves them front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Most, of course, will never glimpse a paying customer.
Real-estate realities work against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, for example,
has a collection of 33 million items, but only enough space to
display 1 percent of the booty, just the tip of the curatorial
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of this alternative universe has been liberated, on
film at least, by Richard Ross. He recently poked his lens into the
cubbyholes of two museums, recording a realm where staffers toil as
relics encroach upon their work space. Here balding grizzly bears
guard water fountains, miniature suits of armor crowd desktops and
everyone takes this secret world of museum misfits for granted.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 1, 1970, a 9-month-old boy was brought to a hospital in
Basankusu, a small town in what is now called the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was covered with a horrible rash _ large, painful
pustules that radiated out toward the face and the extremities. It
looked just like smallpox, a virus that had supposedly been all but
eradicated from the face of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors in Basankusu took samples, which eventually ended up
in the hands of renowned Soviet virologist Svetlana Marrenikova.
She grew the virus and inoculated it into a rabbit skin, where it
produced a lesion she'd seen before, but never on a human.
</P>
<P>
   This was not smallpox but monkeypox, a disease first identified
in 1958, when it was found spreading among Asian and African
monkeys that had been captured for laboratory research.
</P>
<P>
   Four cases in Liberia soon followed, and other reports of the
disease began trickling in.
</P>
<P>
   Because smallpox was so rare, doctors could more easily diagnose
monkeypox, which had apparently infected forest-dwelling Africans
for centuries but was completely unknown to most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smallpox, one of the most virulent and highly contagious
human diseases, monkeypox did not easily spread from person to
person. Most victims were children who had caught and eaten small
animals from the forest, including monkeys, squirrels and rats.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators learned from outbreaks during the next 20
years, African monkeypox, like smallpox, could kill as many as one
out of every 10 persons infected.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Health Organization study carried out from 1981 to
1986, investigators identified 338 monkeypox cases in Zaire (now
the Congo) but concluded that it wasn't a major problem. For one
thing, the disease had relatively few victims in a country haunted
by malaria, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness and AIDS. It also did
not spread very quickly and was rarely transmitted through human
contact.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before anyone thought much about the monkeypox
virus changing. New outbreaks of the disease indicate that it could
be breaking free of its natural confines and spreading from person
to person ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, civil unrest engulfed the Congo. A rebel army seized
power and installed Laurent Kabila as head of state. In the
province of Kasai Oriental, forest-dwelling Batetela peoples were
forced to rely more on hunting and gathering for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   The Batetela lived in leaf-roofed huts built on the edge of the
forest. Their children foraged there for squirrels, rats and voles.
When they were lucky, they caught the occasional monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, some of the local children became very ill _
monkeypox again. But this time, a new and troubling characteristic
had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Two traits are crucial to determining the severity of infectious
threats: virulence and transmissibility. The virulence of this
outbreak of monkeypox, the percentage of its victims dying, didn't
seem to be increasing. But transmissibility, how the virus spreads,
was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   In previous outbreaks, human contact appeared to have spread
only about one-fourth of the cases of monkeypox. Most cases came
from trapping and skinning an infected animal. Reports from three
separate missions conducted by the World Health Organization over
the past three years indicate that the overwhelming majority _ at
least two-thirds _ of the cases are now originating from
person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 511 cases had been diagnosed since the 1996
outbreak. But the disease continues to spread, and no one can be
certain at what rate, given the state of the war-ravaged Congolese
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately some scientists fear that monkeypox could kill a lot
more people than more horrifying viruses like Ebola or Marburg or
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the emerging diseases that attract media attention _
Ebola, hantavirus and the like _ probably pose little threat of
causing epidemics,'' says evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald of
Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

Amherst College, in Mass. ``They don't have the necessary mix of
virulence and transmission characteristics. Not so with monkeypox.
It causes damaging infections, grows productively in humans, is
transmissible from person to person and is durable in the external
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox, like smallpox, belongs to the family of orthopox
viruses. They are both encoded in DNA, and DNA viruses _ unlike RNA
viruses such as HIV and influenza _ are not noted for their rapid
mutability.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they don't evolve. Under the right
conditions, natural selection may allow survival of those strains
best suited to infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no scientific consensus on whether and how much
monkeypox is changing, John W. Huggins of the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is worried about the
increase in transmissibility. And he's been working on finding a
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was on the third team the World Health Organization sent
out to study the present outbreak in the Congo. The team headed off
to the Congo partly to complete the work of preceding World Health
Organization research teams, collecting serum samples from active
cases of monkeypox and attempting a close study of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they, like their predecessors, could not complete the work
because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins says the samples he gathered reveal two new traits not
present in the monkeypox strain of 1976. The first is syncytia, in
which infected cells tend to fuse together into cells with many
nuclei. He also found differences in monoclonal antibody-binding
patterns, a clue that the strains he found are distinct from the
samples taken in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, says virologist Joseph Esposito of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Huggins' observations don't
tell us whether the disease is growing more transmissible or more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   CDC virologist John Stewart, a member of an expedition to the
Congo in 1997, is not familiar with Huggins' analyses but, like
Esposito, he is not worried about monkeypox: ``I don't think that
our studies show anything to indicate that monkeypox is changing
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the increased incidence of the disease to the
greater vulnerability of a younger, non-vaccinated population:
Smallpox vaccinations, halted in the region in 1982, confer at
least 85 percent immunity to monkeypox, although that immunity
wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from monkeypox is also in dispute. Esposito says
the death rate for those infected in recent outbreaks is much lower
than 10 percent. Huggins insists that there are pockets of
infection where monkeypox is killing 10 percent of those it
infects.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the question of whether monkeypox could become
more virulent.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary tests conducted at the CDC, Huggins found that
cidofovir, a drug originally developed to treat a viral infection
in AIDS patients, appears to inhibit the replication of both
monkeypox and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   All anyone can assume for now is that as long as monkeypox stays
in the rain-forest villages of the Congo or Sierra Leone and
Liberia, where it has also been seen, it won't develop into a major
threat. But all of these areas are war zones. Soldiers, from rebel
and government factions alike, have cut a brutal path through the
infected zone in the Congo. Both soldiers and refugees are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to think about what could happen to monkeypox in
the large, crowded city of Kinshasa.

   Fashion may have been all over the map at the recent spring
shows, but one trend was clear on both sides of the Atlantic: The
Cher-hair revival of the last several seasons has finally started
to lose its grip on our fascination.
</P>
<P>
   (Think of Helen Hunt's extensions at the Academy Awards this
year for a look that's quickly passing its expiration date.)
</P>
<P>
   In its place was a parade of shaggy, homespun hairdos and _ get
this _ bangs. Even Naomi Campbell opted to walk the catwalk with a
modern shag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair has been long and straight for so long that it was just
begging for a new look,'' says Garren, the hair master responsible
for Maggie Rizer's new bleached blond, choppy 'do. ``That haircut
is amazing on her. It really transformed her,'' he says, throwing
the model an admiring glance backstage at the Anna Sui show.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, a new haircut is the easiest way for a restless
model to find her way back into the spotlight. Gamine Trish Goff,
who last season sported one of the most luxurious manes around _
thick, jet black and hovering low beneath her shoulders _ this
season flaunted a shaggy, disheveled haircut that barely grazed her
neck. She looked so startlingly different that photographers
practically tripped over their tripods to get a shot of her.
</P>
<P>
   In Goff's case, the cut's homemade air was authentic: The model
did the snipping herself, albeit under the watchful eye of
hairstylist Rick Haylor.
</P>
<P>
   For mere mortals, the thought of bringing a pair of scissors in
contact with one's own hair might incite a panic attack, but for
seasoned veterans of fashion's smoke and mirrors, it's just a
matter of confident practicality.
</P>
<P>
   Take Stella Tennant's nonchalant explanation for her
self-inflicted crop: ``I know what I like, and I like to be in
control,'' she says with a shrug. Plus, she adds, ``I hate going to
salons.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gordon, the owner of New York's Bumble and bumble salon,
is understandably thrilled over the return of the ``haircut'' and
declares that if he had his way, he'd do away with all long hair.
``A true haircut is much more interesting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, see the cropped look as just a fun diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is a good season for short hair,'' says Orlando Pita
backstage at Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   But Pita says while long tresses have a versatility and a
universal sex appeal, short hair has its limits. ``You can only be
trendy with short hair,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Pita's sentiments is Brazilian bombshell Gisele. Much
has been said about her voluptuous figure, but Gisele's abundant
auburn mane is clearly the icing on her cake. The mere mention of a
new coif causes the model to shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cutting it!'' she gasps, throwing herself a reassuring
look in the mirror backstage at Ralph Lauren. ``I just think women
look more feminine with long hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was hair the shortest it's been since the waif rage of
the early '90s, but many of the styles sported something that
hasn't been seen for a long time: bangs. And editorial hairstylist
Ward couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's homage to this stalwart, however, is an offbeat,
asymmetric version that covers one eye and dips below the ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangs that are cut in the same old way,'' he says, ``just
don't turn heads, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, isn't that what hair's all about?

<P>
   Believe it or not, when Leonardo DiCaprio gets on his soap box
about saving the planet, he's not just blowing hot air. DiCaprio,
along with Cameron Diaz, Aidan Quinn and Alanis Morissette, is
among the socially and environmentally enlightened entertainers who
are putting their money where their conscience is.
</P>
<P>
   They, like many investors, have created portfolios filled with
the stocks of companies with sound environmental policies, fair
employment practices and other traits beyond profit and loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they've discovered that it's possible to do well
while also doing good.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a huge difference by checking to see where
their money is going,'' affirms actress Susan Sarandon, while the
designer Diane Von Furstenberg, who avoids companies dealing in
arms, adds, ``It's a good thing to invest in products and services
that help. That's the elevating side of the American capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Long seen as the purview of the Birkenstock set, such so-called
PC investing has been gaining mainstream acceptance. And now, if
picking stocks isn't your thing, there are certain mutual funds and
indexes that avoid ``sin'' industries such as tobacco, alcohol and
gaming and that screen for ethical concerns like union busting and
workplace discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical investing is taking off in part because the army of
newly minted dot-com millionaires, who were in junior high school
when a greed-is-good philosophy swept over the '80s, don't want to
manage their money the way their parents did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum of unethical behavior swung so far during the
Michael Milken era,'' says Patrick McVeigh of financial management
firm Trillium. ``People are saying, `We don't want to invest that
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   And legal restrictions governing pension funds are no longer an
obstacle since the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration
ruled that selection of socially conscious investments is not
inconsistent with fiduciary standards governing such plans.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most compelling is the fact that the performance of
some PC mutual funds and indexes has been good enough to make evil
capitalists green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outperforming most other funds in our category,
regardless of whether they are socially responsible or not,'' says
Chris Brown, co-portfolio manager of the socially and
environmentally conscious Pax World balance fund, which invests in
stocks, bonds, cash and equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar, the Consumer Reports of the mutual-fund world,
identifies over 60 funds that specifically target social concerns,
including Dreyfus Third Century, Calvert Social Equity, Citizens
Emerging Growth, Green Century Equity, Meyers Sheppard Pride and
Women's Equity Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are many definitions of socially responsible
investing _ and plenty of loopholes and rationales should an
investor wish to include a questionable company in his or her
portfolio. After all, good deeds are no guarantee of good returns _
although performance was more of an issue when people were avoiding
South African investments to protest apartheid and tobacco and
firearms companies were driving the Standard &AMP; Poors 500.
</P>
<P>
   Today, performance and ethics seem more closely interwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the companies that are proactive in doing good are
performing better,'' says Dana Giacchetto, president of Cassandra
Group, the trendy financial management company that counts DiCaprio
and Diaz among its youthful Hollywood clients. ``General Electric
has shed a lot of defense and chemical units, while companies like
Philip Morris have been hurt. There are not a lot of people who
want to start pounding the table about why cigarettes are good for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many ethically enlightened firms are now doing well,
some investors still want to goose their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People put together a portfolio they consider to be socially
or environmentally responsible and enhance their returns by using
futures on the market itself _ S&AMP;P futures,'' says Andrew Malloy, a
partner in Tag Associates, which managed the money of the late Time
Warner chairman Steve Ross. ``To the extent that the market pushes
well ahead of the companies in the portfolio, you have a side door
exposure to the market itself. There are a lot of sneaky ways to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, PC investing offers protesters a voice where it
really counts: in the boardroom. Two cases in point: The Domini
Social Equity Fund has been urging Johnson &AMP; Johnson to improve
standards at its Mexican factories while Trillium believes its
vocal objection to Home Depot's practice of buying timber from old
growth forests persuaded the company to change its position.

   WASHINGTON _ The ``other Mayflower'' set sail from Africa with a
cargo of enslaved Asante villagers about a century after the
original landed on Plymouth Rock. It landed in the colony of
Virginia on July 4, 1719, and most of those aboard were sold to
Robert Carter to work on his tobacco plantation near Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is among the tapestry of tales woven into ``African
Voices'' _ a new permanent exhibition that opens Wednesday at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Six years in the making, the $5.5 million exhibit explores the
culture and history of a continent through films, photographs,
interactive videos, more than 400 artifacts, and the words of
scores of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,500-square-foot exhibition ``demonstrates how African
cultures have spread worldwide, becoming a part of the very fabric
of American life,'' said Robert Fri, director of the museum. It
``encourages people to look beyond the existing stereotypes and
assumptions about Africa and Africans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit aims ``to present the diversity and dynamism of
Africa,'' said Fri, and ``to show how African cultures have spread
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an exhibit explaining the traditional ``mud cloth
pattern'' on paper cups of Peet's Coffee illustrates how ingrained
African culture has become in everyday American life.
</P>
<P>
   Fri said the exhibit is largest cultural display in all the
Smithsonian museums.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of slavery and colonialism are only two of 10 stories
told in the ``History Corridor'' that runs down the center of the
exhibit. The other historical themes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The story of human origins in Africa about 5 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tales of the Egyptian and Nubian civilizations that arose in
the ancient Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ The conquests and rule of African Muslims in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   _ The emergence of independent African nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Africa's struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a changing section on the challenges that Africa faces
today.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are told ``from both rural and urban settings,''
said curator Mary Jo Arnoldi. The exhibitors received input from
Brazil, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Egypt and
South Africa, as well as from experts and institutions within the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``aqual,'' or contemporary portable home for Somali camel
herders. With a framework of arched roots and covering of woven
mats, the structure can be quickly disassembled and carried on a
camel's back. If a Somali marriage ends in divorce, the woman
retains rights to this house and its goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``airplane coffin'' from Ghana made by artist Paa Joe. This
colorful conveyance ``confirms the deceased with the prestige and
mystique of travel,'' the curators wrote. Burial in a winged coffin
``connects the spiritual journey of death with a reminder of a life
well lived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An early 20th century carved wooden door from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   _ An antelope mask made from corn husks and used by the Chewa
people of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contemporary toys and dolls of African children.
</P>
<P>
   At every corner, an African voice speaks out _ sometimes in
narration, sometimes in song, sometimes in a written proverb or
passage. ``When you reach Benin, it is still very far away,'' goes
one saying from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum of Natural History is located at 10th Street
and Constitution Avenue NW and is open daily except Christmas Day
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To Yolanda and Ray Gomez, Sister Gertrude Levy
isn't just a customer at their tailoring shop. She's a guardian
angel.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met the elderly nun a few years ago, when she came in
to have some alterations done. They became friends after a few
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, Ray started having chest pains and other
symptoms of a heart attack. But he was too embarrassed to go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to tell the people at the desk that I had no
insurance,'' he says. ``They make you feel like a bum, like you are
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain worsened over the next three days. And when Sister
Gertrude heard about Ray's condition, she took action: Ray had an
angioplasty and other treatments for his blocked arteries. Today,
he's feeling fine and continues to run the family business.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic modesty, Sister Gertrude refuses to discuss
the help she gave them, or give specifics about the care and
consolation she's provided for thousands of other families during
her 30 years in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But others are happy to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have gone to the hospital,''
Ray Gomez says. ``And if I hadn't gone to the hospital I probably
would have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Gomez now makes all of the nun's skirts free of charge.
In her view, ``Sister Gertrude is the next best thing to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotion to the poor
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude's job is in patient and guest services at Seton
Medical Center. Technically, her hours are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. But she frequently puts in 12-hour days and
is often found at the hospital on weekends visiting the ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job with these people is to see that they are comfortable
and that they are satisfied with their treatment and that their
family is comfortably taken care of while they are visiting,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her job is administering an emergency relief fund for
employees who need money in a crisis. She takes their calls and
decides what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Her work dovetails with the mission of her order, to care for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think working here is fun,'' she says. ``It's a different
kind of fun. I enjoy my job, I enjoy people and so, it's not fun
like a picnic but I enjoy doing what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her institutional knowledge and get-it-done attitude are assets
to patients and their families, friends say. If someone has a
question about what Medicare will cover, if someone is disabled and
has trouble finding transportation to the hospital to visit a sick
relative, if a family doesn't know where to get rehab services,''
she finds the answers,'' says Dianne Schoch, a member of the Seton
Fund Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   While her efficiency is an asset, it's her sense of humor and
warmth that make her such a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Schoch's father was in the hospital two years ago because of a
heart attack, and Sister Gertrude ``visited him and prayed with him
and my mother every day,'' Schoch says.
</P>
<P>
   Liz McDaniel Watson, the wife of Austin Mayor Kirk Watson,
credits Sister Gertrude with helping her family through traumatic
times. When Kirk Watson's mother was dying of lymphoma, and when
Watson was battling testicular cancer, Sister Gertrude was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so happy, bright, she has such joie de vivre,'' Liz
McDaniel Watson says. ``I didn't understand how important that was
until Kirk's mom died. Sister Gertrude came in and was so
comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude, she says, ``is the living embodiment of God's
love.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of Bach and Elvis
</P>
<P>
   But don't go thinking Sister Gertrude is some saintly person
who's dry to be around. She's a mix of contradictions _ a nun who
plays the saxophone and bongo drums, who likes Dick Francis novels,
who had an Elvis impersonator sing at her birthday party. A woman
who ministers to those who are suffering and dying, but who is also
friends with Broadway composer Marvin Hamlisch and former Supremes
singer Mary Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   At Sister Gertrude's 80th birthday party last month, hundreds
gathered to celebrate their favorite member of the Daughters of
Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, the order of nuns to which Sister
Gertrude belongs. There was a cake sent by Wilson, with a note
declaring Sister Gertrude ``an honorary Supreme.'' Guests loved a
video from Hamlisch in which the Tony-winning composer sang two
versions of ``Happy Birthday'' _ one done the way Bach would have
sung it, another in a Mozart style. Gov. George W. Bush sent a
proclamation declaring her ``an honorary Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude first met Wilson and Hamlisch when each was in
town to perform at a Seton gala. It was her job to pick them up at
the airport, but the bond she has formed transcends the usual
chauffeur-passenger relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just my disposition,'' the nun says. ``I just
like people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish nun? he asked
</P>
<P>
   When she first met Hamlisch, who is Jewish, he stared at the
surname on her name tag and asked, ``A Jewish nun?''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude Levy explained that when her Jewish grandfather
married her Catholic grandmother, the Catholic Church required him
to agree that any children from their marriage would be Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my grandfather is very faithful to his promises, so my
father and his brothers and sisters were raised Catholic. So we're
all Catholic,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The second of nine children, she was born and raised in the
French Quarter of New Orleans. She and two of her sisters became
nuns. One of her brothers became a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude joined the order out of high school. After
taking her vows, she earned a bachelor's degree in education,
another in science and a master's degree in counseling. She started
teaching in 1937. Over the next few years, she worked in Alabama,
California, Mississippi and Louisiana, and finally in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, she began working at what was then Seton Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Attal, president of the Seton Fund, remembers when she came
to work. At that time, she was his only employee, he told guests at
her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's been bossing me around ever since,'' he says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Retire? Not yet
</P>
<P>
   At 80, Sister Gertrude's energy is unflagging. Her appointment
book is packed. Every day, there are more people in the waiting or
recovery rooms for her to check on.
</P>
<P>
   Will she ever retire?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not in my plan right now,'' she says. ``I probably will
have to, someday, but I'm not even thinking about it now.''

 &HT;    Please, let the songs escape from my skull
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Nearly every morning I wake up with a song
in my head. Most times it's a song that I can't stand. The other
morning it was ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' _ the version
sung by some screechy-voiced kid, maybe little Michael Jackson. It
took a hot shower, several cups of coffee and an Sausage Egg
McMuffin to drive that rascal out of my skull.
</P>
<P>
   I've even awakened to hear ``Achy, Breaky Heart,'' lumbering
between my ears. Yeech. I consider Billy Ray Cyrus to be the
antichrist of country music. Reminds me of a line from a Chris Wall
tune, lamenting the death of Keith Whitley several years ago:
``Lord, if you'll just send back Keith Whitley, we'll give you
Billy Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apparently I am not alone. An informal survey of
co-workers and acquaintances indicates that just about everybody is
dogged with tunes they can't stand running through their head. For
some, it's radio or television jingles. For others, it's snatches
from nursery rhymes. It's almost always something annoying.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one person I talked to said what first runs
through her head each time the alarm goes off is, ``Ohmigod, it's
morning already.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could make a pretty good country song.
</P>
<P>
   Pondering this, I went to the Internet, figuring there is bound
to be a Web site devoted to people who are tormented by the songs
in their heads. There is at least one Web site for any conceivable
subject in the universe. Finding it is a trick, since Web sites are
added by the bejillions each day. I read somewhere that even the
best search engines can only scan 16 percent of all the sites on
the Web. I consider this a good thing, since any search now
invariably brings up about 17,000 possible sites. If all sites were
being searched that number would increase six-fold.
</P>
<P>
   I have this theory about the World Wide Web. It was created by
the moguls of television and radio, with limited help from the
print media. They sat around one day, worrying about how they were
going to increase their budget numbers the following year. One of
them said, ``Let's use the old, stuffy Internet, long the domain of
universities and the military, to create a new medium on which any
20-year-old can found a company that loses millions of dollars at
the same time its stock value escalates at alarming rates. We'll
make the Web so huge and hard to find stuff that these companies
will have to advertise on television and radio, and in newspapers
and magazines to let people know they're on the Web. Otherwise
they'll never find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Click on the television tonight. Every other
commercial is about a place to buy stuff on the Web. The sites
almost certainly aren't making any money, since it apparently is
illegal to make a profit on the Web unless one specializes in
photos of naked women. But the TV station or network selling the
commercials is making a killing. The price of a 30-second spot at
the next Super Bowl is rumored to be $3 million, which will buy
about 20 shares of your typical dot.com.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after about 15 minutes, I found
songinmyhead(at)listbot.com, which is devoted to people who wish to
complain about melodies in their medulla. The entry page says:
``Join this list if you always have songs buzzing around your head
and you'd like to annoy/amuse other people by sharing them.'' There
are about 300 entries, certainly no indicator of a worldwide
problem but enough to make you wonder:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why would anyone create a Web site devoted to songs in your
head? Does this person have a real job?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Are they selling stock yet?
</P>
<P>
   The only effective cure for exorcising an annoying jingle or
song from my head is to tune to a commercial radio station.
Listening to instrumental or classical music, as I usually do,
won't do the trick. But crank up a Top 40 station with big-haired,
high-pitched rock stars singing something unintelligible, or some
drugstore cowboy crooning about his horse, dog, mama and pickup
truck, and ``I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' magically disappears
from my brain.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then I'm stuck humming ``Bubba Shot the Jukebox,'' or
some such nonsense. At least I'm not alone. The Internet has proven
that.

 &HT;    Some folks got in wrong line for funny bone
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lisa L. Moore, an associate professor in the
English department at the University of Texas, thinks I'm a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's new? Hey, lady, pretend you're at Sears, and take a
number. But I'll bet she doesn't know how to pronounce ``theater.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``thee-ay-ter.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is still honked off about a tongue-in-cheek review I wrote
last summer about an artsy-schmartsy female spoken-word performance
arts piece called The Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge involved 100 women in white clothing sitting in
folding chairs on the Congress Avenue bridge. I made fun of this
show, if you can imagine a straight-arrow such as myself actually
poking fun at the Austin arts community. The show was unique. I
have been to several state fairs and a jalapeno-eating contest, and
I have never seen anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show started with the women, seated in their folding
chairs, making an extended 'Ahhhh' noise in unison, like they were
at the dentist and he had just said, 'Open wide,' '' I pointed out
in my review. ``A bit later the women rose out of their folding
chairs to their feet. They had fierce faces, and they were babbling
loudly and incoherently. All I could figure was somebody back at
the house hadn't taken out the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The part that really seemed to set Moore off was when I opined
that when the performers began laughing ``hah hah hah hah'' during
the performance, they were probably thinking about getting half of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Half of everything _ the oldest divorce joke in the book. A lot
of people, I'll have to admit, got really chapped about this
article. On the other hand, a lot of people thought it was pretty
darned funny.
</P>
<P>
   But one of them wasn't Moore, who didn't exactly slap her
English-teaching knees when she got to that ``hah hah hah hah hah''
part because, as she pointed out, the piece wasn't about men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a celebration of women,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   A celebration of women? Then how come there wasn't a Tupperware
party scene? And if they were celebrating, how come they were
scowling?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to me that you didn't bring up the themes
of the piece,'' Moore told me. Of course I didn't bring up the
themes of the piece. This column is supposed to be funny, and
writing about the themes of the piece would bore the snot out of my
readers, lady.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore wants to think I'm an idiot, that's her business. But
I'll bet if she could, she'd make me write on the blackboard a
thousand times, ``I'll bet you still think you're funny.''
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering why I'm bringing this up. I needed a
way to get yet another cheap plug in for my own performance arts
piece, The Remote, which will involve 100 guys in recliners sitting
on the Congress Avenue bridge, as well as watching football on big
screen TVs.
</P>
<P>
   As you may remember, we were going to hold this deal in
November. But we postponed it, out of respect for Texas A&AMP;M and the
Bonfire tragedy, until next Oct. 14 _ when we will have it in
conjunction with the Texas-Colorado game.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore wants to come and watch, she's welcome. What is it that
tells me she won't be there?

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To Yolanda and Ray Gomez, Sister Gertrude Levy
isn't just a customer at their tailoring shop. She's a guardian
angel.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met the elderly nun a few years ago, when she came in
to have some alterations done. They became friends after a few
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, Ray started having chest pains and other
symptoms of a heart attack. But he was too embarrassed to go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to tell the people at the desk that I had no
insurance,'' he says. ``They make you feel like a bum, like you are
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain worsened over the next three days. And when Sister
Gertrude heard about Ray's condition, she took action: Ray had an
angioplasty and other treatments for his blocked arteries. Today,
he's feeling fine and continues to run the family business.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic modesty, Sister Gertrude refuses to discuss
the help she gave them, or give specifics about the care and
consolation she's provided for thousands of other families during
her 30 years in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But others are happy to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have gone to the hospital,''
Ray Gomez says. ``And if I hadn't gone to the hospital I probably
would have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Gomez now makes all of the nun's skirts free of charge.
In her view, ``Sister Gertrude is the next best thing to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotion to the poor
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude's job is in patient and guest services at Seton
Medical Center. Technically, her hours are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. But she frequently puts in 12-hour days and
is often found at the hospital on weekends visiting the ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job with these people is to see that they are comfortable
and that they are satisfied with their treatment and that their
family is comfortably taken care of while they are visiting,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her job is administering an emergency relief fund for
employees who need money in a crisis. She takes their calls and
decides what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Her work dovetails with the mission of her order, to care for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think working here is fun,'' she says. ``It's a different
kind of fun. I enjoy my job, I enjoy people and so, it's not fun
like a picnic but I enjoy doing what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her institutional knowledge and get-it-done attitude are assets
to patients and their families, friends say. If someone has a
question about what Medicare will cover, if someone is disabled and
has trouble finding transportation to the hospital to visit a sick
relative, if a family doesn't know where to get rehab services,''
she finds the answers,'' says Dianne Schoch, a member of the Seton
Fund Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   While her efficiency is an asset, it's her sense of humor and
warmth that make her such a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Schoch's father was in the hospital two years ago because of a
heart attack, and Sister Gertrude ``visited him and prayed with him
and my mother every day,'' Schoch says.
</P>
<P>
   Liz McDaniel Watson, the wife of Austin Mayor Kirk Watson,
credits Sister Gertrude with helping her family through traumatic
times. When Kirk Watson's mother was dying of lymphoma, and when
Watson was battling testicular cancer, Sister Gertrude was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so happy, bright, she has such joie de vivre,'' Liz
McDaniel Watson says. ``I didn't understand how important that was
until Kirk's mom died. Sister Gertrude came in and was so
comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude, she says, ``is the living embodiment of God's
love.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of Bach and Elvis
</P>
<P>
   But don't go thinking Sister Gertrude is some saintly person
who's dry to be around. She's a mix of contradictions _ a nun who
plays the saxophone and bongo drums, who likes Dick Francis novels,
who had an Elvis impersonator sing at her birthday party. A woman
who ministers to those who are suffering and dying, but who is also
friends with Broadway composer Marvin Hamlisch and former Supremes
singer Mary Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   At Sister Gertrude's 80th birthday party last month, hundreds
gathered to celebrate their favorite member of the Daughters of
Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, the order of nuns to which Sister
Gertrude belongs. There was a cake sent by Wilson, with a note
declaring Sister Gertrude ``an honorary Supreme.'' Guests loved a
video from Hamlisch in which the Tony-winning composer sang two
versions of ``Happy Birthday'' _ one done the way Bach would have
sung it, another in a Mozart style. Gov. George W. Bush sent a
proclamation declaring her ``an honorary Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude first met Wilson and Hamlisch when each was in
town to perform at a Seton gala. It was her job to pick them up at
the airport, but the bond she has formed transcends the usual
chauffeur-passenger relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just my disposition,'' the nun says. ``I just
like people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish nun? he asked
</P>
<P>
   When she first met Hamlisch, who is Jewish, he stared at the
surname on her name tag and asked, ``A Jewish nun?''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude Levy explained that when her Jewish grandfather
married her Catholic grandmother, the Catholic Church required him
to agree that any children from their marriage would be Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my grandfather is very faithful to his promises, so my
father and his brothers and sisters were raised Catholic. So we're
all Catholic,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The second of nine children, she was born and raised in the
French Quarter of New Orleans. She and two of her sisters became
nuns. One of her brothers became a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gertrude joined the order out of high school. After
taking her vows, she earned a bachelor's degree in education,
another in science and a master's degree in counseling. She started
teaching in 1937. Over the next few years, she worked in Alabama,
California, Mississippi and Louisiana, and finally in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, she began working at what was then Seton Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Attal, president of the Seton Fund, remembers when she came
to work. At that time, she was his only employee, he told guests at
her party.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's been bossing me around ever since,'' he says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Retire? Not yet
</P>
<P>
   At 80, Sister Gertrude's energy is unflagging. Her appointment
book is packed. Every day, there are more people in the waiting or
recovery rooms for her to check on.
</P>
<P>
   Will she ever retire?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not in my plan right now,'' she says. ``I probably will
have to, someday, but I'm not even thinking about it now.''

 &HT;    Wonder kids' key to gifts
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My daughter pulled the laminated photo ornament
out of the box of Christmas tree decorations. ``There's baby
Veronica,'' she said, with a fondly nostalgic air, as she peered
through the mists of time _ half a lifetime ago _ at the 1997
photo.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is a time to chart your children's growth, and not
just by way of those picture ornaments they so proudly bring home
from school. You can measure your kids' development from their
Christmas lists.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year Veronica has observed Christmas in its
traditional meaning of rampant consumerism. Oh, sure, in previous
years she has gotten the bit about the sense of wonderment, of the
magical. But good old-fashioned greed, that she was slow to master.
</P>
<P>
   Her lilting requests to Santa didn't get any more specific than
``a doll with brown hair.'' No brand names. I could simply stash
hand-me-down toys in the attic, and she'd be as delighted as if
they came with store tags.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, I asked Veronica what she wanted for
Christmas. ``Some toys to play with!'' she shouted, after careful
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   That was, alas, before her commercial baptism in Saturday
morning cartoons. Veronica watched the ads intently and came to me
with breathless commercial bulletins: ``I want Santa to bring me a
Miss Party Surprise Pony Party. And I want Blue's Clues Play Doh.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking it: My daughter has been reborn as a
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old son, meanwhile, has graduated from toys to fishing
gear. Gone are the Hot Wheels sets and Star Wars paraphernalia that
populated his lists in previous years. Alec still believes in
Santa, I think, unless he is adopting a don't-ask, don't-tell
policy. He seems to believe that Santa does most of his shopping
from the Bass Pro Shop catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   What is the right balance between a bountiful holiday and
Wretched Excess? How much do children need?
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Patricia Duff, ex-wife of billionaire Ronald
Perelman, the answer would be $132,000 a month. That's how much she
demanded in child support for daughter, Caleigh, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Caleigh would be emotionally damaged, Duff argued, by the change
in her lifestyle _ especially if she realized she was living on
less than her half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision last week fairly dripping with scorn, Manhattan
judge Franklin Weissberg refuted Duff's arguments: ``The mother's
argument assumes that only material things matter in the life of a
child, and that if Caleigh is denied any imaginable luxury, she
will be emotionally damaged,'' Weissberg wrote. ``It does not
require a degree in psychiatry to know that this assumption is
rubbish. There are far more important things in the life of a young
child than private jets, yachts, obsequious staffs and pandering
guests.''
</P>
<P>
   How much do children need? Ask them, and the answer will always
be ``More.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend has a 9-year-old who is asking the Big Questions: ``If
Santa is real, that means I can have as many presents as I want,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking on her feet, the mother replied, ``But we pay Santa.''
She winced at the memory. Why doesn't parenthood come with second
takes? ``I should have told her that there's only so much room in
the sleigh.''
</P>
<P>
   She recovered herself in time to add, ``Santa will come if you
believe he will come. And if you tell your sister, he definitely
won't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't need a sleighful of presents or $132,000 a month. But
they do need a sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not be in a hurry to replace visions of sugarplums with
visions of Toys 'R' Us. As long as they can, let them hold on to
Santa, and the doll with the brown hair.

 &HT;    Some advice on giving books as Christmas gifts
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books make the best Christmas (birthday, too, in point of fact)
gifts for a number of good reasons. That is, if the recipient of
your gift can read and, especially if he or she likes to read. And
even if he or she isn't a particularly avid reader, the right book
might turn he or she into just that, and that would make it the
greatest gift of all, since you probably can't give happiness or
lifelong good health.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Which book is the right book to give to that
special, or not so special, person?
</P>
<P>
   No one can make that choice for you, but the following are a few
books discussed here during the year just past that might give you
a little help in making this important choice.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, of course, the age of the giftee has a lot to do with
the choice of a giver's book selection. But there was one that came
out this year that might take care of that special person
regardless of what age he or she might be _ if they are above the
age of Happy Meals, that is. I'm speaking of a book titled
``Holes'' by Louis Sachar (Farrar, Straus and Girouux, $16), which
to my considerable surprise, won the National Book Award for
``young readers.'' I'm no young reader by any stretch of the term,
and I enjoyed this book immensely.
</P>
<P>
   A critic named Marvin Hoffman has written about ``Holes'' that
trying to tell what this book is about is no easy task ``for a
story with as many elements as a fine watch, all arranged to mesh
so precisely as to tell perfect time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recent book that would make a fine Christmas gift
especially for someone who likes folklore told about with
professional and nostalgic skill, there is ``Walter Benjamin at the
Dairy Queen _ Reflections at Sixty and Beyond'' by Pulitzer Prize
winning novelist Larry McMurtry.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry has never been easy to get close to personally; so this
book of essays about his life and times growing up in and around
the small West Texas town of Archer City is about as close as most
people will be able to get to a McMurtry autobiography. It is
fascinating for that and a number of other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another book now on bookstore shelves that should interest
serious readers and thinkers is Barbara Kingsolver's ``Poisonwood
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kingsolver fans, this new one may be something of a
surprise, but, if you stick with it, a pleasant surprise. It isn't
as simple and straightforward as previous Kingsolver stories and is
set in Africa. And this go-round, she uses a style somewhat
Faulknerian with each chapter told by a different character in that
character's words and accents. But, never fear, she is still as
skillful at depicting character as ever and her story, or stories,
are just as mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like their reading material rather light and
strictly for pleasure, there are new Robert B. Parker, Robert K.
Tanenbaum and Jay Brandon novels still on bookstore shelves, as
well as the many older ones that are now in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   The new Parker adventure about Spenser and his pals is called
``Hush Money'' and is definitely up to Parker's usual high level of
entertainment. If your friend or relative is a Spenser fan (or
likely to become one) this would make a dandy gift.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as popular yet, but should be, are the Butch and
Marlene novels by Robert Tanenbaum, former New York City assistant
D.A., whose stories featuring attorneys Butch and Marlene, who also
are married lovers, along with their precocious daughter, Lucy, are
my current favorite light reading.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't sampled one of those yet, don't delay, especially
if you love suspense stories with humor and characters you care
about deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Brandon's new one is called ``Angel of Death'' and is set in
San Antonio, home of the attorney/novelist. It's a good one, too.

 &HT;    Who's afraid of Y2K?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Nearly a year ago, a long-time acquaintance tried
to convince me about the magnitude of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went into business for himself, he worked at IBM. He
knows more about computers than I will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   I should be prepared, he told me, for extensive break-downs in
society right after the midnight hour ushers in a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We might even be hit before midnight on Dec. 31 as the power
grids on the east coast start to collapse due to the inability of
computers to tell the difference between the years 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to know how I was going to prepare for the upcoming
calamities.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers really swing into work during disasters. I guessed
that we would be working extra hard covering all the disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   No, he said, newspapers run on computers. Computers require
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   I had to admit that we needed electricity to put out a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But I reminded him that we live in a profit-oriented capitalist
society. That fact alone will prevent a nationwide calamity due to
an obscure computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many Americans will figure out clever ways to make
money from the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans in private business will move heaven and earth to
keep from losing money on a problem that has a lot of advance
notice.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later a friend said he noticed this man coming out
of the post office with a package. He inquired about the package,
which is not improper in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   The man began to rip open the package, practically breaking his
fingernails in his excitement. Once ripped open, the man showed my
friend the contents. Neat stacks of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   After the banks collapse due to Y2K computer problems, America's
paper money will become worthless. Most Americans not only will
lose the money they have in banks, but in their investments as
well. Americans will be forced to barter for needed supplies. Gold
will become the coin of the realm. That's how he saw it.
</P>
<P>
   As 1999 wore on I heard reports that the man had stockpiled food
and other survival gear. He supposedly was telling doubters to not
come to his house if the bottom falls out of society in 2000. It
would be too late.
</P>
<P>
   There was even one report, perhaps in jest, that the man was
buying up surrounding water districts. Evidently he not only was
going to survive, he also was going to benefit from the upcoming
Y2K collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so ago my friend's wife ran him off for a day while
she escorted people through their house during a holiday home tour.
</P>
<P>
   My friend invited a number of his friends to his little cabin
for a barbecue. Included in the group was his friend, and my
long-time acquaintance, who was preparing for the big Y2K
catastrophe only days away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you find out any more about his Y2K preparations?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, my friend said, the subject never came up. The subject has
gotten to the point that it is similar to someone having an unusual
religion. You simply don't inquire about it, which would be
improper in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is laying in extra supplies, ``just in case.'' She has
extra food, some extra cash and extra prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 2 newspapers, which will come out on time, will carry
round-up stories of all the Y2K foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   I predict there will be no major Y2K breakdowns in U.S. private
businesses. In all, the Y2K computer disaster will be a ho-hum news
story. I think.

 &HT;    Financial services site operator CFN branches out
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online shopping is not just buying books and CDs. An
Atlanta company helps consumers shop for financial products ranging
from life insurance to mutual funds on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CFN sells its services to more than 200 corporate customers that
make the service available on their corporate intranets. The
company has also rolled out a site for individual consumers called
Youdecide.com, available to anyone on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Cathi Raffaeli, 43, has been at the helm of CFN for the past
year, overseeing its expansion into the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an aggregator of aggregators,'' she says. ``We don't
want to be a just a car site or a mortgage site. We want to be the
place you go to organize your financial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is the ideal vehicle to combine the education process
with the buying experience,'' she says. ``We can use the Internet
to gather advice and information and make intelligent decisions. I
remember applying for my first mortgage and wondering if I was
saying some key word that would ruin everything. People do feel
intimidated about asking questions and appearing uneducated. It's
so much easier to ask a digital question than asking a broker.''
</P>
<P>
   CFN launched as a intranet product for corporations and their
employees. ``When I joined the firm a year ago, it was 80 percent
phone-based,'' Raffaeli says. ``Just looking at corporate sector
was limiting, considering the assets we had been collecting. So we
went on a very rapid plan to make a shift to the retail user.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffaeli, who spent several years in executive positions at
Citigroup in New York, says the aggregation of financial products
in one place is something she's thought about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my entire career in financial services working toward
the goal of one-stop shopping, because it saved consumers time. But
the difficulty of it in the old tactile world is that you could
have one-stop shopping but it was with all one brand _ one
insurance company or one bank, for example. Now on the Web you can
have one-stop shopping with many choices. What we offer is the
nation's first digital financial mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit is that the service is very unbiased. We have
providers from all walks of life, and we have no interest in
offering one deal over another.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffaeli says the difference between operating on the corporate
intranet and being on the Web for the public involves some
tinkering to help individuals make better decisions. ``In the
corporate world, people go directly to the purchase, but in retail,
users want more information, so we set about adding all kinds of
information to help them through the processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate site was also revamped to incorporate some of the
tool kits and personalization found on YouDecide. Raffaeli plans to
add more personalization and tools to help users keep track of
their insurance polices, loans and investments.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Capital owns 23 percent of CFN, Atlanta-based
iXL Enterprises the remaining 77 percent. The company is looking
for its next round of funding. So far, YouDecide and its corporate
version have no real competition.
</P>
<P>

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember that the story line of the movie ``Apocalypse
Now'' was taken from the book ``Heart of Darkness.'' I also
remember hearing that the character Col. Kurtz, played by Marlon
Brando, was loosely based on Col. David Hackworth. Can you verify?
</P>
<P>
   A: That rumor continues to make the rounds, two decades after
the 1979 movie was released, but there's nothing to indicate that
it's anything more than a rumor. We found no record that the film's
co-screenwriters, Francis Ford Coppola (who also directed) and John
Milius, ever mentioned that they based the Kurtz character on
Hackworth.
</P>
<P>
   However, an article in the Los Angeles Times in May 1989
reported this, after describing Hackworth's exploits in Vietnam as
a commander of several elite units: ``. . . the young commander
(Hackworth) led a helicopter unit that was later immortalized in
the movie `Apocalypse Now.' '' That article was based on an
interview with Hackworth when he was in Washington, D.C., promoting
his autobiography, ``About Face,'' but Hackworth himself didn't
mention the Kurtz character.
</P>
<P>
   While Hackworth has been described in print as ``one of the more
outrageous figures to emerge from the Vietnam War,'' he had a
noteworthy military career, collecting 78 combat awards and earning
a reputation as one of the Army's most brilliant commanding
officers. That career ended after he appeared on national TV in
June 1971, denouncing America's conduct in the Vietnam War. Within
months, the outspoken colonel retired from the service under a
cloud of criticism and moved to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Atlanta Falcons had gotten into the Super Bowl next
month, would that have been been the first time for a Super Bowl
team to play in its home stadium? Or, as a friend claims, did the
Miami Dolphins do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. No host-city team has ever played in the Super Bowl on
its home field, but two have played at nearby venues. The San
Francisco 49ers played in Super Bowl XIX at Stanford Stadium in
Palo Alto, Calif, and Super Bowl XIV featured the Los Angeles Rams
at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., not Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are movie previews called ``trailers''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The word ``trailer(s)'' is a misnomer, as The Encyclopedia of
Hollywood points out, because they precede feature films rather
than trail them. So it would be better to call them ``previews of
coming attractions.'' Although the derivation is unknown, one
theory is that the advertisements traditionally were shown after
the first film of a double feature _ or, rather, at the beginning
of the second film _ and therefore came to be known as
``trailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the turnover of the Panama Canal used the
word ``gringo.'' What does that mean, and what is its origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The meaning is a foreigner, especially a white North American
or Briton. It's a Spanish or Spanish-American term, usually used
with derogatory connotation, explains the World Dictionary of
Foreign Expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says
many scholars trace the term to the Spanish gringo, ``gibberish,''
a corruption of the Spanish word Griego, ``a Greek.'' By this
theory, gringo would be related to the old saying, ``It's all Greek
to me,'' indicating that the Yankees were strange and unfamiliar in
their ways to the Mexicans who so named them.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation traces to Maj. Samuel Ringgold, a
strategist dreaded by the Mexicans during the Mexican War (1846-48)
before he was killed at the Battle of Palo Alto in 1846. Ringgold's
name, pronounced with a trilled ``r'' and without the last two
letters as it normally would be by a Mexican, then becomes
``gringo.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sen. Edward Kennedy, who spoke at the memorial service Dec. 8
for the firemen killed in Worcester, Mass., read a quote from a
letter his father wrote many years ago to a friend after the death
of a son. Can you print that text?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the words spoken by Kennedy (D-Mass.) as part of
his remarks, which also included his reading of the firemen's poem,
``May They Not Be Forgotten'':
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1958, my father wrote a friend whose son had died. And
since then that letter, read and reread, has helped our family
endure through the difficult times. Fourteen years before, my
oldest brother, Joe, had been killed in World War II, and my dad
referred to that when he wrote his grieving friend:
</P>
<P>
   `When one of your loved ones goes out of your life, you think of
what he might have done with a few more years, and you wonder what
you are going to do with the rest of yours. Then one day, because
there is a world to be lived in, you find yourself a part of it
again, trying to accomplish something _ something that he did not
have time enough to do. And, perhaps, that is the reason for it
all. I hope so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the meaning of the inscriptions on the one-dollar
bill, ``Annuit Coeptis'' and ``Novus Ordo Seclorum''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Annuit Coeptis: ``He (God) has favored our undertakings.''
Novus Ordo Seclorum: ``a new order of the ages.'' The mottoes on
the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States were condensed
by William Barton, designer of the Great Seal, from a line in
Virgil's ``Eclogues.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``brand new''? How does
the word ``brand'' relate to something that is new?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins
explains that ``brand new'' has nothing to do with the brand name
of a product, as some people think. Rather, it's associated with
the word ``brand'' that is cognate with ``fire,'' as in
``firebrand.''
</P>
<P>
   The product described as ``brand new'' therefore would be fresh
from the anvil, or ``fire-new,'' as Shakespeare put it in ``Twelfth
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I enjoyed watching a videotape of the movie ``The
Eddie Duchin Story'' recently. It reminded us that we haven't heard
anything in a long time about Peter Duchin, his son. Is he still
playing the piano?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he is. Gina Andriolo, his spokeswoman in New York,
told Q&AMP;A that Peter Duchin just returned from Italy, where he
played at the ``Save Venice Ball.'' His 1996 best-selling
autobiography, ``Ghost of a Chance,'' is now out in paperback, she
added. And he'll perform New Year's Eve at the Ritz-Carlton Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps glitziest of all, Duchin is featured in this year's
Neiman-Marcus Christmas Book. For $35,000, he will compose an
original piece of music, record it with his orchestra for a CD, and
have lunch with the gift recipient at ``21,'' the famed New York
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 film you saw, starring Tyrone Power and Kim Novak,
tells the story not only of Peter's parents, Eddie Duchin and
socialite Marjorie Oelrichs, but also of their son. It ends with
Peter still quite young, but already demonstrating considerable
keyboard talent.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Peter studied at Yale, where he received his B.A.
in music and French literature, and at the Sorbonne in Paris. After
a two-year tour with the Army, he returned to New York and embarked
on a career that included a lengthy engagement at the St. Regis
Hotel. He also has made more than 26 studio recordings, and has
performed at every presidential inaugural ball since 1961. He
continues to play at weddings and society engagements nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've been trying to figure out the Roman numerals for the
years 1999, 2000, and 2001, and can't agree. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1999: MCMXCIX. 2000: MM. 2001: MMI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When can those of us who applied for the random drawing for
tickets to Super Bowl 2000 in Atlanta expect to hear if we'll be
able to buy them?
</P>
<P>
   A. People will get a telepone call sometime around Dec. 24
advising them that they ``won,'' as a spokesman for the National
Football League put it. The NFL distributes about 500 pairs of
tickets to fans through the drawing. These are the only tickets
made available to the public. The tickets will cost $400 for club
and suite level, $325 for all others. Super Bowl XXXIV will be
played Jan. 30 at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A game show contestant was asked what was used to remove rock
from Mount Rushmore. She said TNT, which was ruled incorrect.
Another contestant said dynamite, which was ruled correct. Aren't
they the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   A: The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scienfic and Technical Terms
explains that the word dynamite is a generic term ``covering a
class of nitroglycerine-sensitized mixtures of carbonaceous
materials (wood, flour, starch) and oxygen-supplying salts, used as
explosives for blasting and mining.''
</P>
<P>
   TNT is an abbreviation for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, defined as
``toxic, flammable, explosive, yellow crystals; soluble in alcohol
and ether, insoluble in water; melts at 81 degrees C; used as an
explosive and chemical intermediate and in photographic
materials.'' So if an explosive other than this specific chemical
mixture had been used at Mount Rushmore, it wouldn't have been TNT.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of funding for the Ricky Ray Relief Act?
The act was passed by Congress last year, but it wasn't funded. It
involved a ``compassionate payment'' by the federal government to
hemophiliacs infected with HIV through the use of contaminated
blood products in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A: On Nov. 29, a $75 million appropriation for the Ricky Ray
Hemophilia Trust Fund was signed into law by President Clinton. The
measure had been approved previously, as you say, by both the House
and the Senate. The funding legislation was included in H.R. 3424,
an omnibus bill that authorizes $390 billion in spending for fiscal
year 2000 (which runs Oct. 1, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund was the only new program funded in the Health and
Human Services Department for fiscal year 2000. The $75 million
appropriation includes $10 million for administrative expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 trust fund legislation requested $750 million in
funding, leaving a balance of $675 million remaining to be funded.
Funding this balance will require additional appropriation(s),
which may come as soon as the midyear (fiscal) budget sessions in
early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I send a donation to the Hillary Rodham Clinton
Senate campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Hillary Rodham Clinton for Senate Committee, 450
7th Ave., Suite 804, New York, NY 10123. Information is available
online at www.hillary2000.org or by calling 212-239-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print an address where we can send contributions to
Rudy Giuliani's campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit card donations can be made online at
www.rudyyes.com/contents/donate or by mailing a check (or credit
card information) to Friends of Giuliani, 250 Broadway North, Suite
2014, New York, NY 10007.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the age at which people can begin receiving full
Social Security retirement benefits is going up. I also know that
the ages will differ according to the year of birth. Can you print
a schedule showing the various years and ages for full retirement?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's all posted at www.ssa.gov, the Social Security
Administration's Web site. But here's the information for those who
aren't online.
</P>
<P>
   The full retirement age is 65 for those born in 1937 or earlier.
Those born in 1938 are eligible for full benefits at 65 and two
months; 1939, 65 and four months; 1940, 65 and six months; 1941, 65
and eight months; 1942, 65 and 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Those born between 1943 and 1954 are eligible for full benefits
at age 66.
</P>
<P>
   Those born in 1955, 66 and two months; 1956, 66 and four months;
1957, 66 and six months; 1958, 66 and eight months; 1959, 66 and 10
months; 1960 and later, 67.
</P>
<P>
   If your full retirement age is older than 65 (that is, you were
born after 1937), you still will be able to take your retirement
benefits at age 62, the Social Security Administration points out.
But the reduction in your benefit amount will be greater than it is
for people retiring now.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. If your full retirement age is 67, the
reduction for starting your benefits at 62 is about 30 percent; at
63, it's about 25 percent; at 64, about 20 percent; at 65, about 13
1/3 percent; and at 66, about 6 2/3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, the agency notes, early retirement will give
you about the same total Social Security benefits over your
lifetime, but in smaller amounts, to take into account the longer
period you will receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On ``Hollywood Squares,'' the question was asked, ``Which
city is located the farthest west?'' The choices were San Diego,
Los Angeles or Reno, Nev. The correct answer was Reno. I've checked
several maps and don't see how that can be. Was the program wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reno is at longitude 119.47 west. Los Angeles is at 118.24
west. San Diego is at 117.10 west. So Reno is indeed farther west
than either California city. Look at a globe, rather than a flat
map, and check the 120-degree longitude, and it will make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The likenesses of presidents on U.S. coins all face to the
left except for Abraham Lincoln on pennies. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mint reports that the direction Lincoln faces on the cent
wasn't mandated, but was simply the choice of the designer.
Lincoln's likeness on the coin is an adaptation of a plaque
executed by portraitist and sculptor Victor David Brenner.
President Theodore Roosevelt, who was impressed with Brenner's
design of the plaque, recommended to the secretary of the Treasury
that this design be placed on a coin to be issued in 1909, the
centennial of Lincoln's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Accounts in different publications have reported on the close
relationship of the late Al Gore Sr. and the late Armand Hammer,
president of Occidental Petroleum Corp. After he left the Senate,
Gore reportedly worked for Occidental. Can you elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   A: This relationship was described recently in The Wall Street
Journal. According to the article, the senior Gore was named by
Hammer to the Occidental Petroleum board of directors after Gore
lost his 1970 Senate re-election bid. He also was named chairman of
an Occidental subsidiary, Island Creek Coal Co., and was paid more
than $500,000 a year for the positions.
</P>
<P>
   As to a ``close relationship,'' The Wall Street Journal listed
many connections and quoted from a 1992 Washington Post article
reporting that Gore Sr. was a partner, with Hammer, in a profitable
cattle breeding business, and that Hammer had provided Gore Sr. an
88-acre farm in Tennessee with rights to mine zinc. The Post
article said Occidental Minerals, an Occidental Petroleum
subsidiary, bought the land in Tennessee in 1972, and within a
year, Gore Sr. had bought the property.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Sr. obviously wasn't Hammer's only politician acquaintance.
The Wall Street Journal, in fact, pointed out that Hammer
``collected politicians.'' A longtime friend of President Ronald
Reagan, Hammer pleaded guilty to charges of making illegal
contributions to President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in
1972 and was sentenced to one year's probation and fined $3,000. He
was pardoned in 1989 by President George Bush. Hammer died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Marianne Gingrich said she's involved in
helping Mission Specialties, which raises money for needy A: The
address: Mission Specialties, 1827 Powers Ferry Road, Building 15,
Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30339. Those wishing to make a contribution
can mail a check, made payable to Mission Specialties; or call
770-916-9029 to have it charged to a credit card.

all. I hope so.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the meaning of the inscriptions on the one-dollar
bill, ``Annuit Coeptis'' and ``Novus Ordo Seclorum''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Annuit Coeptis: ``He (God) has favored our undertakings.''
Novus Ordo Seclorum: ``a new order of the ages.'' The mottoes on
the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States were condensed
by William Barton, designer of the Great Seal, from a line in
Virgil's ``Eclogues.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``brand new''? How does
the word ``brand'' relate to something that is new?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins
explains that ``brand new'' has nothing to do with the brand name
of a product, as some people think. Rather, it's associated with
the word ``brand'' that is cognate with ``fire,'' as in
``firebrand.''
</P>
<P>
   The product described as ``brand new'' therefore would be fresh
from the anvil, or ``fire-new,'' as Shakespeare put it in ``Twelfth
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I enjoyed watching a videotape of the movie ``The
Eddie Duchin Story'' recently. It reminded us that we haven't heard
anything in a long time about Peter Duchin, his son. Is he still
playing the piano?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he is. Gina Andriolo, his spokeswoman in New York,
told Q&AMP;A that Peter Duchin just returned from Italy, where he
played at the ``Save Venice Ball.'' His 1996 best-selling
autobiography, ``Ghost of a Chance,'' is now out in paperback, she
added. And he'll perform New Year's Eve at the Ritz-Carlton Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps glitziest of all, Duchin is featured in this year's
Neiman-Marcus Christmas Book. For $35,000, he will compose an
original piece of music, record it with his orchestra for a CD, and
have lunch with the gift recipient at ``21,'' the famed New York
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 film you saw, starring Tyrone Power and Kim Novak,
tells the story not only of Peter's parents, Eddie Duchin and
socialite Marjorie Oelrichs, but also of their son. It ends with
Peter still quite young, but already demonstrating considerable
keyboard talent.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Peter studied at Yale, where he received his B.A.
in music and French literature, and at the Sorbonne in Paris. After
a two-year tour with the Army, he returned to New York and embarked
on a career that included a lengthy engagement at the St. Regis
Hotel. He also has made more than 26 studio recordings, and has
performed at every presidential inaugural ball since 1961. He
continues to play at weddings and society engagements nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We've been trying to figure out the Roman numerals for the
years 1999, 2000, and 2001, and can't agree. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1999: MCMXCIX. 2000: MM. 2001: MMI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When can those of us who applied for the random drawing for
tickets to Super Bowl 2000 in Atlanta expect to hear if we'll be
able to buy them?
</P>
<P>
   A. People will get a telepone call sometime around Dec. 24
advising them that they ``won,'' as a spokesman for the National
Football League put it. The NFL distributes about 500 pairs of
tickets to fans through the drawing. These are the only tickets
made available to the public. The tickets will cost $400 for club
and suite level, $325 for all others. Super Bowl XXXIV will be
played Jan. 30 at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A game show contestant was asked what was used to remove rock
from Mount Rushmore. She said TNT, which was ruled incorrect.
Another contestant said dynamite, which was ruled correct. Aren't
they the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   A: The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scienfic and Technical Terms
explains that the word dynamite is a generic term ``covering a
class of nitroglycerine-sensitized mixtures of carbonaceous
materials (wood, flour, starch) and oxygen-supplying salts, used as
explosives for blasting and mining.''
</P>
<P>
   TNT is an abbreviation for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, defined as
``toxic, flammable, explosive, yellow crystals; soluble in alcohol
and ether, insoluble in water; melts at 81 degrees C; used as an
explosive and chemical intermediate and in photographic
materials.'' So if an explosive other than this specific chemical
mixture had been used at Mount Rushmore, it wouldn't have been TNT.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of funding for the Ricky Ray Relief Act?
The act was passed by Congress last year, but it wasn't funded. It
involved a ``compassionate payment'' by the federal government to
hemophiliacs infected with HIV through the use of contaminated
blood products in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A: On Nov. 29, a $75 million appropriation for the Ricky Ray
Hemophilia Trust Fund was signed into law by President Clinton. The
measure had been approved previously, as you say, by both the House
and the Senate. The funding legislation was included in H.R. 3424,
an omnibus bill that authorizes $390 billion in spending for fiscal
year 2000 (which runs Oct. 1, 1999, to Sept. 30, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund was the only new program funded in the Health and
Human Services Department for fiscal year 2000. The $75 million
appropriation includes $10 million for administrative expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 trust fund legislation requested $750 million in
funding, leaving a balance of $675 million remaining to be funded.
Funding this balance will require additional appropriation(s),
which may come as soon as the midyear (fiscal) budget sessions in
early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I send a donation to the Hillary Rodham Clinton
Senate campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Hillary Rodham Clinton for Senate Committee, 450
7th Ave., Suite 804, New York, NY 10123. Information is available
online at www.hillary2000.org or by calling 212-239-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print an address where we can send contributions to
Rudy Giuliani's campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit card donations can be made online at
www.rudyyes.com/contents/donate or by mailing a check (or credit
card information) to Friends of Giuliani, 250 Broadway North, Suite
2014, New York, NY 10007.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the age at which people can begin receiving full
Social Security retirement benefits is going up. I also know that
the ages will differ according to the year of birth. Can you print
a schedule showing the various years and ages for full retirement?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's all posted at www.ssa.gov, the Social Security
Administration's Web site. But here's the information for those who
aren't online.
</P>
<P>
   The full retirement age is 65 for those born in 1937 or earlier.
Those born in 1938 are eligible for full benefits at 65 and two
months; 1939, 65 and four months; 1940, 65 and six months; 1941, 65
and eight months; 1942, 65 and 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Those born between 1943 and 1954 are eligible for full benefits
at age 66.
</P>
<P>
   Those born in 1955, 66 and two months; 1956, 66 and four months;
1957, 66 and six months; 1958, 66 and eight months; 1959, 66 and 10
months; 1960 and later, 67.
</P>
<P>
   If your full retirement age is older than 65 (that is, you were
born after 1937), you still will be able to take your retirement
benefits at age 62, the Social Security Administration points out.
But the reduction in your benefit amount will be greater than it is
for people retiring now.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. If your full retirement age is 67, the
reduction for starting your benefits at 62 is about 30 percent; at
63, it's about 25 percent; at 64, about 20 percent; at 65, about 13
1/3 percent; and at 66, about 6 2/3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, the agency notes, early retirement will give
you about the same total Social Security benefits over your
lifetime, but in smaller amounts, to take into account the longer
period you will receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On ``Hollywood Squares,'' the question was asked, ``Which
city is located the farthest west?'' The choices were San Diego,
Los Angeles or Reno, Nev. The correct answer was Reno. I've checked
several maps and don't see how that can be. Was the program wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reno is at longitude 119.47 west. Los Angeles is at 118.24
west. San Diego is at 117.10 west. So Reno is indeed farther west
than either California city. Look at a globe, rather than a flat
map, and check the 120-degree longitude, and it will make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The likenesses of presidents on U.S. coins all face to the
left except for Abraham Lincoln on pennies. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mint reports that the direction Lincoln faces on the cent
wasn't mandated, but was simply the choice of the designer.
Lincoln's likeness on the coin is an adaptation of a plaque
executed by portraitist and sculptor Victor David Brenner.
President Theodore Roosevelt, who was impressed with Brenner's
design of the plaque, recommended to the secretary of the Treasury
that this design be placed on a coin to be issued in 1909, the
centennial of Lincoln's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Accounts in different publications have reported on the close
relationship of the late Al Gore Sr. and the late Armand Hammer,
president of Occidental Petroleum Corp. After he left the Senate,
Gore reportedly worked for Occidental. Can you elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   A: This relationship was described recently in The Wall Street
Journal. According to the article, the senior Gore was named by
Hammer to the Occidental Petroleum board of directors after Gore
lost his 1970 Senate re-election bid. He also was named chairman of
an Occidental subsidiary, Island Creek Coal Co., and was paid more
than $500,000 a year for the positions.
</P>
<P>
   As to a ``close relationship,'' The Wall Street Journal listed
many connections and quoted from a 1992 Washington Post article
reporting that Gore Sr. was a partner, with Hammer, in a profitable
cattle breeding business, and that Hammer had provided Gore Sr. an
88-acre farm in Tennessee with rights to mine zinc. The Post
article said Occidental Minerals, an Occidental Petroleum
subsidiary, bought the land in Tennessee in 1972, and within a
year, Gore Sr. had bought the property.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Sr. obviously wasn't Hammer's only politician acquaintance.
The Wall Street Journal, in fact, pointed out that Hammer
``collected politicians.'' A longtime friend of President Ronald
Reagan, Hammer pleaded guilty to charges of making illegal
contributions to President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in
1972 and was sentenced to one year's probation and fined $3,000. He
was pardoned in 1989 by President George Bush. Hammer died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Marianne Gingrich said she's involved in
helping Mission Specialties, which raises money for needy A: The
address: Mission Specialties, 1827 Powers Ferry Road, Building 15,
Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30339. Those wishing to make a contribution
can mail a check, made payable to Mission Specialties; or call
770-916-9029 to have it charged to a credit card.

 &HT;    Simple cooking, sensible advice
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Art Ginsburg _ Mr. Food _ offers
opinions with little prompting. Here are some of his:
</P>
<P>
   _ On overwhelming success: ``My philosophy is, we're offering
quick, easy, sensible, everyday recipes for the everyday person.
For the busy people. And all of the ingredients we use are off the
grocery shelf. If you can't find it in the common supermarket, I
don't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On health-conscious cooking: ``There are people who ask us to
write recipes for this or that diet restriction. What we found is
that they're paying lip service to it. We thought about doing a
diabetic cookbook, but we're waiting to see the response to our
diabetic cooking shows first. Giving options is the way to go, so
that's what I do _ I tell them you can use low-fat sour cream or
whatever, but I give it as an option and leave it up to them. I
would never endorse any diet _ I'm not a nutritionist.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On his five-minute TV spots: ``Most people who are on TV have
a cooking show. I have a food show. I talk about food. The things
that chefs do are so complicated, most people can't and won't ever
do them. I'm doing things that everyone can do, from the new cook
to the cook who's been doing it for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the nation's weight problem: ``That's the government saying
that (we're overweight and obese). You may look and feel fine 20 or
30 pounds overweight, while someone else may not. For different
people, overweight is relative. Now that they've settled with the
tobacco industry, what else is there to rail against? Food. We've
got to be sensible and real. Everything I do, I hope, is sensible
and real.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``perfection'' cooking: ``I don't like the intimidation of
perfection in food magazines or on TV shows or on a cake box. There
are crumbs on the plate when I make food. The food stylist wants to
clean it up, but I say `No! Leave them!' That's reality. If we have
a crooked cake, leaning to one side or another, or the icing isn't
perfect, that's good. That's how real cooks cook. It's time we got
back to real.''

 &HT;    Life is good for Mr. Food
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ There really are test kitchens in the
Mr. Food studio. So what if Art Ginsburg _ Mr. Food to millions of
TV viewers _ never cooks in them? He could. He's just too busy with
his new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The TV success of Mr. Food has far outstripped his former life
as a caterer and butcher in upstate New York in the 1970s. So now,
cooking is his act _ his segments close with a signature tagline,
``Ooh, it's so good!'' as he mugs for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   He describes recipes, rather than demonstrates them, on
90-second spots that air in 170 stations around the country.
They've been aired in many cities since the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   He gives fast cooking tips and food information instead of
complex how-to's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my viewers are stupid,'' he said. ``Watching
fish fry for 10 minutes is boring. In a minute and a half, I can
give recipes for a whole meal. That's what they want _ they know
how to fry a fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tells them how to choose a fresh fish, what kind of
cabbage to buy for slaw and how to store it, and how to make a
tartar sauce from bottled ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The gray-bearded, 64-plus-year-old _ he's vague about his age _
lives in Fort Lauderdale with his family and has his offices, TV
studio set and test kitchens in an industrial park there. While
talking, he's hunting up an apron and toque (chef's hat) for his
photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The crisp, bright red apron's a sore spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People write in about the clean apron; nobody cooks every day
in a brand-new apron,'' he said, ``but they don't want to see you
wear a dirty one, either. So it's damned if you do, damned if you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no waffling about pleasing his viewers, however. His
cookbooks are top sellers on QVC; he gets millions of pieces of fan
mail each year and he says his corporation is solidly in the black
(he won't reveal company worth).
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg says it's because he knows exactly what cooks want and
how to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convenience is the No. 1 concern of cooks today,'' he said.
``Price and value are still important, but everybody is too busy to
cook and they want to do it faster, easier, with fewer ingredients.
They don't want to have to shop at four different stores to get the
ingredients, either.''
</P>
<P>
   So all of Mr. Food's recipes are ``quick, easy and sensible.''
He uses only ingredients available at major supermarkets. While
other chefs hide labels and boxes or cans if they use them, he
stacks them all on the counter as he gives the recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reality. I do sensible home cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Recipes for cakes begin with cake mixes, and breads are made
with pop-open tubes of dough _ a direct contrast to the elaborate
techniques presented on most TV cooking shows or in magazines. Home
cooks love to see those things, but never do them, he said.
``They're intimidated by those perfect-looking foods that take
hours to do. That's why we show our mistakes. I have to fight with
my food stylist about that, but we show homemade-looking foods.''
Crooked cakes happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him,'' said David Pantone. ``The majority of the
people the majority of the time have a limited amount of time to
get dinner together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for what he does, Mr. Food does it very well. It's a
recipe; he doesn't plug a lesson into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg's down-home personality makes his fans comfortable.
They trust him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he's just launched the At Home with Mr. Food
home parties. Set up like the Tupperware system of home selling,
Ginsburg's food props and utensils are offered to cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got so many requests for things I used on the show _
knives, cookie jars _ we figured it was a natural.'' He tests all
the products before they're allowed in the catalog. ``They know I
won't sell something I wouldn't use.''
</P>
<P>
   He began the parties this summer in South Florida; they're now
in all the markets where he airs. The catalog features the cooking
tools and dishes, cookbooks, gadgets and Mr. Food spice blends that
appear on his segments. His easy recipes are included.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious that he knows fine food and cooking. Hundreds
of cookbooks from around the world line his office and hallway
walls. He keeps a staff of researchers busy helping develop menus
and recipes for the 28 cookbooks and monthly magazine, Mr. Food's
Easy Cooking.
</P>
<P>
   All of his recipes are tested several times in the test
kitchens. His company, Ginsburg Enterprises Inc., is also
responsible for testing contest recipes for magazines such as
Southern Living, and for creating recipes with his name on them for
organizations such as the American Cheese Board.
</P>
<P>
   All this, yet his name seldom comes up when successful chefs are
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, he says, he's not a chef, and doesn't do a
cooking show. ``I do a food show, and I'm entertaining at the same
time. It's about food and products and how to use them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His fans rush him in airports, and line up for hours for
autographs when he appears at state fairs. They want the Death by
Chocolate recipe that's become the most requested in his
repertoire. He, of course, features the trifle bowl to build it in,
in his home-party catalog. ``It's a big seller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Party hostesses get a bonus if he's in their town _ he'll show
up at a party as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing it.'' Schmoozing with fans satisfies his latent
acting career, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theater was where he was headed before he hit the food circuit.
``I was a bit player, struggling actor as it were, and couldn't
make it. When I entered catering, it was the first time in my life
I was paying the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   He no longer has time for acting, but, he said, ``I'm getting my
jollies in theater and food at the same time with the show. Life is
very, very good.''

 &HT;    Show to recall band leader Kyser's life
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ He is an American icon who was born and
raised in Rocky Mount. His memory might have slipped through the
cracks of history, but with the help of his daughter, it will soon
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Mortarboard Productions, in association with the North Carolina
Museum of Art Foundation, will produce ``Kay Kyser - A Life in
Motion.'' It will document the life of Kyser from his days as head
cheerleader at UNC Chapel Hill through more than two decades as one
of the nation's most successful entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser was a big band leader. He hosted NBC's ``College of
Musical Knowledge.'' And he appeared in 11 motion pictures, seven
of which he starred in.
</P>
<P>
   He performed shows for U.S. troops during World War II - more
shows than anyone in history, including Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many viewers, `Kay Kyser - A Life in Motion' will be their
history. It will be a reliving of their own experiences,'' said his
daughter Kimberly Kyser, during a telephone interview from her
office in Chapel Hill. Kimberly also is executive producer of
Mortarboard Productions. ``For younger audiences, it will be a
discovery of their parents' and grandparents' histories, an
opportunity to learn about the world that shaped their future more
than 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of his career, in 1951, Kyser walked away from fame
and fortune. Out of the national spotlight, his ideas, energy and
inspiration resulted in the formation of major institutions that
are an integral part of life in North Carolina history. Starting
Memorial Hospital at UNC Chapel Hill and bringing public television
to the state were among the many retirement projects Kyser launched
from his home in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Although a biographical documentary film, ``Kay Kyser - A Life
in Motion'' is about more than the life of one man, his daughter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the uncovering of a lost saga of an American experience,
a personal pilgrimage, a unique individual's living of a very
public and private life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bright story that intersects two dark moments in
American history, the Great Depression and World War II. Kyser
played an important role in both, but especially in World War II -
not with speeches or with guns, but with music.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser was a public figure for most of his life, and there is a
wealth of information to tell his story. Recordings provide core
documentation of his music. There are hundreds of radio programs,
11 major motion pictures, U.S. Armed Services film footage and
audio recordings of the many shows performed for the troops, still
photography, taped television appearances and rare home videos.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kyser was co-founder of UNC-TV, his daughter feels it's
only fitting that one of the many goals of the project is to
benefit the institution he helped create. Mortarboard Productions
intends to use the film to raise money for public television by
giving the right to broadcast the film and sell videos in North
Carolina to UNC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The film is expected to be complete by year-end 2000.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ My daughter pulled the laminated
photo ornament out of the box of Christmas tree decorations.
``There's baby Veronica,'' she said, with a fondly nostalgic air,
as she peered through the mists of time _ half a lifetime ago _ at
the 1997 photo. Christmas is a time to chart your children's
growth, and not just by way of those picture ornaments they so
proudly bring home from school. You can measure your kids'

   KELSO-COLUMN _ From my review of ``The Bridge'' earlier this
year _ the ``celebration of women'' that closed down Congress
Avenue in Austin, Texas. . . ``The show started with the women,
seated in their folding chairs, making an extended 'Ahhhh' noise in
unison, like they were at the dentist and he had just said, 'Open
wide,' '' I pointed out in my review. ``A bit later the women rose
out of their folding chairs to their feet. They had fierce faces,
and they were babbling loudly and incoherently. All I could figure
was somebody back at the house hadn't taken out the trash.'' The
part that really seemed to set Lisa L. Moore off was when I opined
that when the performers began laughing ``hah hah hah hah'' during
the performance, they were probably thinking about getting half of
everything. ``It was a celebration of women,'' Moore said. A
celebration of women? Then how come there wasn't a Tupperware party
scene? And if they were celebrating, how come they were scowling?

   AUSTIN, Texas _ To Yolanda and Ray Gomez, Sister Gertrude Levy
isn't just a customer at their tailoring shop. She's a guardian
angel. The couple met the elderly nun a few years ago, when she
came in to have some alterations done. They became friends after a
few visits. Some time later, Ray started having chest pains and
other symptoms of a heart attack. But he was too embarrassed to go
to a hospital. ``I didn't want to tell the people at the desk that
I had no insurance,'' he says. ``They make you feel like a bum,
like you are worthless.'' The pain worsened over the next three
days. And when Sister Gertrude heard about Ray's condition, she
took action: Ray had an angioplasty and other treatments for his
blocked arteries. Today, he's feeling fine and continues to run the
family business. With characteristic modesty, Sister Gertrude
refuses to discuss the help she gave them, or give specifics about
the care and consolation she's provided for thousands of other
families during her 30 years in Austin. But others are happy to
talk. ``If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have gone to the
hospital,'' Ray Gomez says. ``And if I hadn't gone to the hospital
I probably would have died.'' Yolanda Gomez now makes all of the
nun's skirts free of charge. In her view, ``Sister Gertrude is the
next best thing to God.'' (Santos, Austin American-Statesman)

begins next month. By DAN LYNCH.

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
rt the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin training on the
equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up and running no
later than Dec. 30. The center also has a certain public relations
mission. ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and
Russia to show the rest of the world that former Cold War
adversaries can come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security reasons,
the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain, the heart
of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet underneath
the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. In an assessment last year
of Russia's potential Y2K problems, the Pentagon singled out for
particular concern the Russian early warning system designed to
detect incoming missiles. But even before Y2K worries took hold,
U.S. officials were worried about the capability of Russia's
missile defense system. In 1995, Russia initially interpreted the
launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S.
nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear
briefcase'' in the first stages of preparation to launch a
retaliatory strike before the Russian armed forces realized its
mistake. eal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year. Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the
Air Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining
U.S. missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers. ``We've checked them,
we've rechecked them. They're ready,'' Warren said.  &UR; --- &QL;  &LR;  (Eric

   CHANGERS OF OUR WORLD _ Not a week passes that most of us do not
encounter some attempt by the media to determine the most important
person, group or event of the 20th century, writes columnist Bill
Maxwell. ``While studying change in the 20th century, I realized,
obviously, that change has been the most important phenomenon
throughout history,'' he writes. ``Which group, then, has been
responsible for the world's most significant changes?'' His answer:
Young people. In this timely commentary, Maxwell offers a selection
of extraordinary individuals from several epochs who, while still
in their youth, contributed to the evolution of society.

   AMERICA'S WAR OF HYPOCRISY. Twenty years ago, columnist James
Garcia and his girlfriend were decorating their Christmas tree in a
rented farmhouse in rural Indiana when they heard a knock at the
door. It was the police. Garcia was arrested for selling five grams
of cocaine to a friend-turned-police-informant and went to prison.
``I tell you all this because I want to talk about the hypocrisy of
America's `War on Drugs,''' Garcia writes. ``Over the course of the
past 20 years I have concluded that the government's escalating
battle to keep people from consuming illegal drugs has been a
miserable failure.'' Why? For one thing, America's ``War on Drugs''
demonizes an activity that our society also glorifies. ``Alcohol is
a drug,'' Garcia writes. '' ... Sell someone a beer and they'll
make a television sitcom glorifying your profession. Remember
`Cheers'? But sell someone a joint and you'll go to prison.''

   PUERTO RICO: THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. From the New World's oldest
Spanish landmarks to water sports, natural attractions, luxury
accommodations, delicious dining and nightlife in the best Latin
tradition, Puerto Rico offers an exciting vacation choice for
Hispanic executives, writes Barbara Beckley in this feature from
Hispanic Business. For history buffs, the capital city of San Juan
is the story of Spain in the New World from beginning to end _ from
Christopher Columbus' landfall in 1493 through 1898, when Spain's
flag came down at the end of the Spanish-American War. Beckley
lists must-see tourist sights as well as the most popular nighttime
haunts. One color slide of The Castillo de San Cristobal, which is
mentioned in the story, is available electronically.

<P>
   EDUCATION NEEDED TO COMBAT ILLEGAL USE OF PEYOTE. Columnist
Karen Lincoln Michel is a member of the Native American Church of
Wisconsin. As part of her religious belief, she uses the peyote
cactus _ classified as a hallucinogenic drug in this country _ in
the manner that Catholics use sacramental wine. Mainstream America
misunderstands this way of worship. But there is another kind of
disregard toward Michel's beliefs. This time it is Native-Americans
themselves who are the perpetrators. Nonbelievers, mainly Navajo
teens, reportedly have been using peyote in the way some people
take recreational drugs. Many church leaders and their followers
blame themselves for failing to educate their own people about the
significance of peyote as a holy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   THE TROUBLE WITH STEREOTYPING. Columnist Akilah Monifa discuses
the race-based tipping incident that occurred on Oct. 23 in the
Thai Toni restaurant in Miami. An African-American couple had a
15-percent gratuity added to their bill, while a white couple did
not. The only posted notice of automatic gratuity applied to
parties of five or more. When the couple inquired about the bill,
the owner, Hiromi ``Toni'' Takarada, said it was added because
``blacks don't tip well.'' Bob Butterworth, Florida's attorney
general, filed a lawsuit against Takarada, which was settled for a
$15,000 fine. Takarada also agreed to sensitivity training for
himself and his staff. ``This was a case of differential treatment.
And for all who do not like the so-called `race card' being played,
I would query them as to what they think the reason was for the
differential treatment,'' Monifa writes.

   CHANGERS OF OUR WORLD _ Not a week passes that most of us do not
encounter some attempt by the media to determine the most important
person, group or event of the 20th century, writes columnist Bill
Maxwell. ``While studying change in the 20th century, I realized,
obviously, that change has been the most important phenomenon
throughout history,'' he writes. ``Which group, then, has been
responsible for the world's most significant changes?'' His answer:
Young people. In this timely commentary, Maxwell offers a selection
of extraordinary individuals from several epochs who, while still
in their youth, contributed to the evolution of society.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S WAR OF HYPOCRISY. Twenty years ago, columnist James
Garcia and his girlfriend were decorating their Christmas tree in a
rented farmhouse in rural Indiana when they heard a knock at the
door. It was the police. Garcia was arrested for selling five grams
of cocaine to a friend-turned-police-informant and went to prison.
``I tell you all this because I want to talk about the hypocrisy of
America's `War on Drugs,''' Garcia writes. ``Over the course of the
past 20 years I have concluded that the government's escalating
battle to keep people from consuming illegal drugs has been a
miserable failure.'' Why? For one thing, America's ``War on Drugs''
demonizes an activity that our society also glorifies. ``Alcohol is
a drug,'' Garcia writes. '' ... Sell someone a beer and they'll
make a television sitcom glorifying your profession. Remember
`Cheers'? But sell someone a joint and you'll go to prison.''

   PUERTO RICO: THE COMPLETE PACKAGE. From the New World's oldest
Spanish landmarks to water sports, natural attractions, luxury
accommodations, delicious dining and nightlife in the best Latin
tradition, Puerto Rico offers an exciting vacation choice for
Hispanic executives, writes Barbara Beckley in this feature from
Hispanic Business. For history buffs, the capital city of San Juan
is the story of Spain in the New World from beginning to end _ from
Christopher Columbus' landfall in 1493 through 1898, when Spain's
flag came down at the end of the Spanish-American War. Beckley
lists must-see tourist sights as well as the most popular nighttime
haunts. One color slide of The Castillo de San Cristobal, which is

<P>
   EDUCATION NEEDED TO COMBAT ILLEGAL USE OF PEYOTE. Columnist
Karen Lincoln Michel is a member of the Native American Church of
Wisconsin. As part of her religious belief, she uses the peyote
cactus _ classified as a hallucinogenic drug in this country _ in
the manner that Catholics use sacramental wine. Mainstream America
misunderstands this way of worship. But there is another kind of
disregard toward Michel's beliefs. This time it is Native-Americans
themselves who are the perpetrators. Nonbelievers, mainly Navajo
teens, reportedly have been using peyote in the way some people
take recreational drugs. Many church leaders and their followers
blame themselves for failing to educate their own people about the
significance of peyote as a holy medicine.

<P>
   THE TROUBLE WITH STEREOTYPING. Columnist Akilah Monifa discuses
the race-based tipping incident that occurred on Oct. 23 in the
Thai Toni restaurant in Miami. An African-American couple had a
15-percent gratuity added to their bill, while a white couple did
not. The only posted notice of automatic gratuity applied to
parties of five or more. When the couple inquired about the bill,
the owner, Hiromi ``Toni'' Takarada, said it was added because
``blacks don't tip well.'' Bob Butterworth, Florida's attorney
general, filed a lawsuit against Takarada, which was settled for a
$15,000 fine. Takarada also agreed to sensitivity training for
himself and his staff. ``This was a case of differential treatment.
And for all who do not like the so-called `race card' being played,
I would query them as to what they think the reason was for the
differential treatment,'' Monifa writes.

 &HT;    Go around the world for Christmas feast
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the joy and good will that mark the spirit of Christmas
are the same the world over, the traditions and foods of holiday
feasts vary widely from country to country. In many regions, the
rituals and foods of Christmas are deeply embedded in the culture
and have their roots in centuries past.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, on the other hand, tend to invent their own style of
celebration, taking inspiration from anywhere and everywhere. We
are known to mix family favorites that go back generations with
anything that's new and different via the latest decree from Martha
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   While turkey, ham and roast beef are popular centerpieces for
the Christmas table, the American melting pot more often produces
an eclectic mix of holiday cuisines that varies from family to
family, neighborhood to neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian side of one family would expect nothing more than
fish on Christmas Eve, while the Polish cousins who may set an
extra place for the Holy Spirit will delight in almond soup,
pickled herring, sauerkraut and mushrooms. The neighbors from
Mexico will likely celebrate with Bacalao Vizcaina, a dry cod in
tomato sauce with potatoes, while the Russians across the street
will be feasting on suckling pig stuffed with buckwheat porridge,
pickled onions and cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   To learn how the world celebrates Christmas is to enrich your
own celebration. If you want to add an international touch to your
holiday table, a quick sleigh ride on the Internet can yield a
tantalizing array of ideas you may want to integrate into your own
family's tradition. Many sites also give fascinating information on
the origins of some Christmas traditions that you may have observed
for years _ like hanging stockings, drinking eggnog and sending
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you will find something from the country of your
forebears that can become part of your family's holiday at
</P>
<P>
   www.bconnex.net/(tilde)mbuchana/realms/christmas/. Click on
``Christmas Traditions Around the World'' and you'll find a list of
the Christmas rituals and foods of nearly 50 places, from Armenia
to Wales. Spend a bit of time here and you will surely pick up some
inspiration and learn something you didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Greece, you will find loaves of christopsomo
(Christ bread) at the Christmas table. It is made in various shapes
and the crusts are engraved and decorated in some way that reflects
the family's profession.
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever wonder about the origin of the candy cane? At the
same site, click on ``Origins of Christmas Traditions'' and find
out that the ubiquitous candy was invented by a candymaker in
Indiana who incorporated into the candy several symbols for the
birth, ministry and death of Jesus Christ. The shape, for example,
represents the letter J and a shepherd's staff.
</P>
<P>
   And what about holly? Teutonic peoples decorated with holly,
which stays green even in the bitter cold of winter. In England,
the prickly holly is called ``he'' and the nonprickly ``she.''
Which type of holly is first brought into the house at
Christmastime determines who will rule the household through the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar site with additional countries is ``Santa's Favorites:
From North Pole to Down Under'' at www.santas.net and navigate to
Christmas around the world. Here you will find a lovely tradition
observed in Finland and other Scandinavian countries, in which a
sheaf of grain is tied to a tree for the birds. Many people refrain
from eating until the birds have had their own Christmas dinner.
</P>

   Preparation time: 35 minutes Cooking time: about 2 hours
Standing time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Plum Pudding, which is neither a pudding nor does it contain any
plums, has been a Christmas mainstay in Britain for centuries.
Originally it was called hackin because of its many ingredients
(sometimes reaching two dozen) that are finely chopped and folded
into a batter. It was given a more festive name in the 17th century
and made famous worldwide in Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas
Carol.'' Laced with rum or brandy, it is sometimes set aflame and
is always served with great ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Shortening for the mold
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) butter or margarine at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup apple cider or apple juice
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded carrot
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup candied cherries, halved, or currants
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped candied pineapple, or currants
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   Brandied Cider Sauce:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup apple cider or apple juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy or apple juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease a 1 1/2-quart steamed pudding mold or casserole
dish. In a medium-size bowl, stir together the flour, orange rind,
cinnamon, baking powder, ginger and cloves. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium, cream the
brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy, scraping side of
bowl often. Add the egg whites and beat well. Using a wooden spoon,
stir in 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 of the apple cider.
Repeat, then stir in the remaining flour mixture. Stir in the
raisins, carrot, cherries, pineapple and pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared mold. Cover mold with
foil; tie foil in place with string.
</P>
<P>
   Place mold on rack in a Dutch oven. Pour boiling water into the
Dutch oven until the water is halfway up the side of the mold.
Steam, covered, over low heat for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Place mold upright on a wire rack and let stand for 10 minutes.
Using a narrow metal spatula, loosen side of plum pudding from the
mold, then invert the pudding onto a serving plate. Serve warm with
Brandied Cider Sauce; top with vanilla ice cream if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Or, cover and refrigerate the pudding for up to a week. To
reheat, steam again for 1 hour or until heated through.
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce: In a small saucepan, whisk together 3/4 cup apple
cider or apple juice, brown sugar and cornstarch. Bring to a boil
over moderate heat, whisking constantly. Cook for 2 minutes or
until the mixture is thickened, whisking constantly. Stir in brandy
(or apple juice) and butter or margarine.

 &HT;    A recipe for gift giving
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few Christmas gifts endure 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   I have one. There, in the honored position in my cookbook
cabinet (top shelf, first on the left). It has been treasured since
I received it in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   We started whining on Christmas Eve, my brothers and I. To the
point Mammaw broke down and said, ``OK, you can choose one present
to open tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew exactly which one.
</P>
<P>
   There were bigger, shinier presents there for me. But one flat,
square package hidden behind the tree had caught my eye. So I
tunneled through to retrieve it, and then tore the paper off in two
seconds flat.
</P>
<P>
   For a few long moments I gazed at the bright yellow cover with
the boy in a chef's hat triumphantly holding up a chocolate cake
while a red-ribboned girl with a hamburger in her hand looked on.
Their little brother had his hands on the frosting spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then I cracked open ``Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls
Cookbook,'' first to read the inscription from my mother, and then
to absorb this most unexpected gift page by page.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the hamburgers with the funny faces on the buns (made
with olives). I marveled at the pancakes ``branded'' with initials
and giggled at the bunny salad (pears for bodies, slivered almonds
for ears, cottage cheese mounds for tails). I couldn't wait to get
into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, I spent countless hours following the
recipes from this book, starting with scrambled eggs and working my
way up to the pumpkin-shaped Halloween cake.
</P>
<P>
   I've packed the book with me to seven different cities. It has
survived everything from grease splatters to floodwaters. It now
requires careful handling (and tape on the binder), but just last
year I retrieved it to bake the enchanted castle cake for a
3-year-old's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas, if you are looking for a gift that will endear
and endure, give a cookbook. What else can instruct, enrich and
entertain while helping to meet a most basic need (to eat)? Even
those who look rather than cook will enjoy the inspiration for
indulgent fantasies (ummmm, look at that chocolate mousse tart with
hazelnut cream).
</P>
<P>
   And the choices have never been greater.
</P>
<P>
   Are you buying for a young professional who's just moved into
his or her first apartment? Give them Marion Cunningham's
``Learning to Cook'' (Alfred A. Knopf, $29.95) to help them master
the basics. For those with a green thumb, Smith &AMP; Hawken's ``The
Gardeners' Community Cookbook'' (Workman, $19.95) shares recipes
from gardeners across the country.

 &HT;    Figgy Pudding is a sure sign it's Christmas
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Margarett Kinton of Roswell, Ga., lost her recipe for
Figgy Pudding and wrote hoping for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters it wouldn't be Christmas without a steamed
pudding, even though they can be time-consuming to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   We were interested, then, to see that Rick Rodgers included a
lighter pudding in his new cookbook, ``Christmas 101'' (Broadway
Books, $15). Called Figgy Pudding Noel, it substitutes melted
butter for lard and goes together quickly. Like all steamed
puddings, however, it does require long stovetop steaming _ in this
case 2 hours. But even that can help bring welcome holiday warmth
on a cold, damp day.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers says that if you want to flambe the pudding with
additional brandy or cognac before serving, use apple juice to soak
the figs or the pudding will be too ``spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Figgy Pudding Noel
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a 1 1/2- to 2-quart covered tube pudding mold,
don't worry. We tested this in a 2-quart flameproof earthenware
bowl that fit on a rack in a large covered stockpot for steaming.
We covered the bowl tightly with a double layer of aluminum foil
and it came out perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Butter and flour, for preparing the mold
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups fine, dry, freshly ground bread crumbs (about 12
slices sturdy, stale sandwich bread, crusts trimmed)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (about 8 ounces) finely chopped dried figs, preferably
Calimyrna
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cognac, brandy, liqueur (such as Triple Sec) or
apple juice
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter the inside of a 1 1/2- to 2-quart covered tube
steamed pudding mold. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, moisten the bread crumbs with the milk. In a
small bowl, combine the figs and cognac. Let both mixtures stand
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, melted butter, baking
powder and salt until well-combined. Stir in the soaked crumbs and
the soaked figs. Pour the batter into the prepared mold and cover
with the lid or aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Place a collapsible metal steamer or a rack in a large covered
kettle. Add enough water to come just beneath the steamer or rack
and bring to a full boil over high heat. Place the mold on the
steamer or rack and cover tightly. Reduce the heat to low. Simmer,
adding more boiling water as needed to keep a good head of steam,
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 2
hours. Let the pudding stand for 5 minutes while making the
topping.
</P>
<P>
   For the topping: In a chilled medium bowl, using a hand-held
electric mixer at high speed, beat the cream, confectioners' sugar
and vanilla until stiff. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Run a sharp knife around the inside of the mold to
release the pudding. Unmold the pudding onto a platter. Slice and
serve warm with a dollop of the whipped cream.

 &HT;    `By the book' never tasted so sumptuous
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the stockings have been hung by the chimney with care but the
Christmas menu is still up in the air, we've got some ideas for
you. From the cheese puffs to the truffles, each bite is a delight.
We found fancy French green beans and a down-home ham from the
South. Scalloped potatoes, wild rice salad and a traditional corn
pudding round out the buffet. It's a feast for friends and family
on such a special day.
</P>

   French Cheese Puffs
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 dozen Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy, these are considered the perfect hors d'oeuvre, and
we think they'll keep the crowd happy until the Christmas feast is
ready. Notes: Make sure eggs are large, not extra-large. And while
I made this the old-fashioned way, with a wooden spoon, I've been
given assurances a hand mixer would be fine for blending in the
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, cut in pieces
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk, divided
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese, divided
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine butter, 1/2 cup milk and
1/2 cup water in medium saucepan over high heat. Season generously
with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and, when butter has melted,
remove pan from heat. Add flour all at once and stir vigorously
with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a thick dough and pulls
away from the sides of the pan, 1 to 2 minutes. Return pan to heat
for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Let dough cool to room temperature, then beat in eggs, one at a
time, making sure each egg is completely incorporated into mixture
and dough is smooth after each addition. Dough should be thick,
shiny and smooth. Add 1 cup of the cheese and beat in until
well-combined.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon teaspoon-size mounds of dough on nonstick baking sheets,
leaving about 1 inch between them. Brush tops with remaining 1/4
cup milk, then sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake one
tray at a time in lower third of oven until puffs have doubled in
size and are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room
temperature. _ From: ``Saveur Cooks Authentic French'' (Chronicle

   Sure, there are plenty of places where you can pick up a fully
baked glazed ham that's ready to eat. But it's also easy _ and much
more econmomical _ to bake it yourself. And with this sherry-spiked
brown sugar-mustard glaze, the taste is sensational _ perfect for
the holiday buffet table. This makes a ton of glaze, but it's so
tasty you won't mind having the extras (it wouldn't be bad poured
over cream cheese to serve with crackers, either).
</P>
<P>
   1 10- to 12-pound whole or half bone-in ham, fully cooked or
partially cooked
</P>
<P>
   About 1 1/2 cups prepared mustard (we used Dijon)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sherry
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Rub the surface of the ham with
about 1/4 cup of the prepared mustard. Cover the ham with foil and
place it in a roasting pan. Bake for 20 minutes per pound (or until
internal temperature reaches 140 degrees for fully baked, or
155-160 degrees for partially baked).
</P>
<P>
   One hour before ham is done, remove it from the oven. Cover the
ham again with a light coating of mustard, about 1/4 cup, and
sprinkle with ground cloves. Combine 1 cup each prepared mustard,
brown sugar and sherry in a small bowl. Baste the ham with the
mustard mixture and cover with foil. Continue baking for 30
minutes. Remove foil, baste with sauce and dripping in the pan and
continue to bake, uncovered, until done. Let stand 10-15 minutes
before carving. (Leftover sauce may be placed in a gravy boat and
passed separately.) _ Adapted from ``A Gracious Plenty''

<P>
   Marinated Beef Tenderloin
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   Marinating time: 2-4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A beef tenderloin always impresses. It is an indulgence, as it's
more expensive than a turkey or ham. The marinade here produces
succulent and delicious slices. If you'd like to save time, have
the butcher do the trimming. Our tester said that would cut
preparation time in half.
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-pound) beef tenderloin, untrimmed
</P>
<P>
   For the marinade:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup hearty red wine, such as zinfandel
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest and juice of 1 large orange
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed under a knife
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly milled black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Drain beef, rinse under cold running water and pat dry with
paper towels. (Do not be concerned about any odor _ it will
dissipate in a minute or so.) Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife,
trim away any fat, including the large lump at the wide end, and
discard. Pull and cut away the long, thin ``chain'' muscle that
runs the length of the tenderloin. (If you wish, trim away the fat
from the chain and reserve the meat for another use.)
</P>
<P>
   Following the natural muscle separation, cut away the large clod
of meat at the wide end and reserve for another use. At one end of
the meat, make an incision under the silver sinew covering the
meat. Slip the knife under the sinew, and pull and trim it away.
Work lengthwise down the tenderloin until it is completely free of
sinew and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the thin ends of the meat underneath so the tenderloin is
the same thickness throughout its length, and tie with kitchen
string. Tie the roast crosswise at 2- to 3-inch intervals.
</P>
<P>
   To make the marinade: Whisk wine, zest, juice, soy sauce, 1/3
cup oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, thyme and peppercorns in a
large bowl to combine. Immerse the tenderloin in the marinade.
Cover and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for at least 2 hours
and up to 4 hours. Drain the tenderloin and let stand at room
temperature for 1 hour before roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425
degrees. Rub the tenderloin with 1 tablespoon oil and season with
the salt and pepper. Place in a large roasting pan (no need to use
a roasting rack). Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted
in the center of the roast reads 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare
(the internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise about
10 degrees outside the oven), about 35 minutes. If serving hot, let
stand for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. For a buffet, cool at
least 30 minutes, then carve and serve within 2 hours. Or cool
completely, wrap tightly in foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days
before carving and serving at room temperature. _ From: ``Christmas
101'' by Rick Rodgers (Broadway Books, $15)

   Here's a special presentation for green beans we borrowed from
``Cafe Boulud Cookbook'' (Scribner, $35). You can cook the beans
ahead of time, then wrap them in the strips of bacon. Just before
serving give them a quick saute.
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces haricots verts or wax beans, tipped
</P>
<P>
   2 slices bacon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to the boil, plunge the
beans into the water and cook just until they are tender, 3 to 5
minutes. Drain the beans in a colander and immediately run them
under very cold water to cool and set their color. When the beans
are cool, dry them well between layers of paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each piece of bacon crosswise in half and place the pieces
between sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat tenderizer or the
bottom of a pot, pound the bacon gently to flatten and thin it (the
way you would veal scaloppine). Cut each of the pieces of bacon
crosswise in half again.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the beans into 8 packets. Working with one packet and one
piece of bacon at a time, lay the bacon out flat on a work surface,
place a bundle of beans close to one end of the bacon, sprinkle
with white pepper and roll up the bacon tightly around the beans.
When the bacon is wrapped tightly, you usually won't need to secure
the bundle with a toothpick. But if the bundles look a little
shaky, run a toothpick through each piece of bacon to hold it fast.
Warm the olive oil in a large saute pan or skillet over medium-low
heat. When the oil is hot, slip the bundles into the pan. Cook the
packets slowly, just until the bacon is crisp, without allowing the
beans to color.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, carefully lift the bundles out of the pan and serve
immediately, placing 2 bundles on each dinner plate or piling up a
pyramid of the bundles on a platter to serve family-style.

   These rich, crusty-topped potatoes are absolutely heavenly _ a
perfect accompaniment for any holiday meat dish. Do heed Julia's
advice to use the butter if you forgo the cream.
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 cups milk, or mixed milk and cream, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boiling potatoes, peeled and covered in water
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons butter for topping the potatoes (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Put rack at the lower third level
and set a cookie sheet on it to catch boil-overs.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt on the chopped garlic and mash
together with the blade of a knife, to make a puree. Pour about
half the milk (or milk and cream mixture) into a buttered 8- to
10-cup flameproof gratin dish. Add garlic puree and the rest of the
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut potatoes crosswise, by hand or in a food processor, into
very thin slices ( 1/8 inch or less) _ do not rinse them again.
Spread them evenly in the gratin dish and pour in the remaining
milk. The liquid should come right to the top layer of potatoes _
add more milk or cream if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dish on a burner, bring to a slow boil, and cook for 2
to 3 minutes, until the liquid has thickened slightly. Scrape the
bottom gently with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching. Taste the
liquid and adjust the seasoning.

go with the cut biscuit method.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon granulated or packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut up, or chilled solid
shortening, plus extra for preparing pan, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cold mashed sweet potatoes or yams (9 ounces, or 2 medium
baked sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and mashed)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons milk, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk, optional
</P>
<P>
   Position rak in center of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.
Butter the cookie sheet or cover it with baking parchment.
</P>
<P>
   If working by hand, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the
flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and nutmeg. Cut in the butter or
shortening by pinching it into the flour with your fingertips or
mixing it with a pastry blender or 2 cross-cutting table knives
until the mixture has small lumps about the size of peas. Stir in
the sweet potatoes with just enough milk to make a soft dough,
tossing the mixture only until the dough holds together.
</P>
<P>
   If using a food processor, pulse the dry ingredients and butter
until the mixture has lumps the size of peas, then add the sweet
potato and 2 to 3 tablespoons milk; pulse only until dough begins
to clump.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Add a few
drops more milk if the dough is still too dry, then pat it into a
rough ball.
</P>
<P>
   To make drop biscuits, scoop 10 to 12 equal portions of the
dough onto the baking sheet, placing them at least 1 inch apart.
</P>
<P>
   To make cut biscuits, pat the dough into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle
about 3/4 inch thick. Divide each side into 2-inch segments and use
a long-bladed knife to cut the dough into 12 pieces. Place them
about 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. If desired, use a pastry
brush to paint the biscuit tops with a little milk.
</P>
<P>
   Bake about 15 minutes, until the biscuits rise and their golden
color is somewhat darker around the top edges. Cool on a wire rack;
serve warm. _ From: ``Family Baker'' by Susan G. Purdy (Broadway

</P>
<P>
   1 recipe cream cheese frosting (see below)
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely chopped or whole pecans for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Cream cheese frosting:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound (2 eight-ounce packages) of cream cheese, slightly
softened, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened slightly, cut into
small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>

   5 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch
round cake pans and line the bottoms with waxed paper.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda
and salt. Set aside. In another large bowl, beat the oil with the
sugar until smooth on medium speed of an electric mixer about 3
minutes. Add the eggs one at a time and beat until light, about 1
or 2 minutes. Add the vanilla extract. Add the bananas and the
pineapple. Add the dry ingredients in thirds, beating after each
addition until smooth. Stir in the pecans. Divide the batter
between the prepared pans and bake for 40-50 minutes or until a
cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let
cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool
completely on wire rack.

   These are absolutely lovely, especially with a couple of
chocolate truffles on the side. You want a fairly round, pretty
orange. I found peeling in a circular fashion worked best. You can
always carve the shape, but you don't want to lose too much of the
orange. You do want to lose all the bitter white pith, though. You
can add 1/4 cup cherry- or orange-flavored liqueur if desired.

   8 navel oranges or blood oranges
</P>

<P>
   1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

<P>
   Fresh mint sprigs for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Using a vegetable peeler, remove enough of the zest (the colored
part of the peel with none of the bitter white pith) from the
oranges in long, narrow strips to measure 1/2 cup and set aside.
Cut away the peel and all the white membrane from the oranges,
keeping them as round as possible; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan or other nonreactive pot large enough to hold all
the oranges, combine 1 cup water with the sugar, orange and lemon
juices and orange zest strips. Place over medium-high heat and
bring to a gentle boil, then adjust the heat to maintain the gentle
boil and cook until the mixture is thickened to a thin syrup
consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the oranges to the syrup and
continue cooking, turning the oranges frequently to coat evenly
with the syrup, for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the heat (and stir in the liqueur if using). Set
aside to cool.
</P>

   Cover and refrigerate the oranges for at least 2 hours or

   There's hardly a more direct chocolate experience than these
truffles. They can be messy and time consuming, but they're oh, so
worth it. When the chocolate begins to melt in your hands, stick it
in the freezer for 5 minutes. This recipe calls for a 1/4-inch
pastry tip, but I simply used a pastry bag without a tip. You can
also substitute cognac, rum, Grand Marnier or Kahlua for the
Armagnac.
</P>
<P>
   Truffles:
</P>
<P>
   17 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 tablespoons Armagnac or cognac
</P>
<P>
   Coating:
</P>
<P>
   9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3 cups unsweetened alkalized cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   For the truffles: Place the chopped chocolate and corn syrup in
a large bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a boil. Pour the
hot cream over the chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds. Whisk
until smooth. Whisk in the Armagnac or other liqueur. Let cool to
room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chocolate mixture in the refrigerator, stirring
occasionally, until it is the consistency of pudding, about 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Have a baking sheet lined with parchment paper ready. Fill a
pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip with the chilled
chocolate mixture. Pipe out 3/4-inch mounds of the mixture onto the
baking sheet. Chill the mounds for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the coating: Fill a medium saucepan 1/3 of the way with
water and bring to a simmer. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl
and place it over the simmering water. Stir until the chocolate is
completely melted.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cocoa powder in a shallow dish or pie pan. Using your
palms, roll the chocolate mounds into balls. Dip the truffles, one
at a time, into the melted chocolate. Remove the truffles with a
fork, allowing the excess chocolate to drip off. Using a fork,
immediately roll the truffles in the cocoa powder, coating them
completely. Store the truffles in an airtight container in a cool,
dry place for up to 2 weeks. _ From: ``Simply Sensational

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
read only the last two digits of a year might interpret the change
from 1999 to 2000 as going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the
computers to crash; interfering with utility services, banking,
aviation and any other sector that relies computers. While most
essential civilian and military computers in the United States have
been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries, including Russia,
are having difficulties. In fact, the State Department is so
worried about computer troubles there and in three former Soviet
republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of employees through the
New Year period. But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world. Their information will be
collected from a network of radars and satellites operated by the
nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center of the U.S. Space
Command. During the Cold War's superpower standoff, the Cheyenne
Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S. efforts to detect any
Soviet missile attack. The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed
the Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a
missile attack against the United States. Instead, it is designed
to reassure Moscow that U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if
that's what aging Soviet-era military computers incorrectly
indicate because of a Y2K computer glitch. That mistaken perception
could prove deadly because Russian policy calls for launching a
nuclear counter-strike if Moscow believes it is under nuclear
attack. The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to
protect against that theoretic possibility. Even if Moscow's
computers failed and incorrectly indicated an U.S. attack was
underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing the consoles
could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite pictures
showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for retaliatory
strikes against the United States. ``''We will prevent that from
occurring,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the
Y2K center. ``We will be sitting side-by-side with our Russian
counterparts and they'll be viewing the U.S. missile information.
They will have that view that says a launch is not occurring.''
Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct contact
with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone link, will
stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man teams will
rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day. Each crew
will include a linguist to enable team members to converse. The
Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30. The center also has a certain
public relations mission. ``The bottom line is that it's important
for the U.S and Russia to show the rest of the world that former
Cold War adversaries can come together and work as a team,'' said
Wicklund. The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for
security reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne
Mountain, the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried
1,800 feet underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. In an
assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems, the
Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles. But even
before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were worried about the
capability of Russia's missile defense system. In 1995, Russia
initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket
as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin
activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first stages of
preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian armed
forces realized its mistake. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading
foreign policy spokesman in the Senate, said the incident
underscored that ``Russian early-warning capabilities continue to
deteriorate, and this deterioration will be compounded by the
transition to the year 2000.'' Should a glitch occur during the New
Year period, ``we want them to understand that their problems are
Y2K-related and not a result of U.S. hostile action for which they
need to respond.'' The Y2K center also is designed to make up for
problems in the ``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and
Washington. The hotlines give military and political leaders
immediate communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear
crisis. As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side. ``Assured communications
between U.S. and Russian leaders is a priority at all times, and of
particular concern over the millennium date change,`` Warner
said.Because computer scientists warn that Y2K problems might take
several weeks to materialize, the Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian
cooperation will extend through mid-January. ``Not all of the data
corruption that may be engendered by Y2K is going to manifest
itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a military expert with
the Federation of American Scientists here. ``Some of this stuff
may take several weeks to propagate through the system.'' Russian
officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are dramatically
overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said the Y2K
problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles or its
nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year. As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is
concerned, Pentagon officials say the chances are ``extremely
remote'' that there could be an accidental launch caused by
military computers confused about the date change. The White House,
in its final report on the readiness of U.S. computers, debunked
worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K problems will not
cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it said. ``Nuclear
weapons launch requires human intervention.``Computers are the
backbone of the U.S. military, arrayed on key weapons like nuclear
missiles, tanks, jets and rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon
is the largest user of computer systems in the world. In
preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in upgrades
to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107 so-called
``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential for
waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year. Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the
Air Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining
U.S. missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers. ``We've checked them,
we've rechecked them. They're ready,'' Warren said.  &UR; --- &QL;  &LR;  (Eric

 &HT;    `Blind' sees the light and spices up sound a bit
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salacious and smug and with an ingratiating hook (that
``doot-doot-doot'' line) that quickly turned annoying as it
saturated radio, Third Eye Blind's 1997 breakthrough hit
``Semi-Charmed Life'' epitomizes the disposability of alternative
rock in the late 1990s. Sure, the song rocks, but in a generically
catchy way. When it came out, it seemed barely distinguishable from
other alterna-hits of the time, by equally faceless groups such as
matchbox 20 and the Goo Goo Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco quartet admirably tries to spice up its sound
on its sophomore release, adding a dash of AC/DC here (``1000
Julys''), a dollop of the Velvet Underground there (``Never Let You
Go''). Unfortunately, the references only show how much less
interesting Third Eye Blind is than its influences.
</P>
<P>
   The group does distinguish itself in one category: With his
perpetual sneer and dicey philosophies (``Wounded'' takes a
disturbingly cavalier attitude toward domestic violence) lead
vocalist and songwriter Stephan Jenkins is the most off-putting
frontman in rock right now.

 &HT;    Doobie Brothers: So easy to just listen to the music
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With funky Fu Manchu mustaches, muttonchop sideburns and hair
that hung toward the floor like pairs of shaggy drapes, the Doobie
Brothers are often framed in music history as the personification
of silly rock 'n' roll excess, real-life Muppets bouncing their
heads to twin drums and stoned-out guitar solos.
</P>
<P>
   While grooming may not have been the band's thing (at least not
in the beginning), it's not so easy to parody the Doobie's sound.
From the beer-chugging, chucka-chucka guitar rock of hits such as
``Listen to the Music'' to the jazzier, smooth Dewars sounds of
``You Belong to Me,'' the one-time bar band from Santa Cruz,
Calif., is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated groups in rock
history. No Hall of Fame nominations, no fawning young mimics (such
as Lenny Kravitz doing Jimi Hendrix), not even a ``Behind the
Music'' special on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the music of the Doobie Brothers, carefully archived in this
new boxed set from Rhino, is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is
(or was) supposed to be _ an emotional celebration of life from the
gut, whether it's longing for a lover, blowing your paycheck at a
bar with friends on Friday night or just ``feeling good to you and
you feeling good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some bloated boxed sets that are crammed with nuisances
like studio chit chat and drunken outtakes, this package is a
streamlined, chronological look at the band, its 14 musicians, 15
albums, and 16 Top 40 singles. Accompanied by an entertaining
booklet packed with flashback photos and album covers, it traces
the Doobie Brothers from their roots in roadhouse biker bars, where
they spewed out seductively slurry party hits such as ``Long Train
Runnin','' to the slick, adult contemporary sound that ultimately
put the group on smooth jazz playlists.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme dichotomy of the band's sound has never been more
apparent than in this package, where the jerky change in musical
direction seems to come overnight. (Actually, it happens between
track No. 5, April 1975's ``Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me),'' and
track No. 10, March 1976's ``Takin' It to the Streets''). That was
when original lead singer Tom Johnston (1970-1975) had rocked down
the highway of excess just a little too long and was replaced by
pianist/vocalist Michael McDonald (1975-1981). This is one of those
rare moments where a split personality turned out for the best.

 &HT;    Beauty pageant spoof has some teeth to it

   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   A cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty pageants, this movie
bombed at the box office. But it's a guilty-pleasure rental.
Kirsten Dunst is a wrong-side-of-the-tracks teen competing against
toothy, perfect and vicious Denise Richards in their small-town
beauty pageant. And, as the big show nears, contestants start to
turn up dead. The movie plays as a hybrid of 1975's ``Smile''and
the 1993 cable flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the
Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.'' It stoops to obvious
sight gags and way-broad performances (especially from Kirstie
Alley as Richards' scheming mom). But the film's unevenness is
covered by the energetic young cast, and a couple of crack
performances from the adults, including Ellen Barkin as Dunst's
trailer-trash mom and scene-stealer Allison Janney as Barkin's best
pal.

<P>
   ``Shakin' not Stirred'' is the appropriate title for this
smooth-as-a-martini contemporary jazz album.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, a 43-year-old Canadian guitarist, blends a grab bag of
musical styles _ Latin rhythms, hip-hop grooves and traditional
jazz _ for his fifth, and most complete, solo album. He combines
the muscular chords of Wes Montgomery with the melodic
inventiveness of another one of his influences, Pat Metheny. But
his most distinctive musical quality, displayed on songs like the
snappy ``For You,'' is a playful exuberance that's amplified by his
love of Latin percussion. Hughes adds a muted trumpet and some
sparkling acoustic piano on songs such as ``There She Goes'' and
``Man About Town'' to give his album the feel of a smoky club.
</P>
<P>
   On songs such as the achingly romantic ``On Moonless Nights,''
Hughes shows he's as good with ballads as he is with uptempo songs.
This is an album that's as self-assured as its title.

   Just as the mainstream finally catches on to Juvenile's 13
month-old second album ``400 Degreez,'' the New Orleans rapper
releases a third CD even early converts may take a minute to get.
The first single, ``U Understand,'' is instantly familiar because
it uses the title like a period, as did ``Ha,'' his infectious 1998
breakthrough single. But for the next six tracks it's as if usually
imaginative producer Mannie Fresh gets stuck in the '70s soul world
of wah-wah guitars and strings, eventually swallowing up Juvenile's
muscular voice. But the bounce that taught the 3 million people who
bought his last album to ``Back That Thang Up'' returns on the
unabashedly sexual ``Catch Your Cut'' and nothing goes splat after
that.

<P>
   Because it's outside the realm of MTV, VH1 and commercial radio,
many think independent, underground music must be difficult, noisy,
inept or socially unacceptable. Not true.
</P>
<P>
   Archer Prewitt, a member of Chicago's the Sea and Cake, delivers
sumptuous pop that cribs from such masterful tunesmiths as Burt
Bacharach, Todd Rundgren (in his ``Runt''/``Something/Anything''
mode) and Alex Chilton. Hardly the stuff to scare parents.
``Motorcycles'' and ``Shake'' might rock a bit, but not in a
lock-up-your-daughters way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raise on High'' kicks things off with a strolling guitar
jangle and crescendoing horns before the strings and a decidedly
un-rock clarinet line take over for the coda. ``Summer's End'' and
``Walking on the Farm'' conjure the pastoral in more than just
title. Enchanting details abound, and Prewitt's soft, sweet voice
sounds so intimate it seems he's letting you in on a secret.

   &QR;  ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' (PG-13) _ As high school movies go,
it barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids (including
Katie Holmes of ``Dawson's Creek'') take their evil history teacher
hostage in her home and then try to figure out how to get out of
the mess they've created. It ends up being a wishy-washy remake of
1980's silly ``9 to 5.'' As the tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is
pretty good. Her young co-stars, however, fail to match her talent.
Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The General's Daughter'' (R) _ John Travolta stars as a
military investigator trying to search out the killer of a
general's daughter, a sexy lieutenant with kinky tastes. The movie
is really a morally dubious, deeply distasteful charade that
pretends to be in favor of women in the armed forces, but mainly it
luxuriates in shots of the murder victim staked naked to the
ground. The wasted cast includes Timothy Hutton and James Woods,
who plays a character whose gayness is telegraphed by the fact
that, gasp, he cooks and has candles at his house. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Red Violin'' (unrated) _ Francois Girard's
centuries-spanning saga is as florid and emotional as his
``Thirty-Two Short Works About Glenn Gould'' was spare and
sophisticated. The film follows the fortunes _ and, more often,
misfortunes _ of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. Grade: B +
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Harmonists'' (R) _ Director Joseph Vilsmaier can't find
a way to make this rags-and-riches biopic of a Berlin singing group
persecuted by Nazis resonate beyond its own outline. And he makes
some groaner choices, like intercutting the illicit first kiss of
secret lovers with the bloody slugs of a boxing match. ``The
Harmonists'' is smartly acted, but it's by-the-numbers. Like the
group's own songs, it's charming, pleasant, but not memorable.

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
read only the last two digits of a year might interpret the change
from 1999 to 2000 as going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the
computers to crash; interfering with utility services, banking,
aviation and any other sector that relies computers. While most
essential civilian and military computers in the United States have
been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries, including Russia,
are having difficulties. In fact, the State Department is so
worried about computer troubles there and in three former Soviet
republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of employees through the
New Year period. But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world. Their information will be
collected from a network of radars and satellites operated by the
nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center of the U.S. Space
Command. During the Cold War's superpower standoff, the Cheyenne
Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S. efforts to detect any
Soviet missile attack. The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed
the Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a
missile attack against the United States. Instead, it is designed
to reassure Moscow that U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if
that's what aging Soviet-era military computers incorrectly
indicate because of a Y2K computer glitch. That mistaken perception
could prove deadly because Russian policy calls for launching a
nuclear counter-strike if Moscow believes it is under nuclear
attack. The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to
protect against that theoretic possibility. Even if Moscow's
computers failed and incorrectly indicated an U.S. attack was
underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing the consoles
could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite pictures
showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for retaliatory
strikes against the United States. ``''We will prevent that from
occurring,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the
Y2K center. ``We will be sitting side-by-side with our Russian
counterparts and they'll be viewing the U.S. missile information.
They will have that view that says a launch is not occurring.''
Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct contact
with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone link, will
stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man teams will
rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day. Each crew
will include a linguist to enable team members to converse. The
Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30. The center also has a certain
public relations mission. ``The bottom line is that it's important
for the U.S and Russia to show the rest of the world that former
Cold War adversaries can come together and work as a team,'' said
Wicklund. The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for
security reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne
Mountain, the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried
1,800 feet underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. In an
assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems, the
Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles. But even
before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were worried about the
capability of Russia's missile defense system. In 1995, Russia
initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket
as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin
activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first stages of
preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian armed
forces realized its mistake. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading
foreign policy spokesman in the Senate, said the incident
underscored that ``Russian early-warning capabilities continue to
deteriorate, and this deterioration will be compounded by the
transition to the year 2000.'' Should a glitch occur during the New
Year period, ``we want them to understand that their problems are
Y2K-related and not a result of U.S. hostile action for which they
need to respond.'' The Y2K center also is designed to make up for
problems in the ``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and
Washington. The hotlines give military and political leaders
immediate communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear
crisis. As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side. ``Assured communications
between U.S. and Russian leaders is a priority at all times, and of
particular concern over the millennium date change,`` Warner
said.Because computer scientists warn that Y2K problems might take
several weeks to materialize, the Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian
cooperation will extend through mid-January. ``Not all of the data
corruption that may be engendered by Y2K is going to manifest
itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a military expert with
the Federation of American Scientists here. ``Some of this stuff
may take several weeks to propagate through the system.'' Russian
officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are dramatically
overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said the Y2K
problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles or its
nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year. As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is
concerned, Pentagon officials say the chances are ``extremely
remote'' that there could be an accidental launch caused by
military computers confused about the date change. The White House,
in its final report on the readiness of U.S. computers, debunked
worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K problems will not
cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it said. ``Nuclear
weapons launch requires human intervention.``Computers are the
backbone of the U.S. military, arrayed on key weapons like nuclear
missiles, tanks, jets and rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon
is the largest user of computer systems in the world. In
preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in upgrades
to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107 so-called
``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential for
waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year. Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the
Air Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining
U.S. missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers. ``We've checked them,
we've rechecked them. They're ready,'' Warren said.  &UR; --- &QL;  &LR;  (Eric

JOHN POPHAM, 89, DIES; JOURNALIST WAS NOTED FOR PERCEPTIVE COVERAGE

<P>
   John N. Popham, who drove a green Buick 50,000 miles a year
across the American South as the first northern newspaper
correspondent to cover the region regularly, died in a Chattanooga
hospital on Sunday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Popham cultivated all kinds of Southerners, from governors to
field hands, from shade-tree mechanics to college presidents, to
tell their stories in The New York Times, for which he worked for
25 years, until 1958. He later edited The Chattanooga Times for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   As the civil rights struggle exploded, his dispatches from
Little Rock, Ark., and the other early flash points informed
readers of the mounting racial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Will Campbell, who was chaplain at the University of Mississippi
and is now a writer, remembered his customary greeting, on arriving
in yet another Southern hamlet. ``What's going on, sweetheart?'' he
would say. ``I'm just wandering around taking the temperature here
and there.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brought common sense to the increasingly tense civil
rights story. Campbell remembered when Popham was arrested at a
gathering of blacks in the early 1950s. ``Are you white or black?''
a police officer demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Popham answered, ``If you can't tell the difference, what
difference does it make?''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison E. Salisbury in his 1980 book, ``Without Fear or
Favor,'' wrote: ``No one did what Popham did, and no one would do
it afterward. His assignment evidenced a singular perception of the
South, its problems and their importance to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Holmberg, who was publisher of The Chattanooga Times, met
Popham, known as Pops or Johnny, 50 years ago. She remembers him as
almost a Damon Runyon caricature of a newspaperman, always with a
hat on, but the farthest thing from a Yankee, with his Tidewater
Virginia speech. His accent was so deep and his delivery so fast
that it baffled both Northerners and deep Southerners. Claude F.
Sitton, who succeeded Popham as the Times' Southern correspondent,
said his delivery approximated nothing so much as ``dollops of
sorghum syrup spat from a Gatling gun.''
</P>
<P>
   John N. Popham III was born in Fredricksburg, Va., and moved
around the world with his father, a Marine captain. He graduated
from Fordham University and worked for The Brooklyn Eagle before
joining The Times in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted in the Marines in 1942, and wrote stories for The
Times during his tour of duty in the Pacific. He left the Marines
as a captain with a Bronze Star and returned to work for The Times
full time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Turner Catledge, a Mississippian who was then assistant
managing editor, asked Popham to cover the South, from the Potomac
to central Texas. Gene Roberts, who covered the region later for
The New York Times and still later was its managing editor, said
Catledge persuaded Times managers to assign Popham only on the
conditions that he drive, not fly, from place to place and that he
keep an office at the Chattanooga Times.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a free-wheeling sort of reporting, with Popham
driving vast distances from friend to friend. He sent out 100 boxes
of New Orleans pralines each year at his own expense, and his vast
network of contacts included old-school connections and distant
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, under Popham's direction, The Times published a
50,000-word eight-page report on the implications of racial
integration in the wake of the Brown vs. Board of Education school
desegregation decision of 1954. In the report he predicted
difficulties, but said most Southern leaders had reached the
conclusion that integration was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Popham and Catledge, then managing editor, later came to believe
the report was too optimistic. However, Roberts said Monday: ``I'm
not sure for the particular moment in time he wasn't right. A lot
of people who started off moderate switched over to a more
hard-line segregationist position as the pressures built.''
</P>
<P>
   Popham was managing editor of the Chattanooga Times until 1977.
After he retired, he commuted hundreds of miles a week from
Chattanooga to Atlanta to attend John Marshall Law School, where he
earned a law degree at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Frances Evans; a son,
John N. Popham IV of Nashville; a daughter, Hilary Popham of
Atlanta; and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Popham's friendships helped both him and other reporters cover
incendiary events. When whites were charged with killing Emmett
Till after reports that he had made sexual remarks about a white
woman in 1955, the trial judge in Sumner, Miss., asked him to act
as go-between with the national press corps.
</P>
<P>
   David Halberstam, in his 1993 book ``The Fifties,'' recounts
that a week before the trial, Popham had called a prominent
businessman who was a fraternity brother of the judge and dined
with him in Oxford, Miss. Afterward, the fraternity brother assured
the judge that the Times reporter could be trusted, and Popham
arranged lodging for out-of-town reporters, both black and white,
at a safe distance from the trial.

<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ Alongside a two-lane road that winds
through the hills in southern Kosovo sits a walled farmyard with a
cinderblock house at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The steep, forested hills rising all around could be mistaken
for those of north Georgia. Skender Rahimi couldn't get this place
out of his mind even while he was in the safety and relative
serenity of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The house by the road is Rahimi's home. By local standards, it's
no palace, but it's a good solid house and a cause for pride. It
pained Rahimi (pronounced: ``ra-HEE-mee'') to leave it eight months
ago to escape advancing Serb forces. With seven family members, he
made his way to neighboring Macedonia and a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   His story is a familiar tale of exile and return that is common
among the 800,000 Kosovar Albanians who fled their homeland last
spring during the brutal conflict between the Serb-led Yugoslav
military and ethnic Albanian separatists. The conflict came to an
end after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced the Yugoslav army,
police and paramilitaries to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When Rahimi fled in April he left behind his parents, whose
memory haunted him for the months he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Parents hold a special place in Albanian society: Children,
particularly sons and their wives, are duty-bound to care for them.
The idea of sending parents off to a nursing home or even a
retirement village is an unheard of absurdity, particularly here in
the deeply traditional
</P>
<P>
   countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahimi's parents _ both in their 60s, an advanced age in
Kosovo _ were not up to the long journey south to Macedonia. Also,
it seemed unlikely that Serb soldiers would harm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with them more than 40 years,'' Rahimi said a on
recent day in the house's sitting room over cigarettes and cups of
strong Albanian tea. ``I must care for them now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to transfer refugees out of overwhelmed
Macedonia, Rahimi's family was airlifted to the United States and
ultimately to Atlanta. America wasn't his first choice _ he had
requested Sweden or Norway to remain closer to home _ but he was
intrigued when he saw the destination on a list in the refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is an odd fantasy to people in this part of
the world. Few have visited it, but America is always with them in
movies, sitcoms, music and endless stream of consumer products.
Yet, it remains a distant place. ``It is somewhere for other
people, that's what we always thought,'' he said. ``Before, I
couldn't have an impression. The biggest impression I had was that
Albright and Clinton were helping us to get freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, after a brief stay in New Jersey, the family arrived in
Atlanta and were housed in an apartment complex near Hartsfield
International Airport. Rahimi spoke not one word of English, and
his children had learned only a little more in school. None had
been to a city as big as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they made a life. From some Bosnians he met, he learned
where he could get familiar food (he didn't care much for the
American fare he sampled, with the exception of pizza). From
Vietnamese emigrants he met at work, he learned survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   But his most powerful memory of Atlanta is a thousand little
generosities given by an American named Mike _ Rahimi can't recall
the odd sounding last name. ``I still think of Mike and walking
around Atlanta,'' Rahimi recalls, first with a smile and then with
a waver in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gaertner, a Catholic Social Services volunteer, assisted
the Rahimis in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking if I could ever help him as I was helped,''
Rahimi says, pausing without ending the sentence. ``They were very
good people in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he loves his native Kosovo deeply, Rahimi would have
liked to have stayed in America. He harbored a powerful desire to
see his five children educated _ a difficult challenge in the
uncertainty of a war-torn province. His younger son, Flamur, caught
the computer bug but has returned to a place where he has no access
to one.
</P>
<P>
   And at 41, Rahimi was prepared to embark on a new life in the
strange but promising land.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received a phone call. He was told that his mother was
sick, perhaps mortally ill. His father was despondent, perhaps
losing his mind. His house in Gnjilane has no telephone and it had
become virtually impossible to get reliable information on his
parents' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In September he decided it was his duty to return to Kosovo.
However, his eldest son, Mentor, wanted to stay in America. Mentor
turned 18 on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me 'You're sending me to Kosovo. Where I can't
study, where I can't make a life,''' Rahimi recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife agreed to let their son stay. ``So, he will
finish school there (in Atlanta) and maybe he can work there.''
Rahimi says, smiling. ``Now Mike is his second father.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying this, Rahimi looks at his younger son and one of
the three daughters who returned with him to Kosovo and then to his
wife. Briefly, they seem to share in the emptiness of Mentor's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' Rahimi says after a minute or two. ``But now
he's grown up and he's living his life. It would be harder now to
have him here and to be unable to give him the school he needs now.
That would be too much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home in September, Rahimi was overjoyed to find
the house undamaged. About 100,000 houses in Kosovo were damaged in
the fighting, half of them beyond repair. He had assumed the worst.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Bathie, will never forget his return. She was
standing on the front porch. ``I looked at the gate open,'' she
recalls. ``And then I saw Skender's face, the face I never thought
I would see again. I thought I was dead before and now I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He was relieved to find his parents alive and reasonably
healthy. It was all he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   While his home and immediate family was spared, things weren't
so good for everyone. Five cousins were dead. Many houses were
destroyed. The mosque down the road was a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   And with winter coming on hard, there will be plenty of misery
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi thinks a lot about Atlanta and his son. He wonders if he
will ever see either again. When he wants to talk to Mentor, he
walks about five miles to use a telephone. But it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   He hands a visiting American a handwritten note and a shopping
bag of cassette tapes to take to Atlanta. ``These are his
favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Kosovo doesn't allow much time for reverie. He and his
wife have four children and two parents to care for.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi says he's ready for winter. Firewood is stacked neatly
against the wall. The family tractor is parked near the chicken
coops on the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is cold the morning Rahimi's wife, Vahide, cooks ``fli-a'' _
a special dish with layers of yogurt and a pasta-like bread _ in a
pan over the open fire. She's in constant motion, stirring the
coals and adjusting the pan to get the heat right. She says very
little.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi sits on his haunches smoking and warming his hands on the
fire. His mother gazes at him from a few feet away. He wonders if
he was right to leave Atlanta, but he doesn't allow himself to
drift into regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to find the house and the tractor weren't
damaged,'' he says, squinting as the smoke stings his eyes. ``But
life is more important than anything else. This is what I think
now.''

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It

direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It
was designed by MARJORIE CONNELLY, staff editor, under the
direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It
was designed by MARJORIE CONNELLY, staff editor, under the
direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

A NEW YORK MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What's missing from our picture of the world 1,000 years ago? A
sense of the experience of everyday life: the sights and sounds and
sensations that time washes away almost instantly.
 &HT;    And so, in an effort to try to document the texture of life
today, at least in a single place in a single moment, the New York
Minute was born.
 &HT;    On Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its
symmetry, a variety of writers fanned out to document a single
minute _ the same minute _ in the life of The Big Apple.
 &HT;    They came back with a mosaic of 60 seconds that, hopefully, will
last a millennium.

 PETE HAMILL 
 Broadway and Canal Street 
 &HT;    At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life
along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan
Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: ``gru, gru, grug, gu-grug,
groooaaaaar.'' Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls
in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed
on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph
Lauren shirt behind four kids with backpacks and baggy jeans. All
easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young
Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored
tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled
crowd, cutting a path. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks
and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the
light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt
turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the
truck's path. The driver stops; she nods and hurries on, into her
American morning.

 JAMES TRAUB 
 The United Nations 
 &HT;    Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations, left an
elevator with his bodyguard and entered a TV studio where he was
scheduled to tape two messages _ one to ``the world business
community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency.
Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the violence in East
Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He wore the uniform
of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie.
Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look
impossibly black.
 &HT;    ``There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' an aide said
sorrowfully.
 &HT;    Annan was expressionless for a moment and then said softly:
``I'll do it another time. Now I can go back to talk to East
Timor.''

 City Hall 
 &HT;    Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's
Committee of the Whole Room, first used in 1812, is running late _
the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning
light coming in through the windows illuminates aides seated around
a gleaming mahogany table, watching Giuliani. Nicholas Scoppetta,
commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, briefs
Giuliani about a rally for directors of the city's foster-care
agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be
there, Giuliani _ perhaps aware that his New York Minute is not
very exciting yet, or maybe that he is not yet the central
character, makes a move.
 &HT;    ``Do I get my money for my jury service?'' he breaks in,
referring to his time as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury
case.
 &HT;    Scoppetta, absorbed in his talk, at first takes no notice. ``And
he ... he will bring--''
 &HT;    ``A check?'' offers the mayor.
 &HT;    Laughter.
 &HT;    ``A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before
the minute is over.

 Southbound tollbooth plaza  
 Henry Hudson Bridge 
 &HT;    A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver
curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in
front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next
to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator
balks between the CASH ONLY and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone
behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its
tracks. A yellow cab trumps the Navigator's hesitation and guns in
front of it. The Navigator lurches forward, heading past the cab,
triumphantly, to the E-ZPass.

 Yankee Stadium  
 &HT;    Thomas Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball
field in America. At 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green
lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats. With a rake, he was tamping
and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Then Fyfe glared at
the dew-soaked outfield. In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on
a tired patch of grass. That's where the outfielder Paul O'Neill
wears down the sod with his vigorous pacing between pitches.
``Now's the best time in the world,'' Fyfe said. ``There's nobody
here. You just come out and work.''

 LEWIS LAPHAM 
 The Carlyle Hotel dining room  
 Madison Avenue at 76th Street 
 &HT;    A high-ceilinged room decorated with the signs of serious money:
English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet,
fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a
background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern
of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center
banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked
salmon at $22.50. Rising from the table near the door, _ Robert
Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and
Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United
Nations, gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod
to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into
the lobby, the maitre d'hotel bows to them with a grateful smile.

cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two.
 &HT;    ``Pretty busy this morning,'' he says.
 &HT;    And so it is.
 &HT;    Customers line the front counter, waiting for their breakfast
sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the
gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an
uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another
minute. Behind the counter, the talk is flying forth in Spanglish
and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is shouting, ``Yo, amigo,''
and ``Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee (grandpa
in Korean)?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet.
 &HT;    Somehow, everyone understands.

Daily News' Page One _ mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of
``encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of 7 million people.

big and battered. She takes some schedules, one of each _ Westport,
Greenwich, Tuckahoe _ as if choosing fruit. She passes through the
crowd, puts the schedules carefully inside her shoulder bag. Now

Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the
ground. Five small stones have been placed on it. Half a million
people are buried in this cemetery, New York's ``Garden City of the
Dead.'' Five more are lowered into it every day. About 135
groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not

middle-aged like me, tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the

A NEW YORK MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 c.1999 The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What's missing from our picture of the world 1,000 years ago? A
sense of the experience of everyday life: the sights and sounds and
sensations that time washes away almost instantly.
 &HT;    And so, in an effort to try to document the texture of life
today, at least in a single place in a single moment, the New York
Minute was born.
 &HT;    On Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its
symmetry, a variety of writers fanned out to document a single
minute _ the same minute _ in the life of The Big Apple.
 &HT;    They came back with a mosaic of 60 seconds that, hopefully, will
last a millennium.

 Broadway and Canal Street 
 &HT;    At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life
along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan
Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: ``gru, gru, grug, gu-grug,
groooaaaaar.'' Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls
in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed
on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph
Lauren shirt behind four kids with backpacks and baggy jeans. All
easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young
Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored
tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled
crowd, cutting a path. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks
and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the
light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt
turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the
truck's path. The driver stops; she nods and hurries on, into her
American morning.

elevator with his bodyguard and entered a TV studio where he was
scheduled to tape two messages _ one to ``the world business
community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency.
Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the violence in East
Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He wore the uniform
of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie.
Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look
impossibly black.
 &HT;    ``There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' an aide said
sorrowfully.
 &HT;    Annan was expressionless for a moment and then said softly:
``I'll do it another time. Now I can go back to talk to East
Timor.''

 City Hall 
 &HT;    Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's
Committee of the Whole Room, first used in 1812, is running late _
the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning
light coming in through the windows illuminates aides seated around
a gleaming mahogany table, watching Giuliani. Nicholas Scoppetta,
commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, briefs
Giuliani about a rally for directors of the city's foster-care
agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be
there, Giuliani _ perhaps aware that his New York Minute is not
very exciting yet, or maybe that he is not yet the central
character, makes a move.
 &HT;    ``Do I get my money for my jury service?'' he breaks in,
referring to his time as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury
case.
 &HT;    Scoppetta, absorbed in his talk, at first takes no notice. ``And
he ... he will bring--''
 &HT;    ``A check?'' offers the mayor.
 &HT;    Laughter.
 &HT;    ``A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before

curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in
front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next
to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator
balks between the CASH ONLY and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone
behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its
tracks. A yellow cab trumps the Navigator's hesitation and guns in
front of it. The Navigator lurches forward, heading past the cab,
triumphantly, to the E-ZPass.

 Yankee Stadium

field in America. At 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green
lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats. With a rake, he was tamping
and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Then Fyfe glared at
the dew-soaked outfield. In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on
a tired patch of grass. That's where the outfielder Paul O'Neill
wears down the sod with his vigorous pacing between pitches.
``Now's the best time in the world,'' Fyfe said. ``There's nobody
here. You just come out and work.''

English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet,
fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a
background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern
of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center
banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked
salmon at $22.50. Rising from the table near the door, _ Robert
Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and
Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United
Nations, gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod
to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into
the lobby, the maitre d'hotel bows to them with a grateful smile.

sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the
gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an
uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another
minute. Behind the counter, the talk is flying forth in Spanglish
and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is shouting, ``Yo, amigo,''
and ``Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee (grandpa
in Korean)?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet.

front of it. The Navigator lurches forward, heading past the cab,
triumphantly, to the E-ZPass.

a tired patch of grass. That's where the outfielder Paul O'Neill
wears down the sod with his vigorous pacing between pitches.

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture this scene: Prima-donna actors indulging themselves with
rich cuisine and recreational drugs. Powerful show-biz legends
girding their loins for a do-or-die project. A great nation
consumed with high living, new technology and entertaining eye
candy.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Try London, 1884, the setting of ``Topsy-Turvy,'' Mike Leigh's
sumptuous and meticulous re-creation of British Imperial culture
and the two eminent Victorians who stamped it with indelible
panache.
</P>
<P>
   In their gilded heyday, lyricist William Schwenck Gilbert and
composer Arthur Sullivan were the leading purveyors of English
opera burlesque, that stoutly middle-class art form consisting of
faux-naif characters, tongue-twisting verse and preposterous comic
plots that gently stood the prevailing social order on its
venerable head.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, Leigh would seem a most unlikely candidate to
attempt such a lavishly outfitted period piece. Celebrated for his
affectionate but biting depictions of downwardly mobile Brits
struggling to survive the Thatcher-Major years, Leigh's forte is
contemporary kitchen-sink realism couched in a distinctively
personal comic syntax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' starts out deceptively like a hip but
more-or-less conventional costume drama, the kind that Britain's
Channel 4 cranks out by the yard. Only as the film moves forward,
always taking its own sweet time, does the keenness of Leigh's
vision, with its purposefully digressive playfulness, fully assert
itself.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet them in ``Topsy-Turvy,'' the shrewd,
business-minded Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the more flamboyant,
hedonistic Sullivan (Allan Corduner) have grown rich and famous off
their winning formula. Having formed a lucrative alliance with the
savvy impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), they're the
marquee attraction at London's Savoy Theatre and the toast of
polite society.
</P>
<P>
   But success has taken its toll, particularly on Sullivan's
health and his dreams of musical immortality. Exhausted by the pace
of production and fretful that he's frittering away his talent on
frivolity, Sullivan tells his partner that they're repeating
themselves artistically. Is the British commercial theater's most
successful partnership in peril, as the actors are whispering
backstage?
</P>
<P>
   After even some risque R&AMP;R in Paris fails to lift Sullivan's
spirits, Gilbert's demure, understanding wife Kitty (Leslie
Manville) drags her husband to a Japanese exhibition. We
practically see the light bulb go off above his head. Soon, the
company is in rehearsals for ``The Mikado,'' that exquisite spoof
of provincial Japanese (read: provincial British) bureaucracy that
would become Gilbert and Sullivan's crowning masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' devotes roughly a third of its two-hour,
40-minute running time to envisioning the creative process behind
``The Mikado.'' Almost a movie within a movie, these revealing,
beautifully staged vignettes, filled less with agony and ecstasy
than with egotistical sniping and urbane verbal jousting, are
surely among the truest sketches of artistic collaboration ever
captured on film _ though they probably presume a greater working
knowledge of ``The Mikado'' than they should. Likewise, the
extended excerpts from previous Gilbert and Sullivan hits probably
will tax some viewers' attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling talent from his stock company of regular actors, Leigh
has assembled a brilliant cast that manages to convey remarkable
depths of character with appropriately Victorian understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan makes a deliciously decadent Sullivan, while Broadbent,
practically unrecognizable from his prior role as a working-class
loser in ``Life Is Sweet,'' is the perfect counterpoint as the
calculating but straight-shooting Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Eve Stewart's production design and Dick Pope's cinematography
capture London in all its Arts and Crafts/Beaux Arts splendor,
right down to the primitive telephones and Vanity Fair caricatures
on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the century in question, Leigh scrutinizes human
behavior with the cool expertise of a butterfly collector, pinning
his specimens in sparkling dramatic patterns yet somehow always
leaving their humanity intact. Like the best of Gilbert and
Sullivan, ``Topsy-Turvy'' cherishes the art of being human, in all
its surprising, glorious folly. &QL;

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Jennifer Rizzotti, who got married in July on
one of her days off from playing basketball with the Houston
Comets, could now be (1) enjoying her honeymoon, (2) looking for a
house, or (3) working out at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was going to be my down time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rizzotti, dressed in black and red sweats, spends her
days sitting in an office at the University of Hartford, watching
tapes of the next opponent that will face the Hawks, or holding
practices with the team. With her team.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Rizzotti's life has been through as many
unpredictable moves as she and her teammates at UConn used to dish
out to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago Rizzotti was in her third year as starting point
guard for the New England Blizzard in the American Basketball
League. Then, the week before Christmas, the Blizzard folded when
the ABL disbanded, and Rizzotti was unemployed. Five months later,
she was drafted by the other women's league, the WNBA, and was sent
to Texas to join the Houston Comets. During the season, Rizzotti
got married.
</P>
<P>
   But the honeymoon is still on hold as Rizzotti's life kept
unfolding. After the season, she had an offer not to play
basketball, but to direct it, and now she is Hartford's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Including Rizzotti, three current or former WNBA players are
with America East programs _ Cindy Blodgett, of the Sacramehto
Monarchs, is an assistant coach at Boston University, and Nicole
Andres, who played with the Charlotte Sting for two years, is at
the University of Vermont. Six other WNBA players coach at college
teams over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But Rizzotti stands out among them for being the only head
coach, and, at 25, for being the youngest of any Division 1 coach.
</P>
<P>
   The progession of girls playing basketball used to be much more
basic _ the path went from AAU and high school teams, then on to
college. That was it, in America. If the women still wanted to
play, they had to do it Europe. Later, they might come back and
coach a college team.
</P>
<P>
   Now the women can stay in this country and play for a WNBA team.
Some of them are even joining college staffs before their playing
days are over, thanks to the WNBA summer season that doesn't
conflict with the college schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And universities realize that in addition to the talent the
women offer, their well-known names can help put fans in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is putting her mark on the image of the university,'' said
athletic director Pat Meiser-McKnett. ``I've had an eagle eye on
her since she was in high school,'' said Meiser-McKnett, associate
AD at UConn before coming to Hartford seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people attended the press conference to announce
Rizzotti's appointment this September, and 759 fans attended the
school's home opener _ more than twice the average attendance (330)
last year. In addition, the school had 26 season ticketholders last
year; this year there are 100.
</P>
<P>
   The name-attraction is not lost on Rizzotti. The 5-foot-6 point
guard who grew up in New Fairfield, Conn., played on UConn's
1994-95 undefeated team that went on to win the national
championship. The next year. Rizzotti was named Associated Press
Player of the Year. However, Rizzotti said she's also aware that
the marquee value could be short term after her team went 8-19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the fans to come, and if they want to see me coach,
that's great,'' she said. ``But I think that you've got to find a
way to keep them here. People aren't going to come back game after
game for the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti said it has always been a goal of hers to coach . . .
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought about getting into it, and how I would do
things, but I didn't think I was going to do it this year,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And she never considered being an assistant, which is the usual
way to enter the career. No, there would be no second-banana job
for the point guard. If she could orchestrate a team on the court,
she figured, she could do it off the court, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I would have to (be an assistant), but I knew
that I didn't want to,'' she said. ``I wanted to be in charge,
totally. I wanted to do things my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti said she and her assistants, Mimi Walters and Brian
Mik, work well together on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to be the one that made the decisions, that did
all the talking in practice, that got the kids to play the way I
wanted to,'' she said. ``And you can't do that as an assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Macca, the co-captain of the Hartford Hawks who grew up
in Southington, Conn., was a senior in high school when Rizzotti
was a senior at UConn.
</P>
<P>
   When Macca heard in the fall who was going to be her coach, she
said she was ``shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, but shocked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Macca said she's still excited, even though Rizzotti is hard
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has high expectations, but I think that's good for us,
especially after coming off last year,'' Macca said, adding that
the new coach has added to the prestige of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's more positive and excited to be out there, and
people around campus know us more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, who will be back at her job with the WNBA when
Hartford is in the height of its recruiting time next summer,
refused to speculate on her future, but denied that she feels like
a short-timer in her coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not taking this lightly at all,'' said Rizzotti, who has
already signed one recruit for next year. ``Whatever I do, I will
coach this season as if I were to coach here forever. That's the
only way you can be good at something. So I'm recruiting hard,
trying to get good players in here, trying to raise the standards
of the kids that are already here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Blodgett, also a WNBA player and also a college star, has
landed a job at college, too, as as assistant at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Blodgett, who was drafted by the Cleveland Rockers in the WNBA
the year after she graduated from the University of Maine, said she
has had to adjust to giving the orders instead of taking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I still struggle with that from time to time,'' she
said. ``I'm not a yeller to begin with, so I would never see myself
as yelling at people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's trying to find what's best for me, like how to get my
point across,'' Blodgett said. ``So it's still kind of very new,
and I try to pay attention to, like, facial expressions, things
that kids are going to look at, and you've never thought of before.
I've been on the other end, and I've seen how coaches react after
I've done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Margaret McKeon, who is also in her first year at BU,
had previously coached at George Washington University, and became
familiar with Blodgett's college history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy was pretty much well-known all over the country as a
high school player,'' McKeon said. ``So I knew quite a bit about
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Blodgett helped lead her high school in Maine to four state
championships, then helped the university win four conference
tournaments and make four trips to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Cindy I felt we needed someone who had a presence of
winning, knew about the league, and was very successful, and that
the players could relate to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blodgett's experience is helpful, and so is her age, McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can communicate with the kids and they can relate, because
a lot of kids that are in my program have seen her play and they
know Cindy is very special,'' MeKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more importantly, Blodgett can offer them a look beyond
college into their basketball careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's young and playing in the WNBA,'' said Annie Tomasini, a
sophomore on the team. ``As a college player, that's the next stop
that you think of.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she played in our conference, so it makes you think dreams
can come true.''

<P>
   The Republican presidential contenders got pretty heated up
about ethanol in their Iowa debate this week, raising a subject
that stirs passions in the cornbelt, but only vague memories of the
1970s energy crisis here in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates squared off Monday over the wisdom of a
longstanding federal subsidy for ethanol, a fuel made from corn or
other plants whose backers have been trying to turn into an
important energy source for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a relic of the past, however, this fuel is quietly on
the march, poised to become an ingredient in much of New England's
gasoline if its politically powerful backers succeed in selling it
as a way to clean up the air. If that happens, critics warn, New
Englanders will feel it in their wallet as the price of gasoline
rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England doesn't have the availability of ethanol. If it's
required, its going to hurt bad. You're talking about serious price
gouging,'' said A. Blakeman Early, a consultant to the American
Lung Association in Washington who is skeptical of ethanol's
purported benefits in combatting urban smog.
</P>
<P>
   But in Des Moines, the heart of an industry that employs 78,000
people in 23 states, only Senator John McCain spoke ill of ethanol.
McCain had already indicated that he does not intend to compete
seriously in next month's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you the things that you don't want to hear as
well as the things you want to hear, and one of those is ethanol,''
said McCain. ``Ethanol is not worth it. It does not help the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of McCain's rivals _ Texas Governor George W. Bush,
publisher Steve Forbes and Senator Orrin Hatch _ defended the
federal tax break for ethanol, which amount to a 32 percent rebate
of the purchase price for marketers of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've supported ethanol whether I was in Iowa or not,'' said
Bush. ``And the reason I do is . . . it's good for the quality of
air. It also reduces our dependence on foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Vaughn, president of the ethanol industry's Renewable Fuels
Association, said McCain also ignored the economic benefits of the
tax break. Ethanol has spurred the sale of so much corn that it has
reduced federal farm subsidies by far more than the cost to the
treasury of the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Monday night was more of a political statement that
(McCain) is an independent,'' said Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol, originally presented to Americans as a homegrown
alternative to Mideast oil in the 1970s, has re-emerged since the
1980s as a way to help reduce some kinds of air pollution,
particularly the carbon monoxide coming out of auto tailpipes in
winter. Since 1991, the number of ethanol refineries in the US has
grown from 34 to 65, and BC International of Dedham is looking for
a place to build a New England plant.
</P>
<P>
   But ethanol has never been able to compete economically with its
main rival, an oil refinery product called MTBE, partly because
ethanol must be shipped on trucks or barges rather than in
pipelines. Even with the federal tax break, ethanol is still
slightly more expensive than MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ethanol industry has fought hard to retain its
tax advantage, giving generously to sympathetic Congressional
candidates, some of whom helped fight off efforts to repeal the
break in 1997. The leading maker of ethanol, Archer Daniels Midland
of Decatur, Illinois, donated $918,000 to Congressional candidates
and their parties in 1995-96 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with their tax break in place until 2007, ethanol industry
officials have an eye on what would be their biggest windfall to
date: becoming an ingredient in a special reformulated gasoline for
regions with a summertime smog problem, including the entire state
of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 80 percent of reformulated gas _ including virtually
all gas sold in southern New England _ uses less expensive MTBE
rather than ethanol to boost the special fuel's octane level.
However, widespread concern that MTBE contaminates water supplies
has led California and Maine to ban MTBE, and Getty announced it
would use ethanol at all its stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were thinking about marketing opportunities . . .
there's probably nothing more exciting than the opportunity to
replace MTBE with ethanol, especially in water-sensitive areas,''
said Vaughn of the Renewable Fuels Association, noting that ethanol
poses no threat to water.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, some environmental analysts say neither ethanol nor
MTBE are really needed. A blue ribbon panel appointed by the US
Environmental Protection Agency concluded that today's vehicles
don't need an octane boost and called for reductions in the use of
both MTBE and ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air quality benefits are quite limited,'' said Early of
the Lung Association. ``To the extent you want to (subsidize
ethanol) for other reasons, that's fine,'' but ethanol actually
contributes to smog if it is not handled carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Unless ethanol critics can change the Clean Air Act, the octane
boost in reformulated gas will stay mandatory, and ethanol is best
positioned to gain. California officials say the switch from MTBE
to ethanol will increase gas prices by 6-7 cents a gallon, a figure
that Early says is likely to be higher for New England due to its
distance from refineries.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Rothstein of Environmental Futures, a consultant to BC
International, said his client plans to greatly reduce the ethanol
costs in New England by building a plant in the region that
converts unwanted potatoes or wood waste into ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``BCI would be an economic driver for New England,'' he said.

RADCLIFFE GETS SEVERAL BOOKS ONCE OWNED BY MARILYN MONROE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bodacious, blond, and blowing the inevitable lipsticked kiss,
Marilyn Monroe has always been Hollywood's ultimate sex icon. But
the curvy actress apparently fancied more than just men and fame.
</P>
<P>
   She collected literature. Everything from the selected works of
Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca to the collected works of
Sigmund Freud.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 of Monroe's books were auctioned off for thousands
of dollars with much of the rest of her remaining property in New
York in October. And now, in a move that could encourage a deeper
understanding of a cultural figure known more for child-like
innocence than intellectual striving, an anonymous donor has
presented a collection of Monroe's books by women authors to the
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so interesting is that so many people think of Marilyn
Monroe merely as a sexual object,'' said Barbara Haber, book
curator at Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library, which has the world's
largest collection of women's history books. ``It indicates that
Marilyn had the side to her that aspired to be an educated person,
a person who dealt with ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   That side was known to those who have written about Monroe,
including biographer Carl Rollyson, author of ``Marilyn Monroe: A
Life of the Actress'' and an English professor at the City
University of New York's Baruch College. ``Actually, she read quite
a bit . . . in spurts and starts. She was self-educated. And like
many self-educated people, she was ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   The five works given to Harvard by a Boston woman who purchased
them for $10,000 are timeworn with dusty spines, crumpled pages and
tattered jackets. The books _ Willa Cather's ``My Antonia'' and
``Lucy Gayheart,'' Carson McCullers's ``The Ballad of the Sad
Cafe,'' Grace Paley's ``The Little Disturbances of Man,'' and ``The
Portable Dorothy Parker'' _ are in no better shape than the
standard fare at any used bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   While the books bring no specific evidence with them of what
Monroe might have thought of them, or even if she specifically read
each, one of the five, Cathers' ``Lucy Gayheart,'' came with a note
from a New York friend of Monroe's. ``This is the book I spoke to
you about and think you might like,'' scribbled Ralph Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many of the themes the books explore, according to
academics and biographers of the actress, seem to fit the epic
sadness and frustration that tortured Monroe before she died from
an overdose of sleeping pills at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Parker's poems and stories also appear to reflect the
world of Monroe. Titles of some of the powerful poems in her
collected work include ``The Same to Me are Somber Days and Gay,''
``The Ladies Men Admire I've Heard,'' and ``There Was a Rose That
Faded Young.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Monroe was an orphan who was farmed out to 12 sets
of foster parents, dropped out of high school and married for the
first time at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cather's work about a woman trying to construct an identity
has its natural appeal,'' said Rollyson. ``Marilyn Monroe really
identified with victims, people who were striving to better
themselves. Some of those books carry those scenes. She was also
drawn to other scenes in these books, which feature ambitious and
successful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source of Monroe's literary interests, often obscured by
her famous marriage to baseball star Joe DiMaggio likely came from
her marriage to Arthur Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright, Rollyson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was influenced by the many people she met and especially
by her marriage to Miller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe died Aug. 5, 1962. She left all her belongings, including
gowns, scripts, furniture, jewelry, furs, photographs, and awards
to her acting coach and mentor, Lee Strasberg. He died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The collection had been in storage accumulating layers of dust
for four decades until October. Christie's auction house in New
York put everything from Monroe's oven mittens to a diamond ring
given to her by DiMaggio up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day auction of some 1,000 of her belongings netted more
than $13 million. The highest bid came for the dress Monroe wore
when she sang ``Happy Birthday'' to President Kennedy at New York's
Madison Square Garden in 1962. The snug dress pulled in $1.3
million from a store called `` Gotta Have It!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the books from Monroe's library, which featured first
editions including Jack Kerouac's ``On the Road'' and French
existentialist Albert Camus' ``The Fall,'' were listed for prices
between $800 and $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   But once the bidding got going, the prices soared. The anonymous
donor, for example, originally intended to buy two of Monroe's
cookbooks, ``The Fannie Farmer Cook Book'' and ``The Joy of
Cooking.'' But when the starting price for the two books jumped
from about $2,000 to $37,000, according to Haber, the woman set her
sights on the women's books.

CASTRO: MAKING WAVES AT EEOC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ida L. Castro was growing up in New York and Puerto Rico,
her father took her argumentative behavior as a sign: He thought it
showed a natural inclination toward law.
</P>
<P>
   Papa was right.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, the chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, has spent much of her 20-year legal career making
waves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Castro was appointed director of the Office of Workers'
Compensation Programs, where she managed a 1,500-member staff. Two
years later, she became acting director of the Women's Bureau at
the US Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who is in her 40s, was sworn in as chairwoman of the
EEOC in October 1998, the first Hispanic woman to serve in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Castro spent her first year concentrating on bolstering the once
ailing and cash-strapped federal agency. She has hired 450 new
staff, including paralegals, mediators, attorneys, and
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, these new hires have helped to reduce the
agency's 110,000-case backlog to 40,000. In addition, the EEOC has
collected $290 million in damages, settlements, and back wages over
the last year, up from $34 million in 1997 and the highest amount
in its 35-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Having received a $37 million budget increase for fiscal 1999,
Castro now manages an agency with 2,800 employees and a $282
million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The agency now categorizes cases according to importance. Prior
policy required that every charge be examined. These days, the most
egregious cases _ now 65 percent of the caseload _ are targeted for
litigation or referred to mediation. Complaints filed after the
statute of limitations expires are dismissed, and cases brought
under the wrong federal statute are referred to the appropriate
agency.
</P>
<P>
   One result, say some attorneys: Cases that used to take years to
resolve are now being seen, reviewed, and resolved within months,
with the agency's final recommendations or findings coming within
90 days of the first filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had 110,000 cases, the policy was to investigate each
and every one, whether or not it had merit,'' said Castro, who was
in Boston Thursday to speak at a luncheon sponsored by the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every charge was investigated, hence the backlog. Now, we
prioritize.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Griffin, executive director of the Disability Law
Center in Boston, which litigates cases under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, described Castro as a ``breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has made a significant impact,'' Griffin said. ``She has
supported more outreach into communities. She has gotten attorneys
out into the field, and she is doing much more litigation. The
agency seems much more proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where the EEOC office once relied on agency lawyers
from New York to prosecute local cases, Castro hired two lawyers
and a mediator. The agency also provides $1.4 million to the MCAD,
the EEOC's local partner.
</P>
<P>
   Under Castro, regional officers were required to develop plans
for tackling their backlogs through mediation, case dismissal, or
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Boston lawyer Dahlia Rudavsky of Messing &AMP; Rudavsky said she had
had mixed experiences with the EEOC. ``Some of the investigators
were diligent, and others were not,'' she said. ``But my most
recent contact with the new lawyers has been very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC was formed in 1964 to protect workers from
discrimination on the job. These days, the fastest-growing type of
claim involves employer retaliation against workers who have
brought workplace harassment or discrimination claims. Such cases,
Castro said, have increased from 7,900 in 1991 to 18,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said most employers have no idea that firing a person for
filing a claim with the agency, denying promotions, or ignoring and
condoning ill treatment of a claimant by co-workers could land them
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Most employees, she said, find the decision to file a complaint
with the agency a difficult one, requiring a lot of courage.
``People fear being branded. They fear retaliation, and they fear
job loss,'' Castro said. ``This is why one of our top priorities
will be to resolve these cases. . . . We have to protect the right
of people to pursue a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan in the 1950s, Castro is the daughter of Puerto
Rican immigrants who had each moved to the city before the Great
Depression. After working at several jobs, the couple opened a
small bodega, or grocery store, in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   When Castro was 6, her parents returned to Puerto Rico because
``they wanted me and my brother to learn the Puerto Rican
culture,'' she said. ``They also stressed education. They felt it
was a bridge to a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's brother, Ramon, is now an engineer in Puerto Rico, the
first in her extended family. She is the family's first lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, Castro became the youngest person and only woman to sit
on the municipal cabinet in Carolina, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who holds master's of science and doctoral degrees from
Rutgers University in New Jersey, was the first Hispanic woman to
gain tenure at the university's Institute for Management &AMP; Labor
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   A single mother, Castro said her daughter was a ``latch-key kid.
There was no other way of doing it. I had friends and colleagues,
but there was no family. They were in Puerto Rico. There was very
little day care, and it was expensive. So, I took my daughter to
meetings and to picket lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's daughter, now 28, is a social worker and advocate for
AIDS patients in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always said I should become a lawyer, because I was
always debating him,'' Castro said. ``But at the time, my only
perception of law was from the show `Perry Mason' and from a
neighbor who was a real estate lawyer. I knew I couldn't be Perry
Mason. But I didn't want to be like our neighbor, because he was
very dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I did what most teens do: I didn't pay any attention to
what my father said.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until she began delving into labor law while teaching labor
relations at Rutgers did Castro realize her calling. In 1979, she
enrolled in Rutgers School of Law, earning her degree in 1982.

A PITCH FOR FISK FOR THE HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 2000 Hall of Fame ballot is considerably lighter than last
year's edition. The 1999 sheet was weighed down by the monumental
achievements of George Brett, Robin Yount, and Nolan Ryan. Those
three were locks for immediate entry into Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   New England's own Carlton Fisk is the heavy holdover from the
1999 ballot and is certain to join brothers Brett, Young, and Ryan
when the 2000 tally is made public early next year.
</P>
<P>
   There are 30 names on this year's ballot, and Fisk may be the
only one to gain entry via the conventional method (being named on
75 percent of ballots cast). Makeup calls for old-timers and Negro
leagues players aren't announced until March.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk deserved to make the cut last winter but was overwhelmed by
the other names on the ballot. Perhaps it is better this way. He'll
have the stage to himself when the results are announced, and it's
been a long time since a native New Englander made this much
baseball noise.
</P>
<P>
   Omitting worthies such as Tony Perez, Jeff Reardon, Jim Kaat,
Jack Morris, Steve Garvey, Bert Blyleven, and Bruce Sutter, your
humble servant has checked the names of Fisk, Rich Gossage, Jim
Rice, Luis Tiant, and Gary Carter. I expect Fisk will be the only
one to get the required 75 percent. Perez has an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for the Hall of Fame is a great privilege. Along with
voting for MVP and Cy Young, it is the only important function
served by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Your servant
takes the responsibility seriously and is ever-willing to explain
his ballot and welcome all dissenting opinion. Hall of Fame
arguments are part of what makes baseball great.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk: He should have waltzed in with George, Nolan, and Robin.
He was named on 66.4 percent of the ballots in his first year of
eligibility. The pride of Bellows Falls, Vt., cauQ.7 more games and
hit more homers than any other catcher in baseball history. That
should do it right there. He was an 11-time All-Star, a Gold Glove
winner, and hit one of the most famous homers in baseball lore.
Mark your calendar for Cooperstown next summer. Catcher Carlton is
a lock.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage: He is the only ``new'' candidate getting my vote.
Gossage saved 310 games in 22 seasons, pitched in three World
Series, and was named to nine All-Star teams. Statistically, he is
less than Sutter (who has struggled to get 25 percent of the votes)
or Reardon, another first-time candidate. But if you watched
baseball over the last 25 years, you would put Gossage ahead of
those guys. Sutter was dominant and invented the split-finger
fastball. Reardon racked up 367 saves. But Gossage was the true
closer. Remember him getting Yaz to pop up in 1978? The Goose gets
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rice: He's not going to make it. His vote total went from 203 in
'98 to 146 last year. He needs more than twice that to make the
cut. Rice's 10-year domination falls shy (like Tony Oliva's) for
most voters, and his churlish personality hasn't helped. I probably
vote for him because he was so uncooperative, just to avoid that
tag that ``poor Jim''is kept out by bitter writers who never got
good interviews. As it is, Rice stands alone with his numbers, and
they are borderline by Hall standards for outfielders. Ralph Kiner
(look him up) makes the best case for Rice, but Kiner shouldn't be
in there, either.
</P>
<P>
   Tiant: Voting for three Red Sox players, I feel a little like
George ``Home Cooking'' King of the New York Post (the man who
stiffed Pedro). Tiant has no chance and will be turned over to the
old-timers committee in two more years, but his career numbers are
equal to or better than those of Hall members Don Drysdale and
Catfish Hunter, both of whom played on better teams. Plus, we all
know Luis was the man you wanted in a big game.
</P>
<P>
   Carter: The more you look at it, voting for Fisk requires one to
vote for Carter. He is almost Fisk's equal in every offensive
category, won three Gold Gloves, and made 11 All-Star teams. Need
we remind Boston fans that Carter's two-out single off Calvin
Schiraldi started the Game 6 rally that hospitalized hundreds in
Greater Boston? Why does this man get half the votes Fisk gets? It
isn't right.
</P>
<P>
   I try to vote for the same people every year. Retired players
don't get better or worse from year to year _ and the idea of
making anyone wait is stupid. I voted for Ron Santo until he left
the ballot (after 15 years, they turn players over to the
old-timers committee) and will hang with Tiant to the finish.
Through the years, I have changed my mind on a few players. NL
folks talked me out of voting for Garvey and Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez may make it in 2000. He was named on 302 ballots (60.8
percent) last year and should benefit from a weaker ballot and
renewed support. A pro-Perez group has been lobbying hard. They
sent me a stat sheet and T-shirt. Sorry, he knocked in a ton of
runs, but his life was made easier by table-setters Pete Rose and
Joe Morgan. He was never as dominant as Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is a worthy candidate and was a terrific big-game pitcher
(remember the seventh game of the 1991 World Series?), but a 3.90
ERA is too high for the Hall. Kaat (283 wins) is probably a better
candidate and has never gotten a sniff. Blyleven (287 wins, 3.31
ERA) is a better choice than both, but can't get voters' attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it means so much. You can win 280 games and hit 360
homers in the big leagues. You can win a couple of MVPs (Dale
Murphy) and set the all-time save record. But Cooperstown is
reserved only for the truly great. And as much as I'd like to vote
for Bruce Hurst and Dave Henderson, they were Hall of Famers only
in the hearts of Red Sox fans for one brief moment in 1986.

CHRISTIAN MEDIA OFFER MORE THAN TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative Christians looking for religious-oriented sources
of news and entertainment do not have to be satisfied with Pat
Robertson, or even Pat Boone.
</P>
<P>
   --Direct satellite service. Sky Angel, a Florida company, was
licensed three years ago to broadcast from a satellite, whose
signal ``cannot be interrupted or influenced by secular media `gate
keepers.' '' Sky Angel bypasses secular television and cable
stations in favor of 24 Christian channels.
</P>
<P>
   --Curse-free TV. A computer made in New Orleans scans
closed-captioning signals and mutes a list of 100 offensive words.
The system retails for about $150, and has ``Strict'' and
``Tolerant'' settings, as well as a ``Religious'' setting that does
not screen out words like ``God,'' ``Jesus,'' and ``Christ'' when
used in the context of a sermon, rather than an exclamation.
</P>
<P>
   --Christian Internet service providers. Dozens of companies
provide self-censoring, competitively priced alternatives to
Internet service providers such as America OnLine and Yahoo.
William Bennett and Ralph Reed helped launch this.com in July; the
server filters out flesh tones, which could indicate pornography,
and hate speech. Pat Robertson's son, Tim, announced his service,
FamilyClick.com, the same month.
</P>
<P>
   --Video games. With The War in Heaven, which went on sale in
October, Eternal Warriors introduced a Bible-based alternative to
PC-based ``first-person shooters'' like Doom and Quake. Another 3-D
shooter is Saints of Virtue, which challenges players to fight
their way through the Mall of Worldliness, the Amphitheater of
Apathy, and the New Age Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   --On-line shopping. On-line shopping malls like Gospelnet.com
have created a vast gateway for Christian books, music, movies, and
tapes, as well as specialty products such as Happy Hank, a stuffed
hound programmed to say 15 Christian phrases including ``Rejoice!
You're a son of the King!''
</P>
<P>
   --Long-distance carrier. Among the companies offering Christian
long-distance service is Missionlink Communications, which
contributes a percentage of its revenues to missionaries in Asia
and Africa.

<P>
   WATERVILLE, Maine _ Taki Pilitsis is knee-deep in media. While
his mother checks financial markets on her laptop across the room,
he sits in front of a personal computer, legs poking out of
cavernous shorts, pounding keys that control a prowling warrior.
His bedroom is papered with posters of athletes captured in midair,
sweat flying. Although he has spent most of his life in central
Maine, he has a favorite rapper.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely, and note that he is shooting his way through
The Mall of Worldliness and defending himself with exploding Bible
verses; the lyrics he sings could be mistaken for hip-hop romance
but actually refer to Jesus. And at 12, Taki has only dim
impressions of the Backstreet Boys, Pokemon, Doom, or Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   At an age when boys turn eagerly to popular culture, he lives in
a media world carefully built by his mother, Allison Pilitsis, who
became a born-again Christian eight years ago after a long
conversation with a Baptist manicurist. Conservative Christians
like Pilitsis have long been able to turn to ``The 700 Club'' for
Pat Robertson's take on the news, but in recent years, technology
and investment have pushed this niche market into overdrive.
Increasingly, they have the option not only of supplementing
secular media, but of replacing it _ with religious Internet
service providers and religious long-distance carriers,
Christian-centered sports journalism, Bible-based financial advice,
Christian-only direct satellite broadcast, and Christian combat
computer action games.
</P>
<P>
   All of which allows Pilitsis to remove her children from the
influence of most popular culture without making them feel cut off.
``They're doing all the things that other kids are doing, but
they're doing them in their own realm,'' said Pilitsis, 49, who
attends the Faith Evangelical Free Church in Oakland. ``So I don't
think they're missing out.''
</P>
<P>
   When talking about the technology that makes it possible to
raise faithful children in a secular world, Pilitsis closes her
eyes in gratitude. Other parents interviewed _ united by the fear
that younger and younger children are buffeted with images of
violence and sex _ spoke with optimism about the loosening grip of
network news and the daily paper. Scott Somerville, an attorney
with the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association, said
that he can now look into the future and envision the development
of a rich Christian ``countermedia'' _ a ``ghetto'' in the best
sense of the term, giving communities the ability to preserve their
faith in the face of ``a hostile dominant culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many others look warily at this development, arguing that
Christ called his followers to work in the world, not run from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's getting to the point where technology will allow
you to create a bubble around yourself so you don't need to
interact with the outside world, the `fallen world,' '' said Greg
Boyd, a professor of theology at Bethel College and pastor of
Woodland Hills Church in St. Paul. ``You develop a whole culture of
people who are completely incapable of holding a conversation with
someone who doesn't hold their world view.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are hoping to bridge that gap with products that can
compete with mainstream offerings. Taki and his 9-year-old brother,
Alex, are the kinds of customers that Theo Beale, 31, was thinking
of when his company, Eternal Warriors, unveiled The War in Heaven,
a Christian-themed, 3-D combat, action-video game that pits zaftig
blond angels against demons with clubs and cloven hoofs. Beale
intentionally designed the game to satisfy teenage players of
``first-person shooters'' like Doom and Quake. And Boyd, who has
test-marketed The War in Heaven with his 14-year-old son, said
Beale's game is a vast improvement on more conservative Christian
computer games, such as one whose goal was fitting as many animals
as possible on Noah's Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that The War in Heaven, with its vivid,
rapid-fire, hand-to-hand combat, is violent. But Beale says
Christian publishers cannot ignore popular culture. ``If you want
to reach people, you have to speak the Gospel to them in their
language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Beale, who also writes Christian fantasy novels, recent
developments have expanded the market into a playground of
opportunity. Part of this expansion is pure capitalism _ as a niche
market, the country's 80 million active, churchgoing Christians are
increasingly hard to ignore. The average children's department in a
Christian retail store last year grew by 22 percent, according to
the Christian Booksellers' Association, and Christian-themed
fiction is the fastest-growing genre in publishing, according to
Salem Communications.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of crossover hits for adults _ the
``Assassins'' has spent four months on the New York Times'
best-seller list; Hollywood was shocked when the film ``The Omega
Code'' was lofted by church-centered promotion into the 10
top-grossing films; and the Christian-influenced rock band Creed
made it to No. 3 on the Billboard alternative singles chart in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology has made publishing far easier. ``If I had
wanted to print a book up 10 years ago, I could have spent my life
savings and made a crappy little vanity press thing,'' said Beale,
in a telephone interview from his home in Switzerland. Now ``for
three or four bucks a copy, I can produce a nice-looking paperback
that is every bit as good as the national media can do. . . . The
giants can no longer control what other people are printing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, anymore, can they control what people are reading.
Pilitsis, who left town in 1972 riding high as a former Miss
Waterville, returned 23 years later, newly divorced and with two
young children. After working overseas for most of that time as a
travel executive, she returned to a United States that shocked her
with its sloppy dress, contempt for authority, and embrace of
premarital sex and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Raised on network news, she began to question the objectivity of
mainstream media. Then she gave up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it, and I can't get away from it, so I'm just going
to do without it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about the media are a central battleground for many
conservative Christian parents, said others interviewed. Susan
Blake of Brewer said her 11-year-old son relies heavily on reruns
of ``The Waltons'' and ``My Three Sons''; Calvin Lawson of the
Cherry Valley neighborhood in Leicester, Mass., makes sure his
children can balance the ``secular news'' with the conservative
reporting of WorldNetDaily. Most parents agreed that the battle
grows harder with age. Eric Unsworth, a Hamilton, Mass., father,
said as his children grew into teenagers, separating them from the
``cultural smog'' proved ``less doable than we hoped,'' giving rise
to case-by-case negotiation about music and movies.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Pilitsis has succeeded in what she set out to do. A
year ago, she canceled her subscription to the Waterville Morning
Sentinel because she did not want her children to read coverage of
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. She is boycotting Disney, and has
soured on the Public Broadcasting System, whose approach to
religion strikes her as scholarly, rather than faith-based, and put
a block on Nickelodeon, which she criticizes as ``very
evolution-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Investors' Business Daily _ which she needs for her
on-line trading _ Newsweek, and two children's sports publications,
Pilitsis' subscriptions are explicitly Christian. On her wish list
is Sky Angel, a satellite broadcasting package that will allow her
to receive 24 Christian channels, bypassing all other channels, and
that, its advertisement promises, ``cannot be interrupted or
influenced by secular media `gate keepers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is little longing for forbidden media in the Pilitsis
household _ in large part, Pilitsis said, because her sons are
rarely exposed to it and ``there's not a lot of discretionary time
for them to be where I can't see them.'' For the last three years,
she has floated the idea of home-schooling them, but they have
resisted the idea, she said. As it is, they go to a Christian
school, attend a Christian youth group, play in a Christian
basketball league, and the only time they spend with children
outside their faith is when they play with their cousins in a local
soccer league. She has heard secular radio stations playing
upstairs, but only a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for kids to be able to stand up for what they
know is right when they've got kids around them that might ridicule
them,'' she said. ``It's a battle for the kids, no matter what we
do at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who see an answer in a Christian ``countermedia,'' it
is less a new world than a re-creation of an old world _ one that
is irretrievably lost. ``As recently as 1962, a child would go to
school and read the King James Bible, say grace before dinner, and
then watch `Father Knows Best,' and everyone went to Sunday
school,'' said Somerville. ``We've shifted from a society that
enforced generic Protestant norms to, in the last 20 years, a kind
of multicultural idea. So what if the Protestant minority decides
to create its own counterculture?''
</P>
<P>
   Pilitsis says her battle to protect her family has mostly been a
winning one. But in the back of her mind is the worry that the same
technology that makes her all-Christian-all-the-time household
possible also poses a danger. A few weeks ago Taki, on the brink of
becoming a teenager, asked to be allowed to watch the latest James
Bond film, and was denied. ``I just kind of got over it,'' he said,
but the next dilemma is already lined up: He wants his own e-mail
account with his own password. Pilitsis sighs, looking slightly
exhausted. She has passed on Taki's request to her pastor, and she
is waiting for him to call back.

THE POLITICS OF REPUTATION PRECEDES THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart O'Nan has an interesting, if bleak, essay in the current
Boston Review on the literary fortunes of the late novelist Richard
Yates. Yates was once the talk of the town, a National Book Award
finalist hailed as a giant talent by the likes of Tennessee
Williams, Dorothy Parker, and Ann Beattie. Now, well, if his name
showed up on ``Jeopardy,'' it would certainly go unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his work was neglected during his lifetime, after his death
it has practically disappeared,'' writes O'Nan, himself a novelist.
``To write so well and then to be forgotten is a terrifying
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sic transit gloria mundi. Why do writers write? ``No man but a
blockhead ever wrote except for money,'' Samuel Johnson famously
said. Yet Johnson himself penned occasional sermons, gratis, for
his bishop pals. Yes, some authors write with an eye toward
salvation, but most writers write for a different reason: to be
read, and to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the politics of reputation are so ferocious. For
dead white males, the canon is shrinking, and you can hear the
beams squealing as the House of Fame collapses inward. Somerset
Maugham and Graham Greene _ who they? A recent article by Roger
Kimball in the New Criterion bemoans the shredding of T. S. Eliot,
arguably the most influential writer and critic of the century.
Kimball's little quip: ``Mistah Eliot _ he dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The American West has always entered special pleadings in this
category. The minute you cross the Sierra Nevada, you hear of
nothing but the S-Men _ Steinbeck, Stegner, and Saroyan _ cast down
by the New York critics. Each case stands separately. Steinbeck,
his claque insists, supported the Vietnam War, and thus forfeited
the cachet that only the left-leaning, New York intelligentsia can
confer. It is true, incredibly, that the New York Times
editorialized against Steinbeck's Nobel Prize, the day after he won
it. The award ``raises questions about the mechanics of selection
and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of
American writing,'' quoth the newspaper of record.
</P>
<P>
   Saroyan was a talented feuilletonist now unjustly neglected _ it
is said, absurdly _ because of his Armenian nationality. Stegner's
biographer, Jackson Benson, claims his subject was ``possibly the
most accomplished person of American letters in our time,'' yet
complains that he ``has been ignored, even belittled as a
Westerner.''
</P>
<P>
   What bosh. The most revered author in the American canon, Mark
Twain, was also a Westerner, albeit one who came East and broke
bread with the grandees of the New York-Boston literary axis. (As
did Stegner.) Stegner was good, real good, and he had a Pulitzer
Prize and a National Book Award to prove it. Yes, he suffered some
bad treatment. The Times never reviewed his Pulitzer-winning novel,
``Angle of Repose.'' After it won, their chief literary critic
complained that the Pulitzer should have gone to John Updike for
``Rabbit Redux.'' But just as good news travels perhaps too slowly
from the Left Coast, so, too, does bad news. The embarrassing
plagiarism revelations that tarnished ``Repose'' were mostly the
stuff of Bay Area salon gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The tide of reputation, of course, flows both ways. T. S. Eliot,
ironically, brought John Donne and the metaphysical poets back into
the ``core curriculum'' that has bedeviled liberal arts majors for
decades. Herman Melville passed on not knowing that he had written
the proverbial Great American Novel. William Faulkner owed Malcolm
Cowley a debt of gratitude for repackaging his work for a new,
larger public.
</P>
<P>
   Reputation is all about debt, and hope, as O'Nan makes clear at
the end of his essay on Yates: ``For now, writers will have to keep
the novels and stories of Richard Yates alive, rescuing copies from
used bookstores and passing them along to students and fellow
writers. . . . We shouldn't have to do it, but we will, gladly.
Perhaps in the future, if we're lucky, someone will do it for us.''

   If there was any doubt remaining that George W. Bush had himself
a pretty good night Monday debating the Republicans chasing him, it
evaporated in the post-debate humbug that MSNBC served up to those
for whom 90 minutes was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw, the strolling anchorman who was one of the co-hosts
for the nicely formatted event, was schmoozing Bush afterward
during what the pols call ``the spin cycle.'' This now-customary
dessert follows the actual debate itself, the meat-and-potatoes
segment of your TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw was letting Bush talk himself out, in the manner of
post-game interviewers bracing a sweating football player en route
to the dressing room. Bush, whose first two outings against live
ammunition left even some of his partisans gagging, was elated with
his performance. ``You did a good job tonight,'' the Texas governor
complimented Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   This was the equivalent of the pupil giving the professor a
chuck on the old shoulder and telling him confidently the lecture
was dandy. For a month we've been hearing whispers about Bush's
brain power and cranial capacity. Even some of Bush's handlers had
to be wondering if their guy was ever going to show he had the
right stuff. Monday night reassured them.
</P>
<P>
   As the least-experienced of all six candidates in terms of
televised debates, Bush surpassed expectations for the first time.
He's not yet in Clinton's league _ it's doubtful he ever will be _
but he was good enough to protect his big lead in Iowa, and
probably good enough to stall the John McCain surge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the feisty Arizonan who has run the best campaign of any
of the eight major party candidates, has nosed ahead of Bush in New
Hampshire, the only place in the land where Bush trails anyone in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Republicans who'll come out in the cold and dark on
caucus night Jan. 24 are a very conservative bunch. Bush took some
light jabs from some of the right-wingers back in the pack, Gary
Bauer, Alan Keyes, and Senator Orrin Hatch, none of whom has a
ghost of a chance of being nominated. There were some more
ineffectual pawings from Steve Forbes, the hapless
billionaire-turned-millionaire, whose magazine fortune is being
spent down as he pursues his pricey trip-to-nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rich man sitting down to a banquet, Bush kept turning up
his nose at invitations proffered by the less fortunate: No, he
told Bauer, he won't take a pledge to appoint only antiabortion
running mates or federal judges. And, no, he scoffed to McCain, he
won't sign on to any campaign finance reform scheme that doesn't
curb union contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, the gutsy McCain was the one who carried the fight. The
crowd in the hall began booing when they realized he was attacking
federal subsidies for ethanol, the corn-based gasoline additive
that soaks up some excess Iowa grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you things you don't want to hear,'' said the
old fighter pilot and POW. ``Everybody here on this stage, if it
wasn't for the fact that Iowa has the first caucuses, would share
my view that we don't need ethanol subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush happily appropriated the ground McCain conceded. ``I'd have
supported ethanol whether I was here in Iowa or not,'' he claimed
with a straight face. ``It's good for our air. It's good for the
air, it's good for the quality of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   When that particular smog bank cleared, others rushed in to
defend the Iowa farmers' right to pocket the ethanol subsidy. There
was so much stroking of the downtrodden farmer, and promises to do
better by what H. L. Mencken used to call ``the horny-handed
husbandman,'' that the bilious Sage of Baltimore might be rolling
over six feet under the buncombe layer of permafrost in which the
old newspaperman is buried.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose modus operandi is never to return to base without
having expended all ammo and armaments, challenged Bush to agree to
ban soft money, the six-figure donations by which the major parties
fund their lavish operations and TV buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my worry with your plan. It's going to hurt the
Republican Party, John,'' said the Texas governor, calling it
``unilateral disarmament'' for Republicans. McCain tried to regain
the offensive by asking, ``How did Ronald Reagan get elected?''
Soft money was not a factor in the Reagan election of 1980, but
Bush evaded the trap by seguing into an attack on labor unions as
tools of the Democratic Party. Brokaw employed a clever device by
grilling each man on specific aspects of the Iowa Republican Party
state platform, a document so tilted to the right that Bush and
McCain had to tap dance away from some of its sterner provisions on
abortion and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Born Again crowd had to love Bush's response when asked
which ``political philosopher'' he most admires. Given all the
speculation about the vacant space between the Bush earlobes, I
half-expected some goofy rejoinder like ``Bart Simpson'' or
``Waylon Jennings.'' But Bush said: ``Christ . . . When you turn
your heart and life over to Christ, when you accept Christ as your
savior it changes your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political philosopher was Teddy Roosevelt, the hard
charger who took San Juan Hill and ramrodded the Panama Canal. But
not even the Old Rough Rider could trump The Lord. So Bush has it
all going for him now, even the Deity. McCain's last, best hope is
those New Hampshire independents. If they don't stick with him,
against ethanol subsidies and Big Money and Business As Usual, the
old Navy flyboy is going down.

LAWYER'S WEDDING BELLS RAISE LIFESTYLE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The invitation landed in David Levenstein's mailbox in
late June, doubling his reasons to celebrate: just weeks before he
was to be married, the Amherst man was offered a coveted spot on
the law review at Western New England School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein was jubilant _ until he realized that his wedding, an
out-of-state affair, conflicted with orientation. And the school
wouldn't budge. No orientation, no law review. So Levenstein, 36,
chose to take his vows and sacrifice the plum position, a decision,
he believes has already cost him one job offer.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, the incident seemed little more than a regrettable
footnote in one aspiring lawyer's career. Then, word of
Levenstein's dilemma spread beyond the Springfield campus, becoming
a cause celebre of the Boston Bar Association, which recently
released a study damning the legal profession for its emphasis on
work over family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just totally horrified,'' said Lauren Rikleen, immediate
past president of the BBA, whose Task Force on Professional Values
and Family Needs found that 43 percent of new associates quit
within three years, largely because they felt they had to choose
between a career and a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be no better example of what it is we're trying to
adddress _ the idea that work matters above all else, that there
are no other values in life,'' Rikleen said. ``I mean, this was his
wedding!''
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein's law review invitation, dated June 29, 1999, arrived
roughly seven weeks before he was to be married in Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was scheduled for Aug. 22, a date that had been set
the previous December. Flowers had been ordered. A caterer,
photographer, and band had been hired. Invitations to nearly 120
friends and family members, some from out of the country, had been
mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Law review orientation, meanwhile, ran from Aug. 21 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he had a conflict, Levenstein dashed off an e-mail to
the journal's faculty adviser, Leora Harpaz, explaining his
dilemma. Her answer: make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein e-mailed again, this time suggesting alternatives. He
offered to study beforehand, tape the orientation sessions, and
listen to them later. In response, Harpaz withdrew her invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Levenstein's experience became fodder for the
student newspaper, which chronicled the case in a story headlined
``Marriage Plans Cause Stormy Romance With Law Review.''
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece accompanying the story, Howard Kalodner,
Harpaz's husband and the school's former dean, justified the
administration's decision by writing that law review takes ``a
willingness to submerge one's personal priorities to the priorities
of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   At most law schools, an invitation to join the law review _ a
scholarly journal that covers a broad range of legal issues _ is a
prestigious honor offered only to the creme de la creme. It is a
sought-after line on a resume, since many law firms heavily recruit
law review participants.
</P>
<P>
   Kalodner was out of town and could not be reached for comment,
according to a school spokesman, and Harpaz was also unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dunn, dean of the law school, called the situation
``unfortunate,'' but said law review orientation is ``extremely
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the only thing I could say is that our law review was
not especially flexible,'' said Dunn. ``But the individual involved
was not flexible at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said, for example, that he offered to use school funds to
fly Levenstein to and from Massachusetts the day before his wedding
so he could attend one day of orientation. He said Levenstein
rejected the offer, calling it impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn also promised Levenstein a law review position in his third
year, and has placed a letter explaining the situation in
Levenstein's student file, which goes to all prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   But Levenstein, who believes he lost out on a summer position at
a Hartford law firm because he could not tout law review among his
accomplishments, said the position is more influential in his
second year, when he is interviewing for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And he scoffs at school officials' reasoning that he should have
anticipated a law review invitation and planned his wedding at a
different time, noting that his marriage was scheduled months
before the academic calendar was set.
</P>
<P>
   At Shatz, Schwartz and Fentin, the Springfield law firm where
Levenstein works as a part-time law clerk, his colleagues support
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's true, in general, that your personal life
sometimes has to take a backseat to your professional life,'' said
Levenstein's boss, Mark Bluver, a partner in the firm. ``But
suggesting that he should have changed his wedding date so he could
make a week of orientation is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein's dilemma so incensed Boston attorney Nancer Ballard,
chairwoman of the Boston bar's work-family task force, that she
plans to ask the group that accredits law schools to include
work-family balance in its evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really does stand as a dramatic example of the
work-family conflict issue,'' said Rikleen. ``What could be more
stark than someone having to choose between his wedding day and
something that has life-long implications for his career?''

BETWEEN FRIENDS, NO EASY ACCORD ON GOLAN HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIBBUTZ MEROM GOLAN, Golan Heights _ They are best friends, and
have been for a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Zelzion and Shefi Mor, both 40, served in the same Israeli
infantry unit and were stationed on this strategic plateau in the
mid-1970s when they embraced the Zionist dream of the kibbutz
movement.
</P>
<P>
   So they stayed at Merom Golan. They married here. They raised
children.
</P>
<P>
   And now they are faced with the prospect of Israel returning the
Golan Heights to Syria after capturing it in the 1967 Six Day War.
The Syrian-Israeli talks set to begin in Washington Wednesday _ the
highest level peace negotiations ever between two countries that
have been bitter enemies for 50 years _ leave the two friends
deeply worried about the fate of their homes, their families, and
the lives they've built together. It also leaves them deeply
divided.
</P>
<P>
   For Zelzion, giving up the Golan, with its cattle ranches,
vineyards, and crucial water resources, is an insane risk and an
unforgivable betrayal of the goals of Zionism. For Mor, returning
the terraced hills where 18,000 Israeli residents live is a painful
but necessary sacrifice to allow future generations to reap the
benefits of a lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want peace just like everyone else,'' said Zelzion. ``But
land for peace does not work. I don't trust Syria. You have to
build trust. Why are we running so fast?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these negotiations will be good for all of Israel,''
countered Mor, the financial administrator for the kibbutz's
agricultural operation. ``The problem is not my private problem, it
is the problem of the whole state of Israel. . . . Even if it means
we have to give up our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were sitting in the bar of the kibbutz's Country
Style Restaurant Tuesday, the end of a day that marked the 19th
anniversary of Israel's 1980 annexation of the Golan Heights.
Israel captured the area in 1967 and then held onto it in a round
of even more intense fighting in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   A cold rain pounded against the tin roof. They drank beer,
listened to American rock 'n' roll, and ribbed each other as they
always do. They have the same mannerisms, the same thick beards.
They say a lot to each other without uttering a word. And like many
close friends, they joked about how they've become ``a couple of
old ladies disagreeing about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is more than a political argument. It is a disagreement
about the future of their lives, about their homes, about the lives
they have built together. It's about what, in the end, all the work
they have put into the kibbutz, into its cattle ranch and orchards,
means to them. It is about whether or not they still believe in
their country.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak begins talks in Washington
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa, not only the two
friends but all of Israel seems divided over the prospect of a
land-for-peace deal, which could also be a key first step toward
disentangling from the civil war in neighboring Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zelzion and Mor served in Lebanon in their many years of
army reserve duty. They agree on the importance of getting out of
Lebanon, a conflict that is widely viewed as a proxy war for Syria,
which has some 35,000 troops stationed there and provides support
to Hezbollah guerrillas fighting the Israeli occupation of a
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' within south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends want to see the bloodshed stop. Like many Golan
residents, they are very secular and very liberal within the
spectrum of Israeli politics. And it is uncomfortable for them to
see hawks like Likud party leader Ariel Sharon speaking on their
behalf in the parliament, and religious Zionists of the ``Yesha''
settler movement coming to their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan question has both forged strange alliances in Israel
and caused new political divisions in the Golan community, as the
nation prepares for a looming political battle if Barak reaches an
agreement with Syria and brings it to a national referendum, as he
has vowed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us feel uncomfortable with this,'' said Zelzion as he
contemplated a battle to keep the Golan. ``Who do we need to
support us? We need the middle class, the classic Labor Party
voters. As soon as they see us with Yesha, they will vote against
us. This is how we will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   A pullout from Golan would end a way of life for families who
settled here over the last three decades. Israel's finest wines
come from lush vineyards that dot the hillsides. The city of
Kazrin, with a population of 7,000, is proceeding to construct new
neighborhoods and a $7 million Teachers College. The hotels and
bed-and-breakfasts perched on the hills do a brisk business.
</P>
<P>
   Merom Golan, with 500 residents the oldest and largest kibbutz
in the Golan, is in the heart of this community. Three generations
have tilled its apple orchards, mined its volcanic rock quarries,
labored in an engine factory, and tended to its livestock.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine Israel abandoning a place like Meron
Golan or displacing the 18,000 Israelis who live in the network of
settlements and newly constructed towns. At the very least, it
would be a traumatizing and expensive endeavor. And not
surprisingly, the renewed talks with Syria leave those who staked
their claim here feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here with the pure Zionist dream. We came here because
we believed in it, and because the government encouraged us to
believe in it,'' said Zelzion, who is raising three children, ages
7 to 12, and who runs the ``Coffee in the Clouds'' cafe on a
hilltop where he once served as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then everything that you believed in, everything you have
fought for and worked so hard for is collapsing,'' he added. ``And
the government tells you that you are an obstacle to peace. We have
been used. And I am bitter about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mor, who has children the same ages as his friend and has seen
the younger generation become best friends as well, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't feel that way,'' he said, casting a sharp look at
his friend. ``There wouldn't be any peace process if the kibbutzim
hadn't been here for 32 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he does not feel betrayed, and that it is time for
those who came here to see that their role is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look to the future for all of Israel, and for our
children,'' he said.

KIMBERLY JENSEN'S FINAL, ELUSIVE JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kimberly S. Jensen didn't call her husband until she reached
Ocean City, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, the number two executive in Mortimer Zuckerman's
publishing empire, was questioned Nov. 4 by company officials about
what appeared to be improper use of an expense account she
controlled at the Atlantic Monthly in Boston. When she failed to
appear at a meeting with a lawyer in New York a week later to
discuss the allegations, her husband reported her missing.
</P>
<P>
   Her call came a day later. She wouldn't tell him where she was
but said simply that she was ending her life.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by her husband, Steven Fuchs, New York City police
traced the call to a beachfront hotel in Ocean City and alerted
local police. She convinced them there had been a mistake and that
she had no intention of harming herself.
</P>
<P>
   After the police left, the 44-year-old executive called her
husband again, warning him not to tell anyone where she was.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw Jensen wandering the beach the next day, Nov. 12.
At 12:45 p.m. on Nov. 13, a maid discovered her body on a bed in
her hotel room. A plastic bag was tied around her head. Jensen left
no note. This week, Ocean City police ruled her death a suicide,
listing her cause of death as asphyxiation ``aided'' by alcohol and
Benadryl, a common cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why she felt she had to do it,'' said Fuchs
during a telephone interview last week from the couple's home in
Killington, Vt. ``But it's not what people might want to think. It
wasn't the money. I know it wasn't the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her colleagues agree. Those who knew her well say they
don't believe the demanding, talented, and highly respected leader
would have killed herself because of the allegations, even if they
are true. ``She was too tough, too smart, and in the end it just
wasn't that big a deal,'' said an Atlantic employee.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been deeper reasons for her actions, others say.
Despite having advanced from a low-level position at US News &AMP;
World report to one of the most visionary forces in Zuckerman's
company, Jensen appeared to have been driven by a thirst for some
unattainable success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that she was a happy person,'' said a former
co-worker at the Atlantic. ``She was an amazingly hard worker and
also intensely private, so it was hard to get a fix on her. But I
got a feeling sometimes. Something she'd do or say would just make
me wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jensen went to work for the Atlantic in 1988, moving to Boston
from suburban Washington, D.C., where she had attended George Mason
University, had a failed marriage, and worked as an assistant
treasurer at US News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Her impact at the Atlantic was almost immediate. She was among
the first at the magazine to perceive the importance of the
Internet, and recruited young workers at the magazine to help bring
the Atlantic on line, former employees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an absolute visionary,'' said Lowell Weiss, a Clinton
administration speech writer who was an Atlantic intern when Jensen
persuaded him to join the Atlantic full time and explore the
possibilities of an on-line magazine. ``She saw something in me
that I didn't see in myself. She gave me the vision of what we were
doing and convinced me I could do it. She was very special in her
ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she won a loyal following, particularly among young
people who felt she had taken an interest in their careers, she
also became known for publicly berating those she felt were not
living up to her standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had no problem excoriating people, I mean really letting
them have it,'' said a former Atlantic employee. ``It was pretty
well known that you didn't want to get on her bad side.''
</P>
<P>
   And many felt she was cold and remote, speaking only on business
terms and avoiding personal conversations in the hallways, favoring
solitary work in her office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she caught the attention of corporate executives who
moved her steadily upward at the magazine and eventually tapped her
to help launch the Internet monthly, Fast Company, based in Boston.
She is credited with writing a business plan for the magazine that
was instrumental in casting it as a hipper-than-hip journal of the
new economy. Claiming a friendship with writer Hunter S. Thompson,
a former editor said, she selected one of his quotes as the
magazine's motto: ``Go faster and faster until the fear of death is
overcome by speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while Jensen's magazine career was advancing, she began to
pursue another love _ music. Friends said she was obsessed with
popular music. She once camped overnight for Pearl Jam tickets and
often went to bars in Boston and Killington to see new bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she saw a Virginia band called Genghis Angus perform at
an Irish pub in Killington. The band played a folksy rock called
``no depression,'' which is ``all about hope and redemption,'' said
Guy Burlage, who was a friend of Jensen. ``She was raptured by it
from the very beginning, really taken in.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, she introduced herself to the band's leader and
main songwriter, Allen Kitselman of Berryville, Va. The two
immediately hit it off, Kitselman said, and he confessed to her
that he was worn out and planned to quit.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of the next several weeks, Jensen talked him
out of it. ``She believed in me,'' Kitselman said. ``She gave me
the gift of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen told the band she would take them on as a personal
project, and one member recalled that she said, ``We are going to
make America love you.''
</P>
<P>
   She formed a record company called Adrenachrome, named after the
fictitious hallucinogenic drug in Thompson's novel ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   She put together slick press materials, including a Web site,
and worked record industry contacts she had made. She persuaded the
producers of pop star John Mellencamp to produce a Genghis Angus
album.
</P>
<P>
   She also pumped money into the endeavor. David Galinsky, the
booking agent Jensen hired to schedule shows for the band, said she
paid him a salary that he declined to disclose but that was ``good
enough for me to get by on.'' He said she paid for promotional
expenses and the production and manufacture of the album and she
paid for part of the tour, all of which totaled ``probably about
$150,000 over the course of a couple years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my expenses I just sent to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her support and the recognition she won for the band,
her management style didn't always sit well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very strong-willed,'' Galinsky said. ``It was her way
or the highway. We went through a number of people in the band.
She'd say, `This guy doesn't sound right. It's just not working
out, and he's got to go.' '' Galinsky said Jensen once told him the
band was like a surrogate family, taking the place of children she
was unable to have on her own. ``She said, `Maybe I'll adopt all
you boys and you can be my kids.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she landed a deal with a Boston label, Eastern Front
Records, and the band went on tour _ financed in part by the record
label, partly by Jensen, and partly by Fast Company, which signed
on as a sponsor. But the album didn't sell, and in December 1998,
she parted with the band, telling Kitselman, ``It doesn't make
sense to put any more money into this.''

 UNDATED: ... into this.''

   A month later, Jensen was promoted and moved her offices to
Zuckerman's headquarters in New York. The new job required her to
juggle frenetic demands. To oversee the magazines in her command _
Fast Company, the Atlantic, and US News &AMP; World Report _ she flew
up and down the East Coast each week, spending a few days in
Boston, New York, and Washington, before beginning the circuit
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exhausting schedule,'' said a Zuckerman company
spokeswoman. ``But she seemed to us such a professional person,
very controlled and able to absorb tremendous amounts of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   There were growing signs of some deep discontent, however. She
began to weep one day while discussing the impending sale of
Atlantic Monthly with another executive in Zuckerman's New York
offices. On rare weekends with her husband at home in Killington,
she slept constantly, her husband said. She complained to him that
her job had become increasingly unpleasant. And yet she felt
compelled to work even more and advance further in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year things got harder,'' Fuchs said. ``But she was a
woman working in a man's world. She had things she wanted to do,
things she wanted to prove. She wasn't going to turn down more
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Still she had a strong distaste for some elements of her new
job, he said. Last summer, she was put in charge of Atlantic
Monthly's pending sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worried about what would happen to the magazine,'' her
husband said. ``She worried about people losing their jobs. She was
afraid they would all hate her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Zuckerman company officials confronted Jensen about the use
of the Atlantic account, the company had found about $100,000 of
what it called ``personal expenses,'' such as credit card payments,
rent, and expenses accrued by the band, the company spokeswoman
said. Jensen's husband, who said he has culled her financial
records, said the figure was closer to $10,000 and that ``she knew
every penny and would have paid it back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jensen seemed dispirited and drained. ``She was just
tired,'' Fuchs said. ``She told me that it seemed like all the time
and care she's put into the company didn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen never went back to work. On Nov. 6, two days after the
meeting with company officials, she went with her husband and a
friend to a Killington bar to watch a new songwriter she was
backing, Jeff Black.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, she drove the songwriter to the airport outside
Providence. After dropping him off, she drove into the city and
attempted suicide by inhaling exhaust fumes from her car, police
say. She was taken to a Rhode Island hospital, where she
recuperated and underwent psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   She was released Nov. 10, and according to police told her
husband she would meet him in New York to consult with a lawyer.
True to her word, she went to New York but instead of attending the
meeting, police said, she flew to Washington, rented a car, and
made the three-hour drive to Ocean City, a tourist trap on the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why Ocean City,'' her husband said. ``All I know
is she didn't like it. She hated the place. I think she went there
as a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   She checked into a Comfort Inn a few hundred yards from the
beach. On Nov. 12, the day of her death, she wandered the beach and
went to a drugstore, where she bought cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived shortly after noon on Nov. 13, she had been
dead for about 24 hours. And officers were struck by her apparent
peacefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rather calm scene,'' Ocean City police Lieutenant
Kevin Kirstein said. ``You could say serene.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the news, her guitarist friend Burlage would
recall being with her the last night she was in Killington watching
Jeff Black perform. On the way home, he had caught her gaze and
found something peculiar in it. He would later wonder whether she
had already made a decision about her fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked almost like a little girl,'' he said. ``She looked
innocent and happy. It was the first time I ever saw her when she
didn't look like an automaton, the first time I really saw her look
alive.''

CLOCKING EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the multitudes who battle traffic each morning to get to
jobs tied to office desks, the concept of telecommuting has a
certain allure:
</P>
<P>
   Get off the road and work from home. Choose your own starting
and quitting times. Take time off when personal needs require.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as your schedule doesn't get in the way of anyone
else's, no one need be the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds good _ but don't count on it. The punch-clock
mentality lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Moving only slightly behind the speed at which the Internet is
penetrating the workplace and home life, two Massachusetts
companies are racing to produce the electronic equivalent of time
clocks that can keep track of you wherever you might be.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been around a while, and the paths each has taken to
deal with technological and social change offer timely
illustrations of how companies must periodically restructure and
revise their business plans to compete and survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reinvented ourselves four times now,'' says Mark S. Ain,
56, chairman and chief executive of Kronos Inc. of Waltham, founded
in 1979 and the first in its field to adopt computer chip
technology to manage unwieldy payroll data.
</P>
<P>
   Kronos, which had $254.3 million in sales in the fiscal year
that ended Sept. 30, is widely considered the market leader in
``time and attendance'' office equipment. The company has about
1,500 employees, half in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Simplex Time Recorder Co. of Gardner, which dates
</P>
<P>
   to founder Edward G. Watkins's first time-clock patent in 1894,
is pushing hard to close the market gap after a shakeup in 1997
that included buying a software company and a new name for its
timekeeping division: ``Workforce Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still owned by the Watkins family, Simplex also makes security,
fire-alarm, and fire-suppression systems. It has about 7,000
employees worldwide, most in sales and service roles. About 1,500
work at its factory in Westminister and at offices about to move
from Gardner to Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Simplex had $736 million in sales in 1998 and
projects 1999 revenue to increase 12 percent, but refused to break
out revenues by divisions _ making comparisons impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As most workers who have contact with timekeeping systems today
know, time clocks that sound a hearty ``ka-chunk'' or ring a bell
as each employee punches in or out are candidates for museums.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, computerized systems actuated by employees'
magnetically coded identification badges or keyboarded data have
taken over at most large companies that keep such records.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond recording hours worked and simplifying payroll processing
by storing each employee's wage scale and other details, these
systems deliver reams of data used by supervisors to write work
schedules and by strategic planners who want to optimize use of
facilities and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, says Ain, large law firms, which typically bill
for their services by the hour, have been looking at these systems
to replace handwritten records that track how much time lawyers and
paralegals spend on each case and client.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants who follow the timekeeping and time management
industry are far from unanimous about its future.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Phelan, a consultant with Gartner Group Inc., believes the
spread of the Internet is bound to bring into the timekeeping fold
thousands of workers at locations far from the home office whose
hours and activities may now only be estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is where the growth is going to be,'' she says. The
onrush of wireless technology, which allows coded transmissions
from cellular phones and soon will have capacity to carry detailed
work reports generated on laptop computers, will put both
white-collar telecommuters and blue-collar field service workers
within keystrokes of the home office's watchful eye.
</P>
<P>
   But David Weaver, with The Survey Group in Wakefield, sees
work-force management moving away from strict timekeeping, in
assembly-line companies as well as business offices.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver says his evidence is in two surveys his company made, in
1996-97 and in 1998-99, each involving 256 companies with a total
of more than 200,000 employees. The number of firms that required
manufacturing employees to punch in and punch out each day fell 13
percent. For office workers and low-level managers not subject to
union rules, the decline was 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing less punching of time clocks and less writing
down times of arrival and departure,'' Weaver said. The second
survey also found 21 percent of companies kept no time records
whatsoever aside from absences and vacations _ more than twice the
number in the 1996-97 survey.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, introduction of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
operating systems; the appearance of large, multipurpose corporate
software systems such as those by Oracle, SAP; and most recently
the development of the Internet all have widened opportunities for
new time-based applications.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to capitalize on these events, more than two dozen small
software companies have emerged nationwide that develop
time-management and time-recording software for specific
industries, from casinos to hospitals to hotels.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no industry-wide statistics, Kronos, which is
the only large player that is publicly traded and reports sales
numbers, estimates it holds about half the market among companies
that buy timekeeping systems from outside vendors.
</P>
<P>
   That group constitutes about half of all businesses, Kronos
marketing director James Kizielewicz says. The large companies that
develop their own systems make up another 25 percent of the market,
he says. The rest either use old-style time clocks and time cards
or keep handwritten records.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this last group are unlikely to change their ways soon,
he says. Reinforcing this, Ain points out that thousands of
Kronos's earliest digitalized time clocks, manufactured between
1979 and 1992, are still in use. But as users have grown and bought
new systems, orders for the time cards that these units use have
fallen from 90 million in 1992 to just 10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1992 when Kronos began its string of ``reinventions,''
introducing DOS- and Unix-based timekeeping systems that could move
the data they collect from employee ID cards into larger systems
for direct payroll processing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Kronos adapted again with Windows-based
software, adding more data analysis capability as it did so. Last
spring it expanded this line further with the acquisition of one of
its small upstart rivals, CrossWind Technologies Inc. of Santa
Cruz, Calif., which specialized in applications that fit into the
popular Microsoft Outlook office systems software.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the Internet has proved more daunting than Kronos
anticipated: An expected October shipping date has slipped while
last-minute bugs are worked out, Kizielewicz says.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan, the Gartner Group consultant, says Kronos is
``definitely behind the curve'' with its Web-based product. But she
says also Kronos is unquestionably dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have permeated pretty much every industry there is to get
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, while Simplex's market position may not be clear,
there is no question it is racing forward. While the company was
the longtime leader in electromechanical time clocks, its push into
digital products took full shape only with the introduction of a
Windows-based system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Simplex made a strategic decision to sell its
systems as a package _ including magnetic card readers,
touch-screen data-entry terminals, and other hardware that it makes
itself in a 700,000-square-foot plant in Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Kronos, which once made most of its own hardware, now turns to
outside suppliers for much of the equipment its systems require.
</P>
<P>
   Simplex's big move came in 1997, when it acquired a small,
35-employee Cambridge company, Information Marketing Business Inc.,
that had been making timekeeping and scheduling software for retail
stores since 1982. Its products included software for analyzing
work patterns and forecasting staffing needs based on prior store
experience.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition came IMB's founders, Frank Perlmutter, 41,
now division vice president, and Geoffrey Palmer, 42, now in charge
of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter sees a strong sales future in consumer-related
industries such as health care, entertainment, hosptality, and
banking _ sectors that, like retailers, have staffing needs that
fluctuate by day, week, month, and year.
</P>
<P>
   Simplex also is developing lines that incorporate features from
the company's security products, including use of biometric devices
that identify employees by fingerprint or palm-print.
</P>
<P>
   Biometrics are under review at Kronos, too, but the firm does
not see much demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks good on TV and people like to talk about it,'' says
Lacy. But Kizielewicz says personnel managers seem to ``be moving
away from the big-brother climate, from wanting to watch what
people are doing.''

LOSER OF THE DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you had invested $1,000 in Reebok International at the
beginning of the decade it would be worth just $420 today.
</P>
<P>
   Like you, I salivated reading that if we had invested $1,000 in
EMC Corp. at the start of the '90s, it would be worth a
mind-boggling $697,385. Or $612,881 if we had put our dough in CMGI
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the other side of investing, the dogs of the
'90s. Among the name-brand Massachusetts companies, Stride Rite is
down 62 percent; Polaroid, down 61 percent; Reebok, 58 percent; and
Stone &AMP; Webster, 57 percent. There is one thing, however, that
distinguishes Reebok from its fellow hound dogs: Stone &AMP; Webster,
Stride Rite and Polaroid have replaced their chief executives, some
more than once, in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   At Reebok, Paul Fireman still reigns supreme. What does this man
have to do to get fired? (Hint: It doesn't hurt that Fireman and
his wife still own 20 percent of the company.)
</P>
<P>
   This was a company that in the late '80s overtook mighty Nike as
the largest athletic footwear company in America. In the last
decade, Reebok has fallen to number three in the world market,
steadily losing share to Nike and other reinvigorated brands such
as Adidas. Sales have gone nowhere since 1994; profits have
declined every year since then. The stock, which peaked at 52 in
1997, is at 8 today, placing it fourth from the bottom among
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies over the decade. Employment stands
at 6,000, down from 6,950.
</P>
<P>
   When the history of business in the '90s is written, any list of
best quotes has to include this recent jewel: ``We have gotten off
course over the last eight to 10 years,'' Fireman told analysts
three weeks ago, ``and I want to bring it (Reebok) back.''
</P>
<P>
   Off track for eight to 10 years! Try that one on your boss.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman has long expoused the idea of chaos as a way of
management, his belief that constant change and turmoil creates
energy. Chaos is just what he's gotten. In a business where brand
and image is critical, Reebok's brand stands for nothing. Nike
means performance and winning. Nike's stock, by the way, is up
roughly 600 percent this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's message of the moment is Traxtar, a high-tech gimmick
that uses a computer chip to measure how fast children run and how
high they jump. The shoes come complete with lights and music,
which is played off an oval pod on the tongue of the shoe. Who
knows what will strike Fireman's fancy next week?
</P>
<P>
   Managing through chaos has produced a revolving-door among
executives, most of whom quit in frustration with his flip-flops
and meddling, which can go right down to fiddling with the menu in
the company cafeteria. According to one list I have, the number two
post in the company has turned over nine times since 1986, with
Fireman himself holding the position three times. Ten different
executives have headed US/North American operations. The top
marketing person, a key spot in a brand company like Reebok, has
turned over and incredible 13 times since 1985.The one constant
through the mess: Paul Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   There's no one else to blame, except maybe the board, which has
been Fireman's enabler. For the record, here is that board: Thomas
M. Ryan, chairman of CVS Corp.; Mannie L. Jackson, chairman of the
Harlem Globetrotters; William G. Glavin, president emeritus of
Babson College; Richard G. Lesser, executive vice president of TJX
Cos.; Geoffrey Nunes, former senior vice president of Millipore
Corp.; retired Reebok executive Paul Duncan; and Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   Failure is relative at a certain level in Corporate America. As
the decade closes, Fireman is about to move Reebok into a new
headquarters in Canton, himself into a 27,000-square-foot palace
off the 11th green at The Country Club in Brookline. But you would
be hard-pressed to find a top executive still drawing a paycheck at
a major Massachusetts company who has done worse in the '90s. Abe
Gosman comes to mind, but then he's gone from Meditrust, too. It's
time _ past time _ that Reebok found a message and stuck with it.
My suggestion: Fire Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a certain ring, no?

KRONOS' TIME CLOCK WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKEREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Two years ago, when he was named chairman of
Kronos Inc.'s Year 2000 committee, Paul Lacy dreaded what he might
face.
</P>
<P>
   But as his internal committee reviewed the dozens of product
lines that Kronos had put on the market to record and analyze time
and productivity, it made a fortuitous discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by chance, one of Kronos's engineers had anticipated 20
years in advance that these products would still be in use when the
calendar turned from 1999 to 2000, and that they should be
programmed to withstand that millennial change.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while Kronos will have two dozen employees on duty
New Year's Eve and well into New Year's Day to answer calls from
any customers who encounter Y2K problems, Lacy plans to be on
vacation at an unidentified Gulf Coast resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have my cell phone with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer responsible for the find, Larry Krakauer, says he
was not looking for Y2K difficulties nor did he anticipate any. ``I
didn't realize what a big deal it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to keep Kronos's first product, a
card-punching digital time clock that stored payroll data in
embedded computer chips, from occasionally locking up and refusing
to move ahead when it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the software I saw that it was reading time
internally in the same way people do _ in minutes, hours, the day
of the month, the month itself, and then the year.'' This meant the
system required several mathematical bases to compute dates _ 60
for minutes, 12 for months, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it and said, `This is a mess. This is not the way
to do it,' '' Krakauer recalls. ``So I changed the representation
of time inside to the number of minutes elapsed since Jan. 1,
1900.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more work was needed to ensure that this time would be
converted accurately to calendar time. But testing proved the
revisions would pass 2000 with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess I didn't go all the way,'' he said. ``I used
the rule that every fourth year is a leap year. I knew that our
clocks would malfunction in 2100.'' In fact, because of a small
revision made since then, they could lock up as soon as 2079.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we haven't really tested for this yet,'' Krakauer said.
``Our hands have been full, testing all the products we have put
out since then'' that might have other Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   For those, Kronos either has distributed new software or patches
designed to correct them, or warned customers that their problems
might not be repairable.

THESE DAYS, DON'T THINK A $100 STOCK HAS TO SPLIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when you could buy at least one share of practically
any stock in America for under $100?
</P>
<P>
   Those days, though still a relatively fresh memory, are gone.
That fact doesn't mean much on its own, but it says a lot about
changes in the investing world and in stock markets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of US stocks that would have been considered
unusually expensive on a per-share basis just a few years ago is
exploding to levels that appear to be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   An unofficial Boston Capital survey this week turned up 115
common stocks that traded at prices in excess of $100 per share, a
level once exceeded by only a rare few companies. In that pricey
company, 19 traded above $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a time in 15 years of trading small stocks
when I've seen so many with absolute prices that are so high,''
said Stephen Demirjian of Westfield Capital Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those stocks are new to the market in 1999, initial
public offerings that took off, such as Sycamore Networks Inc. of
Chelmsford (239 1/4 per share) and Akamai Technologies Inc. of
Cambridge (217 per share). More often than not, they are the shares
of technology companies focused on the Internet,
telecommunications, or other hot areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's illustrative of the speculative frenzy in the
market,'' said Syl Marquardt, research director at John Hancock
Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors measure a company's actual value by mutiplying its
per-share price by the number of shares outstanding. So the
influence of per-share prices alone falls into the realm of
psychology rather than financial fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, companies whose stocks rose to a high level
declared a stock split that lowered the per-share price, with no
effect on the actual value of the company. There were simply more
shares trading at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom suggested that very high per-share prices,
generally over $100, discouraged people from buying stock. It was
easier to imagine a $50 stock appreciating, while many investors
would feel they had already missed an opportunity at $150 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no textbook to look this up in, but there really was a
sense that at $100 you ought to consider splitting,'' said Jim
Weiss, chief investment officer for equities at State Street
Research &AMP; Management. ``That notion is gone, but nothing has
replaced it.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed? Explosive run-ups in many tech stocks made the
appreciate-and-split timetable hard to follow and all but
eliminated any psychological barriers inhibiting investors from
buying at high per-share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Here's all you need to know: Both Sycamore Networks and Akamai
traded above 200 the very first day they hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a class of stocks now that you'd call the
nouveau riche,'' said Karl Mills, vice chairman and investment
strategist at Jurika &AMP; Voyles.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the 56 stocks included in the Russell 1000 index that
trade above $100 per share have appreciated, on average, by 265
percent this year. The rest of the stocks in the index are up about
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Stocks with expensive per-share prices
actually seem to enjoy a certain cachet in today's market, stamped
as champions in a new-economy world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a few of the stock market's huge winners and how they
are dealing with splits. Commerce One Inc., which went public in
July at 21 and now trades at $423, is planning one for later this
month. So is Ariba Inc., a June IPO that hit the market at 23 and
now trades at 234 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   But both splits will create reduced per-share prices that still
exceed $100, based on current valuations. Rather than a price
ceiling that should not be exceeded for long, the $100 per share
figure appears to be a floor for many newer technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have seen $100 stocks go to $200 or $300 or $400,''
said Weiss. ``It isn't automatically suggested as a top as it might
have years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the glitz, there is a darker reason why some companies
are less inclined to reduce the price of their shares through
splits. What happens if a company splits its stock to a lower
per-share level and then sees a market correction bite 40 percent
out of its value?
</P>
<P>
   That is a distinct possibility when companies with no profit
and, sometimes, practically no revenue, trade at
multibillion-dollar valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the thing gets destroyed, what do you end up with?'' asked
Demirjian. ``You've got a $10 stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to think of aggressive technology companies like
Qualcomm Inc. (421 1/4), Juniper Networks Inc. (330 1/4), and CMGI
Inc. of Andover (211 7/8) when it comes to high share prices. But
that old $100 barrier is being broken by well-established older
companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. (111 9/16) and even Dow Chemical Co. (123
5/16) are on a long list of older companies that carry historically
high per-share prices today.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co. split its stock 2-for-1 twice this decade,
in 1994 and 1997. In both instances, GE took the action about four
months after its stock price cracked 100, always before it reached
110.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way it's working out this year. GE shares, which
finished Tuesday at 149 7/8, have closed below 100 just 15 times in
1999.

   The dirty little secret about the '60s is that they weren't
really The Sixties _ you know, long hair, revolution, and all that.
Most people supported the war. Most rock groups sold fewer records
than Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. Wilhelm and Charles Reich
together didn't have a tenth of the readers Jacqueline Susann did.
In fact, to plumb the egregious heart of mainstream '60s popular
culture you could do worse than look to the author of ``Valley of
the Dolls'' and ``The Love Machine.'' Amy Fine Collins gives Susann
her dishy due in the January Vanity Fair. Her look back at La
Jackie (who died in 1974) is but the latest instance of how VF
occasionally has managed to refresh its formula of oohing and
aahing over Eurotrash and the latest Miramax discovery. Think of
such comparably offbeat and intelligent pieces as Nick Tosches's
meditation (for lack of a better word) on Sonny Liston or Michael
Herr's memoir of Stanley Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note here, Marjorie Williams shows why Terry McAuliffe
is the perfect man to be Bill Clinton's wealthiest best friend _ or
should that be best wealthiest friend? _ and why McAuliffe's
aptitude does neither man much credit. On the cover is Cameron Diaz
(don't be fooled by the black hair).

   Y minus 17 and counting: This
year-end/century-end/millennium-end stuff just won't go away. So
Rolling Stone (Dec. 30-Jan. 6) quite sensibly turns the whole
business into a party. The editors invited an impressively eclectic
guest list, from A (Amos, Tori) to Z (Zinn, Howard), to weigh in on
matters millennial. It's a clever conceit, one that makes what's
basically an old-fashioned symposium seem like something far
sexier. The artwork plays up the party angle with a Sgt. Pepperish
cover and an array of suitably festive drawings (one of them
manages to make U2's Bono look like _ I'm not making this up _
Nelson Rockefeller). As with any party, the true highlight of the
evening is the post-mortem: deciding who was best dressed, worst
behaved, and so on. So here goes.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising statement. ``Heroes: Sen. Strom Thurmond has
been able to stay afloat all these years, and he's great for our
country'' _ James Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Least surprising. ``Hardest thing in the world when I wake up in
the morning is to say, `I feel good' '' _ ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Scariest thought. ``Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young records will
be listened to for many years'' _ David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   Least likely to request ``Under My Thumb.'' ``I don't think that
our music is sexist, but I think there are a couple of lines that
might be so construed'' _ Mick Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   Least likely to request a Shania Twain song. ``All the new
female country singers sound alike, and the songs don't say
nothing. And who wants to see a navel?'' _ Loretta Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to request ``Convoy.'' ``I'd like to see the whole
Web thing brought down to size, to what it really is, which is, of
course, CB radio'' _ Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Best millennium product placement. ``I use Viagra and am dating
twins. . . . Would I do ads saying that I'm doing this? You
betcha!'' _ Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest party pooper. ``I find the whole millennium thing really
arbitrary. Billions of Chinese people are celebrating the year 5970
or whatever'' _ R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest in-your-face to readers. Putting the magazine's table of
contents on Page 33 (How about a new slogan, Jann: ``All the
advertising that fits'').

<P>
   The RS preceding this one was a special photo issue, and
rightfully so. One of the things that sets rock apart from every
other kind of music _ except for maybe (God help us) show tunes _
is the importance of the visual element. You can listen to Johannes
Brahms or Jacques Brel or a Javanese gamelan, and if the experience
is purely aural, that in no way detracts from a listener's
appreciation. But try to imagine listening to Elvis unaware of his
sneer or Parliament unacquainted with P-Funk couture or (God help
us, again, but for different reasons) Marilyn Manson minus the
Marilyn Manson-ness: unh-unh.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is a special category. While not beholden to appearances,
it has a sumptuous visual side _ everything from Dizzy's bent
trumpet to Lady Day's gardenia _ that has attracted many talented
photographers. Roy DeCarava, Herman Leonard, William P. Gottlieb,
William Claxton, Milt Hinton, Francis Wolff, and Chuck Stewart are
only the best-known among them. How could they resist? The music is
epic chiaroscuro, an endless interplay of light and dark (there's a
reason all the great jazz photos are in black and white),
beautifully suited to the ministrations of light meter and lens. It
comes as no surprise, then, to learn that W. Eugene Smith, one of
the most admired American photojournalists of the century, tried
his hand at jazz photography, too. DoubleTake (Fall) reports on
Smith's involvement in the New York loft scene during the '50s _ he
lived in a building where several prominent musicians had rehearsal
space _ and how he came to obsessively photograph his friends and
neighbors. Two-dozen examples of his work are printed here. Also in
this issue, two very short stories by that most distinguished
senior practitioner of the genre, William Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have to be fairly old _ or have your clicker preset to
American Movie Classics _ to have an idea who Victor Mature was.
Perhaps the best way to describe him is Sylvester Stallone with a
sense of humor. For a decade or so, he was a very big star _ and
then, well, a big grin and an even bigger set of pecs would take
you only so far in Hollywood during the late '40s and early '50s.
He did have his moments, though even in his triumphs he got
sidetracked somehow. In ``Kiss of Death,'' Richard Widmark pushes a
wheelchair-bound old lady down the stairs (in 1947!), so that's
what people remember instead of Mature's uncharacteristically
affecting performance as a crook trying to go straight. In ``My
Darling Clementine,'' as Doc Holliday, he's history's beefiest
consumptive (when Mature coughs blood into a handkerchief, it's a
respiratory eruption), but one can argue that that very haleness
makes the beautiful abstractness of Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp seem
all the more ethereal. Mature, you might say, was not so much great
as the cause of greatness in others.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he died last summer _ don't expect him at RS' New Year's
party _ and in Film Comment (Nov./Dec.) David Thomson takes his
risible/robust measure. At a time when it seems every other
Hollywood release gets treated by Premiere and Entertainment Weekly
with a bated-breath awe worthy of ``Citizen Kane,'' it's no small
satisfaction to see a career of such amiable junkiness appreciated
for just what it was.

CONSTANTINE'S `MUD' IS A GRITTY MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BLOOD MUD 
By K. C. Constantine 
Mysterious Press, 375 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blood Mud'' is the 15th novel K. C. Constantine has written
about Rocksburg, a town in central Pennsylvania that is still full
of ethnic particularity but that also reflects every general
problem facing America and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning, the series, centered on police chief Mario
Balzic, has always pushed the envelope of the genre because the
pseudonymous Constantine appears to be a policeman or a public
official in a town very like Rocksburg. Constantine is more erratic
than other writers of mystery series because he refuses to repeat
himself or to turn his most successful books into a formula for all
the others. Instead, as Balzic ages and the society around him
changes, Constantine incorporates these factors into the stories.
His failures result from the same cause as his extraordinary
successes: Some kind of reality is always exploding through
genre-based expectations. ``Reality,'' remarks a policeman without
illusions, ``is way . . . better at makin' up stuff than I'll ever
be.''
</P>
<P>
   This new book, which is some kind of masterpiece, virtually
leaves crime fiction behind _ though shady characters abound, and
Balzic has emerged from restless retirement to investigate the
robbery of a gun store out at the mall. The book offers a really
boffo beginning, when a sleazy city councilman delivers a classic
1973 Mustang of dubious provenance to the girlfriend he met behind
a glass wall in an adult entertainment center. She could care less
about the beauties of a car that is probably older than she _ why
should she want to be reminded of how much mileage she has on
herself? She makes it clear that her councilman is going to see no
further action until she gets the brand new, bright red car she's
bargained for. Once again, Constantine tells this story in the kind
of raw-nerve, character-exposing dialogue in which his only real
rivals have been Elmore Leonard and the late George V. Higgins.
``For givin' you back your hope and your courage and your energy
and your stamina, for this I get a secondhand car? I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Balzic's investigation is proceeding in the kind of disorderly
order one expects from him when there is a surprise. He's on his
way to to interview someone, but wakes up in the Conemaugh General
Hospital after suriving an ``event'' an earlier generation would
have called a heart attack. Balzic's clogged arteries, silted by
``blood mud,'' are described in graphic detail, and so are the
medical procedures by which they are cleared. That takes only a few
pages: Clearing the mud from his psychology becomes Balzic's
principal task, and the job is not complete by the time the book is
done. Balzic can change his diet, but it's hard to change the way
his mind functions, and it's hard not to feel the stress when
trying to operate out of principle in a society that doesn't have
many any more, and where politics have messed up priorities _ there
aren't enough policemen anymore because politicians have diverted
so much money into stadiums for profit-making sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Balzic's tenuous hold on life parallels society's weak
allegiance to principle and values; society is silted up with
greed. There are comic set pieces in ``Blood Mud'' to rival the
opening row between the singleminded councilman and his determined
doxy, and there's lots of tough, dirty talk, and ultimately a rough
and approximate sort of justice, which is at once satisfying and
disturbing. Although Balzic is finally able to piece together what
went down out there at the mall, there's almost nothing he can do
about it; officially, what happened there never happened at all. As
the unillusioned cop says to Balzic: ``Only ones we put away are
the ones have to take a number and get in line in the public
defender's office, that's all. Yeah.'' All Balzic can do is a few
good turns along the way, but he can't save anyone, really _ except
maybe himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all that is bleak and black, Balzic's saving
grace is his own character, and his relationship with his wife,
Ruth. Some Mario/Ruth episodes in the previous books have gotten a
little sticky, but one of the miracles of ``Blood Mud'' is how
Constantine can make us feel the sustained deep harmonies of love
that lie below a surface ruffled by steady bickering _ harmonies
that lie below the level of hearing, but which you can feel.
Constantine's unobtrusive achievement in these scenes, and in most
of ``Blood Mud,'' is well beyond anything that anyone but a major
novelist would attempt.

   It took Marion Cunningham until her 50th birthday to find
something she loved. ``I barely got out of high school,'' she says.
Afterward, she worked at all sorts of things. At one point she was
a switchboard operator, then she worked on the stock exchange in
San Francisco, and she had a brief stint at an insurance company.
``I was too hyper to sit,'' says the 77-year-old cookbook author
known as the modern Fannie Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came World War II. She saw a sign at the Union station near
her house. ``Replace a man,'' it read. So she did. She pumped gas
for two years. ``I was going to buy a service station at one
point,'' she said during a recent visit to Boston. ``But my husband
said, `No matter how many baths you take, you will still smell like
40-weight oil.' '' She leans across the dinner table and says
softly, ``I never go to the station and not pump my own gas.''
</P>
<P>
   That must be quite a sight. Tall, slim, and elegant, Marion
Cunningham lives in Walnut Creek, Calif., and puts 2,500 miles a
month on her Jaguar, driving it into the city for dinner, mostly to
accompany San Francisco Chronicle restaurant critic Michael Bauer
on his rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham began cooking seriously when she flew to Oregon to
take a class with the late James Beard. The class was a way for her
to overcome social phobias that had plagued her for years and kept
her close to home. Beard was so impressed with her that he asked
her to become his assistant and travel around the country with him.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she writes, cooks, and teaches in the modest house that
she and her late husband built 38 years ago. It sits on an acre. A
160-year-old oak tree graces the property, and she loves the place
and won't ever sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is very small. People come in and say, `Where's
your lab?' '' In it, she tested all the recipes for the 1979
revision of ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook,'' ``The Fannie Farmer
Baking Book,'' ``The Breakfast Book,'' and, just recently,
``Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham'' (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   Working on ``Learning'' showed her how the world has changed.
Her students didn't know what saute meant, nor shred, nor simmer.
``Forget blanch. Fold? They didn't know that either,'' she said. A
recipe called for soft butter, and one student she was teaching, a
woman who ran an immensely successful business, searched the dairy
case in the local supermarket for ``soft butter.'' Another wanted
``to learn to cook because I stand up to eat at night. I want to
sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the baking powder biscuits that turned them around, she
said. ``When they saw those blobs of dough go puff in the oven,''
it gave them courage to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham herself has kept up incredible momentum all these
years, largely by staying involved with her colleagues, keeping in
touch with them by phone, and working hard to stay fit.
</P>
<P>
   She rises at dawn and walks Rover, her yellow Lab, by the creek
that gave her town its name. ``Then I swim every day in an outdoor
pool. It sounds more rugged than it is. Actually it is cold when
it's cold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shop every day whether I need to or not.'' Because she works
at home, grocery shopping gives her a break. ``And I talk on the
phone a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   These days her talk is about a cookbook she and many other Bay
Area pastry chefs are working on. They're all part of the Baker's
Dozen, a 10-year-old project that collects no dues and writes no
newsletter. Each member pays $5 a year for stamps, and the group
runs without a leader. ``The project is to learn from one
another,'' said Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, members began compiling a book of their recipes, which
they sold to Broadway Books for a large advance. They may buy a
retirement community for bakers, said Cunningham. ``I'm the point
person on the book.'' It keeps her on the telephone for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die,'' she said, ``you better put a mobile phone in
that coffin.''
</P>

   Grace Young was raised in a Cantonese household not too far from
San Francisco's Chinatown, when most of California's Chinese
families were Cantonese. The Youngs were so traditional, she says,
that ``the recipes my parents cook today are the same recipes my
grandparents and their grandparents cooked.'' Like any red-blooded
American teenager, Young made sure she broke the chain, first by
eating pizzas and hamburgers, then, as an adult, by incorporating
many non-Chinese dishes into her repertory. By the time she was
living in New York on her own, all the rice she needed was stored
in a 5-pound canister beside the sugar and flour.
</P>
<P>
   Then her mother came to visit. ``Where is the rest of the
rice?'' she asked her daughter. ``A pound of rice was all I ever
needed,'' writes Young in ``The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen:
Classic Family Recipes for Celebration and Healing'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``But, in that moment,'' Young continues, ``I realized
how far I had journeyed from my Chinese roots.'' Rice meant many
things. A 100-pound sack assured the family that there was enough
to eat. When fruit wasn't ripe, Young's mother would bury it in the
rice overnight. Her father mashed cooked rice with water when the
children needed glue.
</P>
<P>
   Young wanted to know more. She began by asking a friend to
photograph the traditional New Year's celebration at her parents'
home. Then she asked all her cousins which of their childhood
dishes they ate as adults and whether they knew how to cook them.
The cousins knew as little as she did.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of going over the recipes with her mother, other
things came to life. She learned her family history, and she
finally understood why her mother would serve certain dishes and
insist they were good for her. At the time, of course, she was only
half listening.
</P>
<P>
   Now she wishes she had been paying attention. ``The women in my
family are body fortunetellers,'' said Young during a recent visit
to Cambridge, Mass. to address the Radcliffe Culinary Friends.
``They can look at anyone and tell what soup they need.'' The
Cantonese, she said, have taken soup to an art form.
</P>
<P>
   They used them for healing and balance according to the ancient
theory of yin and yang. ``Yang foods are warming, invigorating, and
powerful,'' she writes. ``Many are high in fat and spicy.'' Typical
yang foods are butter, chicken, lamb, and ginger. ``Yin foods are
cooling, soothing, and mild, and characteristically more
vegetarian.'' These include crab, watermelon, cucumber, tofu, and
bean sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Steaming, poaching, and boiling tend to be yin. Sauteing,
roasting, and barbecuing are yang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the people in the West are yang,'' she said.
``Coffee is yang. The American diet is yang. One has a tendency to
over-yang oneself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fundamental to keep yin and yang in balance,'' she
continued. To do this, you can eat whole grains, which are
considered neutral, or any of the ``neutral'' or healing soups from
the Cantonese diet. Pasta, which Americans live on, is ``barely
neutral,'' she said, because it's been processed.
</P>
<P>
   Young's family sips ``yun'' (soothing) soups, which are said to
restore balance in the body, ``like a cough drop that soothes a
parched throat,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some soups are drunk year round, others during the season in
which the vegetables are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, Young preferred Campbell's chicken noodle soup to
most of her mother's soups, especially one made with mustard greens
and sweet potato, also simmered for three hours and thought to ward
off flus. She decided to make it again while she was writing
``Wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To my surprise, I found it soothing and comforting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still living in Manhattan, Young is nearly back to the diet of
her childhood, which is a challenge, considering she's test kitchen
director and head of food photography at Rebus Inc., a book
packager that specializes in cookbooks and health news letters. ``I
used to eat Thai, French, Chinese, and Tex-Mex food. Every time I
went home to my parents, the foods agreed with me more.''
</P>
<P>
   American cooks, she said, are mixing ingredients from East and
West and ``grabbing at all these elements.'' Food is being
assembled without any strong traditions behind it.
</P>
<P>
   What she likes about Chinese cooking is the thoughtfulness that
goes into it. ``They put ingredients together that make perfect
sense,'' she said. When she stops to think about it, she remembers
what an old process this is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured it out 4,000 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl who ate pizza came home.

CHEF'S BOOKS PLAY TO A RAREFIED AUDIENCE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost as soon as there were restaurant chefs, they wrote
cookbooks for the rest of us. This year's crop of experts' advice
to amateurs tells us a lot about the cuisine of some of today's
finest restaurants. But does that mean we can cook the recipes in
home kitchens? Well, yes and no, in some cases. And in some cases,
just no.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with ``The French Laundry Cookbook'' by Thomas
Keller (Artisan, $50), a monumental book dedicated to the mastery
of the restaurant's chef-owner. Weighing in at 5 pounds, 4.7
ounces, and measuring just under a foot square, it runs to 323
pages and thoroughly explains Keller's tasting-menu cuisine and his
philosophy. Going to his Yountville restaurant in the Napa Valley
is exactly like entering a shrine. For several hours, the diner is
presented with up to 10 small and elaborate dishes, each more
gravity-defying in construction. The book sets a similar tone.

   But making these flights of fancy _ and making enough of them to
feed a table of six guests _ would tax even the most expert
amateur. Here's an example: a salad of petite summer tomatoes with
tomato sorbet, garlic tuiles, and tomato coulis. The peeled cherry
tomatoes and tomato sorbet, in a zeppelin shape, are stacked ever
so delicately between a garlic crisp and a brioche crouton, all
resting in a pool of tomato coulis surrounded by a circlet of basil
oil. It's an amazing architectural feat, even following the
author's tips on trimming the tomatoes to sit flat in the stack.
Now, for you home cooks throwing a dinner party for six, after you
engineer that first tomato tower, do it five more times and get
them all to the table. Be careful the family cat doesn't trip you.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this beautifully photographed book might best be saved
for bedside reading rather than the kitchen. Anyway, that's what
I'll do.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Boulud, another giant of French cuisine in America, has
produced a very different kind of book, ``Cafe Boulud Cookbook:
French-American Recipes for the Home Cook'' by Boulud and Dorie
Greenspan (Scribner, $35). Despite the sophistication of Boulud's
restaurant cuisine, these recipes are eminently doable. I found at
least a dozen I was eager to try, and one, scallops on crushed
potatoes, sauce charcuterie, definitely has been added to my
repertory. I substituted tiny Cape scallops for the larger sea
variety, because they're impossible to resist in season, but
otherwise I followed the recipe. The sauce involves onions, red
wine vinegar, boiled ham, and tiny slivers of French cornichons; it
may sound odd, but it was wonderful with the scallops and the
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, the coauthor, said in a phone interview recently that
the chef's intention was to create workable dishes that reflect the
heritage of his family farm and village near Lyon, France. Adapting
Boulud's restaurant work involved ``deconstructing it for the home
cook, like a puzzle,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   She explains that a recipe for duck civet originally called for
marinating the duck overnight in three bottles of red wine with
many vegetables, then discarding the marinade and adding more wine
and cut-up vegetables to cook the ragout. After she and Boulud
discussed the idea that a home cook might be hesitant about
discarding so much wine, not to mention cutting up a multitude of
vegetables twice, Greenspan said, Boulud recalled a civet his
mother had made at home. In this, and in the finished recipe, the
duck is cooked right in the marinade.
</P>
<P>
   The other published powerhouse chef this year is Charlie Trotter
of Chicago, who has previously written coffee-table-size volumes on
seafood, vegetables, and desserts. This year's ``The Kitchen
Sessions With Charlie Trotter'' (Ten Speed Press, $29.95) is a
companion volume to Trotter's PBS televison series of the same
name. In his restaurant, Trotter, like Keller, presents diners with
a series of tiny dishes, imaginative and highly complicated. But,
probably because doing the television series forced him to adapt
his food to what a home cook could actually do, this cookbook is
much more accessible than his previous ones. Not easy, mind you,
but plausible. And, as Greenspan said of Boulud's recipes, you can
mix and match the components of the dishes. I found that the
tamarind and orange juice glaze on roast chicken added a lovely
tang, but decided to pass on the apple-onion-potato puree. Instead,
I caramelized the onions and apples for a sweet-savory side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Ming Tsai of Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Mass. says he benefited
from having already adapted many of his restaurant recipes for his
Food Network TV show, ``East Meets West.'' His book, ``Blue Ginger:
East Meets West Cooking With Ming Tsai'' by Tsai and Arthur Boehm
(Clarkson Potter, $32.50), covers a lot of territory, brimming over
with recipes and tips to help the home cook. It ranges from fairly
simple dishes to an ``over-the-top'' section with specialties from
his Wellesley fusion restaurant. ``I tried to make a concentrated
effort,'' Tsai said in a recent phone interview from Chicago, where
he was appearing on a 10-city book tour, ``to demystify the Chinese
pantry.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite chapter, he said, is on dim sum, his favorite way
to eat. For many cooks, even attempting dim sum seems ambitious,
but Tsai's recipes are ``not traditional'' and, as he says, would
make a good cocktail-party offering for the holidays. Tsai
simplifies and lightens salt-and-pepper shrimp, something my family
loves in Chinese restaurants, by flash-frying the shrimp in a small
amount of oil in a wok. It eliminates the need for a deep fryer,
uncommon these days in home kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Italian food, even in restaurants, is really home food, and chef
Michael Chiarello uses that to his advantage in ``The Tra Vigne
Cookbook: Seasons in the California Wine Country'' (Chronicle,
$35). His recipes weave through the seasons and present a variety
of ways to use ingredients. There are dinner party dishes like
monkfish with roasted garlic polenta and tomato broth. But others,
such as fusilli Michelangelo, which the chef named after his
mother's nickname for him, are gussied-up renditions of simple
family fare. This medley of tomatoes and mushrooms zapped with
dried tomatoes, lots of herbs, and a little balsamic vinegar is a
dish my teenagers love.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters takes the same tack as Boulud, using her cafe
recipes adapted to home kitchens in her latest book, ``Chez Panisse
Cafe Cookbook'' (HarperCollins, $34). As Waters said in an
interview earlier this year, she thinks cookbooks are read on
several levels, sometimes by cooks creating the dish in their
kitchen and sometimes for enjoyment or learning. So her recipes
range from mere lists of ingredients with a plan for using them to
fairly complicated procedures for making head cheese.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague who made Waters's braised beef short ribs with
gremolata reported that they were wonderful. The restaurant-style
instructions on browning the ribs before braising were clever, and
the gremolata, a mixture of parsley, lemon zest, and chopped
garlic, added a great burst of flavor. But the recipe calls for
testing the meat after 1 1/2 hours, much too early, my colleague
says, since the ribs take at least 2 1/2 hours to become properly
tender.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the book, and all her books, is that
whether simple or complex, there's no talking down to the readers.
Her plain-spoken personality shines through. Reassuring to the home
chef is the assumption that even restaurant food can be adapted for
us amateurs. As Greenspan says, good food always takes a
commitment, but ``almost anything can be done at home.''

SCALLOPS ON CRUSHED POTATOES, SAUCE CHARCUTIERE 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Cafe Boulud Cookbook'' by Daniel Boulud and Dorie
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   For the potatoes:
</P>
<P>
   Coarse sea salt or kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds of Idaho potatoes, scrubbed
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons (1 stick plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at
room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, peeled, trimmed, and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch Italian parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the scallops:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   12 or 16 large sea scallops (about 1 1/2 pounds), preferably
live jumbo scallops from Maine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Flour (for dredging)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, peeled, trimmed, and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce boiled ham, cut into matchstick-sized pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 cornichons (bottled French gherkins), cut into
matchstick-sized pieces
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For the potatoes: Spread an even 1/4-inch-thick layer of coarse
or kosher salt in the bottom of an ovenproof saute pan, skillet, or
baking pan large enough to hold the potatoes (an 8-inch pan should
be fine). Arrange the potatoes in the pan, slide the pan into the
oven, and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the potatoes
can easily be pierced with a thin knife. Remove the potatoes from
the pan and let them cool for about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Split the potatoes in half and, using a spoon, scoop the flesh
into a heatproof bowl. Still using the spoon, crush the potatoes
with the butter, shallots, and parsley. Don't be overzealous _
these are meant to be coarsely crushed and pleasantly lumpy. Season
with salt and pepper, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set the
bowl over a pan containing a few inches of simmering water _ the
water shouldn't touch the bowl. Keep the potatoes warm over low
heat while you cook the scallops.
</P>
<P>
   For the scallops: Warm the olive oil in a large saute pan or
skillet over medium-high heat. While it's heating, season the
scallops with salt and pepper and dredge them in flour, shaking off
the excess. Slip the scallops into the hot oil and cook on one side
for 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, lower the heat, flip
the scallops over, and cook for three minutes more, or until just
cooked through. Transfer the scallops to a warm plate and set aside
while you finish the sauce. Do not wipe out the pan _ you want to
keep the cooking fats.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pan to medium heat and add the onion. Season with
salt and pepper and cook for a few minutes, just until translucent.
Pour in the vinegar and, stirring and scraping the bottom of the
pan, let it cook away. Add the white wine and cook until only half
of it remains, then return the scallops, along with any juices that
may have accumulated on the plate, to the pan. Cook just until the
scallops are warmed through. Toss in the ham and cornichons _ the
ingredients that give the sauce its name _ and pull the pan from
the heat. Swirl the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Spoon the potatoes into the center of a warm serving
platter and arrange the scallops on top. Pour the sauce charcutiere
over them and serve immediately. Serves 4.

<P>
   BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS &UR;  &LR; WITH GREMOLATA
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook'' by Alice Waters.
</P>
<P>
   For the ribs:
</P>
<P>
   6 to 7 pounds beef short ribs, cut 2 inches thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 large yellow onions, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks, white and pale green parts only, washed and roughly
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, smashed
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups red wine
</P>
<P>
   3 to 5 cups hot beef stock
</P>
<P>
   For the gremolata:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1/2 lemon, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   For the ribs: Cut them into smaller pieces, roughly square, so
that each piece includes a bone. Trim excess fat if necessary.
Season generously with salt and pepper, and refrigerate for 4 to 6
hours, or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Arrange the ribs bone side down
in a roasting pan and roast until lightly browned, about 20
minutes. Meanwhile, saute the onions in a little olive oil in a
large skillet until lightly colored. Add the leeks and carrot, and
cook until slightly softened. Add the tomatoes, garlic, thyme,
parsley, and bay, and saute a few minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the vegetables in an earthenware baking dish large enough
to hold the short ribs. Arrange the ribs on top of the vegetables,
bone side up. Pour in the wine, and add enough hot stock to barely
cover the ribs. Cover the dish tightly with foil and place in the
hot oven. When the braise begins to simmer, after about 20 minutes,
loosen the foil and lower the heat to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Begin to test for doneness after 1 1/2 hours. A skewer or paring
knife inserted into the meat should encounter no resistance, and
the meat should be nearly falling from the bone. When they are
tender, uncover the short ribs and turn them again so that the bone
side is down. Pour off and reserve the braising juices. Raise the
heat to 450 degrees and return the ribs to the oven for a final
browning. When they are beautifully glazed, after about 10 minutes,
remove from the oven. Strain the braising liquid into a bowl,
pressing down on the solids to extract all the juices. Allow the
liquid to settle, then degrease. Pour the liquid back over the
short ribs and reheat if serving immediately, or cool, refrigerate,
and serve the next day.
</P>
<P>
   For the gremolata: Mix the parsley, lemon zest, and garlic
(these ingredients should be chopped at the last minute) and
scatter over the short ribs just before serving. Serves 6.

   STRACOTTO OF LAMB WITH OLIVES AND ORANGES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Best American Recipes 1999,'' edited by Fran
McCullough and Suzanne Hamlin.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 boneless leg of lamb (about 5 pounds), butterflied
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 medium red onions, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and dried
</P>
<P>
   2 (unpeeled) oranges, washed, quartered, seeded, and sliced into
1/4-inch-thick quarter-moons
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Tuscan green olives or Picholines, pitted or not (your
choice)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Chianti or other dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fresh orange juice
</P>
<P>
   The lamb, which takes about 2 hours to cook, can be simmered on
top of the stove or cooked in the oven. If you choose the oven,
preheat it to 350 degrees and set a rack on the lower-middle level.
</P>
<P>
   Trim most of the fat from the lamb and remove any lingering fell
(the thin membrane). Season generously with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil until it is almost smoking in a large
heavy-bottomed casserole in which the lamb can lie flat. Brown the
lamb on both sides until dark golden brown; remove it to a platter.
Add the onions, garlic, anchovies, and orange pieces to the
casserole and cook over medium heat until softened, 4-6 minutes,
scraping the pot bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen the brown
bits. Add the olives, wine, tomato sauce, and orange juice and
bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Return the lamb to the casserole, lower the heat to a simmer (or
put it in the oven), cover and cook, turning once, for 1 1/2 to 2
hours, or until fork-tender. Remove the lamb to a shallow platter
and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the heat to medium-high and cook the sauce, uncovered,
until it is reduced to 3 cups. The orange pieces will almost have
dissolved at this point, but even if they haven't, they will be
tender enough to eat. Add salt and pepper if need be. Pour the
sauce over the lamb and serve, or slice the meat and serve with the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

SHEPHERD'S SALAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Italian Country Table'' by Lynne Rossetto
Kasper.
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 thin slice mild coppa, soppressata, or hard salami, cut into
thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium to large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   A 4-inch branch fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   6 large fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red wine vinegar, or more as needed
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the salad:
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red onion, sliced into thin rings
</P>
<P>
   Ice water
</P>
<P>
   1 large head Bibb lettuce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large head romaine lettuce
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 cups mixed wild greens or 1 small head curly endive
</P>
<P>
   2 small inner stalks celery with leaves, cut on the diagonal
into thin slices
</P>
<P>
   1 small fennel bulb, cut into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound Italian or American sheep cheese, cut into strips
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cooked cannellini, borlotti, or organic pinto beans or a
15-ounce can of beans
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing: Heat the oil in a 1-quart saucepan over medium
heat. Add the salami, onion, rosemary, and sage, and saute until
the onion colors. Add the garlic and red pepper and stir for a few
seconds, then add the vinegar. Boil 4 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of the
stock and boil down to nothing. Add the rest of the stock and boil
2 minutes, or until the flavors blend and deepen. Taste for balance
and season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan and set aside until
needed, or up to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   For the salad: Immerse the onion in ice water and refrigerate
about 45 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and thoroughly dry the greens, setting aside any bruised or
coarse leaves for other dishes. Arrange the greens on a large
platter. Scatter the celery over the salad and tuck clusters of the
fennel strips into it. If necessary, the salad can be covered and
chilled up to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before serving, cluster the salami strips into seven to
nine bundles, tucking them in here and there in the salad. Do the
same with the drained onions and with the cheese strips. Nest large
spoonfuls of the beans in several of the lettuce leaves. Sprinkle
the salad lightly with salt and pepper, and set it out.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the dressing to a boil. Taste for seasoning again, this
time checking if it needs a tablespoon or so of vinegar. Present it
in a deep bowl, and spoon it over the salad just before serving.
Serves 6 as an antipasto; 4 as a main course.

   FUSILLI MICHELANGELO
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Tra Vigne Cookbook'' by Michael Chiarello.
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dried tomatoes, not packed in oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh marjoram
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound dried fusilli
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups diced mixed mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup loosely packed fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 cups arugula
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Combine the tomatoes, boiling water, sugar, vinegar, and
marjoram in a small bowl. Let the tomatoes rehydrate until soft,
about 10 minutes. Drain well, squeezing out excess liquid. Cut the
tomatoes into fine julienne. Set aside. Discard marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and the pasta and
cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1/2
cup of the pasta cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large saute pan
over medium-high heat until hot. Add the mushrooms and do not move
them until they begin to brown, about 1 minute. Then saute until
brown all over, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add
the garlic and saute briefly until light brown. Add the basil and
julienned tomatoes and cook quickly, pulling the pan off the heat
as necessary so the tomatoes do not burn.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the pasta is done, add it to the tomato-mushroom
mixture and toss well with 1/2 cup of the cheese and the reserved
pasta cooking water. Add 3 cups of the arugula and toss until
barely wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into a warm serving bowl or onto a platter and scatter the
remaining arugula on top. Sprinkle with the nuts and dust with a
little cheese. Serve immediately and pass the remaining cheese at
the table with a shaker of red pepper flakes. Serves 4.

degrees. Coat a 9-by-9-inch pan with vegetable spray or shortening.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare one topping: Either toss together cinnamon and sugar in
a cup or make streusel by pinching together all the ingredients
with your fingers or a fork until crumbs are formed.
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: In a large bowl, mix all the fruit and add the
nuts, if using.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder,
salt, and cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer, beat together
the eggs, butter, vanilla, and sugar. Stir in all the dry
ingredients and mix only until combined. Gently mix the fruit into
the batter, stirring only once or twice; do not overbeat. The
batter will be thick.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the batter into the baking pan, sprinkle on the topping,
and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until golden brown and a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out dry. Cool the cake on a wire rack;
cut it into squares and serve it from the pan. Makes one 9-inch
cake.

FOR CELEBRITIES, FIRM FINDS GIFTS WITH STAR POWER

<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ And you thought it was hard finding the
perfect gift for that special someone.
</P>
<P>
   Marnie Lerner and Cynde Cassel's holiday shopping list is packed
with someones, the sort who star in movies or make movies or have
enough money to buy whatever they want themselves. It's an entire
list of people who have everything.
</P>
<P>
   As Lerner put it, ``When we shop, sometimes we'll spend
thousands of dollars on a single item. Money is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The money also isn't theirs. Lerner and Cassel are stand-in
shoppers known for their stand-out gifts. The recipients _ Gwyneth
Paltrow, Julia Roberts, and Jack Nicholson, to drop a few A-list
names they've power shopped for in the past _ don't even know the
pair exists. They think the gifts come from the Hollywood studios,
talent agencies, and celebrities who sign the cards.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lerner, 27, and Cassel, 30, who were behind the
old-fashioned popcorn cart that country music star Reba McEntire
received for the screening room she added to her house. They
stocked the bassinet with chenille teddy bears and velvet pillows
for Jodie Foster's newborn son. The night-vision goggles with
infrared lighting sensors that Eddie Murphy received? Them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, we've upped our own ante,'' Cassel said. ``We did
so well for one client last year _ picnic backpacks filled with
everything from silverware and china to binoculars and a compass _
that we've got to top ourselves now.''
</P>
<P>
   While lavish gift-giving in Hollywood dates back at least to the
mid-1980s, when uber-agent Michael Ovitz began pampering stars with
presents, Lerner and Cassel have raised expectations even higher.
The friends and partners in Star Treatment, based in a Los Angeles
suburb, have mastered matching celebrities with one-of-a-kind gifts
for any occasion, from start of filming to Oscar win.
</P>
<P>
   They've taken to the Internet to bid on a vintage Barbie doll in
a cheerleader costume for actress Kirsten Dunst, hunted down
antique dealers in India for a studio head, and tested more creams
and lotions than they can count.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, couple Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson got one
of those backpacks, personalized with a bottle of wine,
an-all-in-one tool kit, and hand-crank radio. Sylvester Stallone,
along with about every celebrity in Hollywood, received a gourmet
gift basket half the size of a coffee table. The partners won't say
who's receiving $1,000 cashmere bathrobes or pashmina shawls from
Nepal this holiday season. They don't want to spoil the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynde has been in tears most of the day,'' trying to satisfy a
client who's sending out dozens of the same elegant but obscure
items this year, Lerner said as the women took a break from writing
proposals and overseeing gift wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're just going to the supermarket to buy food
for gift baskets,'' said Cassel. ``They think it sounds so homey.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lerner, ``If only they knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners, in fact, say they hardly knew what they were
getting into when they launched Star Treatment 3 1/2 years ago.
Lerner, a former writer for one of her father's Spanish-language
publications, and Cassel, who was a personal shopper at
Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, met at a New York fashion show,
clicked, and suddenly found themselves in business together.
Headquarters was Lerner's parents' guesthouse (her mother, Diane,
is also a partner). Gift baskets were their specialty.
</P>
<P>
   But their naivete paid off. No one told them they couldn't
approach studios and talent agencies directly, and so they did. In
a town where valet parking is a must, and anyone who's anyone has a
stylist to select his or her wardrobe, word soon got around about
Star Treatment. Many of the major players, who spend millions of
dollars a year on gifts for stars, were happy to cede the shopping
headache to the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not personal shoppers in the sense of department store
personal shoppers,'' Lerner said. ``We bring it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cassel, ``We really submit so many ideas that we're not
choosing for them. We're just helping them decide what they want to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, Star Treatment has given gifts to countless
award winners, the cast and crews of scores of films, and so many
celebrities that the partners keep extensive files on them all.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Billy Crystal enjoys cigars, they included them along
with brandy and an antique crystal decanter in the gift box he
received for hosting the Oscars. Adam Sandler got an oak chest
filled with squirt guns and other toys to welcome him to the set of
``Big Daddy.'' Mike Myers got a silk smoking jacket, body oils, and
oysters when filming began on the ``Austin Powers'' sequel. Any day
now, members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will
receive cookies shaped like actor John Malkovich's head after
screening ``Being John Malkovich'' _ part of a package intended to
reflect the theme of the movie about getting inside Malkovich's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a store,'' Lerner said. ``We do electronics, we do
food, we do cashmere, we do gadgets. You can find the coolest
things for people who have everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That skill has paid off nicely for the partners. Recently they
moved into an immense warehouse where more than a dozen employees
are now busy wrapping gifts seven days a week. Tables are laden
with bows and boxes; styrofoam packing balls litter the floor. The
shelves in one room are crammed with shampoos and moisturizers;
others are filled with wine and champagne. One room is devoted to
children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   The trick: paying wholesale whenever possible and charging
customers retail for gifts that range from $75 to $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Always busy with the year-round movie business, the holiday
season is an especially hectic time. Star Treatment is sending out
as many as 200 gift baskets a day, some of them ordered from its
Web site (www.startreatment.com) where anyone with a credit card
can hire the partners or purchase the women's taste in gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As Lerner explained, ``Sometimes people say the sky's the limit,
if a major A-list star is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cassel, ``They want cashmere this, cashmere that . . .
We've been sent keys to cars to put inside gifts for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cassel and Lerner haven't had much time to enjoy their
success. They're too busy shopping for others, although now they
mostly deal directly with wholesalers or retailers and rarely have
to venture into a store themselves. Neither has bought a single
gift for their friends or relatives yet or even for each other.
Last year, Cassel got Lerner an evening bag that she then borrowed.
Lerner got Cassel a nutcracker she wanted. Right now, both dread
the idea of hitting the malls for anyone besides a customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we do it, we're like the `Terminator,' '' said
Cassel. ``We can immediately see exactly what we want. You run, you
scan, you buy. We can do two malls a night that way.''
</P>

VICIOUS CYCLE FINDS PATRIOTS IN A TAILSPIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sunday's game was over. For one team, the Colts, joy
and ecstasy were in the air. The upstarts had won a game another
way, the way good teams have to do, win not with their vaunted
offense but with a defensive stand.
</P>
<P>
   For the other team, the Patriots, the so-familiar emotion _
frustration _ hung in the air. Another chance gone by. Another game
in which they had played well but not well enough.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the National Football League often win these games,
these fourth-quarter tests of will, because their big players make
big plays. One play can change all, and one play can swing the
balance. It is why big players are paid big money.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the National Football League lose these games, these
close games, because they do not make the big play. The Patriots
did not make the big play.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, as Christmas approaches, the media and
Patriot fans take out their magnifying glasses for a micro-view of
New England's playoff chances. Endless permutations are trotted
out, permutations by which the Patriots can make the playoffs. At
times, this can be fun, such as when the Patriots are a team on the
rise and are surprisingly making a run at the elite. At other
times, such as now, it is monotonous. Frustratingly so.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, do fans and media take the macro-view of the
Patriots franchise. It's like an investor looking merely at last
week's stock prices. Often, though, insights can be found by
looking at charts from years ago, from 10 and 20 and 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots, the long-term look at what the team has done
_ and when it has done it _ is troubling. In the 40 years of this
franchise, as their fortunes have ebbed and flowed, the Patriots
have performed well at very precise times.
</P>
<P>
   During the middle of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   And performed poorly at very precise times. At the end of one
decade and the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, for instance, when the American Football League
was formed, the Patriots of 1964 were 10-3-1, losing to the Bills
at War Memorial Stadium in their final game, 24-14, and blowing a
chance to return to San Diego for the AFL title game.
</P>
<P>
   That was the high point of the decade. In 1965, the Patriots
were 4-8-2, but recovered to be 8-4-2 in 1966. Then, in the next
four seasons, from 1967 to 1970, the Patriots' combined record was
13-42-1 and the franchise collapsed with coach Clive Rush the
symbol of the team's disarray.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday in Indianapolis, the Patriots played very hard, and
cornerback Ty Law epitomized the team's effort, playing with his
broken right thumb in a cast. On one play in the fourth quarter,
when the Colts' Edgerrin James swept right end, Law came up and
tried to tackle the rookie, virtually with one arm. On the way back
to the huddle after the play, Law's right arm hung limply at his
side, like a rag doll's. But he was on the field and remained on
the field, playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   So effort is not the issue with these Patriots. Any suggestion
that the players have quit is ludicrous. Pride is still alive in
Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, makes the team's predicament all the more . .
. well, frustrating. Sunday's game might as well have been a
metaphor for the season, as well as the last few seasons, the
Patriots falling behind early and then clawing back late. But, as
usual, falling short.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as the Patriots' cycle replayed itself, the team
was terrible early in the decade. But with Chuck Fairbanks's
arrival, the team asserted itself in the middle of the decade,
first showing hope with a 7-7 season in 1974 and then, after a 3-11
step back in 1975, progressing tremendously to the 11-3 season in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   That 1976 team still may be the best Patriot team ever. Ben
Drieth's roughing-the-passer call against Ray Hamilton in the
playoff loss in Oakland may have deprived New England of its best
chance to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1977, the Patriots were 9-5, followed by 11-5 a year
later. But the raucous ending to that 1978 season _ when Fairbanks
agreed to coach Colorado before the Patriots ended their regular
season _ makes Bill Parcells's departure two decades later seem
like a child's bedtime story. The sight of lawyers for the Patriots
and Fairbanks in a federal courthouse in Boston just before a
playoff game makes Parcells's ``shopping for the groceries'' remark
seem innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, to the surprise of few, lost that playoff game to
Houston. The team, shall we say, was unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the decade, unable to recover from the Fairbanks
fiasco, the Patriots gradually weakened until they hit bottom in
1981 with a 2-14 record. The cycle was repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1980s the Patriots were on the way back, going 9-7 in
1984, and the 1985 team went 11-5 and reached the Super Bowl. But
that team was rocked by a drug scandal and, soon enough, the
end-of-the-decade slide reappeared. By 1989, the Patriots were
5-11; in 1990, they were 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been just like the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. The
team recovered from an abysmal 2-14 of 1992 and reached 10-4 in
1994 under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   But 1995 repeated 1975 as a young Patriots team fell back for a
season and went 6-10. The 1996 team, of course, went to the Super
Bowl. Once again, the Patriots' best team came in the middle of the
decade. But then came the fiasco of Parcells's departure, an eerie
repeat of the fiasco of Fairbanks's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Now another decade ends with the Patriots sliding down from the
heights. Fairbanks and Parcells have been the two best coaches in
the franchise's history, and if the lesson from Fairbanks is
repeated, the immediate future is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing good has happened to any Patriots team as one decade
turns into another. The cycle has repeated itself.
</P>
<P>
   So the real frustration may not have been Sunday in
Indianapolis, or those squandered games in Buffalo and Miami. The
real frustration may come in the next few years. It is a long time,
after all, to the middle of the next decade.

SIGNS DON'T SAY `WALK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't expect Mark Whipple to go anywhere. At least not this
season. The University of Massachusetts coach is on the road
recruiting this week and has not heard from North Carolina State,
the one opening that might have drawn his interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although Army has a vacancy, and offers a Division 1-A position,
don't look for Whipple to jump at that. If he does make the move
from Division 1-AA to 1-A, he wants a program that he can bring
into the Top 25 on a regular basis. Army is not such a program.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State would be a perfect place for Whipple to
showcase his coaching skills. But the administration seems intent
on finding a replacement for Mike O'Cain from a group of 1-A
assistant coaches. Florida State's Chuck Amato seems to be the
front-runner right now.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity _ perhaps mistake _ in doing that is that the
greatest success the Wolfpack have had in football was after hiring
1-AA coaches, Lou Holtz from William &AMP; Mary and Dick Sheridan from
Furman (although Holtz did have experience as a Division 1-A
assistant).
</P>
<P>
   Whipple can afford to stay put. He has a good team coming back
next season, and several other jobs could open, possibly a couple
in the Big East. Rutgers is a prime possibility since coach Terry
Shea has been told that he must produce a winning season or he is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Also not going anywhere is Boston College coach Tom O'Brien. The
Virginia rumors were false and now are dead since George Welsh is
returning for another season. O'Brien might not have gone anyway,
since he has established something at BC on his own, while at
Virginia he would have been compared with Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   Look for BC officials to extend O'Brien's contract in the next
few weeks, with a little boost as a reward for this year's 8-3
season, which put the Eagles in the Dec. 31 Insight.com Bowl in
Tucson against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   BC's success also drew the attention of the Kickoff Classic.
Officials approached BC about playing in next summer's game, but
the opponent would be Michigan, so BC passed, feeling that the
program is still a year away from taking on such a challenge that
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is sound. If the Eagles were to play Michigan and
lose, they would have to win seven of the next 11 games to become
bowl-eligible, as opposed to the six wins they need in an 11-game
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   While BC's program took a turn upward this year, it is hardly at
the stage where it can be adding Top 10 type teams like Michigan to
the schedule at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Kickoff Classic will shop for another opponent for Michigan,
but if one can't be found, it might try to get what it wanted
originally, a Virginia Tech-Purdue matchup that would feature
Purdue quarterback Drew Brees against Tech's Michael Vick in what
should be an excellent duel.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block to that has been Tech's desire to play a
home game in one of the Black Coaches Association preseason games.
The Hokies have been unsuccessful in finding anyone to come to
Blacksburg and might opt for a neutral-site game against a team
like Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible compromise matchup would be Purdue against BC.
But Purdue-Virginia Tech is the No. 1 target right now.

THERE'S DASHER AND DANCER AND PRANCER ... AND OLIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom). 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little actually happens in the children's book ``Olive, the
Other Reindeer.'' Olive hears and misinterprets the line ``All of
the other reindeer'' in the song about Rudolph and decides she's
needed at the North Pole; she helps Santa, nominally, on his
Christmas Eve run.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the book so much fun is J. Otto Seibold's wonderfully
inventive graphics style, which is faithfully reproduced _ and
expanded upon _ in Fox's holiday special, ``Olive, the Other
Reindeer,'' executive-produced by ``Simpsons'' and ``Futurama''
mastermind Matt Groening and written by Steve Young (not the
concussion-prone quarterback).
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore imbues Olive's voice with a delightful spryness.
In the special, it takes her pet flea to persuade her that she's
needed up North, only after one of Santa's stalwart reindeer breaks
a leg, imperiling the entire holiday. Providing the requisite
dollops of villainy is an embittered postman (Dan Castellaneta,
better-known as Homer Simpson), who has delivered too many tons of
holiday mail to appreciate the season's finer qualities. Olive's
sidekick _ who appeared in the book, without mention, in one
drawing _ is the wise-acre penguin Martini (Joe Pantoliano, the
seedy guy in ``The Matrix''), who lost his job at the zoo and is
now reduced to peddling Rolex knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful computer animation, directed by Oscar Moore, is
chockablock with some wonderful inside jokes _ blink and you'll
miss them. Olive passes shops offering Ice Sculpture Repair,
Hydrants New and Used, and Butters of the World; a tanker carrying
eggnog wanders the streets. When Olive enters a tough North Pole
bar on her way to Santa's _ itself a funny idea _ the sign by the
door reads, ``Icicles must be surrendered at door.'' The bar is
populated by Round John Virgin (mangling another song lyric, in
this case from ``Silent Night'') and Schnitzel the melancholy
reindeer (REM's Michael Stipe), who provides the perfect tune for a
Christmas special in this era of diminished expectations: ``We're
Not So Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Seibold has also illustrated a delightful series of children's
books featuring a dog named Mr. Lunch, who runs a successful
bird-chasing business. With any luck, Moore, Young and Groening
will get to work animating his adventures, as well. &QL;

PATRIOTS' PROBLEMS STEM FROM THE RUNNING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is one of the standard questions you ask the opposing coach
about the locals before an upcoming game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you see in the Patriots films?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost always: ``They've got a lot of talent. The
speed of those wide receivers scares you. The defense is quick, and
they've got guys that can make plays in the secondary . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And then the trailer always comes: ``. . . but of course, the
No. 1 thing you have to do is stop Drew Bledsoe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no different with Andy Reid, the first-year coach of the
struggling Philadelphia Eagles, when he had his chance on the horn:
``The guy has one of the best arms in the game. He can put the ball
anywhere. If you don't take care of those receivers . . .''
</P>
<P>
   You'll find no complaints about Bledsoe from the coaches that
have to prepare for him.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Parcells of the Jets said earlier this year, ``Let him
go to free agency and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising to this humble scribe to see Bledsoe up
front, apologizing for all of the Patriots' sins after they were
beaten by a very good Colts team in what has become a very
difficult place to play, the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can applaud Bledsoe for being a stand-up guy, what
has happened to this team has very little do to with the way he has
played. If you had to hand out the blame, Bledsoe should be
standing at the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are not a championship team. Most people picked
them to finish fourth in their own division, which is no disgrace
because the AFC East has proven to be the best division in
football. However, this team should be good enough to make the
playoffs, and if it fails to do that, it will be because it didn't
take advantage of the opportunities it was given.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is this:
</P>
<P>
   THEY CANNOT RUN THE FOOTBALL.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that they cannot PASS the football.
</P>
<P>
   And until they find a way to run the football _ either with
better blockers, or a better scheme, or better running backs _ they
are going to be no better than they are now, which is mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall from grace over the last five weeks _ when the
Patriots tumbled from 6-2 to 7-6 after a miserable 1-4 stretch _
they have scored a total of 69 points. That's a little less than 14
points per game. Not once in those five games have they scored 20
points. Any NFL coach will tell his team before a game that they
need at least 21 points to win. The Patriots are averaging a
touchdown less than that.
</P>
<P>
   And if you look closely at those 69 points, most of them have
come in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't score a touchdown in Indianapolis until the fourth
quarter. They didn't score a touchdown against Dallas at home until
the fourth quarter. They were down in Buffalo, 17-0, before they
scored a touchdown in the final five minutes. In the last five
games, they have scored one touchdown, total, in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they have no running game. Colts president Bill
Polian said after Sunday's game, ``We didn't even bother with their
run.'' Opponents focus on stopping Bledsoe and the wide receivers,
and they will continue to do so until New England finds a running
game.
</P>
<P>
   And the quarterback shouldn't be apologizing for that. Others
should be stepping forward to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reid's team is only 3-11, but he is upbeat about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players have played hard,'' he said. ``We told them from
the beginning this is the year we build the foundation, and I feel
we have been doing that. We're a young team, and we still need more
pieces to put together, but we are going in the right direction.
Nine of our games have been decided by a touchdown or less. We've
lost six games by 4 points or less, and we've been in those games
right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid is not sure whether rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb will
play against the Patriots Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hurt his knee in the last game, and he's doubtful,'' said
Reid. ``He wants to play, but we are not going to put him at risk.
If I think he can be OK and do the job, then he'll play, but we
won't know that until late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been coming along well. It takes time in this league,
but he's advanced in terms of knowing what to do at this point in
his first year. He has the arm. The first few games it was too
strong. The ball was really flying out of there. It's just a matter
of time and work to get him where he wants to be and I want him to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McNabb, and veteran Doug Peterson, is that the
Eagles do not have any wide receivers that would be considered for
the Pro Bowl. The team's first move in the draft next year is
expected to be for a wide receiver, followed by a defensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles can run the ball. They have a fine back in Duce
Staley, a bowling-ball type who is short but strong and can make
yardage after the first hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keeping telling our guys this is a building year,''
said Reid. ``With a couple of breaks, we could have won a few more
games. We're still playing hard, and continuing to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots should win this game, but if they don't watch out,
the Eagles might put another brick on their load, and it might be
the one that buries New England for the season.

BROWN SAYS HOUSING WILL BE PRIORITY IN NEXT TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, fresh from a landslide
victory in Tuesday's run-off election, said affordable housing in
an era of soaring real estate values would be the major challenge
of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it was too soon to propose specific remedies,
although he intends to push a broad study of the housing market
through the governing Board of Supervisors as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems of affordability will be the challenges that I
face in the second term,'' the mayor said after his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic shortage of housing and the glittering economy of the
Silicon Valley have made the real estate market in San Francisco
one of the most expensive in the nation. Soaring rents helped
propel the grass-roots campaign of Brown's rival, Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, who won a spot in the run-off
race with an unprecedented write-in campaign in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by his big victory over Ammiano, Brown said he would use
his second term to tackle a host of nuts-and-bolts problems,
including the housing issue and repairing the aging water and sewer
system.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who begins his second and final term Jan. 8, said it was
too early to start thinking about a legacy for his years as mayor.
``I'm not so much focused on legacy as I am on solving the problems
that exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledged that Ammiano's populist campaign put him
through the contest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Ammiano, the most liberal member of the board,
had forced him to more aggressively court moderate to conservative
voters on the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race in which I'm battling for a constituency that I,
frankly, have never had before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brown said he had to fight hard to keep his
base of supporters _ union workers, gays and lesbians, blacks and
Hispanics, some of whom defected to Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that represents a dramatic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a contentious campaign in which the mayor criticized
Ammiano's leadership and the supervisor attacked Brown's integrity,
the mayor said he would not hold a grudge and would work with
Ammiano in their roles as mayor and board president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever has the job as board president, I will endeavor on
behalf of the mayor's office and the people of this city to work
with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the housing crunch continues despite the approval of
a $100 million affordable housing bond act in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also vowed to help push the proposed stadium and an
adjoining commercial complex for the San Francisco 49ers pro
football team, a project that has been stalled by a feud among the
team owners.

LIMOS WIN BUT ONLY AFTER AN UPHILL FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The limos won.
</P>
<P>
   The party transportation summed it up. A dozen gleaming limos
sat outside Alioto's restaurant where Mayor Willie Brown had an
election-night dinner, while outside Tom Ammiano's party at the
Roccapulco nightclub was the sign ``Free bike parking across
street.''
</P>
<P>
   The bikes never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wasn't about to let a critical mass of bicyclists and
other dissidents take him by surprise again. He ran right over
them.
</P>
<P>
   Give Brown credit for working hard, spending big, getting his
message of leadership across, ``going West,'' as he put it, to
rouse the Asian-American voters of the west side of San Francisco,
and crushing the Ammiano insurgency down to its progressive core of
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new middle class of San Francisco, replacing the Irish and
Italians, are Chinese-American families, who own homes and small
businesses and are relatively conservative,'' said David Lee,
executive director of the Chinese-American Voters Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown was the only candidate speaking to them. It's
ironic because Brown made his chops fighting the old Irish and
Italian politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Ammiano credit, too. He gave Brown the scare of his
political life. Now Brown has to address the issues Ammiano pounded
home during the run-off election _ housing, homeless, development
and neighborhood issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a voice for the people who are traditionally shut
out,'' Ammiano shouted to his cheering supporters after the
election was lost Tuesday night, ``and we will be shut out no
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years Ammiano _ who is president of the
governing Board of Supervisors _ will help reshape San Francisco
politics around district elections, and perhaps run against one of
Brown's proteges. And there will be no more coronations of mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown won an overwhelming mandate, but it was a mandate for
changing his ways.
</P>
<P>
   When the absentee votes were counted, it was already over. Brown
had about 70 percent of the absentees, easily a record for a
liberal in San Francisco, and at the end had about 60 percent of
the vote to Ammiano's 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the landslide was being called a win-win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great thing,'' said Supervisor Gavin Newsom. ``It's
good for the mayor, good for Ammiano and good for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of Brown's vanity is that he is not going to allow
himself to be perceived as a failure,'' said political consultant
Jim Rivaldo, a Brown supporter who is sympathetic to Ammiano. ``He
has been energized.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to wait and see if Willie found God through Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Rich DeLeon, a professor of political science at San Francisco
State University, saw a connection between the surprising battle
over globalization in Seattle and ``the fracas in Frisco,'' as he
called this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campus has been politically dead for almost 30 years,''
DeLeon said. ``Because of this election you hear students talking
about politics without their professors hectoring them to.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLeon spoke of the changing demographics of San Francisco, the
revival of the anti-development cause, and San Francisco's lively
``politics of everything,'' as he called it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a pundit and supposed to be articulate,'' said
DeLeon, ``but when I look at what happened in the last year, I'm
speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the things that happened: Ideals are back. The
neighborhoods have been put out front. The Internet generation got
wired on politics, not just caffeine. Asian-Americans asserted
themselves at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, things are as they always have been in
politics. Willie Brown may have gone to a Chinese temple to pray,
but he didn't count on those prayers to be more important than
fund-raising appeals.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how Tom Ammiano would have done if he had
money and a machine more powerful than a bicycle.

CUSSLER'S `ATLANTIS' MAKES A BIG SPLASH
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas came early this year with the publication of Clive
Cussler's latest adventure thriller featuring Dirk Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantis Found'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $26.95, 534 pages) is a
delightful page turner that is almost impossible to put down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1858, a shore party from a whaling ship locked in the
Antarctic ice discovers the British merchantman Madras, ice-bound
for nearly a century. In its storage room, they find a skull carved
from obsidian. When the ice pack begins to break up, the shore
party runs for their own ship, taking only the skull and Madras'
log.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, miner Luis Marquez discovers a chamber deep in an
abandoned Colorado mine. ``It looked to be a perfect cube,
approximately 15 by 15 feet, with the same distance separating the
floor and the roof. Strange markings were cut into the sheer,
smooth walls.'' Marquez also finds a obsidian skull.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia O'Connell, an expert in ancient languages, is asked
to fly to Telluride and try to decipher the room's inscriptions.
She is met by anthropologist Thomas Ambrose, who introduces her to
Marquez. While the three explore the room, an avalanche blocks the
mine's entrance. Then an explosion rocks the mine and water begins
to flood into the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, who has been exploring the mountain's waterways, rescues
the three and gets them to a higher level in the mine. Before they
can get out of the mine, three men show up and tell them they will
never escape the mountain and reveal their find. Pitt knocks one
out and kills the other two after they say they are members of
``The Fourth Empire.'' Ambrose disappears, only to resurface and
try to kill Marquez, O'Connell and Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the three will be in danger until they can discover
the secret of the Fourth Empire, James Sandecker arranges to have
O'Connell, Marquez and their families placed in protective custody.
Pitt learns of another skull and is told the story of the Madras.
</P>
<P>
   Sandecker sends Pitt to Antarctica to try to find the Madras. He
also sends Pitt's pal Al Giordino to an island in the Indian Ocean,
where a Madras passenger had found the skull.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the deciphered writings will tell the story of a
race of people who roamed the seas thousands of years before the
pyramids were built and left their history in hidden chambers
around the world. An evil family of untold wealth has known the
story of the lost race since before the beginning of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Using a prediction made centuries before, the family concocts a
plan to wipe out most of mankind. Only their most loyal followers
will survive the planned holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantis Found'' is Cussler at his storytelling best. Not as
outrageous as some of the earlier Pitt adventures, ``Atlantis''
makes Dirk more human and less Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timeline.'' By Michael Crichton. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. 443
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton didn't set out to write another thriller. Rather he had
his sights set on a megaconglomerate. Prior to publication,
Crichton reportedly signed a groundbreaking deal for film rights to
``Timeline,'' forgoing a multimillion dollar upfront fee from
Paramount Pictures for as much as 15 percent of the movie's gross
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Timeline,'' ITC Research in Black Rock, Ariz., is the
master of quantum technology. It is also funding an archaeological
dig in the Dordogne region of France that includes a couple of
fortresses, a monastery and a mill. When an ITC representative
seems to know more about the site than the archaeologists, the
team's leader, Professor Edward Johnston, demands to be taken to
Black Rock to get some answers. Days go by without the team hearing
from Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   One day there is a collapse at the dig and an old parchment is
found and written on it is ``HELP ME 4/7/1357'' and it is
definitely Johnston's writing. Eventually, ITC will tell Johnston's
team that the company has developed a method to travel back in
time. Johnston has traveled back to the 14th century and is stuck
there. ITC asks the team to go back and rescue their professor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once they get there everything goes awry. France in
the 14th century was a very violent place and each member of the
team is in danger, especially Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   As you read ``Timeline,'' the words MAJOR MOTION PICTURE keep
flashing in your mine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very interesting story here, but this is just an
elaborate screenplay. Nevertheless, this is a must read for
Crichton fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Highland Christmas.'' By M.C. Beaton. Mysterious Press.
$156.95. 129 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Beaton's 14th book featuring Scottish Police Constable Hamish
Macbeth is a little gem.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth works in the dark and dreary village of Lockdubh in the
far northern Highlands. Calvinist to its core, no one puts up
Christmas lights or decorates a tree. An old biddy reports her cat
stolen and complains to Macbeth's superior that the constable is
not doing his job. Macbeth does hunt for the cat, but wants to know
why the lady is so frightened. A nearby village reports that its
tree and lights have been stolen. And Macbeth meets a 9-year-old
girl whose parents don't believe in Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Macbeth wants to play Santa Claus and his actions
will light up many hearts in Lockdubh.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Highland Christmas'' is heaped with oddball characters that
you want to know. The dialogue moves the plot along at a steady
pace. A perfect Christmas story for any reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oxford Companion to Crime &AMP; Mystery Writing.'' Edited by
Chief Rosemary Herbert. Oxford University Press. $49.95. 535 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery.'' By Bruce Murphy. St.
Martin's Minotaur. $75. 543 pages.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for a gift for a true mystery fan, either of
these books would be a great addition to a library. Both are
arranged from A to Z.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Nancy Drew was created by a man? I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I've only paged through both works, but I know I'll use
them often.

WORKPLACE PERKS MAY FUEL A CULT MENTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are provided with everything from child care to a cafeteria
to a gymnasium, and you have a dynamic leader who makes sure
everyone is strongly committed and feels empowered. So does that
make you a member of a great company or a cult?
</P>
<P>
   Probably some of each, says Dave Arnott, a professor at Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Baptist University and the author of ``Corporate Cults: The
Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All organizations have some level of cultish behavior; it's
just that some have more than others,'' Arnott writes. ``A
corporate cult is an individual-level construct. Only individuals
can make their corporation into a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   When publications offer lists of the best places to work in
America, the winners are often places that make it easier for
employees to take care of essential tasks like eating and exercise
without ever leaving the corporate campus. It is convenient for
employees, Arnott says, but it also separates them from the rest of
the world and makes them more emotionally dependent on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day care and schools at the corporation, while convenient,
effectively separate the employee from the community,'' Arnott
writes. ``Not only is the worker cut off from the community, the
child is cut off as well. The employee increasingly socializes only
with other workers who are parents of children in corporate day
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child knows only the children of other workers. Whatever
cultural stereotype exists in the corporation is magnified in the
children. All the programs aimed at diversifying society by
integrating people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds are
turned on their head by corporate day care.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes that separation from the community is one of three key
elements of a cult, corporate or otherwise. Charismatic leadership
and devotion are the other crucial factors, making people feel bad
if they leave the office or go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Arnott said he realizes that it is probably all
right and even healthy for an employee to have certain cultish
beliefs. He does in his own job. Using corporate child care might
save parents an hour a day and even let them have lunch with the
children, for example, and he acknowledges that the advantages can
outweigh the disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Just be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the organization offers you a cafeteria plan of, say, five
cultish activities, don't gorge on all five,'' Arnott said. ``Try
two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   He said companies aren't wrong for offering the activities;
workers just need to be careful that they don't get so immersed in
the company's beliefs that they lose their individuality. The
particularly vulnerable fall into three broad categories: those who
are new to the industry or corporation; those who have moved away
from their families or left their church; and those who have lost a
spouse through death or divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often is your organization considered a family?'' Arnott
said. ``Look at your circle of friendships and see how many are in
your organization and how many are outside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even an entrepreneur can make up a one-person cult, he said, if
all the person's energy and friendships are work-related.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott said the increasing commitment demanded by employers
might be felt more strongly as unemployment starts to increase.
Workers who have many options now might find them limited in the
future, making them more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott said members of corporate cults can be workaholics, but
the two are not necessarily connected. People who wear a pager
constantly or check their e-mail on vacation might not be
workaholics, but could be cult members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workaholics are measured by the number of hours they work.
Cult members are measured by their level of emotional attachment.''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I feel better now. The threat to my long-standing boycott of
major-league baseball has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, this boycott that I've waged on and off for
nearly a decade was hanging by a thread as a result of the New York
Yankees' brilliant World Series victory and the Texas Rangers'
magnificent decision to trade away one of baseball's premier
overpaid brats, Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees conducted a clinic in the art of playing baseball _
and exhibited a level of class in the process that conjured up
memories of yesteryear, when ballplayers were heroic figures and
baseball was truly the national pastime. And no sooner had the
World Series celebration concluded than the Rangers shipped
Gonzalez to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The combined exhilaration from the two events nearly overwhelmed
me, prompting me to all but pledge an end to my boycott if only the
Rangers would meet two conditions. I asked them to make sure that
third baseman Todd Zeile remained a Ranger and to make equally sure
that ex-Ranger pitcher Kenny Rogers did not return.
</P>
<P>
   And what did the Rangers do?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they bungled their negotiations with Zeile, and he
signed on with the New York Mets. And the Ranger honchos can't seem
to stop talking about the possibility of bringing back Rogers, the
sniveling prima donna whose brain-dead pitching for the Mets ended
that team's hopes of advancing to the World Series last season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just to rub salt in the wound, the Rangers announced
a gigantic price increase for many seats at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   I'm certainly disappointed that the local team will no longer
enjoy the services of Zeile, whose attitude toward the game and its
fans is a throwback to the humble baseball heroes of days gone by _
the Stan Musials, the Mickey Mantles, the Hank Aarons.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's hard work on the baseball diamond and his good
citizenship off the field will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I must confess to being relieved, in a way, that the
Rangers failed to meet my conditions, freeing me to continue
pursuing this boycott that has become almost second nature.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that I modified the boycott two seasons ago so that I
could watch baseball on television and read about the game in the
newspaper. But in making that change, I rededicated myself to the
essence of the boycott: denying baseball the only thing it really
cares about _ money _ by refusing to contribute financially to the
game in any way. I don't attend games in person, don't buy licensed
merchandise of any kind, and do my best to avoid buying the
products of companies that advertise during baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Any meaningful boycott is about economics, so I'm doing my small
part to punish the greedy owners and players who have turned a
once-great American institution into little more than an overhyped
commercial enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of folks, I know, the whole idea of a baseball boycott
seems pretty silly nowadays. Fans were up in arms back in 1994,
when a strike by players wiped out the last part of the season, the
playoffs and the World Series. Even the most devoted aficionados of
the game were reluctant to return when the billionaires finally got
back to business in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans gradually drifted back to the ballparks, gradually
started coughing up their hard-earned bucks for those outrageously
overpriced tickets and concessions, gradually eased back into the
habit of supporting the home team in particular and the game in
general. And after a brief period of catering to the fans to entice
them back, the game has resumed its proclivity for abusing these
loyal customers who passively pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment there last month, it seemed as though the Texas
Rangers were heading down the less-traveled path by unloading the
self-absorbed all-star, Gonzalez, and perhaps making room for the
selfless solid citizen, Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. The Rangers flubbed the chance to keep Zeile. They
are apparently pursuing Kenny Rogers. They have increased ticket
prices _ again.
</P>
<P>
   And the boycott continues.

TRY ON DIFFERENT HATS BEFORE MAKING CAREER DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you face a tough career decision, think about
Richard Bachman _ a best-selling author who technically does not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Bachman himself was dreamed up by Stephen King, who usually
specializes in nightmares. After writing bestseller after
bestseller, King thought it would be fun to write with a
</P>
<P>
   different voice, under a different name, and see whether that
struggling new author could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   As Bachman became moderately successful, though, some diehard
King fans began to notice similarities between their two writing
styles. Eventually, King acknowledged that he was indeed Bachman,
but he continues to write as Bachman from time to time; some
stories just seem better when told from Bachman's voice.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to do anything that dramatic, but it does help
to look at dilemmas from fresh perspectives. You can, and should,
ask people for help when you really need it, of course, but
sometimes just thinking about what others would do can help you
figure things out.
</P>
<P>
   That's why having a diverse network is so important. If you
listen well, you get inside the heads of people from all sorts of
backgrounds, and their approaches might help you come up with a
fresh way of doing things. Learning to see things from other
people's perspectives is a crucial career skill.
</P>
<P>
   One effective way to organize your thinking is to use ``Six
Thinking Hats,'' Edward de Bono's bestseller that has recently been
released in paperback. A consultant and author of several books on
the thinking process, de Bono suggests that individuals and groups
can limit confused thinking by using his metaphor of six colored
hats:
</P>
<P>
   _ Blue is for organizing, like a facilitator at a meeting. It's
used for determining what issues need to be discussed and what the
ground rules will be for discussing them.
</P>
<P>
   _ White is for facts and figures only, with no interpretation.
It's used to outline the essential facts and show what necessary
information might be missing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red is for the emotional view, your gut feelings about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black is for the negatives about the issue, the chance to play
devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yellow is all the positives about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Green is for creative ideas. How could the issue be approached
differently, or avoided completely?
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who has been at a meeting with a few overly negative or
overly positive people should appreciate why de Bono's method has
dramatically shortened meetings at some companies. At traditional
meetings, somebody raises a point, then the negative person chimes
in. Someone else says something, the negative person rebuts it. The
dance can seem to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Using the hats, though, the person running the meeting focuses
the discussion on one hat's approach at a time. You get all the
positives brought out at once, and all the negatives brought out
together, rather than the back-and-forth than can grind meetings to
a halt. You also have a clear separation between facts and
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   As an individual, the hats can help organize your thinking.
Suppose you have a job offer, but you are torn about whether to
accept it. You don't really need the blue hat because the
alternatives are pretty clear, but here is how the other hats might
help:
</P>
<P>
   _ White: List all the objective data you have comparing the two
jobs, including salary, benefits and hours. Put in any other
crucial facts, such as whether you would be leaving your current
job before you were vested in the pension plan. When was the last
time each company laid people off? Is one company growing and the
other shrinking? Do you need more facts to help you decide? How can
you get them?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yellow: What are the best reasons for changing jobs? Is the
pay better? Will you get a chance to develop more skills? Does the
new company have a better reputation? Will you more flexibility?
The chance to telecommute? Are you stagnating at your current job?Does changing let you escape a bad boss or an unstable company?
</P>
<P>
   _ Black: Why should you turn down the offer? Will it make your
commute worse? Will you have less time to spend with your family?
Will your lack of seniority make you a likely candidate if layoffs
occur? Will you be leaving a good boss?
</P>
<P>
   _ Red: What does your gut tell you? What does your heart tell
you? Will you be heartsick over leaving the old place, or will you
be leaving skid marks in the parking lot? Don't underestimate the
power of emotion in career decisions. Often your instincts are more
powerful than your objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Green: Are there are ways to simplify your decision? Can you
push your current company for better pay or more flexibility? What
is the new company's offer missing that would make it irresistible?
How would you feel about asking for it?
</P>
<P>
   Look at whether you are even tackling the right problem. If you
consider the decision a ``lesser of two evils,'' think about
whether you ought to be changing careers rather than just jobs.
What parts of the job do you really enjoy? Is there another way to
use those talents?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether you prefer Richard Bachman or Edward de
Bono, try putting on a different hat the next time you face a
difficult decision. You just might end up feeling like a King.

``ignoring'' the plight of Arabs since Israel's birth. President
Clinton urged Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to look
beyond their differences and into a future fresh with the promise
of peace. ``The road to peace is no easier, and in many ways it is
harder than the road to war.'' said Clinton. ``There will be
challenges along the way, but we have never had such an
extraordinary opportunity to reach a comprehensive
settlement.''Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service). 20.

a possible divorce settlement. It will be their first face-to-face
meeting in the case since they split this summer. The court-ordered
mediation will take place at the offices of Marianne's lawyer, John
Mayoue. Settlement remains unlikely, however, because Marianne
still hasn't deposed her husband's lover, Callista Bisek. That
deposition is considered a cornerstone of Marianne's effort to get
what she feels would be a fair settlement. Gingrich's attorneys say
he's ready to split the couple's existing assets in half and move
on. (Stanford, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

CARTOONISTS DREW INSPIRATION FROM SCHULZ'S PIONEERING WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM WHITING  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All fans of Peanuts will mourn the comic strip's passing, but
none more than Charles Schulz's fellow cartoonists.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks quite the way he does,'' said Hank Ketcham,
whose Dennis the Menace was created in October 1950, the same month
Peanuts made its debut. Ketcham, 80, has two assistants who
collaborate on Dennis via fax. This will ensure that his strip
lives on, but Ketcham never expected Schulz to trust any hand but
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want anyone to impose their personalities into the
characters,'' Ketcham said Tuesday from his office in Carmel,
Calif. ``He's always said that when he goes, nobody else is going
to draw the strip, and I guess he's just decided that at this stage
of the game, going through what he's been through, Peanuts will
offer space to new cartoonists who're just yearning to get into the
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz has already inspired several generations of such artists,
cartoonists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the biggest influence in my life,'' said Patrick
McDonnell, creator of Mutts. ``Since I was 4, I wanted to be a
cartoonist, mainly from reading Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Evans, creator of Luann, said, ``I imagine if you stopped
100 cartoonists on the street and asked them who was their No. 1
influence, 99 would say Sparky (as Schulz is known to friends and
family). He really brought the comic strip into the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could come up with even one Great Pumpkin or kite-eating
tree or security blanket, I'd be happy for the rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was echoed by Garry Trudeau, whose own Doonesbury
may have been the influence for the one-in-a-hundred strips not
inspired by Peanuts. ``For 50 years, Peanuts has shown us the way.
The uncontested gold standard for comics,'' Trudeau said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Schulz does is an intensely personal effort,'' said Dan
Piraro, creator of Bizarro. ``He started the psychological gag and
developed it to the extent that we're all dependent on it. It's so
standard now that people take it for granted. But it didn't exist
in the newspapers before Schulz did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that didn't exist was the use of the ironic touch,
sweetened by the voices of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he did that was a breakthrough was to have children
acting and behaving as adults,'' said Evans. ``That's what has
given the strip such great appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Twohy, creator of That's Life, recalled the first time he
saw a Peanuts strip as a kid, more than 40 years ago. Twohy heard
his dad laugh, and he looked and laughed, too. ``One of the really
great appeals of the strip is little kids to old folks can respond
to it and love it,'' said Twohy, who also was impressed with a
Schulz interview he saw years ago on the ``Mike Douglas Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me is he didn't talk about anything but the
characters, and he talked about them with real love, like they were
real people, and that stuck with me,'' Twohy said.
</P>
<P>
   Peanuts didn't just influence the comic strips that came after,
it also had an effect on the strips already in existence. Gus
Arriola, who created Gordo in 1941, simplified his drawing style
after studying Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His retirement leaves an unfillable hole on the comic page,''
said Arriola, 82, from Carmel. ``But Charlie Brown and Snoopy are a
bright legacy, a permanent decoration in the global culture.''
</P>
<P>
   They will still be around awhile. United Feature Syndicate,
which has circulated Peanuts since day one, will start running the
strips from 1974, after the last new daily strip runs January 3.
The last original Sunday strip will appear February 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly imagine a newspaper without Peanuts,'' said
Evans, ``and even the reruns will be great.''

THE PEANUTS GALLERY IS CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Phil Frank draws the comic strip Farley for The Chronicle.)  
 By PHIL FRANK  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news is not good in Toon Town today: Charles Schulz is
putting the Peanuts bunch to bed. Jan. 4, 2000, will mark the last
appearance of the daily strip, and the last color Sunday strip will
be February 20.
</P>
<P>
   This seven-day-a-week cartoon, which has been in print for
nearly 50 years, has been Schulz's life. And in many ways, Peanuts
has been our life as well.
</P>
<P>
   What made it special when it first saw print in October 1950 was
how different the cartoon was from other strips of the day. Instead
of adventure, drama and gags, Schulz was talking about feelings and
what it was like to be human _ to win, to lose, to love, to hate
and to sit on a hillside and wonder about what might lie in the
future or what might have been. As if that weren't different
enough, he put the words in the mouths of children and a dog.
</P>
<P>
   By having children express adult thoughts and talk about being
human, he gave all the cartoonists who came after him a broader
palette to work from. Today's comics pages look like therapy
sessions laid out on paper. That's a far cry from what comics were
in the '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of Peanuts that gave it such global acceptance was
that Schulz endowed the strip with a sense of innocence. People all
over the world could identify with the strip because Schulz was
talking about the universal human condition.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Schulz _ ``Sparky,'' as he prefers to be
called _ hoped that the strip would be called Li'l Folks. He never
cared for the Peanuts moniker that United Feature Syndicate hung on
it, but he learned to live with it. Early on, the legs of adults
who were interacting with the children occasionally would be seen.
They soon disappeared, however, and the world he had created
belonged from then on, as it should have, to little folk.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, Sparky Schulz has drawn every line of every
cartoon panel and written every syllable in every word balloon,
seven days a week _ an impressive feat. And through the years, the
comic strip and its array of delightful characters have inspired
millions of readers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   All the cartoonists who have been inspired by Schulz's insight
and humor over the years are sitting at their drawing boards right
now thinking about him and wishing him the best.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I can't help remembering that Sparky always thought that
I put a little too much politics and point of view into my
cartoons. He once said to me, ``You can't change the world with a
comic strip.''
</P>
<P>
   And I always laughed at that, because in many ways, that's
exactly what Sparky did.

BOOKSELLERS WANT CALIFORNIA TO TAX INTERNET SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of California booksellers is urging
the state to be more forceful in collecting taxes from on-line
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering in San Francisco, the group of independent
shopkeepers took specific aim at three giants of e-commerce:
Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand the state's Board of Equalization collects sales tax
as existing law requires,'' said Hut Landon, owner of Landon Books
in Corte Madera. ``This is an instance where the state is handing
major retailers a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The request to the state agency was made by the Northern
California Independent Booksellers Association and the American
Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly discriminatory,'' said Neal Sofman, who hosted
the event at his own store, A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books on
Van Ness Avenue. ``If this imbalance remains, we'll lose our tax
base.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the request of the bookstore owners, Board of
Equalization Chairman Johan Klehs said the state is, indeed,
enforcing the existing tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, the rules for e-commerce are the same as
catalog selling,'' Klehs said. ``If you have a nexus in California,
or employees in California, you're required to collect sales tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce is
considering whether to tax transactions that take place on the
Internet. The 1998 law creating the study commission placed a
three-year moratorium on new taxes targeting Internet services or
Internet access services.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not exempt e-commerce companies from having to pay
state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ross, who owns Cody's Books in Berkeley, said he first
complained to the state in July and has received little
satisfaction from the Board of Equalization so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax policy should not be politicized,'' said Ross, who went on
to accuse the Board of Equalization of bowing to Silicon Valley
pressure. ``Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com are not
collecting taxes in clear violation of the law. It's bad policy and
bad politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The state and national booksellers associations maintain that
the three on-line booksellers have a formidable presence in
California and that should count as an established nexus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that these are not California businesses is just
nonsense,'' said Bill Petrocelli, owner of Book Passage in Corte
Madera. ``Large Internet commerce people are being given a free
ride. That's simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Prem, a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in San Francisco, sides with the on-line retailers, saying
they are doing nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the current tax laws work, the position that Amazon,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders are taking is legal,'' Prem said. ``The
fact that they're not collecting sales tax is perfectly legal. The
companies have set up subsidiaries for on-line retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prem said a little-known or enforced tax, called the ``use
tax,'' could be the answer to the Internet taxation riddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tax that's imposed on a purchaser that buys something
from out of state and brings it into the state to use it,'' Prem
said. ``It's been on the books in California since the 1930s, but
is seldom enforced.''

WEB RETAILERS AIRING THE WITTIEST ADS ON TV _ BUT ARE THEY
WORKING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're wondering what to call him, he's the Pets.com Puppet
Spokesdog Thing. If you're wondering what that's all about, he's
the little sock puppet who shills for Pets.com, an online pet
store, in a series of amusing TV commercials that began in August.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the Puppet Spokesdog Thing at a dog park, envying one of
his canine companions: ``Oh, boy, he's got a stuffed thing! I love
stuffed things!'' Here he is at the holiday table, conspiring with
Max, the family dog, to pawhandle a piece of turkey. Here he is
looking at stockings hung by the chimney with care, appalled at the
evil things humans do to socks: ``The horror!''
</P>
<P>
   Cute, huh? Funny, right? But do commercial campaigns like the
Puppet Spokesdog Thing make you want to log on to Web sites like
Pets.com? Online retailers and advertising companies are betting
that the answer is a hearty ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   They're betting a lot _ $2 billion in 1999, by most estimates _
on TV advertising. But with scores of Web sites _ or ``dot-coms,''
as they're popularly called _ flooding the airwaves, they're also
aware that for many, it will be a losing gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are roughly 8 million Web sites,'' says Anne Hollows,
senior vice president of global brand strategy for Monster.com,
which also has a striking commercial campaign. ``And they've got to
figure out a way to get noticed. ... People tend to lump dot-coms
together. We've thought of it in terms of car categories: We think
we each have a different product to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's ad campaign, Hollows says, has drawn attention,
with traffic increasing 450 percent in the past year. The ``global
career management'' site is running a commercial with small
children expressing ironic ambitions: ``When I grow up, I want to
have a brown nose'' or ``I want to be forced into early
retirement.'' The company has spent roughly $30 million on its
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been well worth it,'' Hollows says. ``We're extremely
profitable as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also been worth it at Pets.com, which may have the best
dot-com commercials running these days. It's not just the Puppet
Spokesdog Thing, but the simplicity of the Web site's name and the
cleverness of its tag line _ ``Because pets can't drive'' _ that
sticks in your head. Curiously, though, if you log on to the
Pets.com site, you won't see a much of the Spokesdog's humor, but
rather a fairly straightforward pet-supply site with articles and
care-taking tips. But the online company is using the Spokesdog's
celebrity as a gift to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see the sock puppet in stickers on boxes, in different
poses,'' says Amy Robinson, director of marketing for Pets.com.
``We're sending out holiday cards to our customers, which feature
the sock puppet in funny, clever ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers have asked to buy the sock puppet, which may be
surpassing the Taco Bell chihuahua as top commercial ``dog,'' and
one woman told the company that she wanted to dress as the puppet
for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson disagrees with the suggestion that the commercials are
``wacky,'' although that adjective is being pasted on just about
any humorous dot-com commercial. ``We actually feel like (the
Spokesdog) personifies the passion we feel toward animals, and the
way people feel about their pets,'' Robinson says.
</P>
<P>
   The clever approach has its detractors, though. Critics point
out that although humor draws attention to an ad, the humor is what
gets remembered instead of the product. Many sites are taking this
criticism to heart. Amazon.com _ a Web site with such name
recognition that it doesn't seem to need the help _ recently
changed paths from the wacky route (a commercial in which gerbils
were launched at the company logo) to the traditional (a Mitch
Miller-style singalong). Monster.com's spot, despite its ironic
humor, is filmed in stark black and white with the type of
drive-the-speed-limit editing we used to see in the pre-MTV age.
</P>
<P>
   And iCelebrate.com, an Irving, Texas-based site that sells
holiday-themed merchandise, went with the home-comfort approach: As
``iCelebrate'' is repeated over and over to the tune of ``Carol of
the Bells,'' a house (complete with cozy border collie) lights up
with Christmas flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our category is a very sentimental category,'' Julie Abdinoor,
vice president of marketing for iCelebrate, says of the holiday
site. ``We wanted our commercial to evoke very positive,
traditional feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Tami Hollis, iCelebrate's publicist, puts it in terms of hitting
a demographic target. ``What we're finding is that women are
responding to our ads,'' Hollis says. ``The Pets.com spot doesn't
necessarily appeal to me. I'm a woman, and I don't necessarily get
that humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers find fault with any ``dot-com'' advertising,
regardless of whether it's played silly or straight. Many of the
Web companies that are spending millions on advertising are
start-ups, investing more on ads than they are taking in in
revenues ``(The New York Times'' reported that send.com spent $20
million on advertising, even though at the time the gift site had
only $10 million in venture-capital funding). The belief is that
you gotta pay to play, but business writers and technology wonks
say that the real winners are the advertising agencies and TV
networks that are benefiting from all the money being spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a belief by some people that eventually there's going
to be a shakeout of some kind,'' says Jerry Preyss, president of
Playground, the Cleveland-based advertising agency that created the
iCelebrate spot. ``Many of the dot-coms that exist today won't
exist in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a sense that dot-coms, by advertising on
television, are feeding the hand that bites them even though the
media advertise in or on competing media all the time. But
Web-surfing and channel-surfing seem, on the surface, to be
incompatible, as most people don't have their computer up and
running while they're watching the tube. The question is whether
people will check out a Web site just because of a clever ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a necessary evil,'' Preyss says of TV advertising. ``The
simple fact is, if nobody knows about it, nobody's going to visit
your site. A 30-second commercial will increase your visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollows dismisses any contention that TV advertising works
against online companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's use a car analogy,'' she says. ``You may not actively be
in the buying process, or even thinking about buying. But if
commercials for a certain car company catch your attention, you'll
have that in mind when you do start to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollows says that when Monster.com ads aired during this year's
Super Bowl, the company monitored minute-by-minute traffic on its
site, out of curiosity. The results were surprising: Traffic did
surge right after the commercials aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were literally multitasking,'' Hollows says. ``I find
that bizarre.''

THE NIGHT THE LIGHTS WENT OUT IN LITTLE ROCK _ AND WENT ON AT
DISNEY WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that Jennings Osborne didn't want his Christmas lights.
He gave away the truly astounding display because some of his
neighbors in Little Rock, Ark., complained of the eye-popping glare
and the extra traffic they attracted.
</P>
<P>
   How bright could these lights possibly be, you ask? By 1993,
Osborne's yard had 3 million lights and could be seen by plane from
80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ordered him to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massive commercial lighting displays generated by commercial
transformers are not appropriate in quiet residential
neighborhoods,'' the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Disney World inherited 350 miles of Christmas
lights, complete with 32.2 miles of extension cables, for its own
``Residential Street'' in the back lot of Disney-MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's infatuation started in 1986, when his 6-year-old
daughter asked him if he would hang some Christmas lights at their
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung 1,000 red lights that first year, and each year after
that it got bigger and bigger,'' the businessman recalled in a
recent telephone visit. ``This year, we added another million in
Orlando, so it's up to 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, there were a couple of neighbors a mile and a
half away who disapproved of all the lights. The two closest gave
me so much trouble I just bought their houses and decorated them,
too. Then some of the other neighbors took me to court, claiming my
lights were a nuisance,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When Osborne lost in the lower courts, he took his case to the
U.S. Supreme Court, but the high court sent the case back to
Arkansas, where the judges reconvened during their 1993 Christmas
break and ordered Osborne to cut back the number of lights in his
enormous display and the hours they were lit.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply would mean a $10,000-a-day fine and 10 days in
jail. When he defied the order, Osborne was fined $10,000, but the
jail time was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so devastated. This was a gift we gave to the people
of Arkansas. I thought my world would come to an end,'' Osborne
says. ``As it turned out, it's the greatest thing that ever
happened. Now millions get to see our lights. We get to share our
gift with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of the lights' fate spread, the Osborne family started
getting letters from people all over the world who wanted to give
the lights a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I got a phone call from a gentleman in Orlando who
said he had a residential street where we could put the lights,''
Osborne says. ``I asked him to put his proposal in writing, and a
couple of days later, I got a letter on Disney stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him back, and he clarified that Residential Street
was on Disney property, and suddenly I realized exactly where he
was talking about. I thought that was the neatest thing in the
world. We had been going to Disney World the day after Christmas
for years, and I had always said it would be neat to take our
lights with us some time,'' he says. The lights were relocated
there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Osborne, who is an avid Elvis fan, also lit up
Graceland in Memphis, Tenn. _ but he says he only used about 2
million lights there.
</P>
<P>
   At the Disney-MGM Studios' back lot, the eight houses on
Residential Street are not only outlined in lights but totally
covered with them.
</P>
<P>
   Guests can take in all the lights through special holographic
glasses that give the display even more brilliance _ as well as a
few visual surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The display's 70-foot-tall centerpiece tree has 58,000 lights; a
30-foot tree in one of the yards has 27,300 lights; and 51 other
illuminated trees _ both real and artificial _ brighten the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-D replica of the world floats above the entry to the
display, flashing the words, ``Peace on Earth.'' More than 170
angels are suspended overhead, gently fluttering their wings; two
30-foot-tall carousels grace the lawns; and three flying Santas,
each with eight not-so-tiny reindeer, hover above the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the spectacle of lights each evening through Jan. 2
are snow flurries, generated by 66 snow machines, even on warm
Florida nights when temperatures rarely dip below 60.
</P>
<P>
   Disney says it takes 21,000 hours of manpower each holiday
season to install the lights and display pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who heads Arkansas Research, a private company that
does research for pharmaceutical companies, is pleased with the new
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lights in 32 places in Arkansas _ about 40 million
lights all together, including Orlando and Memphis,'' he says.''It
just brings tears to my eyes. The courts did the right thing after
all. They opened a million doors for me.''

DON'T EXPECT THIS CAKE TO BE A FLOP

   A reader uncovered an old recipe she had for flop cake, which
called for boxes of this and boxes of that. Unfortunately, box
sizes often change, so she had no idea of proportion sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, one of the ingredients called for was Bisquick, a
product still manufactured by General Mills. Sarah Foley of General
Mills found the recipe in her archives and sent it along.
</P>
<P>
   In testing this cake, I didn't find it to ``flop,'' or sink, a
great deal, but it was good nonetheless. To get more of a flop, you
might want to shake the pan once or twice during the baking time.

   This one is a real puzzle. Jewell Susong from Johnson City,

   A reader sends the following: ``Years ago, probably in the late

have been a recipe from a German restaurant in New York City.''

THE LAST WORD ON LAST-MINUTE GIFT SHOPPING: CENTRAL MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another day or two, it will officially be time for
last-minute Christmas shopping. It is a time with which I am
painfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The only way I survive is to make that desperate trip to the
local mall with the suffocating traffic, exceedingly remote
parking, overwrought and angry shoppers, and nothing but broken
packages and odd sizes on the sale tables.
</P>
<P>
   I generally announce that I'm willing to pay top prices for
useless gifts, wave my credit card and, eventually, reluctantly, a
clerk shows up to help.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   I will still shop late. It's my nature. But I'm shopping at a
place I really like. A place where I can find gifts for everyone,
and I don't mind taking a lot of time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to Austin's Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   This 63,000-square-foot grocery store is the North Pole to those
of us who like to cook, and, more important, like to eat. Nestled
back among the oak trees of middle Austin, Central Market is a
giant toy store, a beckoning Santa with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   It grabs you right at the front door where cases of Clementines
_ sinfully sweet, seedless tangerines from Spain _ are stacked like
orange-colored Nutcrackers. A gift all by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section honestly smells like a refreshing rain has
just fallen. There are no sissy sprinklers spitting water on these
rows of produce. A guy with a cart comes by every few minutes to
shovel _ yes, shovel _ scoops of ice between the stacks.
</P>
<P>
   White asparagus stands at attention and portobello mushrooms the
size of hubcaps spill over from their cases. Winter squashes add
color against the greens of arugula, frisee and romaine. Stalks of
sugar cane cover one corner, next to a giant box of stem-leaf
grapefruit, a Texas variety that is sweet and low in acid.
</P>
<P>
   Central Market has more than 500 varieties of fresh produce.
Many are organically grown, some from local growers.
</P>
<P>
   Gift baskets beg to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   The meat and fish markets are just around the curve, and the
wonders continue. Whole redfish, snapper and grouper peer from
behind the counter. Thick slices of monkfish and mahi-mahi lie next
to rows of tuna and salmon. There are piles of oysters and mussels.
</P>
<P>
   Sausages are the first thing you see at the meat counter and,
believe me, there is a sausage for everyone: turkey cilantro,
andouille, Philly cheese and bright-red chorizo are on display.
Workers behind the counter show off a list of more than 60
varieties and say you only have to make your choice known a day in
advance and they'll do the preparation.
</P>
<P>
   One of their most popular is chicken, cherry and pecan.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is another place where gift baskets plead for
filling. Large, crusty rounds of blue-cheese bread, buttermilk and
Westphalia pumpernickel lure you to the counter, where it is
apparently OK to press your nose against the glass and ogle.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever asked me to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In an adjacent area, bulk bins are filled with pastas, teas,
coffees, nuts, spices and grains. There are more than 700 varieties
of cheeses from Texas and around the world. An olive and salsa bar
offers tubs of pico de gallo, guacamole, basil pesto, hummus and
blue cheese-pancetta dip.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite place, a small, unadorned corner of the store, is
the tortilleria, where organic whole-wheat tortillas, flour
tortillas, and spicy, peppered Southwestern tortillas come right
off the hot presses. There is a butter tortilla that causes you to
slap passers-by and drag them to the counter.
</P>
<P>
   There's a floral department, a cafe, and a beer and wine
selection that literally numbers in the thousands. Central Market
caters and offers cooking classes, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to fill your own gift baskets, the store has
people who will do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, Central Market is open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
seven days a week. There are two stores in Austin _ the older and
best-known is at 4001 N. Lamar Blvd.; the other is at 4477 S. Lamar
Blvd. Santa lives at both.

THE TOP 10 ARTS HAPPENINGS OF THE CENTURY: CLASSICAL MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Classical Music
</P>
<P>
   1913: In spite of a rioting audience, the show goes on at the
premiere of Igor Stravinsky's ``The Rite of Spring'' in Paris _ and
modernism in music is born, with dissonance and orchestral color
evoking a primitive past but reflecting the turmoil and energy of
the age.
</P>
<P>
   1923: Liszt meets Tin Pan Alley when George Gershwin's still
appealing combination of jazz and classical music, ``Rhapsody in
Blue'' for piano and jazz band, debuts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   1934: The melodious music of Tchaikovsky and the limitations of
his young, mostly female ensemble inspire Russian-born
choreographer George Balanchine to create ``Serenade.'' Premiered
at the estate of a wealthy Balanchine admirer, ``Serenade'' will
define ballet in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   1939: Denied, because of her race, a routine booking at
Constitution Hall, an auditorium in Washington, D.C., owned and
operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution,
African-American contralto Marian Anderson instead appears on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial before a crowd of 75,000. In 1955,
she will become the first African-American to perform at the
Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   1941: A literally captive audience of 5,000 prisoners of war in
Germany witnesses the premiere of imprisoned French composer
Olivier Messiaen's ``Quartet for the End of Time.'' Working with a
damaged piano, clarinet, violin and cello available in the prison
camp, the composer (who plays the piano at the premiere) turns the
limitations of the instruments to his advantage, creating a unique
sound and vision of angels in the midst of international
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   1942: With Russia under siege by Adolf Hitler's armies, Dmitri
Shostakovich composes his Symphony No. 7, a tribute to the national
spirit and courage of his homeland. After the premiere of the
symphony in Russia, the score is microfilmed, carried by plane to
Tehran, Iran, and by car to Cairo, Egypt, then flown across North
Africa and the Atlantic to America, where leading conductors
compete for the right to perform it. The American debut is
presented in a radio broadcast with Arturo Toscanini conducting.
</P>
<P>
   1945: Just weeks after the end of World War II in Europe,
audiences in London see the birth of a new type of 20th-century
opera when Benjamin Britten's ``Peter Grimes'' premieres.
Extraordinary musical lyricism and profound pessimism combine to
launch the career of the most significant operatic composer of the
postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   1958: The Cold War thaws temporarily when young Texas pianist
Van Cliburn wins first prize _ and the hearts of Russian music
lovers _ at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in Moscow.
Americans respond as enthusiastically as the Russians, greeting the
new national hero with a ticker-tape parade in New York on his
return.
</P>
<P>
   1976: Scott Joplin, one of America's greatest musical geniuses
and the creator, via ragtime, of the most significant body of solo
piano music written in America, is finally honored with a special
Pulitzer Prize for music, 60 years after his death at age 48 in
1916.
</P>
<P>
   1989: American conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein celebrates
the fall of the Berlin Wall with performances of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony. In the choral section, Bernstein substitutes the word
``''Freiheit'''' (''freedom'') for the original ``''Freude''''
(''joy''). Appropriately, soloists for the event represent East
Germany, West Germany, the United States and Great Britain.

<P>
   CIR-WORKER-MONITORING (Undated) _ In 1999, at least 45 percent
of employers said they monitored their employees' phone calls,
computer files or e-mail messages, according to the American
Management Association. That number, based on a survey of more than
1,000 human-resources managers at corporations of varying sizes, is
up from 35 percent two years ago. The monitoring is necessary,
employers argue, because of the changing nature of the workplace.
Supervisors must keep tabs on which workers are wasting company
time by surfing to entertainment Web sites, which ones are sending
e-mail messages that create a hostile environment for women or
members of minority groups, and which ones are distributing company
secrets or jamming their networks with bulk e-mail. Balancing that
desire for control with an employee's rights to privacy has never
been easy. By Lisa Guernsey.

ALL THAT GLITTERS MAY ALSO GLOW FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Angel or devil? Millennium cutie or retro siren?
The choice in makeup style this holiday season is entirely up to
you.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic companies have tapped various trends for gala looks.
Traditionally, red lipstick was the holiday staple, but as New
Year's Eve draws nigh, red has been augmented by things glimmery,
silvery and space age.
</P>
<P>
   M.A.C, that fashion-forward company whose reds are sublime
(particularly Russian Red, reported to be Madonna's favorite), has
spun on a dime this season, promoting a snowbound look with
superfine glitter over a white-white makeup base, silver lipstick
to wear alone or over a luscious pink, a collection of mirrored,
pearly or glitter hair ornaments and false eyelashes spiced up with
a teensy band of glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Saint Laurent, meanwhile, has chosen a golden glamour-gal
look polished off with one of the most beautiful red lipsticks
around. Spinning off from Queen Amidala's signature Kabuki style in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' YSL makeup designer Terri de
Gunzberg designed a collection called One Love that is truly
original and complimentary to just about all complexions and hair
color.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of the look is Royal Glow, a ``dry oil'' with a
coppery-gold sparkle. Coupled with Shimmering Powder, an iridescent
beigy-pink also flecked in metallic, Royal Glow, the effect is a
rosy, healthy glow. Amidala's Red, the Rouge Pure No. 71, is an
intense blue-red that works magic on both blondes and brunettes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Simonson from YSL/Saks Fifth Avenue in San Francisco used
Amidala's Red on model Tracy with a very simple, '50s-style oeil de
biche (doe-eye). In other words: She lined Tracy's eyes with black
liquid liner, popped on the M.A.C lashes, mascara'd like crazy and
from there, let the lips take precedence. The effect: Fifties
Screen Siren.
</P>
<P>
   On model Brittany, Alexis created a frosted look with pale
lavenders (Tommy Hilfiger's eye shadow pencil), shimmery ``snow
flakes'' (M.A.C's glitter) and a pale rose/lavender YSL powder
blush on the cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   Other marvelous ways to glow for the holidays:
</P>
<P>
   _ Este Lauder's fat glitter-stick that leaves a trail of pinky
copper sparkles wherever you want them; Lancme's Micro Paillettes
from last Christmas season, which can be sprinkled in the hair
(spray it first), or laid like a trail of fairy dust on the body
(over body cream or Vaseline to make it stay).
</P>
<P>
   _ Chanel's handy little pots of sheer sparkle, Cristal Glitter
(diamond-bright flecks suspended in a clear gel to put on face or
body) or Pure Frost (in either Crimson, a metallic red for cheeks
and lips, or Cristal, a pinky-white sheer cream to highlight
cheekbones, the decolletage, eyelids, whatever with a subtle,
light-catching sheen), plus Chanel's definitive silver metallic
nail enamel, Silver Bells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Versace's silver glitter eyeliner/eyelid decor, 2000 Lights on
Eyes, a silver-flecked gel that you can paint on even the most
sensitive eyelids with a self-contained brush.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to collect their look from many
different cosmetic counters, Francois Nars has put it all together
for in two specially designed millennium artist palettes, Last
Dance I (warm tones of copper, gold, peach and white pearl pared
with burnished browns for the lips and body glitter for fun) and
Last Dance II (berry tones and reds with a mixture of silver and
gold accents) at Saks Fifth Avenue.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

<P>
   A: Write to Flutie or anyone else affiliated with the team in
care of Buffalo Bills, One Bills Drive, Orchard Park, NY 14127.
</P>
<P>
   After learning in 1995 that their son has the neurological

   Q: I heard a weatherperson say that dew point meant the
percentage of moisture in the air. I thought that was humidity.
What's the difference? _ J.D.J., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Both measurements describe the moistness in the air, but they
track it in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dew point is the temperature to which air must cool for its
moisture to condense and form dew. Humidity, more accurately called
relative humidity, is the percentage of moisture in the air.
Humidity reaches 100 percent when the air contains all the water
vapor it can possibly hold.
</P>

   The dew point of air increases rapidly as humidity increases and
is often used as part of a ``discomfort index.''

THE TOP 10 ARTS HAPPENINGS OF THE CENTURY: CLASSICAL MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Classical Music
</P>
<P>
   1913: In spite of a rioting audience, the show goes on at the
premiere of Igor Stravinsky's ``The Rite of Spring'' in Paris _ and
modernism in music is born, with dissonance and orchestral color
evoking a primitive past but reflecting the turmoil and energy of
the age.
</P>
<P>
   1923: Liszt meets Tin Pan Alley when George Gershwin's still
appealing combination of jazz and classical music, ``Rhapsody in
Blue'' for piano and jazz band, debuts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   1934: The melodious music of Tchaikovsky and the limitations of
his young, mostly female ensemble inspire Russian-born
choreographer George Balanchine to create ``Serenade.'' Premiered
at the estate of a wealthy Balanchine admirer, ``Serenade'' will
define ballet in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   1939: Denied, because of her race, a routine booking at
Constitution Hall, an auditorium in Washington, D.C., owned and
operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution,
African-American contralto Marian Anderson instead appears on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial before a crowd of 75,000. In 1955,
she will become the first African-American to perform at the
Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   1941: A literally captive audience of 5,000 prisoners of war in
Germany witnesses the premiere of imprisoned French composer
Olivier Messiaen's ``Quartet for the End of Time.'' Working with a
damaged piano, clarinet, violin and cello available in the prison
camp, the composer (who plays the piano at the premiere) turns the
limitations of the instruments to his advantage, creating a unique
sound and vision of angels in the midst of international
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   1942: With Russia under siege by Adolf Hitler's armies, Dmitri
Shostakovich composes his Symphony No. 7, a tribute to the national
spirit and courage of his homeland. After the premiere of the
symphony in Russia, the score is microfilmed, carried by plane to
Tehran, Iran, and by car to Cairo, Egypt, then flown across North
Africa and the Atlantic to America, where leading conductors
compete for the right to perform it. The American debut is
presented in a radio broadcast with Arturo Toscanini conducting.
</P>
<P>
   1945: Just weeks after the end of World War II in Europe,
audiences in London see the birth of a new type of 20th-century
opera when Benjamin Britten's ``Peter Grimes'' premieres.
Extraordinary musical lyricism and profound pessimism combine to
launch the career of the most significant operatic composer of the
postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   1958: The Cold War thaws temporarily when young Texas pianist
Van Cliburn wins first prize _ and the hearts of Russian music
lovers _ at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in Moscow.
Americans respond as enthusiastically as the Russians, greeting the
new national hero with a ticker-tape parade in New York on his
return.
</P>
<P>
   1976: Scott Joplin, one of America's greatest musical geniuses
and the creator, via ragtime, of the most significant body of solo
piano music written in America, is finally honored with a special
Pulitzer Prize for music, 60 years after his death at age 48 in
1916.
</P>
<P>
   1989: American conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein celebrates
the fall of the Berlin Wall with performances of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony. In the choral section, Bernstein substitutes the word
``''Freiheit'''' (''freedom'') for the original ``''Freude''''
(''joy''). Appropriately, soloists for the event represent East
Germany, West Germany, the United States and Great Britain.

Thursday, Dec. 16:
</P>
<P>
   HIPPIE-THRONE (San Francisco) _ She is no longer a lithe hippie
goddess. But as she sits by the fire in her rhinestone-encrusted
living room, the colors quivering, it's clear that the spirit of
Lotus Carnation still dwells inside Lois Anderson, 72. It was
Lotus, as she was known in the late 1960s _ as opposed to Lois, now
a part-time librarian _ who created The Throne (1973), a
resplendent creation born of acid and epoxy, designed to transport
the sitter into another realm. ``We saw patterns everywhere,'' she
recalled the other day, lounging barefoot. ``We sat and listened at
the feet of every Indian guru, glommed on to every microcosm and
macrocosm, then we looked at their art. I got up one morning and
just like you say `I think I'll have a ham sandwich for lunch,' out
came the Throne.'' By Patricia Leigh Brown.

<P>
   RANCH-HOUSE (Houston) _ These days, ranch houses are an
endangered species. Once the revered symbol of postwar prosperity,
these rectangular houses, with their rec rooms and picture windows
and skinny wrought-iron balustrades, are now as dated as Melmac. In
this one neighborhood, at least 100 ranch houses have been torn
down in the last five years, replaced by today's dream: the
multistoried, Palladian-windowed, double-height ceilinged,
great-roomed mansionette; Tara on a quarter-acre lot. By Tracie
Rozhon.

   MTV-BUNKER-PROJECT (Undated) _ Those pondering whether to hunker
down as the Year 2000 approaches may look to a decision by MTV to
bunker down. MTV Interactive, the online division of the MTV cable
television network, is sponsoring a stunt for New Year's Eve that
will relocate six young Americans to a dwelling that's not so much
far from home as it is deep. They will live for a week in the
bowels of Times Square as a kind of survival squad, in case the
worst-case scenarios of the millennial Jeremiahs come true. That
stay in their redoubt is being called the Bunker Project _ ``The
Real World'' meets the end of the world. By Stuart Elliott.

   NUNNERY-ROCKIES (Virginia Dale, Colo.) _ For a moment, Sister
Ancilla Armijo seemed like any proud new homeowner. Looking
heavenward, she swept her hand across the towering, domed ceiling
to the skylight windows of the new chapel here, and extolled the
virtues of simplicity. She scoffed at suggestions that stained
glass be installed where there are now views of snowy mountaintops.
``Why do we need those things?'' she asked. ``The land is
beautiful, the building is beautiful _ it just lifts you up to
prayer.'' In this most dramatic American setting, where the Great
Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, a vision of the most improbable
sort is materializing: a 21st-century Benedictine abbey. Last
month, Sister Ancilla and the 20 other nuns of the Abbey of St.
Walburga moved into the nunnery, which was designed and built for
them here in northern Colorado. By Mindy Sink.

   What's Ailing My Begonias?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently picked up a beautiful, big begonia plant at a tag
sale. It has shiny leaves with saw-toothed edges. They are about
three inches long, dark green with red splotches, and appear to be
growing straight up from thick, horizontal brown stems. The plant
completely fills the pot and is spilling over the sides. I have
been watering it faithfully, but it just keeps wilting more and
more. The leaves droop and sag and are starting to fall off. What's
wrong? Does it need a bigger pot?
</P>
<P>
   A: From your description, I'd say your begonia is one of the
rhizomatous tribe, and what it needs more than anything else is to
be left alone. It isn't dying of thirst: it's drowning.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rhizomatous begonias come in a wide variety of leaf shapes and
sizes _ leaves can be from about an inch across to about a foot,
and most can live a long time, becoming quite large. The rhizomes
(those stems) spread outward rather than up, so largeness is more a
matter of width than height. Though grown for their foliage, they
also offer delicate sprays of small white or pink flowers in late
winter and early spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, these begonias are very easy to grow, thriving in
east or west light, preferring the same temperatures agreeable to
humans: 65 degrees Fahrenheit at night, warmer during the day. They
will endure considerable neglect and are seldom plagued by insects.
Crowded pots are no problem _ they can live wedged in for years,
looking fuller and fuller.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they  &UR; hate &LR;  soggy soil, so allow yours to dry out before you
water again. They recover from drought more easily than from
overwatering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as insurance, you might want to take some cuttings to make
a new plant in case your kindness has done in the original. Three-
or four-inch lengths of stem with most of the leaves removed will
usually root if you simply stick them in a glass of water and put
it in a dim spot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When roots appear, plant several stems in a low, wide pot, using
commercial potting soil labeled for African violets. Fertilize only
during the growing season, March to October.
</P>
<P>
   Winter Plans for Kale
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are really enjoying the kale we planted this year. It has
withstood several frosts and seems unaffected. How much longer can
we expect it to keep growing? Is there anything we can do to help
it survive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Now that days are short and cold, you can't expect kale to
keep growing at all. But you can help it survive almost
indefinitely. The trick, which also works for Swiss chard and other
hardy greens, is to keep the soil around the roots from freezing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you don't already have one in place, start by applying a
thick blanket of organic mulch _ straw or shredded leaves. Then use
bales of straw and old windows (or clear plastic) to build a
lean-to cold frame.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place a row of bales close to the long side of the kale row.
They should be to the north if the row runs east-west, to the east
if it runs north-south. Put another row on top so you have a wall
about three feet high. On each short side, make a sloping wall by
butting single bales firmly against the back wall, then topping
them with partial bales.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, use the windows (or clear plastic sheeting) to cover the
front, making sure the cover does not touch the plants. At the top,
windows can just lean against the straw. Plastic should be draped
and held in place on top by rocks or a heavy board. At the bottom,
where the cover touches the ground, mound on a few inches of soil
to hold it and to seal out drafts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should have a structure whose sloping, clear
roof faces south or west. Use loose straw to fill in any gaps in
the walls. That's it. Throw a heavy blanket over the cover when
night temperatures are predicted to fall below 20 degrees; and be
sure to open the frame at the top on warm, sunny days or you'll
cook your kale before you ever bring it in the house.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't try this with root crops; mice will colonize the bales of
straw if you feed them beets and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Sparing That Christmas Tree
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're having a live Christmas tree this year. Is it all right
to use lights, or will they dry it out too much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wouldn't use large bulbs, but minilights should be OK They
don't put out much heat, and they will be among the branches for
only three or four days: that's as long as a living evergreen can
survive indoor conditions. Be sure the wiring is well away from the
root ball, which should be kept damp, but not wet.

   CIR-WORKER-MONITORING (Undated) _ In 1999, at least 45 percent
of employers said they monitored their employees' phone calls,
computer files or e-mail messages, according to the American
Management Association. That number, based on a survey of more than
1,000 human-resources managers at corporations of varying sizes, is
up from 35 percent two years ago. The monitoring is necessary,
employers argue, because of the changing nature of the workplace.
Supervisors must keep tabs on which workers are wasting company
time by surfing to entertainment Web sites, which ones are sending
e-mail messages that create a hostile environment for women or
members of minority groups, and which ones are distributing company
secrets or jamming their networks with bulk e-mail. Balancing that
desire for control with an employee's rights to privacy has never
been easy. By Lisa Guernsey.

   HIPPIE-THRONE (San Francisco) _ She is no longer a lithe hippie
goddess. But as she sits by the fire in her rhinestone-encrusted
living room, the colors quivering, it's clear that the spirit of
Lotus Carnation still dwells inside Lois Anderson, 72. It was
Lotus, as she was known in the late 1960s _ as opposed to Lois, now
a part-time librarian _ who created The Throne (1973), a
resplendent creation born of acid and epoxy, designed to transport
the sitter into another realm. ``We saw patterns everywhere,'' she
recalled the other day, lounging barefoot. ``We sat and listened at
the feet of every Indian guru, glommed on to every microcosm and
macrocosm, then we looked at their art. I got up one morning and
just like you say `I think I'll have a ham sandwich for lunch,' out
came the Throne.'' By Patricia Leigh Brown.

   RANCH-HOUSE (Houston) _ These days, ranch houses are an

these rectangular houses, with their rec rooms and picture windows
and skinny wrought-iron balustrades, are now as dated as Melmac. In
this one neighborhood, at least 100 ranch houses have been torn
down in the last five years, replaced by today's dream: the
multistoried, Palladian-windowed, double-height ceilinged,
great-roomed mansionette; Tara on a quarter-acre lot. By Tracie

   MTV-BUNKER-PROJECT (Undated) _ Those pondering whether to hunker
down as the Year 2000 approaches may look to a decision by MTV to
bunker down. MTV Interactive, the online division of the MTV cable
television network, is sponsoring a stunt for New Year's Eve that
will relocate six young Americans to a dwelling that's not so much
far from home as it is deep. They will live for a week in the
bowels of Times Square as a kind of survival squad, in case the
worst-case scenarios of the millennial Jeremiahs come true. That
stay in their redoubt is being called the Bunker Project _ ``The
Real World'' meets the end of the world. By Stuart Elliott.

<P>
   NUNNERY-ROCKIES (Virginia Dale, Colo.) _ For a moment, Sister
Ancilla Armijo seemed like any proud new homeowner. Looking
heavenward, she swept her hand across the towering, domed ceiling
to the skylight windows of the new chapel here, and extolled the
virtues of simplicity. She scoffed at suggestions that stained
glass be installed where there are now views of snowy mountaintops.
``Why do we need those things?'' she asked. ``The land is
beautiful, the building is beautiful _ it just lifts you up to
prayer.'' In this most dramatic American setting, where the Great
Plains meet the Rocky Mountains, a vision of the most improbable
sort is materializing: a 21st-century Benedictine abbey. Last
month, Sister Ancilla and the 20 other nuns of the Abbey of St.
Walburga moved into the nunnery, which was designed and built for
them here in northern Colorado. By Mindy Sink.

   Using Linux To Run a PC
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly is the Linux system and what can the average
person do with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linux, a computer operating system created by Linus Torvalds,
a Finnish programmer, has been getting a lot of attention as an
alternative to Windows. Linux is open-source software, which means
that the program's source code is made public. It is available free
to anyone who would like to use it or modify it. Commercial
versions of Linux, like one released by Red Hat, can be purchased
from software vendors, and many Linux books also include a CD-ROM
containing the program.
</P>
<P>
   Linux devotees say that it crashes less often that Windows, and
several companies have released programs to run on the platform,
like WordPerfect by Corel. You can also find other applications for
Linux. You can install it on the same computer on which you run
Windows and choose which system to use when you start up.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't nearly as much software available for Linux as there
is for Windows, however, and some feel that the system interface
isn't as user-friendly as the Macintosh or Windows platforms. If
you want to know more, there are plenty of Web sites devoted to
Linux. The Linux Online site (www.linux.org), with links to dozens
of Linux resources, is a good place to start. There is also a
version of Linux for the Macintosh Power PC, and more information
on it can be found at www.linuxppc.org.

WHAT'S HOT IN VIDEOGAMES FOR KIDS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents, it could be worse. It could be 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year when you not only had to sweat which video
games your kid wanted for Christmas, you had to figure out which
system they wanted. There were three new ones, Sony PlayStation,
Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the system picking's easier. The only new one is
Sega's impressive Dreamcast. Sequels to the PlayStation and N64
aren't expected until next year. Whew, you should say to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But picking out games can be just as frazzling: ``Is this the
right Pokemon game?'' ``Didn't I get him Tomb Raider last year?''
``Wasn't Donkey Kong the bomb when I was a kid? This must be old or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   So many games, so many questions. That's why we've come up with
this guide to the top 10 hottest, most popular game titles of 1999.
These are the ones your child wants for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Toy Story 2
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Tots to teens.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Action/adventure games.
</P>
<P>
   System: Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Price: $50-$60
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: If you've seen the movie, you've played the game. As
sci-fi action figure Buzz Lightyear, you gotta rescue your cowboy
pal Woody before an evil toy collector sells him on eBay or
something.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Spectacular; you could swear you're watching the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: A kids' game, but cool enough for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Toy Commander
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Young guns
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... A good challenge _ and a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   System: Sega Dreamcast
</P>
<P>
   Price: $55
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Totally cool premise: Neglected, old toys rebel
against shiny new ones. Players maneuver toy cars and planes
through the kitchen, bedroom, garage and other household areas,
battling things like wind-up mice. Some of the challenging missions
_ drop sugar cubes into the cocoa from a plane _ are dumb, but the
amusing fighting sequences make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: The crisp, animated graphics are almost identical to
those in Toy Story, adding to the confusion between the two games.
Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found here, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Loads of fun, but definitely for younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Donkey Kong 64
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Everyone's gonna love this one.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Well, Mario 64.
</P>
<P>
   System: Nintendo 64
</P>
<P>
   Price: $55
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Old story, new game. Donkey Kong's stash of bananas
has been stolen, so it's up to the Kongs to gather 'em up and nab
the freak who took 'em. Like past Kong titles, DK64 is two games in
one: You spend most of the time picking up bananas and tromping
through jungles and other terrains, but there are also several
minigames in which winners are awarded extra 'nanas.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Pretty much what you can expect from any N64 title
these days: impressively smooth and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: One of the best N64 titles. Good luck finding one.
</P>
<P>
   Games: NBA 2K and NFL 2K
</P>
<P>
   Age range: All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... B-ball and football
</P>
<P>
   System: Sega Dreamcast
</P>
<P>
   Price: $55
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: These two games _ one's basketball, the other
football _ have set a new standard for sports games. To put it as
simply as possible, they're why people are scooping up the
Dreamcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: The line between fantasy and reality just got erased.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Musts.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Spyro: Ripto's Rage!
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Young and the restless.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Cute-little-creature-hero games like Rayman
and Crash Bandicoot.
</P>
<P>
   System: PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Price: $50
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Spyro's an adorable little dragon whose first,
self-titled game was a worthy sleeper hit. A little older, Spyro's
back, scurrying through 30 pitfall-filled, enemy-laced levels. Ya
can't let this guy die. He's so cute!
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Strong game for the under-13 set.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Teen guys who have a crush on Lara Croft _ and
blowing stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Indiana Jones-type adventure games.
</P>
<P>
   System: PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Price: $50
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Wearing her trademark tight shorts/shirt combo,
evil-fighter babe Lara Croft returns for what is supposedly her
last adventure. As usual, she's gotta blow to bits zombies, mummies
and other monstrous pains while trying to make her way through
ancient ruins and spooky caverns.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Best yet, with an emphasis on details, like light and
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Easily the best of the Raider bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Dawson's Creek-age kids, although we know younger
ones are hot to play it.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Gory, gruesome,
walk-around-and-waste-everything games.
</P>
<P>
   System: PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Price: $55
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: RE 3 picks up where the first RE left off, with
heroine Jill Valentine getting the heck away from the
zombie-infested mansion. In RE 3, she's gotta fight her way through
Raccoon City, doing what she does best: saucing zombies. Certain
choices will affect the game's outcome, making it far less
predictable than the first two.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Carrying on the Resident Evil tradition, the graphics
are disturbingly realistic, full of unsavory imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Not for the fainthearted or very young.
</P>
<P>
   Game: NHL Championship 2000
</P>
<P>
   Age range: 13 and up
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Knocking out someone's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   System: PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Price: $55
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Like you need instructions here: Body check, cross
check, push and trip your way to the net.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Among the mountain of new hockey titles, this one's
one of the best, thanks to the sharp, detailed, realistic graphics.
It's not as fast as the EA series, but it looks _ and, to some
extent, plays _ much better.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: We have no choice but to love it _ Dallas Stars
center Mike Modano is on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Pokmon Pinball
</P>
<P>
   Age range: All ages _ and we mean that.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... Well, pinball.
</P>
<P>
   System: Game Boy Color
</P>
<P>
   Price: $35
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: You don't need to be a Pokmon expert _ or even know
how to pronounce Pikachu _ to play this pinball game. Only real
Pokmon reference is that the game allows you to capture Pokmon as
you nail them with your ball.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Not bad for a Game Boy game, which can sometimes be
unplayable.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Probably the only time a parent will pick up a
Pokmon game.
</P>
<P>
   Game: Pokmon Yellow
</P>
<P>
   Age range: Pokmon knows no limits.
</P>
<P>
   Kid's gotta like ... More like, kid's gotta be able to play
other two Pokmon games, Red and Blue.
</P>
<P>
   System: Nintendo Game Boy
</P>
<P>
   Price: $30
</P>
<P>
   Game plan: Train Pokmon, walk around and do stuff _ don't look
at us, we don't know how to play this thing.
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: Horrible, but does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: You're probably on your way to pick one up right
now.

GATHER 'ROUND THE ELECTRONIC PIANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK HOUSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Moog may not have created MP3 files or hip-hop
sampling. But he may be the person who made the world safe for
electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the release of the Moog synthesizer in 1965, Moog
has helped popularize the strange, unworldly sounds of electronic
music and, in the process, taken the music synthesizer out of the
lab and put it into the hands of aspiring musicians.
</P>
<P>
   And so there is an inescapable irony behind Moog's latest
project, the Van Koevering Interactive Piano. The piano, which was
developed with an entrepreneur, David Van Koevering, combines
computer technology with the elegant craftsmanship of a fine
concert piano.
</P>
<P>
   The design is important because Moog wants his instrument to
accommodate the social aspect of music, to encourage people to
``gather 'round and sing, play, dance or listen.''
</P>
<P>
   So the inventor who helped artists make music in the isolated
obscurity of home studios now believes that people just don't spend
enough time together playing music?
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very long trend away from music as a social
activity,'' Moog said in an e-mail interview. ``Before the radio
and the electric phonograph, people made their own music, for
themselves and for each other. What I see now is that, more and
more, we're all in our own little boxes, using the fruits of
technology to make or listen to music in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added about his new piano, ``it looks good in a living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   The early synthesizers were hardly so domestic. When RCA created
the first modern synthesizer in 1955, the machine filled an entire
room. Engineers fed it binary codes on a paper roll, since there
was no keyboard for an interface, and an oscillator generated a
sound wave with a particular timbre, pitch and volume.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after RCA built its synthesizer, Moog introduced the
Moog synthesizer, the first to use attack-decay-sustain-release
(ADSR) envelopes, sets of parameters that control a sound's onset
and fade. Moog's envelope generators, like many of his other
designs, became a standard component on later synthesizers and
programmable keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone realized that was the way to do it,'' said Joel
Chadabe, president of the Electronic Music Foundation. ``It was
superb engineering, beautifully put together, excellent in every
way _ flexible, simple, durable.''
</P>
<P>
   While RCA synthesizers had cost at least $100,000, the new Moog
sold for $11,000 in 1967. ``It had a tremendous impact on many
people and brought electronic music to many composers, both popular
and academic,'' said Jeffrey Hass, the director of the University
of Indiana's Center for Electronic and Computer Music.
</P>
<P>
   The Moog's breakthrough came in 1969, when the musician Walter
Carlos had a huge, Grammy-winning hit with ``Switched-on Bach,''
featuring renditions of J.S. Bach performed on a Moog. The Canadian
pianist Glenn Gould called it ``the finest performance of any of
the Brandenburgs _ live, canned or intuited _ that I've ever
heard.'' The Moog then turned up in ``Because,'' by The Beatles,
and in the score to ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog followed up with the performance-minded Minimoog, which
helped spread the Moog sound into musical genres from the
avant-garde to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a Minimoog would make it a lot easier to get a job
playing the local Ramada Inn,'' Moog said.
</P>
<P>
   The first digital synthesizer, the Synclavier, had been
introduced in 1975. By the early 1980s, digital sampling, computers
and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standardization
heralded a second wave of innovation in electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   But Moog was an analog inventor who mostly parted ways with
digital revolutionaries. He made innovative control devices for
electronic instruments, such as a flat touch plate and a highly
touch-sensitive keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moog has been interested in the possibilities of extending the
traditional keyboard,'' Keislar said. But ``most people want to
press a button and hear music come out. Such systems are probably
destined to remain experimental, even if elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, now 65, wants to capture the public's imagination at home
with the Van Koevering piano, which sells for $8,000 and up. There
are no strings under the lid, only a Windows-powered computer, a
120-watt amplifier and a half-dozen stereo speakers. An intuitive,
laptop-size touch screen takes the place of sheet music.
</P>
<P>
   The piano's educational software might give piano teachers a run
for their money. It will transcribe any composition onto the screen
(or onto paper, if you attach a printer) as fast as you can play
it. It offers 128 different sounds, including a digitally sampled
Steinway grand, and 256 tracks for recording. Full orchestration
can be added at the touch of a few on-screen buttons, and a CD
burner can be attached to make copies of the resulting symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Moog said he designed the piano for the home. Electronic
instruments have long been limited by their less-than-user-friendly
shells. Moog, who has ``always liked the social aspect of music,''
says instruments that were once ``hardware-intensive, with dozens
upon dozens of buttons, lights, and switches'' can now be updated
with interactive software, like the Van Koevering's touch screen,
``which is highly intuitive, so that anyone can figure out how to
use it just by looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an engineer, I've spent a lot of time with high-tech
equipment,'' he said, which starts off being a source of amusement.
``But by the time the amusement wears off, the solitary musician
may begin to realize that something basic and low-tech _ playing
together _ is missing.''

<P>
   VIRGINIA DALE, Colo. _ For a moment, Sister Ancilla Armijo
seemed like any proud new homeowner. Looking heavenward, she swept
her hand across the towering, domed ceiling to the skylight windows
of the new chapel here. And she extolled the virtues of simplicity,
scoffing at the thought of stained glass where there are now views
of snowy mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need those things?'' she asked. ``The land is
beautiful, the building is beautiful _ it just lifts you up to
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   In this most striking American setting, where the Great Plains
meet the Rocky Mountains, a vision of the most improbable sort is
materializing: a 21st-century Benedictine abbey. In November,
Sister Ancilla and the 20 other nuns of the Abbey of St. Walburga
moved into the nunnery, which was designed and built for them here
in northern Colorado, about five miles from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly, one wonders, should a nunnery look like today?
</P>
<P>
   It fell to the architect, David Barrett, to bring together the
natural setting with the spiritual and utilitarian needs of the
cloister _ not to mention reconciling his own design instincts with
the eager and active advice of 21 nuns.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the nuns, who integrate a life of contemplative
prayer with their daily chores, have lived in temporary buildings
on the property. Before moving to this century-old homestead, the
abbey had been quartered in Boulder, two hours to the south, for
more than 60 years. The nuns who founded the monastery came from
the 11th-century Abbey of St. Walburga in Eichstatt, Germany; they
left in 1935, fleeing the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, as growth in Boulder began to encroach on
their land and peaceful way of life, the nuns began to look for a
new home. On the day they began construction at a site they had
purchased south of Denver, word came that an anonymous donor had
offered them land here. The sisters headed for the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the design process, lively exchanges between Barrett
and the sisters centered on God's presence inside and outside the
chapel and living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the chapel, but the valley and the rocks and the
trees are right there, too,'' Sister Hildegard Dubnick said. ``We
were really talking about the theology of our life and how it's
reflected in the architecture and what does it say about where God
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, of Barrett Steele Architects, in Boulder, had a few
questions of his own. ``Just like any other home or building, it
has functional needs,'' he said. ``But the real soul of the
architecture was going to be in their values and their
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuns and the architect found themselves harmonizing
opposites: ancient and modern, beauty and frugality, the heavens
and earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling of groundedness, then ascension,'' said
Barrett, 51, as he stood on the ruddy tiles of the chapel looking
up 42 feet at the triangular windows and into the blue Colorado
sky.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chapel is both the head and the heart of life in the abbey.
During early prayers, the sisters, facing one another across the
chapel, can watch the sun rise through its many windows. On the
floor between them is a cross formed from the darkest of the red
earth-toned tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The building itself resembles an ancient posture of
supplication. The copper-domed chapel sits as the head, and the
two-story residential wings are like outstretched arms. Barrett
also evoked the sisters' daily prayers in the exterior buttresses.
``They are sort of in a bow, like the nuns are at vespers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The look of an old stone monastery was evoked with the
cement-gray stucco that blends in with the surrounding rocks. The
roughness of the exterior walls also appears inside along the pink
sandstone stairs and adjoining smooth white walls.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the beauty outside to be reflected inside,'' said
Mother Abbess Maria-Thomas Beil, who speaks with a slight German
accent.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the simplicity of monastic life that is reflected in
the rest of the abbey, in the bedrooms and workrooms of the nuns,
ages 27 to 86. There are ``cells'' for the sisters: 11-by-11-foot
rooms with double-wide windows and window seats. Rooms on the upper
floor share bathrooms; the older sisters have larger rooms
downstairs with private baths.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the bedrooms and workrooms the personalities of the nuns are
most visible. One room has a pink floral bedcover and flowering
plants in the window; another has pine bookshelves and a white
spread. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my room,'' said Sister Maria-Walburga Shortemeyer, 31.
``I consider it another sacred space.'' Pictures of nieces and
nephews are arranged on the raw wood shelves.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Sister Ancilla's workroom, a wooden loom dominates her
computer and printer, and large bright spools of tapestry yarns
stand out on a neat shelf. Sister Rafaella DiBouda, 27, giggled as
she described how she had arranged her own tiny spools of thread in
her workroom. Over her habit she wore a gingham-checked apron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nuns has several duties, from birthing calves and
feeding pigs to sewing and baking bread, in addition to a modern
``craft'' _ data entry work they do for outside clients. They hope
that their various handicrafts _ knitting, candlemaking, weaving _
can someday be sold in their gift shop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sisters will use the proceeds from the sale of the earlier
land to help finance the second phase of this project. To date, the
construction here has totaled $5.4 million. If they raise enough
money for Phase 2, each of the wings will be expanded: the sisters
will occupy one wing, leaving the other free for guests at
ecumenical retreats.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, the nuns are excited about their new home, as is. ``I
think,'' said Sister Maria Michael Newe, ``we feel a little bit
more than blessed to be here.''

 REAGAN IS THE ICON GOP HOPEFULS SEEK TO COPY   (For use by New York
Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGON _ The philosophy and policy proposals bouncing through
almost any gathering of Republican presidential hopefuls can be
traced to Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Gipper is not on any ballot. He ran his last
political race in 1984, when he was re-elected president with the
electoral votes of 49 of the 50 states. He bade his final farewell
to tearful Republicans at the 1992 convention in Houston that
nominated George Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter Reagan entered a secluded world of lost memory
and lost identity shrouded by a somber curtain called Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But that speech in Houston remains a vivid memory because it got
the partisan juices flowing forcefully through the veins of
conservative ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegates swooned,'' wrote Bush's biographer, Herbert S.
Parmet, ``when the Gipper spoke standing firm, strong and ruddy,
betraying nothing of the Alzheimer's disease that already was
affecting his system.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his oration with a bit of self-deprecating humor that
was familiar to Americans and always evoked laughter. ``Tonight is
a very special night,'' said Reagan. ``At my age, 81, every night
is a special night.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the triumphs of his White House years, especially
those concerned with the Cold War. He proudly proclaimed that
``America is the moral force that defeated communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end, he strongly endorsed his vice president's
presidential bid, declaring, ``We need George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s, '70s and '80s, Reagan, a former Democrat,
repeatedly enunciated those issues that are closest to the hearts
of conservative Republicans: less government, a strong national
defense, lower taxation, decreased federal spending, a balanced
budget, opposition to abortion and, during the Cold War, a strong
stance against the ``evil empire'' of communism.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally left the presidency, his friend, former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher summed up his legacy more
eloquently than almost anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us above all thank President Reagan for ending the West's
retreat from world responsibility, for restoring the pride and
leadership of the United States and for giving the West back its
confidence,'' said Thatcher. ``He has left America stronger,
prouder, greater than ever before and we thank him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates who hope to win the Republican presidential
nomination and the presidency itself next year echo Reagan's stated
belief that taxes should be reduced and that government should be
made smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board tax cut _ plus Jimmy Carter's weakness as
president _ helped catapult Reagan, the former actor, into the
presidency in the 1980 election. All of the current candidates
advocate some form of tax reduction, whether it be George W. Bush's
across-the-board slash, which is estimated to pare revenues by $1
trillion over 10 years, or the various flat tax-proposals urged by
other hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, Bush's chief rival for the GOP nomination at this
point, has proposed a somewhat different tax cut and maintains that
the Texas governor's plan would siphon too much money out of the
federal treasury, where it could be used to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   All of the contenders talk of reduced federal spending and the
shifting of responsibility from Washington to the local level. All,
at one time or another, cite Reagan's policies as examples of what
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan tried to keep his campaign promises and did a pretty good
job of it. But his huge tax cut, a major feature of supply-side
economics, did not produce anywhere near enough added income to
offset his enormous increase in defense spending. But some Reagan
admirers claim his economic program planted the seeds that
eventually bore fruit in the phenomenal prosperity of Bill
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One of Reagan's most important achievements was the fact that
he, in the wake of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iran hostage crisis,
was able to rekindle the faith and confidence of the American
people in their presidency and their government.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that he, working with the Soviet Union's Mikhail
Gorbachev, helped end the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan had some success in increasing the powers of the
governors and other leaders at the local level. He gave lip service
to ending abortion but did not make much of an effort to achieve
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent C-Span interview from the Reagan ranch in
California's Santa Ynez Mountains, former Washington Post White
House correspondent and Reagan biographer Lou Cannon said that
whether one agreed or disagreed with Reagan's political philosophy,
it was ``impossible not to like him.'' That is basically true. He
exuded charm and confidence and believed wholeheartedly in
America's greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He now has become to Republicans what Franklin D. Roosevelt has
been to Democrats for many decades _ an icon to be praised,
worshipped and copied. That would please Reagan because he greatly
admired FDR and, as Cannon pointed out, sought in many ways to
emulate him.

News Service on Saturday (for Sunday publication), about a new type
of publishing venture in which tobacco companies and magazine
concerns are jointly producing magazines that serve as vehicles for

 BIG TOBACCO'S NEW BILLBOARDS: GLOSSY MAGAZINES  
 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Page through The Art of Simple Living, a new magazine published
by a division of Hearst Magazines, and notice that it looks like
most feel-good women's magazines. There is a profile of the pop
singer Sarah McLachlan, an article about growing an indoor herb
garden and step-by-step instructions for brewing tea.
</P>
<P>
   But the careful reader will notice a difference between Simple
Living and, say, Mirabella. Half of the advertising is for
cigarettes: Carlton, Misty Lights, Kool and Capri. And then there
is the tiny paragraph below the table of contents that notes the
corporation, apart from Hearst Magazines, behind this women's
magazine: the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco companies face increasingly severe restrictions on
how they advertise, they have found other ways to tout their
products, and now they are drawing the major publishers of consumer
magazines into their marketing fold.
</P>
<P>
   Three tobacco giants _ Brown &AMP; Williamson, Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco _ have recently joined with Time Inc., Hearst
Magazines, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and EMAP Petersen to
produce five magazines. In this arrangement, known as custom
publishing, consumer publishers print magazines for corporate
clients, which then distribute them free to customers or for
nominal subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publishers, which limit tobacco advertising in their
consumer magazines, are more than happy to join the ventures as
they ride the boom of custom publishing, a guaranteed profit-maker
that has generated $650 million for the magazine industry so far
this year, according to David Wilkofsky, the chairman of Wilkofsky
Gruen Associates, a consulting firm that studies the magazine
industry. And custom publishing is expected to generate close to $1
billion in 2000, according to a spokesman for the Custom Publishing
Council, a division of the Magazine Publishers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, the magazine content is produced by a staff
specifically hired to create custom-published titles. In one case,
Time Inc. has used the staff of the interior design magazine
Wallpaper _ to produce CML: The Camel Quarterly for R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   For consumer magazine publishers, who are paid by the tobacco
companies to create the magazines and are not subjected to the
vagaries of newsstand sales and disappointing subscription levels,
the arrangement is without financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson publishes three magazines. Two are with
Hearst _ Flair and Simple Living _ and the other with EMAP
Petersen, titled Real Edge. Philip Morris publishes Unlimited, an
outdoor sport and adventure magazine, with Hachette Filipacchi. All
the magazines were started in the last year, except for Unlimited,
which in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines have a total circulation of about five million and
are sent free, for now to consumers whose names are taken from
tobacco company databases. Reynolds and Brown &AMP; Williamson are
considering charging for subscription eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines, which are sent on either monthly or quarterly,
are in some cases indistinguishable from their consumer
counterparts. Real Edge reads like Maxim, a raunchy magazine for
young men. There is even a section called ``Stuff,'' the name of
the section in Maxim that features electronic gadgetry and that
inspired Maxim's sister publication, Stuff. Flair, produced by
Brown &AMP; Williamson and Hearst and aimed at young women, features
articles a reader might find in Mademoiselle, with titles like
``What `I Love You' Really Means'' and ``How to Have a Cocktail
Party.'' Unlimited looks like Outside or Men's Journal. CML, the
only magazine that clearly identifies itself as a tobacco-sponsored
publication looks like Wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the magazine that most clearly portrays smoking
as a glamorous activity in its articles. Flair, Simple Living and
Real Edge make a point to never mention smoking and depend on the
ample tobacco advertising to get the message across. Unlimited
never mentions cigarettes in the text, but they are visible in
photo displays. Its writers are given a list of guidelines
governing what they can and cannot write about with the intention
of not appealing to teenagers: no mention is to be made of smoking,
cancer, illness of any kind, or any activity that people they are
writing about engaged in when they were under the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, by publishing custom magazines the tobacco companies
are using subtle forms of advertising to reach customers. The
tobacco companies clearly find this form of marketing necessary. As
a result of a settlement with 46 states in November 1998, major
tobacco companies were forced to withdraw all advertising from
outdoor billboards. They can no longer sponsor sporting events with
significant youth audiences _ including baseball, basketball,
football, hockey and soccer. With very few exceptions, they can no
longer sponsor concerts.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no more of what is known as ``out-of-home''
advertising _ any advertising like a billboard or a banner at a
sporting event that would reach an unwilling, or underage, consumer
outside of the home. And the Food and Drug Administration is
arguing before the Supreme Court to be allowed to prohibit the use
of color or images in tobacco advertising in large-circulation
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has produced magazines before but the
current crop are clearly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they were overt magazines about tobacco, with titles
like `Philip Morris magazine,''' said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, the
president of the American Council on Science and Health who has
studied tobacco advertising in magazines for two decades. ``Now
they have created their own set of magazines with their own sets of
rules. They will always find a way of advertising no matter what
the ban.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have been preparing for the day of
curtailed magazine advertising. In an internal memo dated July 8,
1998, R.J. Reynolds laid out its plans for a hip magazine, since
introduced as CML. It listed, as an objective, ``To prepare for a
regulated environment by filling a communication gap among 21 to
34-year-old adult smokers when key pubs may no longer contain
tobacco advertising in color.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo emphasized that ``the Camel presence will be under the
radar, although not invisible.'' The proposed magazine, the memo
said, should not ``come across as a big promotional vehicle which
21 to 34-year-old consumers will resent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulations or not, this idea works. The magazine is a
targeted vehicle that can be placed into a single consumer's hands.
It's an experience that can last longer than exposure to an ad and
the momentum can be sustained from issue to issue. It's a
relationship-builder.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship is what the the tobacco companies are seeking.
In their own magazines, they get to advertise their products as
much as they want. Most American consumer magazines keep tobacco
advertising to about 3 percent of total advertising, according to
Mary McGeachy, a spokeswoman for the Publishers Information Bureau.
Hachette Filipacchi _ which publishes 28 magazines, including Elle,
Mirabella and George _ as a whole allotted about 2.5 percent of its
advertising pages for tobacco advertising last year, said a
Hachette spokesman. Approximately 3.5 percent of the advertising in
Time Inc. magazines is tobacco-related, said a Time Inc. spokesman,
and Hearst this year kept it to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Heironimus, the vice president for premium niche brands at
Brown &AMP; Williamson, said the company was producing its three
magazines to present consumers with more tobacco advertising in the
context of what looks like a standard consumer magazine. The Brown
&AMP; Williamson magazines do offer other advertising, not related to
the company, making the magazine appear like regular consumer
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the value of the custom publications, Heironimus of
Brown &AMP; Williamson said: ``We are still allowed to advertise in
almost any magazine. The problem with them is that they are
inefficient because at least three quarters of the readership don't
smoke. By producing our own magazines, we are eliminating a huge
inefficiency right off the bat. The second efficiency is that we
can put any number of our brands in our own magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson's Simple Living and Flair ask readers to fill
out two-page surveys that ask questions about household income and
preferred cigarette brand, and a two-page ad in Simple Living asks
readers to send in a photocopy of their driver's license in
exchange for free Brown &AMP; Williamson gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ron Davis, the former director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health and the
director of the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
in Detroit, said that as cigarette advertising becomes more
limited, the industry will always look for novel channels through
which to spend its marketing dollars. ``As the image of the
cigarette companies and the industry as a whole continues to
plummet, they will find more under-the-table methods to promote
their views _ subliminal advertising, to borrow from 1960s
jargon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of CML, a serialized novel shows cartoon
caricatures of the fictional protagonists smoking and sipping
champagne, or smoking in moments of personal triumph. The text of
the novel also emphasizes smoking's ability to lend power or
courage. As one character faces a daunting job interview, instead
of fleeing, ``she squared her shoulders, squashed out her fifth
cigarette of the morning, and walked through the building's
imposing, revolving doors. `Here goes. I've absolutely nothing to
lose,' she thought.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there was any discomfort for a company like Time
to publish a magazine affiliated with a tobacco giant, Peter
Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc. said: ``The simple
institutional answer is no. We see the magazine as directed at an
audience that because of age and demographic can make their own
decisions about tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   To the researchers that study tobacco and the media, the
marriage between consumer publishers and tobacco companies is an
unending cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught myself never to say I hate the cigarette companies
because they are brilliant,'' Dr. Whelan said. ``They are brilliant
manipulators. They look at obstacles and ingeniously come up with a
way around them. A new magazine here, a new campaign there. They
are always and will always be 20 years ahead of us. I think that is
significant for people who think we are winning the war against the
tobacco companies, because to imagine that we are is just naive.''

VERTICAL TYPING EASY ON WRISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (Circuits)  
(af) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last decade, the computer industry has been haunted by
the fact that typing on a keyboard for long periods can often lead
to painful conditions called repetitive stress injuries, including
carpal tunnel syndrome, one of the most painful and potentially
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Cornell University supports the idea that the
problem may be prevented or treated by having people use a vertical
keyboard design that lets them hold their hands in a more
comfortable position.
</P>
<P>
   The tendons and nerves that connect the arms to the hands travel
through a narrow passage called the carpal tunnel. Excessive
typing, particularly in certain positions, can irritate the nerves
and impair the use of the hands, not only in typing but also in
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have focused on the position of the
hands in the hope of minimizing the stress placed on the nerves by
the tendons during typing.
</P>
<P>
   Bending the wrists in any direction can reduce the size of the
tunnel and pack the tendons and nerves closer together, creating
more trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that training typists to keep their hands in the
position that places the least strain will reduce and perhaps
eliminate the problem of carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell research was conducted by Professor Alan Hedge, who
said, ``If you raise your hand up just 15 degrees, you're doubling
the pressure on the nerve running through the carpal.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, done at the Cornell University College of Human
Ecology, and published on the Internet (www.typesafe.com), examined
the performance of skilled typists using a prototype of a vertical
split keyboard developed by Ergonomic-Interface of La Jolla, Calif.
The company sponsors the laboratory that performed the work.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is split into two parts that are arranged
vertically so the palms face each other during typing. The keys are
in the usual ``qwerty'' configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This position allows the radius and the ulna bones in the
forearm to run parallel to each other instead of crossing over,''
Hedge explained.
</P>
<P>
   That further simplifies the path for the tendons and nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, the typists were wired with gloves that measured
the bending of the wrists in a 15-minute typing test. Each typist
used both a vertical keyboard and a traditional one, and the
researchers compared the positions of the wrists.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded: ``Seventy-one percent of hand
flexion/extension typing movements were in the lowest-risk zone
when using the vertical keyboard, compared with only 44 percent
when using a conventional keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the typists had little trouble learning to use
the vertical keyboard in the short amount of time given for the
test. But typing speeds dropped about 10 percent, and accuracy
dropped about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were not long enough to establish whether the typing
would return to former levels if typists used the vertical keyboard
every day.
</P>
<P>
   After the tests, many of the typists said they preferred regular
keyboards. The typists who took part in the study did not suffer
from repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge suggested that the keyboard was just part of an overall
solution. He said that the position of the typist's chair and the
placement of the keyboard were very important.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Udell, a computer consultant, agreed with that point. He
said he relied heavily on a specially designed chair to combat pain
in his wrists. The chair has half of the keyboard in each arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole-body approach,'' Udell said. ``The chair gets the
weight off of your neck and shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Conway, president of KMC Concepts in Santa Rosa, Calif.,
designed and patented a very flexible keyboard that allows the user
to position the two halves of the keyboard in practically any
position, including a vertical position.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said that such flexibility was ideal because ``the most
important step is to change positions frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   The research may generate more interest in split keyboards.
Although many major companies, like Microsoft, Lucent Technologies
and Apple Computer, have built adaptive keyboards, a number of
promising designs have disappeared from the marketplace. The
keyboards remain niche products that people turn to only after
severe problems emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Heisler, a partner in KeyAlt.com, an online store for
alternative keyboards, said: ``Unfortunately, more often than not,
people start feeling uncomfortable before they start looking for a
solution. Some companies are steadfastly pretending that it doesn't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   He welcomes the new research and suggested that the flexibility
might help serve other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met a young woman who had a deformed left arm that was only
as long as her left elbow,'' Heisler said. ``I was able to modify
one of her keyboards so she could type with her left arm and her
right arm, which was normal.'' &QL;

GAME THEORY: TECHNOLOGY AS THE GUIDING HAND OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(bl) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people see history as a set of names, dates and points on a
map. Other people see it as the evolution of ideas that drive
society: science, religion and politics. In Age of Empires 2, a
computer strategy game published by Microsoft, the grand sweep of
human events is expressed as a series of technological upgrades.
Picking up where the original ended, with the fall of Rome, the
game takes place over 1,000 years, leading up to the Renaissance,
as civilizations race to replace their hardware and software with
more elaborate versions, at considerable cost.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, Age of Empires 2 is typical of the real-time
strategy genre: you begin by foraging, then stockpile resources,
undertake construction projects according to Abraham Maslow's
hierarchy of needs (starting with houses, mills and lumber camps,
working up to universities and cathedrals), explore, create and
train an army, and vanquish computer-generated enemies or online
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In most real-time strategy games, the goal is to win by conquest
_ to take over the map. In Age of Empires 2, you can also win by
constructing a Wonder of the World that demonstrates the
superiority of your civilization and having it stand for a certain
period of time. Or you can collect all the religious relics
(showcased in your network of monasteries, the complete collection
of holy artifacts gives you a lock on the highly sought
medieval-pilgrim demographic group).
</P>
<P>
   End goals may differ. But the ramp that leads up to them is
always the same: technological evolution, achieved by plowing money
into research at every step along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting thing about Age of Empires 2, as opposed to
science fiction strategy games like Command and Conquer, is that
this process is grafted onto historical time periods. To advance
from the Dark Age to the Feudal Age, you need to build two
different Dark Age buildings and pay 500 food units. Invest the
resources, click the Advance to Feudal Age button, and you have
upgraded your socioeconomic operating system. Militiamen are
replaced by more powerful men-at-arms. New blacksmith features
become available.
</P>
<P>
   As you upgrade to the Castle Age and the Imperial Age, new
research opportunities inform your strategy. Do you want to invest
in military advancements in weaponry and armor? Or would you rather
research masonry and architecture to fortify your buildings? It's
also a good idea to invest in market technologies like coinage,
guilds and banking (medieval business-to-business applications, if
you will) to improve the efficiency of your economic system.
</P>
<P>
   All of these technological developments are rooted in medieval
chronology. In agriculture, for instance, you start with simple
foraging and cultivation. Hundreds of years later, you have an
improved horse harness, a heavy plow and crop rotation. All of that
increases your agricultural yield, providing the surplus necessary
to trade, build and fight in more expensive and sophisticated ways
and compete against your rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of play, you understand the Middle Ages as a
series of objects and their consequences. What sort of weapons were
people using? What kind of ships were they sailing? How were the
castle walls constructed?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike textbook information, nothing is learned for its own
sake. Every piece of historical information is relevant and useful
in the context of the game. It's part of a drama in which you are
the prime actor. Victory or defeat depends on the material culture
of your civilization. So there's a heavy incentive to learn about
looms and ax heads and battering rams.
</P>
<P>
   Age of Empires 2 will be responsible for a thousandfold increase
in the number of people who know the word ``trebuchet''
(TREB-you-shet). The trebuchet was a large catapult weapon with a
long throwing arm and a missile bag suspended by ropes. When
released, the arm swung up, the bag flew forward, and projectiles
were sent plunging down to shatter rooftops and towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trebuchets were expensive and complicated machines, requiring
specialists to build and operate,'' the manual explains. ``They
could only be moved in parts and required assembly before use.
Edward I of England refused the surrender of Stirling Castle in
Scotland on one occasion so that he could watch his most recently
acquired trebuchet in action.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, you really want a trebuchet. You also
know something about Edward I of England. And you know what you
would do in his shoes: You've got this brand-new trebuchet; it's
all unpacked, and you're about to get medieval on the lord of
Stirling Castle. Suddenly, he wants to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, in a fit of anachronism, to imagine Edward standing
in the doorway of his battle tent, cell phone in hand: ``Yeah, it's
Ed. I'm about to wreck your castle. Surrender? You're cutting out,
Stirling. I can't hear you. Did you say `No surrender?' Well, good
luck with the salvage operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, victory boils down to who has the best gear. ``The
people who get the technology fastest often have a decisive
advantage,'' said Bruce Shelley, Age of Empire's lead designer.
``If you've got a Feudal Age army fighting an Imperial Age army,
you're probably going to lose. It's a subliminal message, almost,
about technology _ and technology did advance quite a bit during
this time period. On a basic level, we're teaching people about
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   It's poignant to hear a computer programmer invoke the quaint
19th-century notion of progress to describe a product whose code
will be obsolete in less than a decade, and whose operating system
is under attack from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it makes you reflect on the Wonder of the World
strategy: You invest vast amounts of money and manpower to build a
cathedral. When it's finished, a clock starts ticking down, and
rival players move heaven and earth to tear down your church. When
the clock reaches zero, if the cathedral is still standing, you
win. It's a war about architecture. It ends in a siege. And it's
always more fun to be the barbarians than to defend the fortified
walls of a monument. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGON _ The philosophy and policy proposals bouncing through
almost any gathering of Republican presidential hopefuls can be
traced to Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Gipper is not on any ballot. He ran his last
political race in 1984, when he was re-elected president with the
electoral votes of 49 of the 50 states. He bade his final farewell
to tearful Republicans at the 1992 convention in Houston that
nominated George Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter Reagan entered a secluded world of lost memory
and lost identity shrouded by a somber curtain called Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But that speech in Houston remains a vivid memory because it got
the partisan juices flowing forcefully through the veins of
conservative ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegates swooned,'' wrote Bush's biographer, Herbert S.
Parmet, ``when the Gipper spoke standing firm, strong and ruddy,
betraying nothing of the Alzheimer's disease that already was
affecting his system.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his oration with a bit of self-deprecating humor that
was familiar to Americans and always evoked laughter. ``Tonight is
a very special night,'' said Reagan. ``At my age, 81, every night
is a special night.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the triumphs of his White House years, especially
those concerned with the Cold War. He proudly proclaimed that
``America is the moral force that defeated communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end, he strongly endorsed his vice president's
presidential bid, declaring, ``We need George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s, '70s and '80s, Reagan, a former Democrat,
repeatedly enunciated those issues that are closest to the hearts
of conservative Republicans: less government, a strong national
defense, lower taxation, decreased federal spending, a balanced
budget, opposition to abortion and, during the Cold War, a strong
stance against the ``evil empire'' of communism.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally left the presidency, his friend, former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher summed up his legacy more
eloquently than almost anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us above all thank President Reagan for ending the West's
retreat from world responsibility, for restoring the pride and
leadership of the United States and for giving the West back its
confidence,'' said Thatcher. ``He has left America stronger,
prouder, greater than ever before and we thank him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates who hope to win the Republican presidential
nomination and the presidency itself next year echo Reagan's stated
belief that taxes should be reduced and that government should be
made smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The across-the-board tax cut _ plus Jimmy Carter's weakness as
president _ helped catapult Reagan, the former actor, into the
presidency in the 1980 election. All of the current candidates
advocate some form of tax reduction, whether it be George W. Bush's
across-the-board slash, which is estimated to pare revenues by $1
trillion over 10 years, or the various flat tax-proposals urged by
other hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, Bush's chief rival for the GOP nomination at this
point, has proposed a somewhat different tax cut and maintains that
the Texas governor's plan would siphon too much money out of the
federal treasury, where it could be used to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   All of the contenders talk of reduced federal spending and the
shifting of responsibility from Washington to the local level. All,
at one time or another, cite Reagan's policies as examples of what
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan tried to keep his campaign promises and did a pretty good
job of it. But his huge tax cut, a major feature of supply-side
economics, did not produce anywhere near enough added income to
offset his enormous increase in defense spending. But some Reagan
admirers claim his economic program planted the seeds that
eventually bore fruit in the phenomenal prosperity of Bill
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One of Reagan's most important achievements was the fact that
he, in the wake of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iran hostage crisis,
was able to rekindle the faith and confidence of the American
people in their presidency and their government.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that he, working with the Soviet Union's Mikhail
Gorbachev, helped end the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan had some success in increasing the powers of the
governors and other leaders at the local level. He gave lip service
to ending abortion but did not make much of an effort to achieve
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent C-Span interview from the Reagan ranch in
California's Santa Ynez Mountains, former Washington Post White
House correspondent and Reagan biographer Lou Cannon said that
whether one agreed or disagreed with Reagan's political philosophy,
it was ``impossible not to like him.'' That is basically true. He
exuded charm and confidence and believed wholeheartedly in
America's greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He now has become to Republicans what Franklin D. Roosevelt has
been to Democrats for many decades _ an icon to be praised,
worshipped and copied. That would please Reagan because he greatly
admired FDR and, as Cannon pointed out, sought in many ways to
emulate him.

 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

THE GRAND OLD ADVENTURE OF RAILROADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(af) 
 By LES LINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any train enthusiast will tell you that there is very little
romance in modern railroading. Steam locomotives, those living,
breathing behemoths, disappeared from the mainlines in the 1950s,
replaced by efficient diesels with colorful corporate paint schemes
but no soul.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one by one, the great railroads that laid a spider web of
steel across North America in the 19th century fell by the
trackside, victims of bankruptcies, mergers and consolidations.
Conrail and Amtrak, for example, picked over the carcasses of the
New York Central, Pennsylvania, Reading and other Eastern
companies, salvaging freight and passenger operations that looked
profitable and abandoning the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Only one famous line has managed to retain its historic
identity: the Union Pacific, perhaps the greatest railroad of all.
It is the Union Pacific and the long-ago Central Pacific Railroad
that are the stars of Trans-Con, a computer game from the toy-train
maker Lionel and Knowledge Adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Con takes players back to a time when railroading was a
grand adventure and there was a thrilling race to lay track across
the wild western half of the United States, linking the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts of the young nation.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Con puts you in charge of building either the westward
Union Pacific or the eastward Central Pacific segment of the
1,776-mile transcontinental railroad, overcoming assorted obstacles
to be the first to reach an arranged meeting point at Promontory,
Utah, while foiling saboteurs and saving the golden spike from
outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   The game, the centennial version of which is packaged in a
decorative tin box with an informative foldout map of the route and
a tiny model of a wood-burning 1860s locomotive, is fun,
educational _ and nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics and sound effects are entertaining, and Lionel
hopes the game will interest computer-wise children in leaving
their keyboards for a while to play with scaled-down trains that
also come packed with high-tech electronics like realistic digital
sounds and remote control. Grown-ups who already have their toy
railroads will also find Trans-Con a challenge, especially if they
click the Hard button.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the transcontinental railroad, which began in
January 1863 and ended with the driving of the golden spike at
Promontory on May 10, 1869, was an amazing engineering feat for the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Pacific had the shortest route _ 690 miles _ and a
three-year head start because its rival was delayed by financial
and engineering problems. But it needed the extra time since
Central Pacific workers faced the formidable task of laying track
over the Sierra Nevada. Much of the Union Pacific's 1,086-mile
section crossed gently rolling plains.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, you will have the help of two young, more or
less fictional characters _ a 25-year-old inventor and chief
engineer, Jack Casement (beginning in 1866, the Union Pacific
construction was supervised by a Civil War general named John S.
Casement), and his 16-year-old sister, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   She is adept at foiling the mischief-makers and unmasking the
mastermind (perhaps the shipping mogul Cornelius Vanderbilt or the
Confederate president, Jefferson Davis) who is determined to stop
the construction.
</P>
<P>
   Context-sensitive help is available with a single click at any
time, as is a Train of Thought Journal with page after page of
accurate, easy-to-digest information on topics like railroad
engineering, geography, wild animals, natural disasters and
characters straight out of the history books.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Union Pacific's president, Thomas C. Durant,
is described as ``a shady fellow who uses the money granted by the
government to pay for a grand lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``money meter'' shows you how much is available for each
stretch of track. Spend too much by making bad decisions or
experiencing bad luck and your railroad will go bankrupt. Then you
will have to start the section over. The first obstacle west of
Omaha is the Elkhorn River, and you can choose one of three kinds
of bridges to cross it: a deck plate ($10,000), a wood trestle
($25,000) or an iron trestle ($50,000). Go with the cheapest option
and it will be washed away in a huge storm.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a really good idea to reroute the track to bypass a
Pawnee village's crop fields and to keep a reserve for losses from
a raging prairie fire or to find a way through an unexpected
quicksand maze.
</P>
<P>
   I have just passed present-day Grand Island, Neb., where Union
Pacific workers encountered Indians for the first time. I figure I
will reach the virtual Promontory by New Year's Day, if I manage to
build a 126-foot-high, 700-foot-long bridge near Laramie, Wyo., and
find enough timber for rails on the nearly treeless plains.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Central Pacific, the ``steam-powered map'' in Jack
Casement's rolling office shows that it has been built only part
way to the summit near Truckee, Calif., where it will take a year
to complete a 1,659-foot tunnel. I'm betting we'll win, even though
the real race was essentially a tie.

ONLINE SHOPPER: THE WEB IS NO PLACE FOR LAST-MINUTE GIFT-BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In early December, I received e-mail offering me $10 off my next
purchase at Buy.com. This immediately reminded me that during this
gift-giving season, I had not bought nearly enough presents for
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Being both very extravagant and very cheap, I was excited to see
that $10 off would enable me to buy two music CDs for less than the
price of one at my local store. So I checked on the availability of
two albums I had not thought of since high school _ Billy Joel's
``The Stranger'' and Elton John's ``Madman Across the Water.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com informed me they both were in stock and usually shipped
within 48 hours, so I ordered them on Dec. 2 for a total of $11.80,
and immediately began to fantasize about blasting Joel's ``Vienna''
in the kitchen while cooking dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days passed. No CDs. I logged on to Buy.com's online order
tracking service, typed my order number and learned _ well, not
much. My order was ``processing.'' Whatever that meant, I suspected
that it was not good.
</P>
<P>
   Had my credit card been rejected? Were the items unavailable?
Had someone decided that it might be better if I didn't sing ``you
can get what you want, or you can just get old'' at the top of my
lungs while chopping onions?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the experience left me loath to turn to the
Internet, unlike many desperate last-minute shoppers. You know who
you are. You let the shopping slide, telling yourself that it is so
much more convenient to click on a Buy button than to engage in a
to-the-death struggle for the last parking space at the mall. But
then, you're probably the sort of person who thinks it might be fun
to parachute from an airplane or order grilled salmon in a chain
restaurant in a land-locked city.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Buy.com's toll-free number about my CDs
confirmed my fears. A customer service representative said the
items were not in stock. In fact, he said, they were on back order
until _ well, he couldn't say. Unless the items became available by
Dec. 13, he said, I should not count on receiving the order before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, a Buy.com spokeswoman, Jennifer Blanchfield,
offered a different explanation. She said the CDs were in stock,
but somehow an unspecified number of orders placed on Dec. 2 _
including mine _ were misplaced. Although she said the orders were
located and processed Dec. 8, my order status did not change until
Dec. 13, when the site informed me the order was ``completed.''
</P>
<P>
   That got me thinking about all the customer service problems I
have experienced while shopping online during this holiday season:
the Monopoly game that Amazon.com said would probably ship within
three days (it took nine), the sweaters I mailed back to Delias.com
in November ($90) and still haven't received confirmation that they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Although these complaints may have seemed minor at the time _
even if it took the children's Prehistoric Cave Painting kit a
month to arrive, it still got here on time, after all _ we are now
heading into that annual season known as the last-minute holiday
shopping frenzy. With only nine shopping days left until Christmas,
no impediment is too minor.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the daredevil temperament necessary for online
shopping this late in the season, you should bear a few things in
mind. The quality of customer service varies wildly _ not only from
Web site to Web site but also from moment to moment. I ordered the
missing Monopoly game from Amazon.com without thinking twice
because the site had my trust. After all, I already placed and
quickly received two previous holiday orders.
</P>
<P>
   Consider just one aspect of customer service _ return policies.
In November, the market researchers at Extraprise Advisors in
Boston studied the return policies of 50 of the busiest Internet
retailers and found huge differences. For instance, don't assume
you can return items you bought online to a store to avoid paying
shipping charges to ship it back. Purchases from online retailers
like Barnesandnoble.com must be mailed back. And if you want to
return an order from Borders.com to a Borders store, call first;
stores are not required to accept online returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shop online, you are not going to get the same
consistent customer service experience as you would at your
favorite retailer at the mall,'' said Allen Bonde, one of the
study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Before you order, check a site's customer service policies and
take the time to phone a live, human customer-service
representative to confirm information published online. This can be
a challenge; last week I called half a dozen companies' customer
service numbers and waited on hold for periods up to 15 minutes,
except at Etoy.com, which disconnected me after 10 minutes. But
you'll be even more frustrated if you order something and it
doesn't arrive in time.
</P>
<P>
   Come next year, if you have a customer service problem, you will
be able to go to www.feedbackdirect.com, a site that will begin
operating online in January. Feedbackdirect says it will intercede
on the behalf of customers to resolve complaints with online
merchants. Or follow the advice at www.safeshopping.org, a site
affiliated with the American Bar Association, that recommends
reading a site's customer service page before buying and paying
with a credit card to limit liability.
</P>
<P>
   What about my CDs? Unless I wanted the aggravation of canceling
my entire order with Buy.com, I really had no choice. On Monday, I
went to a local music store and saw both CDs. I even held them in
my hands and felt the plastic wrap crinkle under my fingers. But
they cost $11.97 each (before tax), so I put them back on the shelf
and went home to wait. Luckily, I don't need them before Christmas.

AN ECLECTIC SITE FOR ARTS NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(af) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new online arts digest is fashioning a daily journal out of
the cultural world's daily jumble.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Arts Journal, is not the first arts site, but it
illustrates the ability of one person with a good idea and a
willingness to forgo sleep to provide a useful Internet service at
little cost (www.artsjournal.com).
</P>
<P>
   Arts Journal was designed in August, went online in September
and is updated daily by Douglas J. McLennan, a former concert
pianist and arts reporter in Seattle. He got the idea as a 1996-97
fellow in the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia. Surfing
various sites, he kept coming across interesting news in local
papers and obscure Web pages and wondering why they had not
received wider circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, McLennan scans more than 100 online publications,
selecting 80 to 120 links a week for his digest. Since Arts Journal
creates links, not reprints, he pays no royalty fees, and the links
allow audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   There are sections for music, dance, theater, visual arts, arts
publishing, arts issues and the previous week's biggest articles.
His home page has a link to a similar site, Arts &AMP; Letters Daily
(www.cybereditions.com/aldaily), which he said took a more academic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan, 41, said his site's greatest attraction was its
ability to cluster articles. ``The granddaddy of all of them is the
Giuliani-Brooklyn Museum thing,'' he said. The site's coverage of
the clash over the ``Sensation'' exhibition, which includes about
80 stories from all over the English-speaking world, is subdivided
into news, reviews, analyses and related controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all topical subjects work out, McLennan said, citing a page
in which he tried to focus on what he thought was the heating-up
New York auction market. ``Man, nobody was interested,'' he said.
Visual arts and music generate the most articles, he said; dance
and poetry are the hardest to find.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet workday begins at 5 a.m. for McLennan, who takes
three to four hours to update his Web site and two or three to do
technical maintenance. He also tries to deal with 50 to 100 e-mail
messages a day, many from readers asking for help. ``And then
there's a couple of hours trying to promote the site,'' mainly by
persuading other sites to link to his, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that makes the site possible is its low cost: $35 a
month for the site's host and $59 a month for a DSL line. He said
that he received about 1,000 daily visits and that he had received
offers to remain nonprofit and be subsidized by a foundation or to
become part of a larger commercial site.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan is confident that one-person sites like his are here to
stay. ``Yeah, there are these megasites,'' he said, ``but what the
megasites seem to be doing is becoming the homes of the swarms of
baby-bee sites.'' As for the artists and writers who self-publish
online, and who are linked to Arts Journal, ``their material is no
less valuable because they happen to have control of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, McLennan's site has one regular advertiser, the
National Arts Journalism Program, his old sponsor, which
coincidentally made the top-news index last month when it issued a
report criticizing the state of local arts journalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The road to the White House is an uphill climb for
most candidates. But thanks to a StairMaster, Bill Bradley might
have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Saturday, the former professional
basketball player praised the exercise device as his preferred way
to stay fit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bradley's comments have tripled sales inquiries to
the Seattle-based company that makes StairMaster, according to
company president Tom Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very surprised,'' Bryant said. ``We're going to send
him a note and a StairMaster shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions following the disclosure last week that
he suffered from an irregular heart beat, Bradley said he often
goes out of his way to find hotels equipped with a StairMaster.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the product endorsement, Bryant declined to say if he
will support the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say how I will personally vote,'' he said.
``But having a president in the White House who would be using our
product is a very encouraging incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time for Bryant. He once served as a
president of Dunlop Maxfli Sports, the manufacturer of the golf
balls favored by former President George Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle.

 &HT;    USERS DESCRIBE COSTS OF 'PAYDAY' LOANS
 &HT;    450&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Navy sailor told a congressional forum Wednesday
how he became one of the growing number of Americans who take out
small loans from ``payday'' lenders and then fall into a sinkhole
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Stewart A. Wilson said he had been
``desperate'' four years ago when he discovered ads for quick cash
from storefront lenders around the Naval Air Station in
Jacksonville, Fla. He took out a short-term loan for about $250 and
hardly noticed the large fees.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't repay the principal, he took out more
short-term loans and paid more fees. By this fall, when he found
help through a credit union, he said he had paid $5,640 in fees
over the past year on what had grown into an $800 loan.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's case focused attention on fast-growing ``payday''
lenders, who are said to lend $8.5 billion a year from about 9,000
outlets across the country. However, their fees are so high _
estimated at 400 percent if annualized _ that the practice is
banned in 21 states, according to the Consumer Federation of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who led the forum, said the
discussion ``may be particularly timely because payday lenders
enjoy a marked increase in their business during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are scanning the ads in the newspaper or out doing
your shopping _and wishing you had a little more money in your
pocket _ you may well see promotions describing the payday product
as quick and easy cash,'' he said. In fact, he said, it is is ``one
of the most expensive'' loans in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Even representatives of ``payday'' lending conceded Wednesday
that their industry needs to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the first to acknowledge that our industry has
problems,'' said Billy Webster, president-elect of the Community
Financial Services Association, the industry's trade group. Webster
is also president of Advance America, which claims to be the
largest ``payday'' lending company.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said the lenders should clearly disclose the real cost
of such quick loans, give customers a 24-hour escape clause, and
stop using threats of criminal prosecution against borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Webster told Lieberman that he opposed any new federal
regulation for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's revenue has grown from nearly nothing at the
beginning of the decade to a projected $2 billion next year. The
growth will continue next year as payday lending goes onto the
Internet, said Robert E. Rochford, a lawyer for another the lending
association, Financial Service Centers of America.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although high-interest loans are banned in Texas, the industry
is finding ways around those limits, the forum was told.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie L. Pettijohn, commissioner of consumer credit in Texas,
told the forum that at least three out-of-state banks have found
agents in the Texas to provide high-interest payday loans despite
an anti-usury provision in the state's constitution.
</P>

which are then ``leased back'' to the owner for a fee.

president of the Florida Central Credit Union, a Tampa-based

lending. He said the short-term loans are structured so that
borrowers are almost bound to mount up debt.

 &HT;    USERS DESCRIBE COSTS OF 'PAYDAY' LOANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Navy sailor told a congressional forum Wednesday
how he became one of the growing number of Americans who take out
small loans from ``payday'' lenders and then fall into a sinkhole
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Stewart A. Wilson said he had been
``desperate'' four years ago when he discovered ads for quick cash
from storefront lenders around the Naval Air Station in
Jacksonville, Fla. He took out a short-term loan for about $250 and
hardly noticed the large fees.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't repay the principal, he took out more
short-term loans and paid more fees. By this fall, when he found
help through a credit union, he said he had paid $5,640 in fees
over the past year on what had grown into an $800 loan.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's case focused attention on fast-growing ``payday''
lenders, who are said to lend $8.5 billion a year from about 9,000
outlets across the country. However, their fees are so high _
estimated at 400 percent if annualized _ that the practice is
banned in 21 states, according to the Consumer Federation of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who led the forum, said the
discussion ``may be particularly timely because payday lenders
enjoy a marked increase in their business during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are scanning the ads in the newspaper or out doing
your shopping _and wishing you had a little more money in your
pocket _ you may well see promotions describing the payday product
as quick and easy cash,'' he said. In fact, he said, it is is ``one
of the most expensive'' loans in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Even representatives of ``payday'' lending conceded Wednesday
that their industry needs to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the first to acknowledge that our industry has
problems,'' said Billy Webster, president-elect of the Community
Financial Services Association, the industry's trade group. Webster
is also president of Advance America, which claims to be the
largest ``payday'' lending company.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said the lenders should clearly disclose the real cost
of such quick loans, give customers a 24-hour escape clause, and
stop using threats of criminal prosecution against borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Webster told Lieberman that he opposed any new federal
regulation for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's revenue has grown from nearly nothing at the
beginning of the decade to a projected $2 billion next year. The
growth will continue next year as payday lending goes onto the
Internet, said Robert E. Rochford, a lawyer for another the lending
association, Financial Service Centers of America.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although high-interest loans are banned in Texas, the industry
is finding ways around those limits, the forum was told.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie L. Pettijohn, commissioner of consumer credit in Texas,
told the forum that at least three out-of-state banks have found
agents in the Texas to provide high-interest payday loans despite
an anti-usury provision in the state's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   She said 1,300 pawnshops are now applying to become agents to
make these high-fee loans for out-of-state banks. Pettijohn said
that lenders have other inventive ways to get around the ban, such
as calling the loans purchases of the customers' home appliances,
which are then ``leased back'' to the owner for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and other states, including Georgia, have fought the
lenders in court through costly legislation, but the results have
been inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of states, including Ohio, payday lending is not

&HT;     TIPS FOR MILLENNIUM TRAVELERS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For those brave enough to travel over the New
Year's Eve weekend, the travel industry has a few tips to avoid any
millennium-sized headaches from the Year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really think anything is going to happen, but it's
just one of those situations where people shouldn't take any
chances that could end up ruining their vacation,'' said Kristina
Rundquist, spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Agents.
The Alexandria, Va.-based travel industry association, which has
nearly 29,000 members in more than 170 countries, said people
traveling between Dec. 31 and Jan. 3 should follow these tips to
help prevent any problems:
</P>
<P>
   _Obtain, and carry, a written confirmation of all travel plans
including confirmation numbers. If you are traveling to a resort or
destination that is booked to capacity, reconfirm your hotel
reservations by contacting the resort directly before you leave
home.
</P>
<P>
   _Before departing on an overseas trip, contact the State
Department or visit its Web site at
http://travel.state.gov/y2kca.html to check on your destination's
overall Year 2000 readiness. Check to see how prepared that
country's aviation industry is for the glitch that could disable
computers unable to distinguish 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   _Consider obtaining traditional printed tickets rather than
electronic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _Take out extra cash or travelers' checks before departure,
rather than relying on Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) once you
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   _Think about purchasing trip cancellation insurance. However,
before you buy any, make sure the policy covers Y2K-related
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Make at least two copies of all pertinent travel-related
documents including your passport, visas, driver's license, front
and back of credit cards, medical/eye prescriptions and important
phone numbers. Keep one copy in a separate but secure section of
your carry-on luggage and give the other copy to a close friend or
relative who can provide you with the information if needed.
</P>
<P>
   _Be sure to keep all essential items _ including prescriptions,
toiletries and a change of clothes _ in your carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   _As with all peak-travel periods, anticipate possible delays.
Bring a book, water and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rundquist said millennium travelers should take the attitude of
people ``heading into a storm and arriving in a place that was just
hit by a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested that travelers consult a professional travel
agent to help with their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel agents will make sure all of your documents are safe,
and if problems arise, they can likely get you on another flight or
book you another hotel room faster than you could do it on your
own,'' she said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day early in October, 40 employees of the Xerox Corp.,
working in locations across the United States, received unwelcome
news: They had been caught in the act of surfing to forbidden Web
sites, nabbed not by managers or fellow employees but by software
designed to monitor their online indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   The software recorded every Web site they had visited (many of
which, it turned out, were related to shopping or pornography) and
every minute they had spent at those sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was up to eight hours a day in inappropriate visits to
Web sites,'' said Bill McKee, a spokesman for Xerox. ``Obviously
they were not doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40 workers were fired immediately, but they were not the
only ones being subjected to the watchful eye of the monitoring
software. In fact, the Web use of every one of Xerox's 92,000
employees _ in countries around the world _ is routinely monitored
by the company. The surveillance is no secret, McKee said. Xerox
workers have come to expect that they are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at companies elsewhere should begin to expect the
same: In 1999, at least 45 percent of employers said they monitored
their employees' phone calls, computer files or e-mail messages,
according to the American Management Association. That number,
based on a survey of more than 1,000 human-resources managers at
corporations of varying sizes, is up from 35 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring is necessary, employers argue, because of the
changing nature of the workplace. Supervisors must keep tabs on
which workers are wasting company time by surfing to entertainment
Web sites, which ones are sending e-mail messages that create a
hostile environment for women or members of minority groups, and
which ones are distributing company secrets or jamming their
networks with bulk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing that desire for control with an employee's rights to
privacy has never been easy. Even before the arrival of the
Internet, courts have heard cases of employers who search through
desks or listen to voice-mail messages. A spattering of laws,
including state and federal wiretap laws, have tried to offer some
guideposts. Under the federal wiretap law, for example, an employer
cannot listen to an employee's personal telephone conversations
unless the employees have been notified that their conversations
are monitored and unless the monitoring is required for business
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Now questions of privacy have moved to the electronic realm _
where laws related to workplace surveillance are nearly
nonexistent. And so far, less than a dozen lawsuits that raise
questions about an employer's right to read e-mail messages or
track Web site use have made their way to courts. In several of
these, judges have ruled that employers can do what they want with
computers they own. Some judges have said that as long as employees
are warned that they may be watched, they should not expect any
privacy in their online interactions.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates, labor organizations and lawyers
consider those arguments still largely untested. A person's home
life and work life are increasingly intermingled, they argue. At
what point is it reasonable to expect at least some privacy when
using a company's computers or network?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't define privacy as whatever the employer wants it to
be,'' said Craig Cornish, a lawyer who specializes in issues
related to workplace privacy. ``Then it's no right at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the issues revolve around technology that enables
employers to watch and record what flies over their networks.
Recent developments in software may add further complications:
Companies can now record and view everything a person does on a
computer, from typing in a word-processing document to opening an
image file.
</P>
<P>
   One new product, called Spector, surreptitiously takes digital
snapshots of whatever appears on the screen, as often as every few
seconds. ``Your employees will hate Spector,'' the Web site for the
software declares, ``because Spector records everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Spector was just released this month, John Yatsko, a
security consultant for J &AMP; J Consulting in Erie, Pa., has already
installed it at a plastics manufacturing company that he would not
name. ``If you need evidence you want to take to the police,
Spector is great for that,'' Yatsko said.
</P>
<P>
   Most employers are less heavy-handed. They say they won't
routinely read e-mail messages. And they will typically look at Web
traffic among a pool of computers without focusing on individual
use. But if something looks suspicious, they say, they have a right
to dig into an employee's electronic records.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take appropriate steps to make sure the resources
are put to appropriate business use,'' said Alan Hodel, a spokesman
for Compaq Computer, one of 4,800 companies that use a filtering
and monitoring product called Websense.
</P>
<P>
   Employers' fear of sexual-harassment lawsuits is one of the
greatest forces driving the monitoring movement, according to
companies that sell filtering and monitoring software. If employees
are surfing to pornography sites, said John Carrington, president
of Websense Inc., ``it's like having porno magazines all through
your office.'' If blocking and monitoring software is in place,
Carrington said, ``a company can say, at least we tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies that track Web use say they also watch to make
sure that employees are getting their work done. In a recent survey
of about 1,200 employers by Vault.com, a company that publishes
reports about workplace issues, 54 percent reported that they had
caught employees browsing Web sites that were not related to work.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the perceived abuse of resources, many companies
have posted policies outlining what use of e-mail and the Web is
permitted and what is not. Xerox, for example, flashes a message on
the screen every time employees log on. It tells them not to use
the Web for anything but work.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Xerox case, the repercussions of violating those
polices can be drastic: In a survey commissioned by Websense of 200
human-resources officers in mid-size and large companies, one in
three reported that their company had fired employees for misusing
the Internet. A few cases noted in the survey, taken in November,
stemmed from shopping, stock trading, gambling, sports and computer
games. But the vast majority involved pornography. Just this month,
for example, The New York Times Co. fired 23 employees in a central
processing center in Norfolk, Va., for distributing pornographic
images via e-mail, according to Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for
the company. The action was not the result of monitoring but was in
response to an employee complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were made very uncomfortable'' by the
distribution of the material, Ms. Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a handful of employees have argued in court that an
employer's electronic surveillance invaded their privacy. Not one
case, according to Cornish, who has been following the subject, has
been tried by a jury. Some experts suspect that if the employees
had faced a group of their peers, they may have found a more
sympathetic audience. In addressing judges, however, employees have
failed: Not one has ruled in their favor.

   The case of Mark L. Simons, a former CIA employee, is one
example. In 1998, Simons was convicted of possessing child
pornography after a network manager detected that his workstation
had called up several pornographic Web sites. While Simons did not
dispute the facts of the charges against him, he argued in court
that the agency's search of his computer was unlawful because his
employer initially looked at his hard drive without involving the
police, who would have had to obtain a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the employer was looking through his computer for a
legitimate business reason, he wouldn't need a warrant,'' argued
Marvin Miller, Simons' lawyer. ``But this was a criminal
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, James C. Cacheris of the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, was not persuaded. The
agency, Cacheris wrote in his opinion, had made clear to its
employees that they were only permitted to use the company's
Internet service lawfully. And he agreed with the employer's
argument that the agency has a right to monitor its networks to
make sure that its systems are secure. Simons has appealed the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who specialize in employee rights question whether
employers can unilaterally claim the right to monitor what happens
on their computers. Just because the computers and networks are the
employers' property, they argue, does not mean that they have a
right to read everything that crosses the computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A logical extension of that,'' said Cornish, who is
co-chairman of an American Bar Association subcommittee on
workplace privacy, ``is the argument that you're using our
bathrooms, therefore we get to put a camera over the stalls.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Everett L. Bobbitt, a lawyer in San Diego, said he recently took
on a case in which an employer took the ownership argument too far.
He represented a police officer who said he had been fired after
his employer searched his computer and found a file showing he had
visited www.whitehouse.com, _ a pornographic Web site. The police
department argued that it had a right to go through the officer's
computer files partly because it owned the computer.
</P>
<P>
   But the police officer, whom Bobbitt would not name, insisted
that he had meant to type www.whitehouse.gov _ the official White
House site. He sued for wrongful termination and eventually settled
the suit for $100,000. The employer had no right to go through the
officer's files simply because they were on the company's computer,
Bobbitt argued. ``It was just a fishing expedition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates wonder about the larger impact of
electronic surveillance on how people live their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of us are working in a mixed work-and-home
environment,'' said Beth Givens, project director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego. People are
using their computers for making medical appointments, sending
messages to loved ones or filling out forms for car insurance.
``Any monitoring needs to take that into account,'' Ms. Givens
said. ``There are many individuals who would feel they have a
reasonable expectation of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even everyday information-gathering _ like visiting political
Web sites or checking the news _ may be thwarted if workers are
worried about being watched, Cornish said. ``Surveillance has a
chilling effect,'' he said. ``To what extent is this going to choke
off an informed citizenry?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, many lawyers argue, employers should warn
their employees that their e-mail may be read and their Web use may
be monitored. Last summer, the American Management Association
issued a memo to its 10,000 member companies, urging them to make
their employees aware that their electronic actions and
communications ``are subject to recording and review.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks such policies should be required. In
California, Gov. Gray Davis recently vetoed a a bill that would
have prohibited companies from secretly monitoring their employees'
e-mail or personal computer records. He argued that the law would
unduly burden companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At least employees have time on their side. Employers who choose
to scan through employee files, e-mail and Web logs are in for
hours of extra work. A joke circulating on the Net, written by a
28-year-old named Joe Lavin, puts it this way:
</P>
<P>
   A manager installs monitoring software on his employees'
computers. Right away he starts reprimanding them for playing video
games, downloading Pamela Anderson photographs and sending
offensive e-mail messages. But in the end, it is the manager who is
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the past a very effective manager,'' the joke goes.
But lately ``he has been merely sitting in his office all day,
spying on other employees.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown's huge financial advantage
and his vaunted political field operation combined to turn out
three voters for every two who supported Board of Supervisors
President Tom Ammiano in the San Francisco run-off election
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the turnout and interviews with voters and
political experts showed that the mayor won a landslide, with
nearly 60 percent of the vote, because his aggressive
get-out-the-vote effort got both Brown's core supporters and many
backers of erstwhile candidates Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods where Brown ran strongest in the Nov. 2
general election, voter turnout increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign had organized extensive get-out-the-vote
efforts. Meanwhile, in the neighborhoods where the Ammiano write-in
campaign had the most traction six weeks ago, turnout appeared to
have increased only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano won a spot in the run-off race with an unprecedented
write-in campaign in the November election, defeating Reilly and
Jordan, a former mayor, who out-campaigned and out-spent the city
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But in parts of the city where the campaigns of Jordan and
Reilly, who endorsed Ammiano, ran strongest in November, voter
turnout was up more than 7 percent, and there were indications
Brown was the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign had targeted conservative voters in those
neighborhoods. And the San Franciscans for Sensible Government, a
pro-Brown committee formed by downtown business interests, had
mounted a major effort to rally Asian-American voters to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Brown and Ammiano are Democrats, the mayor is
viewed as slightly less liberal and friendlier to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Brown spent more than $3 million on his re-election, six
times what Ammiano spent. The incumbent's re-election also was
boosted by independent committees run by business and political
organizations. They may have spent as much as $2 million
electioneering for the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, executive director of the Chinese-American Voters
Education Committee, said there were other signs the Brown campaign
had connected with those voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one precinct, we saw half of the absentee voters had
Chinese surnames,'' he said. ``That told us that the independent
expenditure campaign, the sensible government committee, had
worked, because they spent funds specifically'' to persuade
Asian-American voters to cast absentee votes for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his organization had spent much of election day
tracking the get-out-the-vote effort at key precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went, Lee said, he saw Brown campaign workers
checking voter lists and going door to door to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's forces were far less in evidence, he said. That
suggested that Ammiano's low-budget campaign simply could not match
Brown's election-day blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Election-day interviews indicated that many swing voters were
breaking for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nelson, 54, a lawyer and homeowner, said that with Jordan
out of the race, it was vital to support Brown's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to the economy of this city,'' Nelson
said. ``I think Tom Ammiano would be bad for business and I think
people in this neighborhood would be taxed unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews indicated that only in the Castro District did
Ammiano clearly beat Brown. In a neighborhood where voters went to
the polls to elect the country's first openly gay mayor, a vote for
Ammiano was almost like voting for kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a personal connection,'' Ed Buckley, 43, said as he
left a polling station on Sharon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, like Ammiano earlier in his career, is a teacher in the
San Francisco Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend. I like Willie, too. He's a great guy. But, with
things going well, this is the time to take a chance on something
different.''

WHAT EMPLOYERS CAN VIEW AT WORK
</HEADLINE>
   (With WORKER-MONITORING) 
(nk) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The increasing pervasiveness of surveillance technology has led
many employees to wonder just how much privacy they can expect
anywhere in the workplace _ whether on their computers or in their
file cabinets. The questions are not always easily answered, but a
few guidelines can be drawn, according to people who follow
employment law.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, experts say, the details of a particular
situation _ such as the presence of locks on drawers _ will
determine what is considered an unlawful intrusion. Whether the
employer is part of the public sector also matters: Public
employers are held to standards set in the Fourth Amendment, which
protects people against unreasonable search and seizure by
government officials. And policies set by an employer can make all
the difference in determining what level of privacy is reasonably
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The following list may provide a rough idea of which areas of
the workplace are typically considered private, and which are not _
according to several lawyers' interpretations of privacy laws and
court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   PURSES AND BRIEFCASES: As a general rule, employers have no
right to go through a purse, briefcase or piece of luggage that has
been brought into the workplace, according to a 1987 ruling by the
U.S. Supreme Court, O'Connor vs. Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   DESKS AND FILE CABINETS: The drawers of desks and file cabinets
are also typically off limits to employers _ as long as employees
have not been given notification that their drawers are subject to
monitoring and as long as the drawers are locked and not shared by
others. This interpretation, too, is based upon the Supreme Court's
1987 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   PHONE CONVERSATIONS: In most cases, in accordance with federal
wiretap laws, employers may not listen to an employee's  &UR; personal
 &LR; conversations without their knowledge. But many exceptions apply:
An employer may listen to the phone conversations of telemarketers,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   VOICE MAIL: Employers may gain access to voice mail messages if
they have a business purpose for doing so, and especially if they
have told their employees that the messages may be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL AND WEB USE: Most employees should not consider their
office e-mail to be private, nor should they assume that their
employers are not looking at logs of the Web sites they have
visited. Only a handful of lawsuits regarding workers' e-mail and
Web privacy have made their way to court. So far, judges have been
ruling overwhelmingly in favor of the employers, especially if
employees are told not to use the company networks for anything but
work.

   &QL;  &UR; SBA Chief Backs Rule on Minority Ownership &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Jonathan Lipman &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 - SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez backed the
federal government's long-standing definition of minority-owned
businesses this week, essentially opposing a proposed rule that the
National Minority Supplier Development Council will vote on next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The NMSDC is a business-membership group that promotes
business-to-business relationships between minority businesses and
the corporate community at large. At its next meeting, the council
will vote on allowing companies with as little as 30 percent
minority ownership to claim minority-owned status. Since 1978, the
government has used a 51 percent ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using a different and lower ratio, the MNSDC proposal
creates confusion,'' Alvarez said in a prepared statement. ``The
fact is that this proposal does not satisfy the legal standard for
federal contracting programs. It would be illegal to apply this
proposed definition to any federal contract. The minority small
business community is not well served by a resolution that flies in
the face of existing laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NMSDC contends that its regulation does not need to
agree with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a non-profit organization and this has nothing to do
whatsoever with government,'' said NMSDC spokeswoman Donna Long.
The organization continues to support the change, she said, but
delayed its initial October vote in order to better explain the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would allow a minority-owned business to sell up to
70 percent of its non-voting stock to non-minority shareholders
without losing its status. Minorities must still hold 51 percent of
voting stock and day-to-day operations must be minority managed.

 &HT;    Indigos revitalized after a year of sadness
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Emily Saliers and Amy Ray _ the Atlanta folk-pop duo known
as the Indigo Girls _ play their last shows of 1999 tonight and
Friday at the Tabernacle, it will be an occasion for reflection and
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the best of times and the worst for them. They've
weathered the sudden deaths of close friends and family, but also
made a breakthrough concert trip to Cuba, toured with the final
installment of Lilith Fair and, in ``Come on Now Social'' (Epic),
released one of the strongest albums in their 19-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of loss this year was the worst year ever,'' says
Saliers, whose 29-year-old sister, Carrie, was found dead in her
Los Angeles apartment in March. The Los Angeles County Coroner's
Office ruled that she died from natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   The new album is dedicated to Carrie, and to others close to the
musicians, including the Atlanta songwriter/performer known as
Benjamin, and activists Ingrid Washinawatock El-Issa and Marcia
Gomez, members of the Indigenous Women's Network, with which the
Indigos are involved. ``The message of (my sister's) spirit was
something I absorbed and live by. There was so much tragedy, but so
much growth and inspiration,'' says Saliers, 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture fights death tooth and nail,'' she continues.
``These were reminders of being a natural part of the whole
intricate web, and that's been a good lesson for me, as many tears
as I've shed. I am eternally optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 35, concurs. ``It was a hard year for us,'' she says,
noting how the death of a friend's grandmother inspired ``Go,'' the
fired-up opening track on ``Social,'' and the duo's plans to
contribute a song to a tribute CD dedicated to Benjamin, who died
in January at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the performers have responded to sad events by
investing their music with a sense of urgency. If it once was easy
to typecast the Indigos as diary-dipping coffeehouse harmonizers,
it is no more. ``Social'' shows a band that is musically
complicated _ banjos coexist with theremins and beat boxes _ and
thrilled to be rocking out. ``I really, really love playing
electric guitar,'' Saliers says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta vocalist Kelly Hogan, who now lives in Chicago
and joined the group onstage there recently, offers further
testimony. ``They're so nice you don't think they could survive in
the wilds, but they're rocking now. Shocking and rocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Saliers and Ray, whose nonmusical interests include social
activism, running an independent record label (Ray's Daemon) and
launching a restaurant (Saliers' Watershed, in Decatur), thrive on
surprises. Though they've been affiliated with Lilith Fair, they
also took their own Generation XX show on the road: the 1998
``Suffragette Sessions,'' which featured varied female artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them because they support cross-pollination and worlds
colliding at all times,'' Hogan says.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Indigos? Some time off. And then? More
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make jokes about it,'' says Saliers, who mentions that Ray
_ the Indigo's resident punk-rock fan _ is working on a solo album.
``She wants to make a total acoustic album, and I want to go in and
rock some more. We could make a double album. It wouldn't sell and
our career might end! We always start at opposite ends of the
spectrum and then it all comes together.''

 &HT;    King Street corridor offers service with style
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ In this city where shoppers are treated like
royalty, you'd do well to head for King Street this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 200 shops, many in centuries-old renovated
buildings, this charming corridor has something for every type of
shopper. Need a special gift? Wander into fred _ named for shop
partner Judith Reinhard's husband _ and pick up gourmet cookware in
either black or white, the featured colors. Perhaps you want a
souvenir of your visit to this Lowcountry city. Stop by Charles
Kerrison Jewelers, where the fifth generation of the family is
running the store, and buy a Charleston plate made exclusively for
Kerrison's by Wedgwood. Or run into Bob Ellis Shoes _ which also
has a branch at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta _ for a pair of sexy Prada
sandals to wear on the last night of '99.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these hometown favorites, including tons of
antiques stores, the street is also home to such familiar national
chains as Saks Fifth Avenue, the Gap and Ann Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   King Street is downtown, stretching from the Cooper River
bridges to the Battery. It was one of the original streets of
Charleston, which was founded in 1670. Although christened
Albermarle Point, the city was later named Charles Town after King
Charles II of England and renamed Charleston in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   ``King was the choice of merchants,'' said Linda Helmly,
director of the Charleston Peninsula Business Association. ``Since
it was the highest street on the peninsula, they could keep their
merchandise dry if floods came. On the other hand, Market Street
during the 19th century, which was used as the city's fish, meat
and vegetable market, was in a creek bed and was constantly getting
flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many downtown streets, King became rundown and derelict in
the '60s and '70s but came back to life with the opening of
Charleston Place in 1986. Located on the block bordered by Market,
King, Meeting and Hasell streets, the hotel, supported by longtime
mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., attracted shops and galleries for blocks
around. Thus it helped turn King Street back into a shopping
destination for locals and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other Charleston streets boast specialty shops and
boutiques including East Bay, Church and Broad. Then there's the
area that comprises Center Market, the Rainbow Market and the Open
Air Market on Market Street. Local artists, including those weaving
Lowcountry sweetgrass baskets, rent stalls and ply their wares.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have limited time, stick to King. You can always go
back and visit the others on another shopping foray.
</P>
<P>
   One shop on this narrow street that reflects Charleston's
worldwide shopping appeal is Norma May International. Three and a
half years ago, May moved her New York business to King Street.
``Everything in the store is made or painted by hand,'' says the
owner who describes her clothing and accessories as ``fashion
art.'' Especially during Charleston's springtime Spoleto Festival,
the shop welcomes international visitors who buy jackets made from
old kimonos, pashmina shawls and handpainted silk bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come in with an old, drab outfit and always leave with
something spectacular,'' said Judy Boehm, a Charlestonian of 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in a bench for your patio or garden, visit
the Charleston Battery Bench store. The iron bench was first made
by the J.F Riley Iron Works in Charleston during the mid-19th
century. George Birlant, purchased the original bench mold pattern
from Riley more than 40 years ago when it ceased doing business.
The design of the casting includes flora and fauna native to South
Carolina. Today, the Birlant family turns out authentic
reproductions ($229.50), which dot Charleston's historic Battery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the finest antiques shops are on King Street, starting
at Princess Street. On a recent Tuesday, Atlanta real estate agent
Suzanne Corbett was busy ``working'' King Street, looking for
porcelain. ``I like 18th-century antiques and Charleston is the
place to find them,'' she said. Corbett visits the city every three
to four months and loves it so much she's looking for property to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best reason to shop King Street is the level of
service given by the stores. ``I like to shop at Berlin's clothing
store, which has been there forever,'' said frequent visitor Dulcy
Rosenberg of Atlanta. ``The same woman always waits on me. It's so
personal.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From downtown Atlanta, take I-20 east to

 &HT;    Atlanta singer expresses herself in poems and essays
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Atlanta pop trio TLC released its ``CrazySexyCool''
album in 1994, there's been no doubt who embodies that last
adjective: It's T-Boz, Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins, who always seems
to be in control of the situations she sings about.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to controlling her emotions, forget cool. Hers
is often a cold stare frosting all onlookers from album covers and
videos.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it's Watkins who has followed pop singer Jewel's lead
and written a collection of poems and essays called ``Thoughts,''
which she'll share with autograph-seekers tonight at a Chapter 11
bookstore in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the native of Des Moines, Iowa, discusses her
father leaving home when she was 3; her delinquent high school
days; and what it was like when TLC was the best-selling female
group in the country and her lights were cut off at home.
</P>
<P>
   A rather personable Watkins, 29, talked recently about becoming
an author, how she's dealing with sickle cell anemia on TLC's first
headlining tour (it visits Philips Arena on Jan. 29) and the public
feud fellow TLC member Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes is having with her
and Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas in the press:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What made you write a book?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sitting around all that time in between albums. While we were
working out all of the business things like the bankruptcy, I was
still the creative person that I am. So I needed a way to get this
out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there anyone you read who led you in this direction?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't like to read. I mean, I like stuff like (motivational
author) Iyanla Vanzant and ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff.'' Stuff
you can skim. And I designed my book for people like me.
</P>
<P>
   I want this to be something for the kids. Maybe it will stop
them from going through some of the unnecessary pain I took myself
through. And it's a way for people to see a side of me they don't
hear in the music. How I grew up, how I've dealt with sickle cell,
the things the fans write me about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are you dealing with your illness on the road? Wasn't it
your sickle cell anemia that prevented you from touring extensively
before?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and I'm doing much better this time. My performance has
changed a lot. I'm just walking and singing, instead of popping and
snapping and dancing all over the place like I used to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has your diet changed in any way? In ``Thoughts,'' you
mention your love for oxtails and give readers a taco casserole
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   A: What's really funny is I take prenatal pills. I take in
everything an unborn baby could. I take folic acid. And I drink
about three bottles of Gatorade before each show. That's why I'm
wearing the kind of outfits I'm wearing. It's like forget trying to
be sexy, I might be bloated. I have to wear what's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's going on with you and Left-Eye? In the press she's
been saying things backstage are pretty bad between you.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not mad at her. I'm not mad about anything. In any family
_ and we're like sisters _ you agree to disagree sometimes. And
from what I've read, she's admitted to not showing up for things
and walking off sets. Now when a reporter is sitting there watching
her do it what could I say? ``Oh, maybe her toe hurts?'' I was
forced into telling the truth. Don't get me wrong though, I wish
baby girl the best for whatever she wants to do. But there's a way
to do everything. It's unfortunate that we have to have this
ongoing soap opera as we do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think there'll be a TLC when this tour and record are
over?
</P>
<P>
   A: We'll see. I'd rather we stop because people don't want to
hear us anymore. Not because we can't get along.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Worst-case scenario: You guys break up. Then what for you? A
solo career?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everybody else says I should, but I don't want to. I'm
working on a cartoon with the Jim Henson Co. (``It's a Fly
World''). Me and (TLC producer) Dallas Austin are working with
(rapper/actor Will Smith's company) Overbrook to develop this movie
called ``Jellybeans'' ... basically about how we all met at a
skating rink called Jellybeans in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you thinking about leaving Atlanta for Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh no. Unless, I get married.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Married?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I may be getting engaged (to rapper Mack 10). I don't
like L.A. But he's from L.A. And if he asks, I'll go.

   Space Shuttle Mission Will Not Jeopardize Santa's Flight: Cape
Canaveral Ready for Kris Kringle
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Lipman
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 - NASA officials sought to allay fears
Wednesday by confirming that, even though the space shuttle will be
in orbit Christmas Eve, NASA will once again keep landing
facilities open in the event Santa Claus is forced to make an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has traditionally offered its landing strip at Cape
Canaveral to Claus in case of a mechanical failure or elf
emergency, and spokesman Bruce Buckingham said this year will be no
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landing area will still be open, both in the event of an
emergency landing from Santa or an emergency landing of the
Shuttle,'' Buckingham said. ``It's not a problem because they come
in from different trajectories. Santa's coming in from a polar
orbit and we're in an equatorial orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Claus, who also received interstate flight clearance from the
Department of Transportation Wednesday, will be flying a
custom-built sleigh, powered by ``eight tiny reindeer, with the
addition of a possible ninth reindeer with a special air navigation
warning light in its nose, in the event of heavy fog or snow,'' the
DOT said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Since Claus added Global Positioning System hardware to his
sleigh back in the late 1970s, Buckingham said, NASA has been able
to track Claus on his Christmas Eve mission ``from the north pole
all the way down to wherever he chooses to touch down first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraging that he come first,'' Buckingham added. ``I
think he wants to start south and then work his way back north.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite unconfirmed reports that STS-103 Mission
Commander Curtis Brown has indeed been a good boy, he and the six
other astronauts will have to wait until Discovery lands on Dec. 26
to receive their Christmas presents. There are no plans for a
mid-orbit docking of Discovery and Claus' sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep the reindeers apart,'' Buckingham said.

   MISCELLANEOUSSTATE-TITLE _ SEALY, Texas _ Motorists heading west
of I-10 might get a jolt of confusion about 40 miles from Houston.
Rand McNally would indicate they're approaching Sealy. A giant
billboard stationed at the city limit proclaims they're entering
Titletown, Texas. Of course, anyone with even a mild interest in
Texas high school football knows they're one and the same. And if
any uninformed traveler is driving slow enough to read the entire
sign they will understand the double intentity. Sealy won Class 3A
state football championships in 1978, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 and
the town wants everyone to know. Except for its volume of
championships, Sealy isn't much different from any other Texas town
that wins it all. You get the trophy. You get the ring. You get the
billboard. But why is a football championship so important to Texas
communities? Why is a football crown a school's most cherished

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Tis the season for cheap chic.
</P>
<P>
   When you've blown your budget on gifts for the family and don't
have the cash for a haute holiday ensemble, there's no need for a
Cinderella complex.
</P>
<P>
   You can kiss the old century goodbye and party into the new one
in the season's latest look _ the ball-gown skirt _ and all the
glittery trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   For under $100.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally you've got to lower your expectations a tad, unless
you stumble over a designer ball-gown skirt at Marshall's or T.J.
Maxx. And it (BEGIN ITAL)is(END ITAL) possible.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the countdown has begun, and you're in a hurry. So we
scouted around, and here's what we found for less than $100 at
Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park and Fallbrook Mall in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sears: Two very wearable choices. In the women's department,
they have pink (or baby blue) ball-gown skirts in iridescent
organza by Apostrophe for $24, and matching beaded sweaters (long
sleeves or shells) for $20.40.
</P>
<P>
   In the junior department, near all the embroidered jeans, is a
billowy black tulle-covered skirt for $30, paired with a silver
lame halter top (the trendy backless type) for $16.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was the shoe department, where there is a huge variety
of evening sandals, but the most fashion-forward are a pair of
medium-heeled slides with a choice of silver, black or plum
sparkles for $38.
</P>
<P>
   Evening-bag styles were limited here _ but inexpensive. A shiny
silver clutch was $10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rampage: This is a junior-minded store for smaller sizes, but
you'll find the hipster version of the ball-gown skirt in crinkled
organza in the top three colors of gunmetal, garnet and white.
They're $38 each and looked fab with a silver knit halter top for
$26.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes and purses for black-tie galas weren't on hand, but we
found gunmetal and garnet lace stoles with heavy fringe for only
$24 each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cathy Jean: This is cheap-chic headquarters for shoes, and we
zeroed in on a pair of killer high-heeled sandals in a choice of
silver, black, red or garnet for $59.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forever 21: We spotted a huge selection of the season's
must-have skirt, but the pink iridescent organza number was the
best, especially when teamed with a slightly darker pink sequin
tube top. Skirt, $27; top, $20.
</P>
<P>
   Party shoes were the clunky variety that teens adore, priced at
$16 each in basic black.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlotte Russe: Lots of glam gowns for bigger budgets, but
way in the back we spotted a pinkish red crinkle-taffeta ball gown
skirt that comes with its own black velvet tank top for $79. Unlike
the other skirts we scouted, this style has an elastic waist, which
could add a few inches to one's figure. On the other hand, it could
prove more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are basic black with a bit of silver glitter in hefty
platform styles, priced at $28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montgomery Ward: There's not much of a party mood here, but
the women's department has a tasteful ball-gown skirt in black
organza that's accented with tiny embroidered flowers and pearls
near the hemline. And there's a matching V-necked sleeveless shell
top in white or garnet. Each was $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ JC Penney Outlet: No Cinderella skirts, but some nifty
2000-themed black velvet evening bags with embroidered champagne
glasses for $19.99 and matching pumps for $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Image: At this shoe store, we found very bare high-heeled
sandals in silver with a sassy ankle strap. Priced at $28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Payless Shoes: More strappy evening sandals with a rhinestone
accent on the toe for $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fashion Mania: It's a stretch to call them ball-gown skirts
when they're really more A-line, but the black iridescent skirts
were a bargain at $13.99. Silvery tie-back tops for super slim
figures were only $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Claire's Boutique: This accessory shop has lots of rhinestone
and crystal bead costume jewelry, but the hottest seller for the
holidays is large rhinestones to be snapped or twisted into the
hair for $6. Few are wearing long gloves this year, but this store
has them for $15.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mervyn's: No ball gowns or full skirts, but the shoes and
handbags were very luxe-looking for the price. Best designer
knockoffs were a pair of elegant silver sequin sandals by Hillard &AMP;
Hanson for $38, and a garnet-colored evening bag in iridescent
organza with a crystal-beaded handle. The bag, which is large
enough to hold a small wallet or a pair of glasses, was priced at
$14.39.
</P>
<P>
   Other bargains at Mervyn's included organza stoles in silver for
$19.99, and rhinestone tiaras for $6. &QL;

THE TOP 10 ARTS EVENTS OF THE CENTURY: THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Theater
</P>
<P>
   1901: George M. Cohan, a 23-year-old singer and hoofer appearing
with his parents and sister as the Four Cohans, expanded a
vaudeville skit into a full musical comedy. Audiences liked it, so
Cohan wrote more _ and became American musical comedy's first
superstar. Among his hits still performed are ``Give My Regards to
Broadway'' and ``You're a Grand Old Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   1912: Ten-year-old Robert Meredith Reiniger watches as an
itinerant salesman of band instruments beguiles a crowd in his
hometown of Mason City, Iowa. The youngster grows up, goes into
radio and changes his name to Meredith Willson. At age 55, he turns
his childhood memory into ``The Music Man,'' which ranks high among
classic American musicals.
</P>
<P>
   1916: Eugene O'Neill, the underachieving son of a famous actor,
joins the Provincetown Players and begins writing plays. He will
become America's first internationally acclaimed dramatist and,
arguably, its greatest playwright. His works include ``Anna
Christie, Mourning Becomes Electra, The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   1919: Actress Helen Westley and other members of the defunct
Washington Square Players in New York City form the Theatre Guild,
perhaps the most intellectually and artistically committed
production organization in the history of American theater. The
Guild is credited with developing the season ticket.
</P>
<P>
   1922: Actor Alfred Lunt and actress Lynn Fontanne marry,
beginning an onstage collaboration that will span 35 years and
establish them as the first couple of American theater. Lunt died
in 1977, Fontanne in 1983. They are largely unknown today.
</P>
<P>
   1927: ``The Jazz Singer'' ushers in the age of talking motion
pictures. New York stage actors flock to Hollywood, eager to
replace silent-movie stars thought to have inadequate voices. The
silent screen had already influenced the stage, as scenic and
lighting designers emulated the techniques of the camera. (A 1914
play, ``On Trial,'' was the first stage work to employ the
flashback, a popular movie device.)
</P>
<P>
   1935: The Federal Theatre Project is established as part of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal agency the Works
Progress Administration. The Federal Theatre Project provided jobs
for writers, performers and designers during the Depression. Orson
Welles, John Houseman and Elmer Rice were among the East Coast
participants. Margo Jones was assistant director of the Houston
branch. Congress abolished the Federal Theatre Project in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   1943: Composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II
team up following the death of Rodgers' longtime partner, Lorenz
Hart. The first Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein show is ``Oklahoma!'' It
transforms American musical theater with its merging of song, story
and dance and begins a string of R&AMP;H hits _ among them ``Carousel,
South Pacific'' and ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   1947: Margo Jones opens Theatre '47 in Dallas. She becomes a
champion of new playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Jerome
Lawrence, Robert E. Lee and William Inge. To demonstrate her
commitment to fresh works, Jones ``renamed'' her playhouse
annually. It was host to premiere stagings of ``Summer and Smoke''
and ``Inherit the Wind,'' among others. Jones died in 1955. Her
theater survived for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   1950: Sen. Joseph McCarthy begins his infamous investigation of
communist influences in government and show business. His
persecution of actors, writers and directors wrecked many stage and
film careers.

TRIBUTES TO THOMAS NAST, KINGMAKER CARTOONIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(af) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, political cartoonists were regarded as hired
hacks. Illustrators did the job of today's paparazzi, targets of
caricature were selected for their moneymaking potential, and
editorial cartoonists would take on the coloration of their
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Nast was different. The man who gave Republicans their
elephant, Democrats their donkey, Santa Claus his modern girth and
William Marcy Tweed his walking papers was a passionate and often
pestering loyalist to his ideals _ including the Union,
Republicanism and anti-racism.
</P>
<P>
   With the influential Harper's Weekly as his public gallery, he
dominated his art form during the Civil War and Reconstruction
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, two especially prolific Nast sites on the Internet
are creations by admiring cartoonists.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Nast home page
(www.buffnet.net/starmist/nast/main.htm) credits a 1974 Dover
Publications collection for much of its extensive online material.
It has a main biography and separate sections on Nast's Civil War
work, his role in bringing down the corrupt Tweed ring in New York
City, his concern for the rights of blacks, American Indians and
Chinese immigrants, and his Santa Claus illustrations. There are
scores of Nast drawings posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created by Joel A. Coughlin, 26, an aspiring
newspaper cartoonist in Buffalo who became a fan of Nast's in high
school. ``I was instantly attracted to his wicked sense of humor
and his beautiful style of drawing,'' Coughlin wrote in an e-mail
message.
</P>
<P>
   Nast's popular images of Santa Claus are a special attraction on
the site. ``Before Nast created his version, St. Nicholas had been
pictured as everything from a stern patriarch in bishop's robes to
a gnomelike creature in a frock coat and pantaloons,'' Coughlin
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nast was born in Germany in 1840 and came to America at age 6.
He had to drop out of art school at 15 to help support his family,
and he got an illustrator's job with Frank Leslie's Illustrated
Newspaper, where he began attacking official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   He also traveled to cover popular subjects like European
prizefights and Garibaldi's struggle for Italian unification before
focusing on Civil War illustrations. His allegorical drawings for
Harper's Weekly, which he joined early in 1862, aroused Northern
patriotic fervor and made him a nationally known figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 25 years following the close of the war, Nast's
cartoons expressed the artist's views on every national issue of
political and social significance,'' the site notes. ``They were,
in fact, an illustrated chronicle of American history during this
period. Every presidential candidate whom he supported was elected
and his successful campaign in 1870-71 to depose the corrupt `Boss'
Tweed of Tammany Hall in New York City added to his fame.''
</P>
<P>
   For a look at Nast's and other Harper's Weekly illustrations
from 1876 to 1880, there is a richly illustrated site, Images of
American Cultures in the 1870s
(www.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is182/assignment7hp.html), by
Professor Mary Kay Duggan at the University of California at
Berkeley. It was designed for a course, Print, Literacy and Power:
To 1900, about the impact of print on society.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Perhaps the richest online trove of Nast lore comes from
Draper Hill, the political cartoonist and the historian for the
Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. The association's
online History Corner is at www.detnews.com/AAEC/history.html and
includes several articles on Nast by Hill, who is working on a
biography of Nast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nast Comes to the Aid of Fort Sumter'' deals with Nast's
fanciful, pre-Harper's Weekly speculations on relieving the
besieged fort with balloon airlifts. In ``Thomas Nast's
Difficulties Covering the First Presidential Impeachment,'' Hill
chronicles the ironic panoramas Nast had prepared to illustrate
what he had expected to be the conviction and removal of President
Andrew Johnson, whose perceived Southern sympathy was hated by Nast
as much as Johnson's imminent successor, Ulysses S. Grant, was
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson escaped removal by one vote, and some of Nast's
anti-Johnson cartoons were never published in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nast, only 27 at the time of the impeachment controversy, was
already saluted as the most important master of his craft yet to
have emerged in the United States, a position he still holds in
1999,'' Hill writes.
</P>
<P>
   Nast's hero, Grant, has his own home page, and one of its
chapters, www.mscomm.com/ulysses/page136.html, details the close
friendship between the cartoonist and the general. The site
includes a quote from President Grant in 1869: ``Two things elected
me. The sword of Sheridan and the pencil of Nast.''

TUEXEDOS MAKE A Y2K STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: with sidebar FASHION-MILLENNIUM-CHEAP) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the biggest party of the century.
</P>
<P>
   So what are you wearing on New Year's Eve?
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, fashion friends, it's glittery, glamorous and
drop-dead stunning, or you'll look so last year at this year's
round of parties. Trust us, a party hat and feather boa are no way
to ring in Y2K. But you're on the right track, because party
invitations are likely to stress black-tie dress codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much excitement about the new millennium, that
people who haven't ever dressed up are going to this New Year's
Eve,'' says Leon Hall, spokesman for the Fashion Association and
co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency.'' According to Hall, ``Excess
is good, and corsages are in again ... as long as they're pinned on
a purse instead of a gown. And so are really big tiaras.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermodel Emme, who's his co-host and also the spokeswoman for
Revlon's ColorStay cosmetics, is equally adamant about partying
with panache. ``You want to shine, whether it's glimmer on your
brow or a totally gaudy outfit, with a silver-sequined gown that
says 2000 on the chest. With matching shoes and purse,'' she says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K fashion jokes aside, this is a fashion maven's chance to
wear more than a little black dress or traditional tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Hall says the ivory shawl-collared dinner jacket associated with
the film ``Casablanca'' is very hip again.
</P>
<P>
   June Rau, fashion director for Nordstrom stores, says, ``We're
selling more tuxedos than in past years. And that includes velvet
and paisley smoking jackets and long silver ties instead of basic
black bow ties.'' She adds that many customers are freshening up
their tuxedos with silver vests instead of cummerbunds.
</P>
<P>
   At Gary's Tuxedo shop at Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks,
salesman Nir Solomon reports business is better than ever, and he's
been surprised by how many customers are requesting top hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuxedos, especially two-button styles, are selling
well,''according to Robinsons-May fashion director Milinda Martin.
``But dressy black suits are what's newest for us. They're a hit
with younger men, who are wearing them in a single-breasted,
four-button design with dress shirts but not necessarily a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   JC Penney stores aren't known for formalwear, but this year
they've got tuxedos. According to spokesman Tim Lyons, ``In
anticipation of the New Year's Eve party fever, we have opened
tuxedo shops in numerous stores, offering three styles.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy a tuxedo at Mervyn's, but menswear spokesman Mark
Nawrocki reports customers are snapping up their satin microfiber
shirts (think John Travolta in the '70s) to wear with tuxedo pants.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the men's fashion report.
</P>
<P>
   Women are dressing up and splurging on all the accessories
they've passed on in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footwear is a big deal,'' says Nordstrom's Rau. ``Women are
buying all types of decorative shoes that could qualify as foot
jewelry. Our best sellers are open-toed sandals with sparkles, and,
of course, high heels. The colors _ titanium, gunmetal gray and
lots of red.''
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's womenswear expert Nicolle Dougherty agrees that it's an
accessory year, reporting that small beaded bags and wraps in
velvet with beaded trims are Mervyn's biggest sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Gowns, wraps, bags and shoes are all a-glitter with glass beads
or pricey Swarovski crystals, but real diamonds _ what Emme calls
``Big Mama diamonds''_ are the ultimate accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've got the ensemble together, women are wrapping it
all up with stoles fringed in bohemian splendor. Huge rectangles
and triangles drip with fringe and beaded fringe, says Robinson's
Martin. According to her, they're a fashion-forward alternative to
pashmina stoles and much fresher than a feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   About the beads. Kevan Hall, who has dressed Sarah Michelle
Gellar and numerous other stars for the Oscars, says crystal beads
are so much more elegant than sequins, especially under the lights.
But he thinks metallic fabrics (especially silver) and anything
iridescent are worthy of New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the ball gown for clock-watching Cinderellas.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers report it's the No. 1 choice, the billowy excess that
Hall was talking about. Really full ball gown skirts (or simply
referred to as ball skirts), topped with midriff-baring tops, tight
sweaters or spaghetti-strapped bodices can be interchanged for
maximum versatility. It's a sportswear inspiration, says
Robinson-May's fashion director, that's finally caught on in the
social-occasion department.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not an iridescent taffeta ball gown, the silhouette is
slinky and provocative like the gowns Marilyn Monroe was sewn into.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look favored by a lot of Hollywood types who have the
figure, like curvy Terri J. Vaughn of WB's ``The Steve Harvey
Show.'' For her intimate New Year's Eve dinner party at her Burbank
home, she'll be playing hostess in a silvery Versace gown with a
low back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sexy,'' says her rapper husband Derrick Carolina,
who will be wearing a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's had a lot of practice wearing gowns in beauty
pageants and at show-biz galas, Vaughn says the secret to carrying
off a glamorous gown is feeling glamorous inside. ``You've got to
feel confident, and not be worried about it being too tight or the
straps falling off,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more thing. Think about coordinating your ensembles.
Remember the prom, when you both wore the same color?
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest trend, say the experts. But pass on the
carnation boutonniere, unless the party's in ``Pleasantville.'' &QL;

THE TOP 10 ARTS EVENTS OF THE CENTURY: THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Till year's end, the Star-Telegram brings you a
subjective look at the top 10 moments of the century in the arts.
Today: Theater
</P>
<P>
   1901: George M. Cohan, a 23-year-old singer and hoofer appearing
with his parents and sister as the Four Cohans, expanded a
vaudeville skit into a full musical comedy. Audiences liked it, so
Cohan wrote more _ and became American musical comedy's first
superstar. Among his hits still performed are ``Give My Regards to
Broadway'' and ``You're a Grand Old Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   1912: Ten-year-old Robert Meredith Reiniger watches as an
itinerant salesman of band instruments beguiles a crowd in his
hometown of Mason City, Iowa. The youngster grows up, goes into
radio and changes his name to Meredith Willson. At age 55, he turns
his childhood memory into ``The Music Man,'' which ranks high among
classic American musicals.
</P>
<P>
   1916: Eugene O'Neill, the underachieving son of a famous actor,
joins the Provincetown Players and begins writing plays. He will
become America's first internationally acclaimed dramatist and,
arguably, its greatest playwright. His works include ``Anna
Christie, Mourning Becomes Electra, The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   1919: Actress Helen Westley and other members of the defunct
Washington Square Players in New York City form the Theatre Guild,
perhaps the most intellectually and artistically committed
production organization in the history of American theater. The
Guild is credited with developing the season ticket.
</P>
<P>
   1922: Actor Alfred Lunt and actress Lynn Fontanne marry,
beginning an onstage collaboration that will span 35 years and
establish them as the first couple of American theater. Lunt died
in 1977, Fontanne in 1983. They are largely unknown today.
</P>
<P>
   1927: ``The Jazz Singer'' ushers in the age of talking motion
pictures. New York stage actors flock to Hollywood, eager to
replace silent-movie stars thought to have inadequate voices. The
silent screen had already influenced the stage, as scenic and
lighting designers emulated the techniques of the camera. (A 1914
play, ``On Trial,'' was the first stage work to employ the
flashback, a popular movie device.)
</P>
<P>
   1935: The Federal Theatre Project is established as part of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal agency the Works
Progress Administration. The Federal Theatre Project provided jobs
for writers, performers and designers during the Depression. Orson
Welles, John Houseman and Elmer Rice were among the East Coast
participants. Margo Jones was assistant director of the Houston
branch. Congress abolished the Federal Theatre Project in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   1943: Composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II
team up following the death of Rodgers' longtime partner, Lorenz
Hart. The first Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein show is ``Oklahoma!'' It
transforms American musical theater with its merging of song, story
and dance and begins a string of R&AMP;H hits _ among them ``Carousel,
South Pacific'' and ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   1947: Margo Jones opens Theatre '47 in Dallas. She becomes a
champion of new playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Jerome
Lawrence, Robert E. Lee and William Inge. To demonstrate her
commitment to fresh works, Jones ``renamed'' her playhouse
annually. It was host to premiere stagings of ``Summer and Smoke''
and ``Inherit the Wind,'' among others. Jones died in 1955. Her
theater survived for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   1950: Sen. Joseph McCarthy begins his infamous investigation of
communist influences in government and show business. His
persecution of actors, writers and directors wrecked many stage and
film careers.

   ``Assuming the Risk: The Mavericks, the Lawyers and the
Whistleblowers Who Beat Big Tobacco''
</P>
<P>
   by Michael Orey
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to provide an upbeat summation of ``Assuming the
Risk,'' Michael Orey's surprisingly lively litigation expose
delivered with surprising clarity and even some humor.
</P>
<P>
   It would have gone something like this: Torched by scruffy
whistle-blowers and lawyers with street-fighter instincts to would
put even novelist John Grisham's heroes to shame, Big Tobacco
finally goes up in smoke. I had my reasons, not the least of which
was Aunt Dale, who smoked heavily and died of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Orey's fine effort does establish the whistle-blowers' courage
as they bucked the multibillion-dollar industry, and some lawyers'
scrappiness and idealism and greed and generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a happy ending, at least to date, remains a hope rather
than an accomplishment. Legal realities are rarely so clean and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   You heard, perhaps, that the $368.5 billion settlement on
smoking-related Medicaid costs went up in legal smoke. It had been
a deal reached in 1997 between the tobacco industry and a team of
lawyers and attorneys general from 40 states. You probably know
that this litigation had initially flared up in Mississippi, and
that Texas' $3.3 billion settlement has been mired in a dispute
over the private lawyers' share.
</P>
<P>
   But did you know the legal roots of the claims for Medicaid
damages tied to smoking?
</P>
<P>
   Orey tells of the toe chomped on in a plug of chewing tobacco
that led to a legal-groundbreaking Mississippi Supreme Court
decision in a product-liability suit _ and delves into asbestos and
other product-liability history.
</P>
<P>
   In the toe case, the judges found in 1918: ``We can imagine no
reason why, with ordinary care, human toes could not be left out of
chewing tobacco, and if toes are found in chewing tobacco, it seems
to us that somebody has been very careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you recall the names of the lawyers and whistle-blowers at
the heart of this ongoing courtroom drama and out-of-court
bargaining?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Dick Scruggs and Don Barrett, the Southern lawyers
representing both whistle-blowers and cancer victims. Barrett and
Scruggs aimed to win, no matter what their personal costs.
</P>
<P>
   There was two-pack-a-day Nathan Henry Horton, whose smoking
habit would end with him choking to death on his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Merrell Williams, the frazzled paralegal researcher at
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., waddling past the cigarette
maker's security checkpoints. He was smuggling, often down in his
baggy pants, documents that incriminated all the major cigarette
makers in a cover-up of nicotine's hazards and their marketing
strategies to attract underage smokers.
</P>
<P>
   As his personal life and finances fell apart, Williams had to
find a way to reveal the documents to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Orey has given us a clear, concise and humanized account of what
could have been a dry recitation of legal issues and jargon.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes are a legal product. States have allowed and
profited from their sale. True, they could be addictive; true, the
industry had been deceptive. But using individual court cases to
resolve such a complex issue _ a legal product that causes grievous
harm to millions of people's health when used as intended _ makes
no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mississippi lawyers, Orey tells us, were the pioneers along
the legal trail leading to removal of Joe Camel from our public
scrutiny. Even now, as we see in current headlines, efforts have
resumed to reach another legal settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco remains the villain. The much-anticipated agreement
dissolved. But ``Assuming the Risk'' is much more than a tirade
against the absurdities of smoking and a morally corrupt industry.
If it remains a tale left incomplete by history, it is at least
informative and entertaining as it takes us up to the present.

DOWN-TO-EARTH ADVICE ON ENTERTAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolyne Roehm, the former fashion designer, made expensive
clothes for a limited audience of ladies who limo. Carolyne Roehm,
the author, is much more egalitarian. Her new ``Winter Notebook''
(Harper Collins, $25, hard cover) is about parties, planning,
gardening and entertaining. It is one of a series based on the
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   She has put her life's work into this compendium. She is the
girl from the Midwest who always wanted to wear a tiara. She is
Oscar de la Renta's enthusiastic assistant. She is the wife of
master-of-the-universe Henry Kravis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is no longer any of those people, yet she taps all of
them for her notebook. She shows us how to throw wonderful
Christmas parties and a New Year's Day lunch. She shows us how to
set the table and make the place cards and the centerpiece. Plus,
she shares her resources.
</P>
<P>
   Entire chapters are devoted to potato and soup recipes, and she
shares them like a good neighbor leaning over the backyard fence.
</P>
<P>
   She helps with the gift-giving chore _ shows us inventive
wrappings and then gives us a workbook page to list gifts,
recipients, mail-order resources, and who gets gratuities and how
much.
</P>
<P>
   Roehm is generous with her book; she shares the pages with her
readers, giving them room to record notes and personal
observations. Pockets are included on the end sheets so they can be
stuffed with clippings and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other authors of books of this nature, Roehm graciously
praises the people who helped her, listing them by name and
contribution. She also includes a list of resources and helpful Web
sites.

TWO FORT WORTH FAVORITES ROLL OUT MUSICAL MILESTONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas arrives early this year _ as in today.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After 26 years, Fort Worth's Space Opera has released its
second record, ``My Father's Bongos.'' Orders are being accepted
today on the band's Web site, www.spaceopera.net, and
vocalist/guitarist Scott Fraser says the CD will be available for
over-the-counter purchase at Record Town before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stylistically, it will sound like Space Opera in a '90s
context,'' says Fraser. Inspired by ``The Beatles Anthology''
television show and CD, he floated the idea of a reunion in 1997.
``We haven't tried to reinvent ourselves _ we evolved naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The band (Fraser, vocalist/guitarist David Bullock, bassist
Philip White and drummer Brett Wilson) played its first gig at The
HOP in Fort Worth in 1969 and became Cowtown's hottest band during
the early '70s, opening for Jethro Tull, Jefferson Airplane and
Johnny Winter and releasing an eponymous LP on CBS in 1973. The SO
sound was, and is, an artful, highly eclectic blend of influences,
from the Beatles to Frank Zappa to classical and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning reunion show at Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams in
December 1997 was the band's first in 17 years; keyboardist Jeff
Ward, who played that night, contributes to the CD, as does
woodwind player Jon Shipley. The bulk of ``Bongos'' was recorded in
May and August of this year at Eagle Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Caravan show, Fraser says, ``Bongos'' is one continuous
piece of music; there are 14 individual parts, and the connecting
thread is four verses of ``Awake, Awake,'' an ancient Scotch/Irish
poem.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser anticipates the band doing a concert within two months,
and says that there has been some interest in the new CD from two
labels, one in England, one in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our way of documenting ourselves and our continuing
dedication to being in a band regardless of any profit,'' he says.
``We realize we are not a capitalist enterprise. We just want to
make music as well as we can and make it available.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We know there are more than enough Christmas CDs out there, but
here's one you absolutely must get: ``Christmas in Cowtown,'' a
10-track collection featuring stalwart Cowtown bluesmen such as
Buddy Whittington, Holland K. Smith, Raleigh Smith, James Hinkle
and Johnny Guadarrama.
</P>
<P>
   The CD's daddy is Bobby Counts, the bassist who leads Count
Blue, which has held down a Thursday-night residency at the Keys
Lounge for two years.
</P>
<P>
   A friend suggested a homegrown yuletide blues collection in
August, and Counts immediately began calling old pals to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just came together,'' Counts says. ``I called
Holland, I called Dave, and every time I asked if they had a
Christmas song, they said, `Yeah, I got one for ya.' I feel like
I've been touched by heaven above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowtown'' was recorded every Tuesday from the middle of August
to the end of September at Sounds Great Production, and the result
is a funky, down-home CD.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Millsap does Clarence Carter's ``Back Door Santa,''
Whittington burns on Albert King's ``Santa Claus Wants Some
Lovin','' and Guadarrama chips in a delightful take on ``The
Christmas Song.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hinkle does a cool recitation of ``The Night Before
Christmas,'' Kenny Traylor tackles Freddie King's ``Christmas
Tears,'' and Raleigh Smith and Millsap combine for an acoustic
version of Lightnin' Hopkins' ``Merry Christmas.'' There are also
original songs by Counts and Holland K. Smith, and Patsy Green
doing ``Merry, Merry, Christmas, Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the first conglomeration Christmas CD to ever
come out of Cowtown _ I can't think of another one,'' says Counts,
who plays bass on nine of the 10 cuts. ``It all just fell in my
lap.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD is on sale at Record Town and Borders, and at all of
Millsap's and Count Blue's shows.
</P>
<P>
   And next year should see Volume Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna start after the first of the year,'' Counts says.
``I want everything finalized by the end of the summer. We're
thinking about making this a tradition.''

   ``Assuming the Risk: The Mavericks, the Lawyers and the
Whistleblowers Who Beat Big Tobacco''
</P>
<P>
   by Michael Orey
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to provide an upbeat summation of ``Assuming the
Risk,'' Michael Orey's surprisingly lively litigation expose
delivered with surprising clarity and even some humor.
</P>
<P>
   It would have gone something like this: Torched by scruffy
whistle-blowers and lawyers with street-fighter instincts to would
put even novelist John Grisham's heroes to shame, Big Tobacco
finally goes up in smoke. I had my reasons, not the least of which
was Aunt Dale, who smoked heavily and died of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Orey's fine effort does establish the whistle-blowers' courage
as they bucked the multibillion-dollar industry, and some lawyers'
scrappiness and idealism and greed and generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a happy ending, at least to date, remains a hope rather
than an accomplishment. Legal realities are rarely so clean and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   You heard, perhaps, that the $368.5 billion settlement on
smoking-related Medicaid costs went up in legal smoke. It had been
a deal reached in 1997 between the tobacco industry and a team of
lawyers and attorneys general from 40 states. You probably know
that this litigation had initially flared up in Mississippi, and
that Texas' $3.3 billion settlement has been mired in a dispute
over the private lawyers' share.
</P>
<P>
   But did you know the legal roots of the claims for Medicaid
damages tied to smoking?
</P>
<P>
   Orey tells of the toe chomped on in a plug of chewing tobacco
that led to a legal-groundbreaking Mississippi Supreme Court
decision in a product-liability suit _ and delves into asbestos and
other product-liability history.
</P>
<P>
   In the toe case, the judges found in 1918: ``We can imagine no
reason why, with ordinary care, human toes could not be left out of
chewing tobacco, and if toes are found in chewing tobacco, it seems
to us that somebody has been very careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you recall the names of the lawyers and whistle-blowers at
the heart of this ongoing courtroom drama and out-of-court
bargaining?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Dick Scruggs and Don Barrett, the Southern lawyers
representing both whistle-blowers and cancer victims. Barrett and
Scruggs aimed to win, no matter what their personal costs.
</P>
<P>
   There was two-pack-a-day Nathan Henry Horton, whose smoking
habit would end with him choking to death on his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Merrell Williams, the frazzled paralegal researcher at
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., waddling past the cigarette
maker's security checkpoints. He was smuggling, often down in his
baggy pants, documents that incriminated all the major cigarette
makers in a cover-up of nicotine's hazards and their marketing
strategies to attract underage smokers.
</P>
<P>
   As his personal life and finances fell apart, Williams had to
find a way to reveal the documents to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Orey has given us a clear, concise and humanized account of what
could have been a dry recitation of legal issues and jargon.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes are a legal product. States have allowed and
profited from their sale. True, they could be addictive; true, the
industry had been deceptive. But using individual court cases to
resolve such a complex issue _ a legal product that causes grievous
harm to millions of people's health when used as intended _ makes
no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mississippi lawyers, Orey tells us, were the pioneers along
the legal trail leading to removal of Joe Camel from our public
scrutiny. Even now, as we see in current headlines, efforts have
resumed to reach another legal settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco remains the villain. The much-anticipated agreement
dissolved. But ``Assuming the Risk'' is much more than a tirade
against the absurdities of smoking and a morally corrupt industry.
If it remains a tale left incomplete by history, it is at least
informative and entertaining as it takes us up to the present.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am building a raised wood deck in my backyard that will be
about 2 feet above the ground. The ground slopes quite a bit in
this yard, but I want the deck to be level. I don't have a very
long level that will go across the width of the deck, so I'm not
sure what is the best way to go about doing this. What can you
suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the simplest and most effective methods is to use a
long length of clear plastic tubing that is filled with water. Use
tubing that is 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter and long enough to go
from one end of the deck to the other, plus enough length to reach
up to a little above the top of the corner posts, as indicated in
the illustration. After filling this tube almost full with water,
have another person help you hold each end against opposite corner
posts (one downhill from the other). Then, mark the height of the
water that is in the tube on each post. Since water always seeks
its own level, the marks will be perfectly level with each other _
no matter how far apart they are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The two large springs that counterbalance my overhead garage
door and run along the top of the track on each side seem to have
lost much of their tension. They no longer hold the door in place
when it is partially open. Do these springs have to be replaced to
correct this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most doors with horizontal springs on each side there is a
steel cable attached to the end of the spring. This cable comes up
over a pulley attached to the frame above the door and has a hook
at the end that snaps into one of a series of holes in the bracket
attached to the door frame. When the coil spring loses some of its
tension all you need do is move the hook forward one or two holes,
thus stretching the spring tighter. If moving the hook to the last
hole isn't enough, then you can still increase tension by
disconnecting the hook from the end of the cable and then cutting
the cable shorter. (CAUTION: Before disconnecting the cable, prop
the door open with a heavy post to keep it from crashing down
accidentally.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house has radiant heating in the ceilings and we have a
continual problem with the ceiling plaster cracking. I am thinking
about covering the plaster ceilings with one of those heavy raised
wallpapers that I've seen in some older buildings, but I wonder if
this will cut down on the amount of heating coming through. What do
you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not quite sure what type of wallcovering you are
referring to, but it sounds as though this material would probably
reduce heat radiation from the ceiling. To make certain, I suggest
you contact the manufacturer of this wallcovering to see if they
can supply more accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The old paint used in my apartment many years ago apparently
had lead in it (I checked this with a kit available from a local
dealer). There are no children in our household and I plan to wear
protective goggles and a suitable respirator when I do some
sanding, but my wife is still concerned about health risks from
exposure to this lead when I do this sanding. Are there any
additional measures I can take when preparing these surfaces for
repainting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lead is a hazard mainly when it is ingested (that's why
children are at risk) or inhaled _ as when sanding. Wearing a
suitable respirator should be adequate protection and safety
goggles should always be worn while sanding, but don't do any more
sanding than necessary. Then prime with a lead-free paint before
applying your finish coats of paint.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weather pattern that has brought frequent surges of very
mild air from the Plains to the Northeast over the last few weeks
has begun to shift. Arctic air that has been locked in northern
Canada will be drawn toward the northern Mississippi Valley as jet
stream winds from the northwest become established over the center
of the continent. As a result, the coldest air of the season will
cover parts of the upper Middle West on Tuesday and Wednesday while
the temperatures in the Northeast gradually fall to seasonal
values.
</P>
<P>
   Mild air will linger near the Northeast Coast for one more day.
A front marking the leading edge of colder air will sweep off the
Atlantic seaboard Tuesday. Variable clouds and a few rain showers
will accompany the front. In the wake of the front, progressively
colder air will sweep over the Great Lakes. As the chill deepens
later Tuesday, locally heavy snow squalls will occur near the
southern and eastern shores of the lakes from Michigan to western
New York. Snow showers will also whiten portions of the northern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be mainly dry and cooler. Sunshine will be
plentiful in the interior. But high, thin clouds will streak across
the sky near the Gulf Coast. Thicker clouds and a few showers will
occur in extreme southern parts Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will occur near the path of low pressure streaking
southeast from the Dakotas to the northern Missouri River Valley.
Farther west, gusty winds from the west will deliver milder air
across the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dust Storm
</P>
<P>
   Visibility usually increases following the passage of a cold
front, but, on Tuesday, dust darkened the skies for several hours
in the wake of a front crossing southern Texas. Winds from the west
gusting over 40 mph combined with dry soil conditions from recent
drought to raise palls of dust that dropped visibility below one
mile in some areas near Austin, Texas, and San Antonio. After a few
hours, the winds subsided allowing the dust to settle. While
Monday's dust storm was relatively small, severe dust storms can be
reminiscent of a blizzard leaving drifts of dust several feet high.

<P>
   'Tis the season for cheap chic.
</P>
<P>
   When you've blown your budget on gifts for the family and don't
have the cash for a haute holiday ensemble, there's no need for a
Cinderella complex.
</P>
<P>
   You can kiss the old century goodbye and party into the new one
in the season's latest look _ the ball-gown skirt _ and all the
glittery trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   For under $100.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally you've got to lower your expectations a tad, unless
you stumble over a designer ball-gown skirt at Marshall's or T.J.
Maxx. And it (BEGIN ITAL)is(END ITAL) possible.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the countdown has begun, and you're in a hurry. So we
scouted around, and here's what we found for less than $100 at
Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park and Fallbrook Mall in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sears: Two very wearable choices. In the women's department,
they have pink (or baby blue) ball-gown skirts in iridescent
organza by Apostrophe for $24, and matching beaded sweaters (long
sleeves or shells) for $20.40.
</P>
<P>
   In the junior department, near all the embroidered jeans, is a
billowy black tulle-covered skirt for $30, paired with a silver
lame halter top (the trendy backless type) for $16.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was the shoe department, where there is a huge variety
of evening sandals, but the most fashion-forward are a pair of
medium-heeled slides with a choice of silver, black or plum
sparkles for $38.
</P>
<P>
   Evening-bag styles were limited here _ but inexpensive. A shiny
silver clutch was $10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rampage: This is a junior-minded store for smaller sizes, but
you'll find the hipster version of the ball-gown skirt in crinkled
organza in the top three colors of gunmetal, garnet and white.
They're $38 each and looked fab with a silver knit halter top for
$26.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes and purses for black-tie galas weren't on hand, but we
found gunmetal and garnet lace stoles with heavy fringe for only
$24 each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cathy Jean: This is cheap-chic headquarters for shoes, and we
zeroed in on a pair of killer high-heeled sandals in a choice of
silver, black, red or garnet for $59.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forever 21: We spotted a huge selection of the season's
must-have skirt, but the pink iridescent organza number was the
best, especially when teamed with a slightly darker pink sequin
tube top. Skirt, $27; top, $20.
</P>
<P>
   Party shoes were the clunky variety that teens adore, priced at
$16 each in basic black.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlotte Russe: Lots of glam gowns for bigger budgets, but
way in the back we spotted a pinkish red crinkle-taffeta ball gown
skirt that comes with its own black velvet tank top for $79. Unlike
the other skirts we scouted, this style has an elastic waist, which
could add a few inches to one's figure. On the other hand, it could
prove more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are basic black with a bit of silver glitter in hefty
platform styles, priced at $28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montgomery Ward: There's not much of a party mood here, but
the women's department has a tasteful ball-gown skirt in black
organza that's accented with tiny embroidered flowers and pearls
near the hemline. And there's a matching V-necked sleeveless shell
top in white or garnet. Each was $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ JC Penney Outlet: No Cinderella skirts, but some nifty
2000-themed black velvet evening bags with embroidered champagne
glasses for $19.99 and matching pumps for $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Image: At this shoe store, we found very bare high-heeled
sandals in silver with a sassy ankle strap. Priced at $28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Payless Shoes: More strappy evening sandals with a rhinestone
accent on the toe for $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fashion Mania: It's a stretch to call them ball-gown skirts
when they're really more A-line, but the black iridescent skirts
were a bargain at $13.99. Silvery tie-back tops for super slim
figures were only $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Claire's Boutique: This accessory shop has lots of rhinestone
and crystal bead costume jewelry, but the hottest seller for the
holidays is large rhinestones to be snapped or twisted into the
hair for $6. Few are wearing long gloves this year, but this store
has them for $15.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mervyn's: No ball gowns or full skirts, but the shoes and
handbags were very luxe-looking for the price. Best designer
knockoffs were a pair of elegant silver sequin sandals by Hillard &AMP;
Hanson for $38, and a garnet-colored evening bag in iridescent
organza with a crystal-beaded handle. The bag, which is large
enough to hold a small wallet or a pair of glasses, was priced at
$14.39.
</P>
<P>
   Other bargains at Mervyn's included organza stoles in silver for
$19.99, and rhinestone tiaras for $6. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the biggest party of the century.
</P>
<P>
   So what are you wearing on New Year's Eve?
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, fashion friends, it's glittery, glamorous and
drop-dead stunning, or you'll look so last year at this year's
round of parties. Trust us, a party hat and feather boa are no way
to ring in Y2K. But you're on the right track, because party
invitations are likely to stress black-tie dress codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much excitement about the new millennium, that
people who haven't ever dressed up are going to this New Year's
Eve,'' says Leon Hall, spokesman for the Fashion Association and
co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency.'' According to Hall, ``Excess
is good, and corsages are in again ... as long as they're pinned on
a purse instead of a gown. And so are really big tiaras.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermodel Emme, who's his co-host and also the spokeswoman for
Revlon's ColorStay cosmetics, is equally adamant about partying
with panache. ``You want to shine, whether it's glimmer on your
brow or a totally gaudy outfit, with a silver-sequined gown that
says 2000 on the chest. With matching shoes and purse,'' she says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K fashion jokes aside, this is a fashion maven's chance to
wear more than a little black dress or traditional tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Hall says the ivory shawl-collared dinner jacket associated with
the film ``Casablanca'' is very hip again.
</P>
<P>
   June Rau, fashion director for Nordstrom stores, says, ``We're
selling more tuxedos than in past years. And that includes velvet
and paisley smoking jackets and long silver ties instead of basic
black bow ties.'' She adds that many customers are freshening up
their tuxedos with silver vests instead of cummerbunds.
</P>
<P>
   At Gary's Tuxedo shop at Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks,
salesman Nir Solomon reports business is better than ever, and he's
been surprised by how many customers are requesting top hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuxedos, especially two-button styles, are selling
well,''according to Robinsons-May fashion director Milinda Martin.
``But dressy black suits are what's newest for us. They're a hit
with younger men, who are wearing them in a single-breasted,
four-button design with dress shirts but not necessarily a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   JC Penney stores aren't known for formalwear, but this year
they've got tuxedos. According to spokesman Tim Lyons, ``In
anticipation of the New Year's Eve party fever, we have opened
tuxedo shops in numerous stores, offering three styles.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy a tuxedo at Mervyn's, but menswear spokesman Mark
Nawrocki reports customers are snapping up their satin microfiber
shirts (think John Travolta in the '70s) to wear with tuxedo pants.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the men's fashion report.
</P>
<P>
   Women are dressing up and splurging on all the accessories
they've passed on in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footwear is a big deal,'' says Nordstrom's Rau. ``Women are
buying all types of decorative shoes that could qualify as foot
jewelry. Our best sellers are open-toed sandals with sparkles, and,
of course, high heels. The colors _ titanium, gunmetal gray and
lots of red.''
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn's womenswear expert Nicolle Dougherty agrees that it's an
accessory year, reporting that small beaded bags and wraps in
velvet with beaded trims are Mervyn's biggest sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Gowns, wraps, bags and shoes are all a-glitter with glass beads
or pricey Swarovski crystals, but real diamonds _ what Emme calls
``Big Mama diamonds''_ are the ultimate accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've got the ensemble together, women are wrapping it
all up with stoles fringed in bohemian splendor. Huge rectangles
and triangles drip with fringe and beaded fringe, says Robinson's
Martin. According to her, they're a fashion-forward alternative to
pashmina stoles and much fresher than a feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   About the beads. Kevan Hall, who has dressed Sarah Michelle
Gellar and numerous other stars for the Oscars, says crystal beads
are so much more elegant than sequins, especially under the lights.
But he thinks metallic fabrics (especially silver) and anything
iridescent are worthy of New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about the ball gown for clock-watching Cinderellas.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers report it's the No. 1 choice, the billowy excess that
Hall was talking about. Really full ball gown skirts (or simply
referred to as ball skirts), topped with midriff-baring tops, tight
sweaters or spaghetti-strapped bodices can be interchanged for
maximum versatility. It's a sportswear inspiration, says
Robinson-May's fashion director, that's finally caught on in the
social-occasion department.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not an iridescent taffeta ball gown, the silhouette is
slinky and provocative like the gowns Marilyn Monroe was sewn into.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look favored by a lot of Hollywood types who have the
figure, like curvy Terri J. Vaughn of WB's ``The Steve Harvey
Show.'' For her intimate New Year's Eve dinner party at her Burbank
home, she'll be playing hostess in a silvery Versace gown with a
low back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sexy,'' says her rapper husband Derrick Carolina,
who will be wearing a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's had a lot of practice wearing gowns in beauty
pageants and at show-biz galas, Vaughn says the secret to carrying
off a glamorous gown is feeling glamorous inside. ``You've got to
feel confident, and not be worried about it being too tight or the
straps falling off,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one more thing. Think about coordinating your ensembles.
Remember the prom, when you both wore the same color?
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest trend, say the experts. But pass on the
carnation boutonniere, unless the party's in ``Pleasantville.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Ammiano, who rode a populist campaign to win
the right to challenge Mayor Willie Brown in Tuesday's run-off
election, will never say he lost the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is still president of the governing Board of Supervisors
and a more recognized figure _ locally and nationally _ with his
unsuccessful bid for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano may be the most liberal of the 11 supervisors, but his
demonstrated ability to spark a movement of discontented voters
could mean he will wield more influence, especially as district
elections approach next November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown helped me get the limelight because I stood up to him,''
Ammiano said Tuesday night after getting 40 percent of the vote to
Brown's 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is very cruel,'' he continued. ``In two years people
will look at the mayor as a lame duck. ... The beauty for me is I'm
not out of office ... and I'm backed by a very energetic movement
that's concerned with more open government and really scrutinizing
the districts because the districts are where the independents come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano conceded at 12:15 a.m. Wednesday during at a nightclub
in the city's Mission neighborhood, where several thousand
supporters chanted ``2003,'' the year of the next mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my birthday, and I feel like I've given birth. I've given
birth,'' he said gesturing to the crowd. ``There is not a mayor who
won't listen to us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano turned 58 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the results, Ammiano has gained political stature and a
place in San Francisco history. He ran the city's first successful
mayoral write-in campaign, which he launched just three weeks
before the Nov. 2 general election. That effort helped him into a
second-place finish _ ahead of former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint
Reilly, the former political consultant who spent almost $4 million
on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And the attention Ammiano attracted has positioned him for a
re-election bid for the board in November 2000. Then, he said, he
would run for mayor again or maybe the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ammiano will have elevated political stature in this city as
the leader of a new progressive political force,'' said Rich
deletion, chairman of Political Science Department at San Francisco
State University.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-off campaign, Ammiano faced the former longtime
Assembly speaker who spent more than $3 million _ six times more
than Ammiano _ and benefited tremendously from millions of dollars
more in expenditures by independent groups. Businesses and the
state Democratic Party hammered Ammiano in mailers and television
advertising, particularly over tax increases he proposed in his
first year as a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's camp, however, doesn't concede that their candidate's
late start or lack of cash hurt him. Ammiano spent about $300,000
to Brown's $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you be more creative, more thoughtful and harder
working,'' said Ammiano campaign strategist Robert Holland.
</P>
<P>
   What really hurt Ammiano, according to political consultant and
Brown supporter Robert Barnes, was the supervisor's reliance on his
established base of support base on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Ammiano ran a citywide campaign,'' said
Barnes, a member of the Alice B. TKOs Lesbian and Gay Democratic
Club, which endorsed Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime political consultant David Looman, who did not work for
anyone in this race, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started from a very narrow base, largely white, liberal,
tenant base,'' Looman said. ``And his job obviously was to broaden
that out and broaden it very fast. Part of what got lost in the
miraculous accomplishment of his coming in second with a write-in
campaign is that he finished 28,000 votes behind the mayor. ...
People have been concentrating on how far he'd come and not how far
he had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If Looman had worked for Ammiano, he said he would have
emphasized trying to reach Asian-Americans, who make up 34 percent
of the city's nearly 735,000 residents and 18 percent of its
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the hammer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano also could have been hurt by history: San Francisco
rarely elects a supervisor as mayor (Dianne Feinstein, who now
represents California in the Senate, was the last in 1979.) And
voters don't like to change course during boom times, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ammiano had a more effective and compelling message to
renters, who are feeling insecure about the housing crisis,''
Barnes said. ``But renters also are part of the citywide community
... and Brown scored more points for showing he could be trusted
with the economy.''

 SHAPING CITIES: 3-D COMPUTER MODELS MAKE ARCHITECTS' IDEAS

 By NINA TEICHOLZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Rosen, an architect, first glimpsed the future of his
profession in an unlikely spot _ the video game arcade at a
nightclub. At the time, Rosen, who is the head of his own firm in
Philadelphia, was having trouble getting local approval for a
planned community he had designed in Chester County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was on his mind at the nightclub as he donned a
virtual-reality helmet to play the game Virtuosity, hunting
pterodactyls in a spare geometric environment. ``I thought, this is
a perfect visualization tool for architects,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen is part of a small cadre of architects who create
three-dimensional models of cities on computer screens, a technique
called urban simulation. It takes state-of-the-art virtual reality
techniques, many of them borrowed from military flight simulation
technology, and applies them to the basic business of urban
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The results are virtual cities: digital, three-dimensional
models of cities like Los Angeles, Washington, New York and New
Orleans. Rosen built a model of Philadelphia. ``People can't read
architectural drawings and they can't relate to models,'' Rosen
said. ``But I realized they found virtual-reality technology cool
and that maybe I could relate to clients that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the models are extremely detailed: a model of Los
Angeles created by Bill Jepson, director of the Urban Simulation
Laboratory at the University California at Los Angeles, is accurate
down to the graffiti on the buildings and the signs in store
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the sophistication of the program, viewers can
navigate through these models as they would through a video game,
flying over buildings, spinning 360 degrees and even changing
features of the landscape with a mouse click. Some of the models
are also ``smart'' _ that is, connected to a database. If you click
on a building, you can get information on the building's owner, the
principal tenants, even the current cost for each square foot.
</P>
<P>
   These models are already changing the way real estate developers
do business, said Michael Kwartler, director of the Environmental
Simulation Center in Manhattan. For example, he built a
three-dimensional model of a SoHo neighborhood for a developer
seeking to build a hotel there. ``We showed the model to the
community, let them fly around it and look at things from different
angles,'' Kwartler said, ``and we sailed through the public
hearing. After all, it's much easier to do urban planning by
consensus than by injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the not-so-distant future, the models should be so
sophisticated that you could wander through the virtual streets
looking for that little Italian restaurant you visited years ago,
recognize the window display and click on it to look at the menu or
perhaps make a reservation. Police and fire departments will
probably be able to set up virtual command centers in virtual
cities; critical information like floor plans and the locations of
fire hydrants and hose bibs could be updated easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just in the realm of imagination,'' Jepson said.
``We're pushing hard to develop these emergency response
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Jepson's laboratory is also building a virtual version of
ancient Rome. The purpose is primarily educational: faculty and
students could meet as avatars on Roman soil and perhaps get a
history lesson from an actor playing Julius Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Two people looking at the same blueprint may imagine the object
in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architects typically get fired in the middle of projects,''
said Joel Orr, an urban simulation consultant, ``usually because
the owner and architect think they have a shared assumption about
how something will look, which is not true.'' Virtual tools, he
added, ``permit a far greater opening of communication channels
between humans than has ever before been possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The first city to be simulated was an imaginary one, created at
UCLA in the 1970s. NASA had given the school a grant to develop
applications for the technology used to simulate the Apollo moon
missions. Until modeling became common in the industry, architects
would slide video cameras through physical models to try to capture
the pedestrian perspective. The heat of the lights caused all the
photographs to peel off the little model buildings, said a clearly
un-nostalgic Kwartler.
</P>
<P>
   Today, urban simulation technology is so persuasive that the
National Capital Planning Commission now requires architects to
submit three-dimensional computer models of all proposed projects
on Washington public land. These projects are then integrated into
the citywide model. ``It allows us to control what we're going to
see as opposed to what the applicant wants us to see,'' said
Michael Sherman, a community planner for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman used the example of the proposed World War II memorial
on the Washington Mall: ``We were able to evaluate the impact much
earlier on. We could see whether the views of the Lincoln Memorial
and other historical landmarks were blocked. It was very helpful to
see the memorial from the perspective of a pedestrian, which you
can't do with a physical model.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic tools for urban simulation are now within the reach of
most architects. While more photorealistic modeling still demands a
high-end Unix station costing at least $15,000, many architects can
do less sophisticated work on a Pentium-class PC with a $300
graphics card. Software is more expensive. The programs for
building a 3-D world (for example, Viz by Autodesk, MicroStation by
Bentley Systems and Creator by MultiGen-Paradigm) and for real-time
simulation (like Vega and GameGen by MultiGen-Paradigm) add up to
about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   That money can save on costly construction fiascos. Before
ground was ever broken on the mammoth Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas,
for example, the developer made hundreds of changes based on
reactions to the virtual model. In Philadelphia, developers of a
new baseball stadium for the Phillies averted a minor disaster by
consulting a virtual model built by Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When we built the model and got down onto the field and looked
toward the sky, we realized that the huge scoreboard hid a piece of
the city skyline,'' Rosen said. So he moved the stadium over 40
feet and rotated it so that the developers had the design and view
they wanted. ``There was no other way to visualize that problem
until the stadium was built,'' he said. ``By then it would have
been too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual modeling is also aiding in the laborious search for
rooftop or office space. When Chase Manhattan Bank was looking for
20,000 square feet of space recently, it went to Urban Data
Solutions, a firm that has built a model, accurate to within a
meter, of most of New York City. Telecommunication companies have
hired Urban Data to scout out rooftop locations for their antennas
and receivers. Standing atop any virtual building, a viewer can see
if other buildings will block signal sight lines. Urban Data
president Andrew Lerner said he planned to use his mod
emergency personnel training and maybe even for virtual backdrops
for movies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the field's most innovative work is being done by New
York's Environment Simulation Center. Kwartler has developed
modeling software that works on a Pentium-class PC with an
inexpensive graphics card, thereby enabling communities to do
planning on their own. The software is like a 19th-century pattern
book, with a kit of parts _ houses, garages, trees, streets _ that
a town planner can use to paste together various development
schemes. Each element is ``smart,'' so when a new set of houses is
placed on a street, the software immediately calculates the
additional tax revenue versus the new cost of road and utility
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The model can even make sophisticated predictions about
outcomes. Build an upscale mall in your town, for example, and the
software will project what kinds of people might shop there, how
much money the mall might generate, and so on. Build a low-end
mall, and the model will assume that some nearby homeowners would
move out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a kind of accountability,'' Kwartler said. ``You
can't be seduced by someone's perhaps overly optimistic vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The town Kwartler has modeled most extensively is Ascutney, Vt.,
(population: 1,000), which is considering several ways to develop
its tiny downtown. Kwartler's group presented its simulated models
during the summer. ``It was like someone flipped on a light switch
in the room,'' said Gary Smith, a consultant who is gathering data
for the project. ``People who would barely talk to each other
because they couldn't agree on where to build new roads suddenly
had at least a willingness to explore more.''
</P>
<P>
   For the architects and developers accustomed to controlling what
people see, these advances can be threatening. ``Normally, an
architect goes to a meeting with three drawings _ each of them a
very manipulative view that's favorable to the developer,''
Kwartler said. But modeling technology levels the playing field; a
client can visualize just as well as an architect. ``Architects
find this technology very uncomfortable,'' said Sherman at the
National Capital Planning Commission. ``We're running into a lot of
resistance because they don't want to give the government their 3-D
files. They don't want to lose control of what's seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say computer models fail to capture the tactile
quality of a development landscape. ``I get the criticism we even
make all the ugly stuff look good,'' Kwartler said. The limited
power behind most models means that they can't show every gritty
detail _ cabs honking, trash cans overflowing, power lines. ``If
you saw a model I did of Chinatown,'' Kwartler said, ``absent all
its hustle and bustle, and then you went to the real place, you'd
be totally shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen blames high expectations among viewers of the technology
for some of the criticism. ``They've come to want the photorealism
of `Toy Story' and `Jurassic Park,''' he said. ``That's just too
expensive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But three-dimensional modeling is a giant step toward allowing
cities and towns to have meaningful conversations about aesthetics.
The whole point, Kwartler said, is to avoid the experience of
someone saying, ``Gee, I didn't know it would look like this!''

HUBBLE TELESCOPE TO GET BILLION-MILE TUNEUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the world's best-known astronomical observatory, the
orbiting Hubble Space Telescope is no stranger to NASA's
spacewalking repairmen.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, for the third time since the telescope was
launched in 1990, an expedition of shuttle astronauts will set out
to grab the observatory from its perch in space. Their objective is
to replace a half-dozen gyroscopes, key components in the
telescope's pointing system, and to make other repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long telescope is the only unmanned spacecraft NASA
has developed that was designed for periodic visits by astronauts,
to upgrade large cameras and other scientific instruments and to
replace worn-out parts.
</P>
<P>
   A gyroscope failure, the fourth since the last repair mission,
forced astronomers to halt observations with the telescope Nov. 13,
lending new urgency to the much-delayed shuttle flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These gyros in Hubble are the most accurate ever produced,''
said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science.
``They are required to get the kind of science we get from Hubble.
Without those gyros, those stars would be just fuzzy points of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Liftoff is scheduled for 9:18 p.m. EST Thursday from Cape
Canaveral, Fla. If Discovery takes off, the seven astronauts plan
to gently grab the 13-ton telescope with Discovery's 50-foot robot
arm and berth it upright in the shuttle's cargo bay for the repair
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   During four lengthy spacewalks, alternating teams of astronauts
will install new gyros and a faster flight computer, and replace
both an out-of-date recorder used to store images and a broken
transmitter used to relay those images to EarthAs time permits, the spacewalkers will patch parts of Hubble's
external covering damaged by solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble is the best example ever of the successful marriage
of the human space program and space science,'' said Weiler.
</P>
<P>
   During their first postlaunch repair mission in 1993, shuttle
astronauts corrected an embarrassing optical flaw that escaped
NASA's detection before the telescope was launched. They visited
again in early 1997 to upgrade its observing powers with new
cameras and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, NASA's repair strategy enabled it to extend the
observatory's operational life to 2010, five years beyond the
original plan and long enough to permit the development of an even
more capable successor.
</P>
<P>
   The extension will push NASA's total Hubble investment to nearly
$6 billion. The space agency estimates the cost of Discovery's
10-day flight at $205 million, including expenses for the telescope
repairs. However, the cost is nearly $400 million if a 1998 NASA
consultant's estimate for the cost of a shuttle flight is applied.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 13,000 observations to date, the space telescope has
made remarkable discoveries. It has enabled astronomers to refine
their estimates of the age of the universe at 12 billion years and
to calculate with more certainty that the cosmos will expand
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Recent images reveal dust discs swirling around a collection of
two dozen young stars, a prelude to the formation of planets,
astronomers believe. Working with other space- and ground-based
observatories, the Hubble has gathered much-sought evidence that
puzzling periodic gamma ray bursts occur in the fringes of the
universe, rather than within the Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   NASA announced the shuttle's latest service call in March to
stem the succession of gyro failures. At the time, only three of
the devices were still functioning, the minimal number needed for
cosmic observations.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning at 19,200 revolutions per minute, the gyros hold the
large telescope steady so that it can stare at faint stellar
targets for lengthy periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its astronaut-friendly design, the telescope is
considered a fragile instrument that must be handled with care to
prevent its precision optics from becoming contaminated or
misaligned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch with your heart in your mouth basically,'' said
NASA's Anne Kinney, a longtime Hubble astronomer who recalled her
anxiety in 1993 as astronauts wormed their way into the close
quarters of the telescope's primary instrument bay. ``It was
incredibly nerve-racking.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasks require intense training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very aware that Hubble is worth a lot of money and
incredibly important to a lot of people,'' said Discovery astronaut
Steve Smith. His three Hubble spacewalks during the February 1997
mission qualified him to lead Discovery's four-man spacewalk team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall trying to look calm but being a little nervous the
whole time,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we worry about making a mistake,'' he said.
``Postflight, I remember my wife saying I seemed like a new person.
It's because that great concern and weight had been lifted from my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacewalkers Mike Foale, John Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier
were selected in July 1998 to join Smith for the latest Hubble
repair work. Most of their training has involved donning bulky
spacesuits to rehearse the repairs in the Neutral Buoyancy
Laboratory, the large diving tank operated by NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston to prepare astronauts for International Space
Station assembly missions.
</P>
<P>
   The buoyancy of the water simulates the weightlessness the
astronauts will experience as they work in Earth orbit. The four
spacewalkers will have logged 44 sessions totaling more than 260
hours in the pool before they lift off.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Smith's squad was selected, the space agency
anticipated a May 2000 flight. A record six mission spacewalks were
envisioned with the four men working in pairs on alternate
excursions. As a third gyroscope faltered in January, NASA altered
its plan, accelerating the most vital work to Discovery's upcoming
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of a new camera and a cooling system for one of
the other instruments has been deferred until a mid-2001 shuttle
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, NASA plans to dispatch a shuttle crew to Hubble for
the last time in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a look at every piece of hardware up there and
see what should be replaced,'' Weiler said of preparations for the
last visit before the 2010 decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the best job we can to keep this thing going,''
Weiler said. ``After 2003, there will be no other servicing
missions. What we have is what we have.''

ORGANIZATION, MONEY AIDED BROWN'S RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS and CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown's huge financial advantage
and his vaunted political field operation combined to turn out
three voters for every two who supported Board of Supervisors
President Tom Ammiano in the San Francisco run-off election
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the turnout and interviews with voters and
political experts showed that the mayor won a landslide, with
nearly 60 percent of the vote, because his aggressive
get-out-the-vote effort got both Brown's core supporters and many
backers of erstwhile candidates Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods where Brown ran strongest in the Nov. 2
general election, voter turnout increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign had organized extensive get-out-the-vote
efforts. Meanwhile, in the neighborhoods where the Ammiano write-in
campaign had the most traction six weeks ago, turnout appeared to
have increased only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano won a spot in the run-off race with an unprecedented
write-in campaign in the November election, defeating Reilly and
Jordan, a former mayor, who out-campaigned and out-spent the city
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But in parts of the city where the campaigns of Jordan and
Reilly, who endorsed Ammiano, ran strongest in November, voter
turnout was up more than 7 percent, and there were indications
Brown was the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign had targeted conservative voters in those
neighborhoods. And the San Franciscans for Sensible Government, a
pro-Brown committee formed by downtown business interests, had
mounted a major effort to rally Asian-American voters to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Brown and Ammiano are Democrats, the mayor is
viewed as slightly less liberal and friendlier to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Brown spent more than $3 million on his re-election, six
times what Ammiano spent. The incumbent's re-election also was
boosted by independent committees run by business and political
organizations. They may have spent as much as $2 million
electioneering for the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, executive director of the Chinese-American Voters
Education Committee, said there were other signs the Brown campaign
had connected with those voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one precinct, we saw half of the absentee voters had
Chinese surnames,'' he said. ``That told us that the independent
expenditure campaign, the sensible government committee, had
worked, because they spent funds specifically'' to persuade
Asian-American voters to cast absentee votes for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his organization had spent much of election day
tracking the get-out-the-vote effort at key precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went, Lee said, he saw Brown campaign workers
checking voter lists and going door to door to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's forces were far less in evidence, he said. That
suggested that Ammiano's low-budget campaign simply could not match
Brown's election-day blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Election-day interviews indicated that many swing voters were
breaking for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nelson, 54, a lawyer and homeowner, said that with Jordan
out of the race, it was vital to support Brown's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to the economy of this city,'' Nelson
said. ``I think Tom Ammiano would be bad for business and I think
people in this neighborhood would be taxed unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews indicated that only in the Castro District did
Ammiano clearly beat Brown. In a neighborhood where voters went to
the polls to elect the country's first openly gay mayor, a vote for
Ammiano was almost like voting for kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a personal connection,'' Ed Buckley, 43, said as he
left a polling station on Sharon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, like Ammiano earlier in his career, is a teacher in the
San Francisco Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend. I like Willie, too. He's a great guy. But, with
things going well, this is the time to take a chance on something
different.''

SWEPT AWAY BY A WRITER ON THE STORM

<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in
History''
</P>
<P>
   by Erik Larson
</P>
<P>
   History
</P>
<P>
   Crown, $25
</P>
<P>
   First things first: ``Isaac's Storm,'' by Erik Larson, is not
``A Perfect Storm,'' by Sebastian Junger. The latter described the
so-called 1991 Halloween Gale in the North Atlantic, which
destroyed a fishing vessel in its fury. ``Isaac's Storm'' is about
the awful hurricane that struck Galveston on Sept. 8, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac'' in the title refers to Isaac Cline, a Texas-based
member of the National Weather Service, who ignored panicked
reports from Cuba and assured Galveston residents that the storm
wouldn't really be that bad. As the book's promotional materials
point out, Cline paid dearly for his mistake. (I won't spoil the
sad surprise by telling you more.)
</P>
<P>
   Mistaken experts and their woolly-brained intransigence have
provided the basis for many books. Larson could have crafted a
reasonably interesting book focusing on Isaac Cline, but he went
well beyond the obvious _ and that is what makes ``Isaac's Storm''
so wonderful, although its subject matter is so deeply tragic.
</P>
<P>
   The monster hurricane that came close to destroying Galveston
killed between 6,000 and 10,000 people _ more than the Johnstown
Flood and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake combined _ and Larson
makes us feel nature's wrath on every page.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the author's description of the hurricane's approach on
one home:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some water on (the) first floor was over nine feet deep. The
wind tore the house like an immense crowbar. The ridge of debris
came closer and closer, destroying homes south and east and casting
(debris) against his walls ... he did not know, however, that the
ridge of debris was now pushing before it a segment of streetcar
trestle a quarter-mile long, consisting of tons of cross-ties and
timbers. ... Imagine it, the atmosphere in this house. Fifty
terrified men, women and children packed in one room ... the room
is insufferably hot and moist. The walls drip condensation. Now and
then rain spits through the ceiling; a pocket in the wallpaper
explodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson does not rely on his imagination for most of the
descriptive passages. His research is nothing less than
breathtaking; before writing ``Isaac's Storm'' he scoured personal
letters, telegrams, even thousands of pages of congressional
testimony as elected officials tried to make post-storm sense of
the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The book's climax comes when 85 passengers aboard a train decide
not to disembark and flee on foot. They're certain that no storm,
no matter how powerful, could blast apart a huge train. They are,
of course, as wrong as Isaac Cline.
</P>
<P>
   So-called disaster books are popular right now. The nonfiction
bestseller list regularly includes accounts of killer storms,
ill-fated mountain expeditions, ships lost at sea and the bloody
legacy of mass murders. Many of these titles are, as irritable
critics say, nothing more than rewritings of newspaper accounts _
sleazy attempts to cash in on notorious moments in history.
</P>
<P>
   But the best of these books _ and ``Isaac's Storm'' is certainly
one _ use the power of disaster to teach us. Lessons were learned
because of what happened in Galveston; other people lived because
of them. It is impossible to read ``Isaac's Storm'' without feeling
awed by the power of nature and by the talent of the man who wrote
the book.  &QL;

IF TRIMMING THE TREE IS YOUR NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, HERE'S
HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trimming the Christmas tree. Ah, if that was all there were to
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tree Ordeal is a seasonal chore that causes women to weep,
children to pout and men to invent expletives. There is the scene
at the tree lot, the family vote, the second family vote, and then
the tree I like least is tied to the roof of the car.
</P>
<P>
   At home, it becomes apparent that the tree will have to be
customized to fit the tree stand. The tree is dragged into the
garage for its moment with the hatchet. Small children are hustled
into the house so they won't hear the screams. Hours later, the
tree is dragged into the house and shoved into place. It is
apparent that it is still too tall for the room; it is taken back
to the garage. The children, poised with an ornament in each hand,
begin to whine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the furniture has been moved, and the tree is upright
and in place, the untangling of the lights begins. The children,
now crying, are sent to bed, and their broken ornaments are swept
into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to avoid this scene. Even fake trees have to be
found, and fluffed, a time-consuming chore.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Schulz has a better plan. It doesn't circumvent any of
the horrors _ it stretches out the ordeal. In her new book
``Decorating for Christmas'' (Reader's Digest Books, $24.95), she
recommends taking each step a day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to trim the tree by working through the preliminary
stages over a few days, usually after the children have gone to
bed. Each morning, they eagerly look to see how the design is
developing. They know that I am performing the tedious tasks that
are the background for the fun to come.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to spare your children the realities of the Tree
Ordeal, here's how she does it.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: The Lights
</P>
<P>
   Use multiple strands, begin them all at the top and work down a
section of the tree. Begin at the trunk and wrap the light strand
out the branch and then back to the trunk. Schulz suggests affixing
the light strand to the tree branches with 4-inch pieces of green
florist's wire.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz uses small crystal lights on her tree. The more lights,
``the more effective your tree will look,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: The Garland
</P>
<P>
   Garlands can be made of many materials and draped horizontally
in swags or in long vertical twists.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to start at the top of the tree in the back and work
down. ``Use green florist's wire to attach the garland to the
branches. Step back from the tree frequently while you are working
to survey the effect of the garland,'' Schulz says, so that
corrections can be made before you progress too far.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: The Bows
</P>
<P>
   Schulz uses decorative bows wherever the garland is attached to
the tree so it looks as if the bows are holding up the swags of
garland. ``Decorative ribbon bows can add the finishing touch to
your Christmas tree, just as they do to gift-wrapped presents,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Ornaments
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at this stage of tree decoration that the true character
of the tree takes shape,'' Schulz says. She recommends hanging one
type of ornament at a time, and repeating certain ornaments to
emphasize the tree's theme. (Unfortunately, there is no mention of
working with the preschool macaroni ornament theme, or the
elementary-school photo ornament theme.) ``Hang larger ornaments
toward the bottom of the tree, and graduate the sizes up toward the
top, where you can place smaller ones.''

&HT;     U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;    This is a test. This is a test. This is a test
 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian military officers
won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping as the millennium
arrives at midnight on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be guarding against the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their cis the ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches
causing the launch of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian governments have been working to fix the
potential Y2K glitches in their missile systems and early warning
defense equipment. And officials from both countries stress that
the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K missile launch is extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   But to reassure a jittery world public and further cut the risk
of a Y2K accident, the governments of the two nuclear superpowers
have set up a joint command center at Peterson Air Force Base at
Colorado Springs, Colo., to help protect against such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, commonly called Y2K, refers to the
possibility that computers programmed to read only the last two
digits of a year might interpret the change from 1999 to 2000 as
going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the computers to crash;
interfering with utility services, banking, aviation and any other
sector that relies computers.
</P>
<P>
   While most essential civilian and military computers in the
United States have been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries,
including Russia, are having difficulties. In fact, the State
Department is so worried about computer troubles there and in three
former Soviet republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of
employees through the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian
and U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their information will be collected from a network of radars and
satellites operated by the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations
Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the Cold War's superpower
standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S.
efforts to detect any Soviet missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed the Center for Year
2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a missile attack against
the United States. Instead, it is designed to reassure Moscow that
U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if that's what aging
Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate because of a Y2K
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   That mistaken perception could prove deadly because Russian
policy calls for launching a nuclear counter-strike if Moscow
believes it is under nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to protect
against that theoretic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moscow's computers failed and incorrectly indicated an
U.S. attack was underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing
the consoles could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite
pictures showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for
retaliatory strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``''We will prevent that from occurring,'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the Y2K center. ``We will be sitting
side-by-side with our Russian counterparts and they'll be viewing
the U.S. missile information. They will have that view that says a
launch is not occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct
contact with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone
link, will stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man
teams will rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day.
Each crew will include a linguist to enable team members to
converse.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has a certain public relations mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's important for the U.S and Russia
to show the rest of the world that former Cold War adversaries can
come together and work as a team,'' said Wicklund.
</P>
<P>
   The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for security
reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne Mountain,
the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried 1,800 feet
underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems,
the Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were
worried about the capability of Russia's missile defense system. In
1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President
Boris Yeltsin activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first
stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the
Russian armed forces realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading foreign policy spokesman
in the Senate, said the incident underscored that ``Russian
early-warning capabilities continue to deteriorate, and this
deterioration will be compounded by the transition to the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a glitch occur during the New Year period, ``we want them
to understand that their problems are Y2K-related and not a result
of U.S. hostile action for which they need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center also is designed to make up for problems in the
``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and Washington. The
hotlines give military and political leaders immediate
communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assured communications between U.S. and Russian leaders is a
priority at all times, and of particular concern over the
millennium date change,`` Warner said.Because computer scientists
warn that Y2K problems might take several weeks to materialize, the
Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian cooperation will extend through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the data corruption that may be engendered by Y2K
is going to manifest itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a
military expert with the Federation of American Scientists here.
``Some of this stuff may take several weeks to propagate through
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are
dramatically overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said
the Y2K problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles
or its nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is concerned, Pentagon
officials say the chances are ``extremely remote'' that there could
be an accidental launch caused by military computers confused about
the date change.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its final report on the readiness of U.S.
computers, debunked worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K
problems will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it
said. ``Nuclear weapons launch requires human
intervention.``Computers are the backbone of the U.S. military,
arrayed on key weapons like nuclear missiles, tanks, jets and
rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon is the largest user of
computer systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in
upgrades to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107
so-called ``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential
for waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the Air
Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining U.S.
missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked them, we've rechecked them. They're ready,''
Warren said.

&HT;     AMMIANO SEES VICTORY IN ELECTORAL LOSS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Ammiano, who rode a populist campaign to win
the right to challenge Mayor Willie Brown in Tuesday's run-off
election, will never say he lost the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is still president of the governing Board of Supervisors
and a more recognized figure _ locally and nationally _ with his
unsuccessful bid for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano may be the most liberal of the 11 supervisors, but his
demonstrated ability to spark a movement of discontented voters
could mean he will wield more influence, especially as district
elections approach next November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown helped me get the limelight because I stood up to him,''
Ammiano said Tuesday night after getting 40 percent of the vote to
Brown's 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is very cruel,'' he continued. ``In two years people
will look at the mayor as a lame duck. ... The beauty for me is I'm
not out of office ... and I'm backed by a very energetic movement
that's concerned with more open government and really scrutinizing
the districts because the districts are where the independents come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano conceded at 12:15 a.m. Wednesday during at a nightclub
in the city's Mission neighborhood, where several thousand
supporters chanted ``2003,'' the year of the next mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my birthday, and I feel like I've given birth. I've given
birth,'' he said gesturing to the crowd. ``There is not a mayor who
won't listen to us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano turned 58 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the results, Ammiano has gained political stature and a
place in San Francisco history. He ran the city's first successful
mayoral write-in campaign, which he launched just three weeks
before the Nov. 2 general election. That effort helped him into a
second-place finish _ ahead of former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint
Reilly, the former political consultant who spent almost $4 million
on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And the attention Ammiano attracted has positioned him for a
re-election bid for the board in November 2000. Then, he said, he
would run for mayor again or maybe the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ammiano will have elevated political stature in this city as
the leader of a new progressive political force,'' said Rich
deletion, chairman of Political Science Department at San Francisco
State University.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-off campaign, Ammiano faced the former longtime
Assembly speaker who spent more than $3 million _ six times more
than Ammiano _ and benefited tremendously from millions of dollars
more in expenditures by independent groups. Businesses and the
state Democratic Party hammered Ammiano in mailers and television
advertising, particularly over tax increases he proposed in his
first year as a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's camp, however, doesn't concede that their candidate's
late start or lack of cash hurt him. Ammiano spent about $300,000
to Brown's $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you be more creative, more thoughtful and harder
working,'' said Ammiano campaign strategist Robert Holland.
</P>
<P>
   What really hurt Ammiano, according to political consultant and
Brown supporter Robert Barnes, was the supervisor's reliance on his
established base of support base on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Ammiano ran a citywide campaign,'' said
Barnes, a member of the Alice B. TKOs Lesbian and Gay Democratic
Club, which endorsed Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime political consultant David Looman, who did not work for
anyone in this race, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started from a very narrow base, largely white, liberal,
tenant base,'' Looman said. ``And his job obviously was to broaden
that out and broaden it very fast. Part of what got lost in the
miraculous accomplishment of his coming in second with a write-in
campaign is that he finished 28,000 votes behind the mayor. ...
People have been concentrating on how far he'd come and not how far
he had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If Looman had worked for Ammiano, he said he would have
emphasized trying to reach Asian-Americans, who make up 34 percent
of the city's nearly 735,000 residents and 18 percent of its
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the hammer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano also could have been hurt by history: San Francisco
rarely elects a supervisor as mayor (Dianne Feinstein, who now
represents California in the Senate, was the last in 1979.) And
voters don't like to change course during boom times, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ammiano had a more effective and compelling message to
renters, who are feeling insecure about the housing crisis,''
Barnes said. ``But renters also are part of the citywide community
... and Brown scored more points for showing he could be trusted
with the economy.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The little suburban ranch house, with its pinkish
bricks and turquoise door, sits snugly on its luxuriant lawn in the
middle of a 1950s subdivision called Braes Heights. Stripped of
everything, including the wall-to-wall carpet and kitchen cabinets,
the house is an empty shell. Even the brass numbers on the door are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   This house is slated for demolition, due to be replaced by a
clone of one of the larger-than-life-size mansions that crowd it.
Four Georgian-style palazzos have risen to one side, in a seemingly
inexorable march to take over the street. The builder's sign is
already planted in the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad,'' said Joni Calkins, about the house where she and
her husband, David, raised their two young children. ``This is the
only home our kids knew.'' But the Calkins sold out: The house was
too small and the money too good.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ranch houses are an endangered species. Once the
revered symbol of postwar prosperity, these rectangular houses,
with their rec rooms and picture windows and skinny wrought-iron
balustrades, are now as dated as Melmac. In this one neighborhood,
at least 100 ranch houses have been torn down in the last five
years, replaced by today's dream: the multistoried,
Palladian-windowed, double-height-ceilinged, great-roomed
mansionette: Tara on a quarter-acre lot. When the ranch houses were
first built in Braes Heights, they cost $5,900. The house that will
replace the Calkins' is already on the market for $519,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, as in so many other places in the country, the
Calkins' land grew in value _ but their 1,500-square-foot ranch
house did not. As the family got bigger, the Calkins considered
adding on, but decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Will their next house be a ranch?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Mrs. Calkins replied. ``I admit I'm kind of
traditional. I grew up in a 1920s English cottage kind of house,
and that's what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband nodded and said, ``We want a two-story house.''
</P>
<P>
   So do a lot of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Association of Homebuilders does not
separate out ranch houses from other one-story dwellings, the trend
is clear: In 1971, 73 percent of the houses built were one story.
By last year, that figure fell to 48 percent. In the Northeast, the
difference is even more pronounced: only 20 percent of new houses
built in 1998 were one story.
</P>
<P>
   And of those one-story dwellings, very few are the classic ranch
house, built on the site by a crew of carpenters, plasterboarders
and plumbers. In many parts of the country now, they are ``ranch
style'' modular homes fresh from the factory, spotted on the
superhighways on the backs of tandem trailer trucks, cut into
sections like a scantily-clad magician's assistant and _ presto! _
reassembled on a waiting lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in business for 22 years,'' said Randy Wine, an
agent with Burgdorff Realtors ERA in Ridgewood, N.J., ``and I
haven't seen them build a new ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, Frank Newbold, the manager of the East Hampton
branch of Sotheby's International Realty, said that his customers
``won't even get out of the car'' to look at a ranch. When his
company does list one, he added, it is advertised as a ``one-story
traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the ranch, the comfortable, predictable,
quintessential suburban house? It came to represent the passe past,
not the classy past, the way Palladian villas and Romanesque
Revival palazzos do. And that, in fact, is what many new home
buyers are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch houses were ``plopped on the site, with a picture
window that looked out at the road, usually with a hurricane lamp
in the center and those awful flowery curtains,'' said Robert A.M.
Stern, the architectural historian and architect. ``The ranch house
has no attitude. America is a country of house-proud people.
Jefferson made that clear with Monticello.''
</P>
<P>
   S.I. Morris remembers when the first ranch house developments
were going up in Houston, probably some of the largest in the
country. He remembers because he was the architect for hundreds of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out of college in 1935, and shortly after that they
started making a lot of noise about ranch houses,'' he said. ``They
started building them out on the suburban edge whedy lived;
an inexpensive ranch house with a car port for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Building ceased during World War II. Morris was married in 1945
and, shortly after, started to build the houses ``a new, cheaper
way,'' he said, adding, ``We introduced a new foundation system, no
basement, just a concrete slab.''
</P>
<P>
   There were five similar models; each sold for $8,000. ``They
were pretty much snapped up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the kitchen of the '50s Modernist house he designed
in the Museum District in Houston, Morris, 85, conceded that many
of the tract ranch houses ``weren't very well built.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranch houses ``needed a lot of lumber,'' he said. ``An old
friend drove his truck to East Texas and loaded it with 2 by 4's
and 2 by 6's, and a lot of them were so warped they just weren't
useful,'' he continued. ``But we used them anyway!''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there is another problem: The earth beneath the
houses is a clay the natives call gumbo. Because of the soupy soil,
those 50- and 60-year-old slab foundations are cracking.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the real problem with the ranch house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranch house just isn't as pretentious to look at,'' said
Kenneth T. Jackson, an urban historian at Columbia University and
the author of ``Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the
United States'' (Oxford University Press, 1985).
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans wanted a big front yard. As a status
symbol, Jackson said, ``the yard was created in the middle of the
19th century, but is now playing itself out.'' The ranch, with its
substantial greenery, is being replaced by bricks and mortar, or
clapboard and nails, built right to the property line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a kind of internal luxury,'' Jackson explained.
``Americans in general are turning inward, with heavy drapes,
central air-conditioning and central heating that never matches the
temperature outside; with VCR's with 500 channels and Jacuzzis in
each of the giant bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For every movement, there is a countermovement.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston two years ago, an architecture group sponsored a tour
called ``Rancheros Deluxe,'' which lauded the best of the city's
ranch houses. At that time, there was some mention of putting a
whole district of ranch houses on the National Register of Historic
Places, but not much was done about it, said Stephen Fox, an
architectural historian who teaches at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from a few aficionados', there is no sense that the
ranch house is a vanishing species that needs special protection,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the ranch house was born, the architect
Cliff May is often credited with inventing the one-story ranch
house. But others dispute that, pointing out that the tiled-roof
courtyard houses May popularized in San Diego in the early '30s
were adaptations of indigenous architecture. (William Wurster, an
architect working in San Francisco at the same time, designed
similar houses.)
</P>
<P>
   One problem, said Ken Bernstein, the director of preservation
issues at the Los Angeles Conservancy, is that so few neighborhoods
of ranch houses remain intact. Across the country, as late as the
'80s, the ranch house, with its easily-adapted sheetrock
partitions, was changed to suit growing families and, as such,
became a favorite ``starter home'' for the baby-boom generation. As
families grew, the little houses' low ceilings became cathedrals,
their carports became bedrooms and their kitchen walls were knocked
out and new, double-size ``gathering rooms'' punched their way into
back yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Levittown,'' Bernstein said, ``where the houses were
designed to evolve.'' The current debate, he said, ``actually is
changing the traditional views of what intact is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the preservation debate centers on the
architect-designed Modernist ranches, like those in the Crestwood
Hill section of Brentwood _ certainly not on the mass-produced
builders' ranches that conquered so many blocks in suburbias across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to educate politicians and homeowners to even
accept the  &UR; idea  &LR; that the 1940s or '50s can be looked at through a
preservation prism,'' Bernstein said. ``But there is a growing
recognition that we are losing the very best examples. It'll be
like the neighborhood after neighborhood of Victorian houses that
were torn down because they were viewed as overly ornamental and
too dark. They came back into favor in the 1970s, but by then,
cities all over the country had lost entire Victorian
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The best way to preserve a ranch house may be to live in it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Fan Morris, S.I. Morris' son and daughter-in-law, are
bucking the trend. Six years ago, they moved with their three
daughters from a 1920s brick French-style manor house with a
circular driveway to a 1959 ranch designed by Lucian T. Hood Jr., a
well-known local architect. Although she agreed with her husband
that their first house was just too formal for the family, Mrs.
Morris said she nevertheless had to be ``pried out'' of it. But
since then, she has fallen in love with the ranch _ in all its '50s
allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked in, I thought it was atrocious,'' Mrs. Morris
said. ``There was a 50-50 chance we'd tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the vast glazed red and bright blue brick free-form
swimming pool in the courtyard, with its round hot tub and spouting
fountain, Sarah Morris, 23, said: ``I thought the `glamour girl
pool' was so tacky. It reminded me of `The Parent Trap.''' Ms.
Morris, who just graduated from college, is back home with her
parents, hanging out in the former maid's room in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually, the house grew on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that this house has an intelligence that is at war
with my aesthetics,'' Mrs. Morris said. ``But because of it, I am
now a freer person _ I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is almost a celebration of tacky,'' she continued.
``See this really tacky gold switch plate? And then there's this
silver one. It's really liberated my personal style. See these
flesh-colored tiles? I wanted to tear them out, but my architect
said: `You need an even stronger pink for the cabinets!''' She
gestured to the bubble-gum-pink Formica kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   There are also flesh-colored tiles in the period bathroom a few
miles away, in the ranch house owned by Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, a
paper conservator at the Menil Collection here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro wasn't even looking for a ranch when she
started house hunting way back in 1988. ``They call them
ranch-burgers,'' she said. ``A ranch house doesn't even have the
cachet of a bungalow or a craftsman cottage.''
</P>
<P>
   But she, too, fell in love, and has decorated the house _ which
still has the original '50s &UR;  &LR; blond wood built-in cabinets in the
kitchen and the original pull-out bar in the family room _ in
period furnishings. She recalled when her son and his high school
friends sat 12 around the celadon Naugahyde sectional sofa,
watching the NBA playoffs on the dated (but not period) television
set.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro said she is lucky, because her house is
strongly built. ``The structural engineer said it would last
forever,'' she said. But one thought gives her pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sell my house,'' she said, ``they'll probably tear it
down.''

SPACEWALKERS HAVE A LONG LIST OF REPAIR JOBS FOR THE HUBBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery's spacewalkers have trained to tackle 11
Hubble Space Telescope repair tasks when they reach the observatory
two days after their Thursday launch.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement of the observatory's half-dozen gyroscopes carries
the highest priority because it would permit stellar observations
to resume. Observations were halted Nov. 13 when a fourth of the
six gyros failed.
</P>
<P>
   The major tasks include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The six gyroscopes, paired in three toaster-size electronics
boxes. Only two are working as Discovery prepares to lift off. At
least three are necessary for astronomical observations. NASA would
accept Discovery's mission as a minimal success if the astronauts
depart Hubble with five gyroscopes operating.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe hair-thin internal copper and silver
electrical wires have crumbled from corrosion. Five of the six new
gyros have been assembled with a new technique to eliminate the
corrosion problem. There wasn't time to complete a sixth, NASA
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six voltage improvement kits. These cell phone-size
electronics boxes are designed to keep the half-dozen storage
batteries on Hubble from overheating as they are recharged with
solar power. Nearly 10 years old, the batteries have become more
sensitive to heat as they re-charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flight control computer. Hubble's current computer is based on
1970s technology, though it was augmented with an Intel 386
co-processor in 1993. The portable TV-size replacement incorporates
Intel 486 processors that will increase the processing power by 40
times and enlarge the memory 30-fold. It takes four years to modify
a computer to withstand the higher radiation levels of space,
ruling out a Pentium-class computer on this mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine guidance sensor. Along with the gyroscopes, the three
fine guidance sensors are a crucial part of the Hubble's pointing
system. One of the baby grand piano-size devices will be replaced.
It works with the flight computer to locate preselected guide stars
that lock the telescope onto its targets. The newest fine guidance
sensor was actually removed in 1997 and refurbished for
re-installation on this mission.
</P>
<P>
   With the gyroscopes, voltage improvement kits, computer and fine
guidance sensor installed, NASA would call the flight a full
success. However, other tasks are planned.
</P>
<P>
   _ S-band transmitter, an electronic device that relays digital
imagery data gathered by the telescope to a NASA communications
satellite, which then transmits the information to a NASA ground
station. One of the two original transmitters on the telescope
failed in 1998, though each was expected to last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Solid state recorder. The telescope was launched with three
reel-to-reel style data recorders, one of which was replaced by a
solid state device with computer chip data storage during the 1997
repair mission. A second shoe box-size solid state device with a
10-fold improvement in memory capacity will be installed.
</P>
<P>
   _ External insulation. The metallic outer insulation on Hubble
showed unexpected signs of wear from the corrosive effects of solar
radiation and reactive oxygen molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere
when astronauts visited in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The squad of spacewalkers plans to install six new stainless
steel panels over the equipment bays on the telescope. These 3-by-5
panels will help keep internal equipment at room temperature in
spite of external conditions that range from 180 degrees Fahrenheit
in sunlight to minus 130 degrees in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Release nitrogen gas from the cooling system of the
telescope's infrared camera. Installed by astronauts in 1997, the
frozen nitrogen refrigerant exhausted prematurely in January.
Residues of the gas can be released by an astronaut turning a value
so that a new refrigerant system can be installed on a future
visit.
</P>
<P>
   _ More external insulation repair. As time permits, the
spacewalkers plan to affix up to seven rolls of flexible metallic
covering to the telescope's light barrel. The longest
wallpaper-like rolls measures 18 feet by 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Handrail covers. The paint that once adorned the handrails on
the telescope's equipment bays has begun to peel away. Flakes of
paint could contaminate optical instruments on the Hubble. Covers
fashioned from a fiberglass fabric will be slipped over the handles
to contain the flaking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Replace latches. Latches on some equipment bays have been
galled as astronauts on previous visits strained to close the outer
cover.

   MIDEAST-TALKS _ WASHINGTON _ Historic Israeli-Syrian peace talks
got off to a rocky start Wednesday, when Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa used opening remarks to assail the West for
``ignoring'' the plight of Arabs since Israel's birth. President
Clinton urged Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to look
beyond their differences and into a future fresh with the promise
of peace. ``The road to peace is no easier, and in many ways it is
harder than the road to war.'' said Clinton. ``There will be
challenges along the way, but we have never had such an
extraordinary opportunity to reach a comprehensive
settlement.''Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service). 20.

mediation will take place at the offices of Marianne's lawyer, John

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

MUSEUM GIVES HIPPIE STUFF THE ACID TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She is no longer a lithe hippie goddess. But as
she sits by the fire in her rhinestone-encrusted living room, the
colors quivering, it's clear that the spirit of Lotus Carnation
still dwells inside Lois Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lotus, as she was known in the late 1960s _ as opposed to
Lois, now a 72-year-old part-time librarian, who created ``The
Throne'' (1973), a resplendent creation born of acid and epoxy,
designed to transport the sitter into another realm. ``We saw
patterns everywhere,'' she recalled the other day, lounging
barefoot. ``We sat and listened at the feet of every Indian guru,
glommed on to every microcosm and macrocosm, then we looked at
their art. I got up one morning and just like you say, `I think
I'll have a ham sandwich for lunch,' out came `The Throne.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Throne,'' a bejeweled roach clip, two wooden electric
guitars, some 40 rock posters, hand-embroidered bluejeans and a
hash pipe made from a copper toilet bowl float are a few of the
objects on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in ``Far
Out: Bay Area Design 1967-73,'' an eclectic retrospective of hippie
material culture _ or what Ruth Keffer, a curatorial associate,
calls ``the flip side of the Tricia Nixon aesthetic.'' The show,
which spans the psychedelic experience of Haight-Ashbury and the
back-to-the-landers' earthy furniture, runs through Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far Out'' couldn't come at a stranger moment. Though the
hippie artists are approaching seniorhood _ they complain of poor
eyesight and memory lapses and gave up inhaling and worse long ago
_ many remain fierce keepers of the '60s flame, even as new symbols
swirl relentlessly around them. (Glitzy dot-com headquarters spring
up daily in the city, as young Webmeisters, or ``twerps with
'tude,''' as Salon magazine dubbed them, cruise the city of gongs,
flowers and beads in freshly minted BMWs.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the old lady who refuses to sell her home to the evil
developer, some of the hippie artists behind the relics are holed
up in handmade hippie houses at the end of unmarked dirt roads in
the wilds of Marin County. They still call each other ``baby,'' and
their city Frisco. Their houses can often be identified by the cars
parked outside, replete with bumper stickers like ``My Karma Ran
Over My Dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Ms. Anderson, pine for the hallucinogenic heritage of
their youth. ``You could disappear for days and have incredible
life experiences,'' she wistfully recalled. ``I gave up drugs, but
the outlook stays. I get nostalgic because it's so weird now. Very
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so objects in the show, including organic wooden
furniture that transcends water beds and futons with madras
spreads, speak to a moment in which making things by hand was an
important personal and political statement. ``The emphasis on
handmade was a development of do-it-yourself, which has a long line
in American history,'' said Todd Gitlin, the social critic. ``There
was belief in the glorious capacities of every human being, whether
it came to tying beads or writing poetry, most of it highly
perishable.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Knox Bennett, 65, who retains his Golden Gate Park beard,
is a well-known maker of sculptural art furniture and lights in
Oakland. He started his career as a crafts entrepreneur by forming
a company called Squirkenworks that provided peace symbols and
roach clips to head shops on Haight Street. He still keeps prized
ones on a glass shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was making stuff, whether you could paint or not,''
he said. ``For me, the '60s were the last time an entrepreneur
could make a good living with his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for hippies,'' he added. ``You could sell them
anything.''

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

 SAN FRANCISCO: them anything.' ' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The exhibition, curated by Aaron Betsky, is rather
hallucinatory, putting forgotten jewelry and clothes behind
plexiglas and hoisting chairs and beds onto pedestals, the kind of
treatment often reserved for Egyptian scarabs. Many of the objects,
created to be anti-establishment, look like they don't want to be
there. ``It's ironic,'' said Paul Krassner, the author and
satirist. ``The main thing about the '60s was its spirit, which was
nonmaterial. But you can't put spirit in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some mysterious omissions _ among them, record album
covers, Zap comics and underground papers like The Oracle. Taken
together, objects like Al Garvey's stained glass and cedar Dutch
door and Wavy Gravy's patchwork jumpsuit form a peculiar blend of
the natural and the plastic-fantastic. Betsky's premise is that,
with the counterculture now 30 years old, it is time to re-examine
its aesthetic, which he sees as an extension of the Bay Area Arts
and Crafts tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The big news may be that contrary to popular belief, psychedelic
art and craft was not produced while under the influence. As Ms.
Anderson put it, ``No way could you do picky-picky work with your
mind blown.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Brand, the founder of The Whole Earth Catalog, called
much of the work ``bright and swirly and filled with meaning.'' But
it sometimes led, he said, to ``pretty dreadful graphic art.''
</P>
<P>
   The period's devil-may-care zest is evident in the boots and
shoes by the Apple Cobbler, a k a Mickey McGowan, a longtime vegan,
who after apprenticing with a Laguna sandalmaker, began fashioning
over-the-top footwear out of fabric like brocade. Inspired by
assemblage artists like Ed Kienholz, McGowan's shoes integrated
rubber duck decoys and toys, creating soles so bouncy, as he put
it, ``it was like walking on Super Balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former Apple Cobbler makes a living from the past,
working as an estate liquidator and selling extras from his archive
of some 15,000 record albums _ his specialty is strange, neglected
music by folks like Jim Backus _ kept in a warehouse. And then
there's what he calls the Unknown Museum, an indescribable welter
of some 100,000 pop-cultural artifacts (from lunch boxes to board
games) in his modest home overlooking the 101 Freeway ramp in San
Rafael. (``I never got into the real estate thing,'' he said
ruefully.)
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to separate some creations from their
creators. Mary Ann Schildknecht, now 52 and still painting
T-shirts, made her intricately embroidered blouse and skirt, a
collage of blue sky, mountains, Janis Joplin and other images,
during a two-year prison sentence in Italy for smuggling hashish.
``I had a lot of time left,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The artist Clayton Lewis, who died in 1995, hand-built what may
be the quintessential hippie bed, a heroic bohemian masterpiece of
wood and paint. It was found in an abandoned Miwok Indian cottage
on an obscure cove near Point Reyes, where he lived. What the
exhibition implies is how central the bed was to '60s culture. ``It
wasn't simply a place to put in your eight hours,'' said the
artist's son, Peter, who is leading an effort to preserve the
cottages. ``My father loved women _ what can I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   David McFadden, chief curator of the American Craft Museum in
New York, noted that cultural artifacts like beds and blouses ``may
become touchstones for memory in a way that some fine arts can't.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Objects like this may look stupid, but they're not
mute.''
</P>
<P>
   High in the Marin hills, where humble hippie shacks now fetch
mid-six-figure prices, Al Garvey and his wife, Barbara, now 67 and
65 respectively, live the life they lived 34 years ago, when
Garvey, a professional door carver, stumbled upon a wooden wine
fermenting tank on the side of the road in Sonoma and decided to
build a studio out of it. The studio, now part of his house,
``smelled like wine for five years afterwards,'' he recalled
somewhat mistily.
</P>
<P>
   Like a skip in a record, ``I kind of got stuck in the period,''
Garvey said cheerfully, adding, ``I can't bear to think of leaving
it.'' His house is an evocative time warp, with a big fireplace
made of Mexican river stones and relief sculptures made from
madrone wood off the forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   He continues carving doors. ``I still get great elation out of
creating something,'' he said. ``What I loved about that period was
the extemporaneous expression.'' His two daughters, now grown, were
less enamored of the spontaneity. ``They're yuppies,'' he said with
affection. ``They make more in a year than I've ever made in my
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other woodworkers rejected the hedonism of San Francisco's
hippie culture, opting to move to places like Bolinas, on the Marin
coast. ``This is where the flower children landed when they hit
50,'' said the furniture maker Art Espenet Carpenter, 79.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter continues to influence generations of California
artisans. His smooth rounded corners and soft edges in pieces like
the Shell Desk, in the exhibition, were copied so widely the style
became known as ``California roundover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hung up on round,'' he said, giving a tour of the
hand-built five-building compound he created in a dense thicket of
trees; it includes a round kitchen and library composed of
4-by-8-foot bays, and an oculus ceiling encircled by wooden beams.
The paths snake through Asian dogwood, revealing a working privy
covered in vines with a magnificent burled seat.
</P>
<P>
   J.B. Blunk, 73, is known for his freeform redwood sculpture and
furniture that bring out the character of trees. His house, built
by hand in the 1960s on the Point Reyes peninsula, is reached
through a graceful sculptured arch of 1,200-year-old redwoods. Like
him, the house is refined and gnarly. It is artfully built of
driftwood, telephone poles, schoolhouse windows and whatever other
materials were at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Blunk, who is perhaps best known for a three-ton curving redwood
outcropping of connected tables designed for the restaurant Greens
in San Francisco, studied stoneware and ceramics in Japan,
befriending the artist Isamu Noguchi and the California surrealist
Gordon Onslow Ford, a neighbor and patron. His kitchen table is a
piece of redwood, vaguely whale shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one has consciously held on to hippie culture more
than Wavy Gravy, who was unofficial ringmaster of the hippie
movement before he became a Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavor.
Founder of the Hog Farm commune, which ran a pig for president in
1968, Wavy Gravy, 63 and formerly Hugh Romney, lives in Berkeley in
a cottagey compound of redwood bungalows that could someday become
the hippie Williamsburg. A platform bed is built into the living
room, ready for crashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably bury me a hippie,'' he said, sprawling on his
bed in a meditative pose, surrounded by artifacts from the era,
including a plaster sculpture of Jerry Garcia turning into a bear.
Wavy Gravy, who runs a children's clown camp north of San
Francisco, learned the power of objects early on: when he walked a
plastic fish on a leash and wore a red nose, it seemed to prevent
the police from arresting him. ``It's hard to beat up on a clown,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a show like ``Far Out,'' it still is.

<P>
   Those pondering whether to hunker down as the year 2000
approaches may look to a decision by MTV to bunker down.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Interactive, the online division of the MTV cable television
network, is sponsoring a stunt for New Year's Eve that will
relocate six young Americans to a dwelling that's not so much far
from home as it is deep. They will live for a week in the bowels of
Times Square as a kind of survival squad in case the forebodings of
millennial Jeremiahs come true. Their stay is being called the
Bunker Project _ ``The Real World'' meets the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believes the world will come to an end,'' said Allie
Eberhardt, creative director at MTV.com, part of MTV Interactive,
and executive producer of the project. ``But who knows?'' he added
laughingly. ``Maybe we're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the MTV.com bunkernauts _ three would-be Adams and three
potential Eves, ranging in age from 19 to 30 _ will be ready for a
cosmic meltdown early on New Year's Day. In the meantime, they will
be ensconced underground in a compound consisting of three
redesigned 6-by-8-foot tornado shelters, a toilet, a shower, a
kitchen and a media room.
</P>
<P>
   A media room? Of course. This is, after all, MTV. And one of the
six is a disc jockey, natch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to preserve the MTV culture, the DNA, if you
will,'' Eberhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The bunker is meant to blend the fin de siecle spookiness of
``The X-Files'' with the sensibilities of the space-age bachelor
pad lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a '60s fallout shelter and David
Lynch's `Blue Velvet,' with a bit of `Barbarella' thrown in,'' said
Steven Harris of Steven Harris Architects in New York, which is
preparing the bunker in the subbasement of the Times Square home of
The New York Times at 229 W. 43rd St., near Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a playful version of domesticity, a sendup like
`Pee-wee's Playhouse,''' he added. For Harris, the busyness ``will
substitute for the missing stimulations of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming younger people are fairly adventuresome,'' he
said, walking through the subbasement space where tornado shelters,
painted in colors he called Caterpillar yellow, John Deere green
and Ford industrial blue are being set up.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for touches like a photoluminescent floor in the
media room, sofas colored in atomic orange, button-tufted gold
Mylar and flocked walls, beds made from cargo netting and fake-fur
throws.
</P>
<P>
   What does Lenore Davis, 27, a bunkernaut, want to take with her?
``There's a body pillow I love and a cool camping sleeping bag,''
Ms. Davis, an account executive for LoadTV.com, a Web-based
broadcaster, said. ``If the world is ending, I will sleep in
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The bunkernauts were selected from more than 300 people ``who
came in after a call out to our users and viewers,'' Eberhardt
said. The list was winnowed by the MTV.com staff and an online
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times space was ``the perfect find,'' he added.
``We wanted a space in Times Square, because that's ground zero for
New Year's Eve, and it provided us the atmosphere we were looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The other tenants of what MTV.com hopes will be the most-watched
bunker in New York since ``All in the Family'' went off the air are
Mike Carson, 30, the D.J.; Zack Goodman, 25, a research scientist;
Tina Kim, 28, a comedian; Maureen Kyle, 19, a student; and Michael
Michael, 23, a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule calls for the six to move in on Dec. 26 and stay
through the early morning of New Year's Day. Army officers are to
visit for an hour a day the first five days to offer survival
training. The goings-on can be watched by computer users _ at least
until the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1 _ at www.mtv.com. Television
lights and cameras have been installed in the subbasement to make
the Webcast possible. MTV.com's stipulations for the bunker brigade
include a code of conduct covering nudity, language and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are under way to show some of the activities on MTV
on Dec. 31, Eberhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The New York Times
Co., declined to discuss the financial arrangements under which MTV
Interactive is renting the space. It was vacated by The Times after
printing operations moved to a new plant in College Point, Queens.
The presses are gone, leaving cavernous spaces, concrete pillars,
metal flooring and wires.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nielsen said the idea was MTV's and this is solely their
project. ``At first, we thought this was really nuts, the idea of
MTV locking six kids in our basement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then MTV said, `Don't worry, we'll give them food and
water.'''

&HT;     TIPS FOR MILLENNIUM TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For those brave enough to travel over the New
Year's Eve weekend, the travel industry has a few tips to avoid any
millennium-sized headaches from the Year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really think anything is going to happen, but it's
just one of those situations where people shouldn't take any
chances that could end up ruining their vacation,'' said Kristina
Rundquist, spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Agents.
The Alexandria, Va.-based travel industry association, which has
nearly 29,000 members in more than 170 countries, said people
traveling between Dec. 31 and Jan. 3 should follow these tips to
help prevent any problems:
</P>
<P>
   _Obtain, and carry, a written confirmation of all travel plans
including confirmation numbers. If you are traveling to a resort or
destination that is booked to capacity, reconfirm your hotel
reservations by contacting the resort directly before you leave
home.
</P>
<P>
   _Before departing on an overseas trip, contact the State
Department or visit its Web site at
http://travel.state.gov/y2kca.html to check on your destination's
overall Year 2000 readiness. Check to see how prepared that
country's aviation industry is for the glitch that could disable
computers unable to distinguish 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   _Consider obtaining traditional printed tickets rather than
electronic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _Take out extra cash or travelers' checks before departure,
rather than relying on Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) once you
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   _Think about purchasing trip cancellation insurance. However,
before you buy any, make sure the policy covers Y2K-related
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Make at least two copies of all pertinent travel-related
documents including your passport, visas, driver's license, front
and back of credit cards, medical/eye prescriptions and important
phone numbers. Keep one copy in a separate but secure section of
your carry-on luggage and give the other copy to a close friend or
relative who can provide you with the information if needed.
</P>
<P>
   _Be sure to keep all essential items _ including prescriptions,
toiletries and a change of clothes _ in your carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   _As with all peak-travel periods, anticipate possible delays.
Bring a book, water and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rundquist said millennium travelers should take the attitude of
people ``heading into a storm and arriving in a place that was just
hit by a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested that travelers consult a professional travel
agent to help with their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel agents will make sure all of your documents are safe,
and if problems arise, they can likely get you on another flight or
book you another hotel room faster than you could do it on your
own,'' she said.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready for a new profession that builds on our increasing
need for self-awareness, individuality and balance: LifeStyling.
Lifestyling does not exist yet, but from what I see these days,
it's a career whose birth is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   People today have an almost manic need to figure out who they
are. They want to create a life that reflects their true selves,
and this desire is reflected in their choice of what to wear, buy
and how to live. By bringing these elements together through a
series of deliberate consumer choices, they create a total vision
of living and being.
</P>
<P>
   Young people put on and take off whole new identities with ease.
They frequently experiment with who they are, and who and what they
would like to be. Today they can quickly outfit their lives to
reflect the most recent persona they have created.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Every mall in America offers the same cookie-cutter
lifestyle. It's the same J Crew, Banana Republic, Gap, Pottery
Barn, Crate &AMP; Barrel. Walk into any home, and you can spot the same
faux vintage candlesticks, gourmet salad dressing and basic white
t-shirt. And designers are not just outfitting our bodies, but our
entire lives. If you want to live the Ralph Lauren dream, paint
your house with Polo Blue. If just smelling and looking like the
epitome of Calvin Klein isn't enough, buy the sheets, dishes and
sofa covers to outfit your apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But as creating a persona becomes easier, finding out who you
truly are becomes harder. Indeed, part of the need for
individuality comes from a need to rediscover what happiness and
success mean for the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are too many choices and no right answers. Are you
more JCrew or Banana Republic? Can you really know yourself if
you're living a designer's package-deal life? And who are you if
you look like every one of your friends?
</P>
<P>
   As one 18-year-old male said ``I need to find something that
makes me feel like I'm not just a page out of some freaked-out
catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the LifeStylist who can help an individual understand who
he really is. The LifeStylist of the future will help you create
not just a look, but a life that is truly your own. Part
psychologist, stylist, trainer and interior designer, your
lifestylists will understand your wants, interpret your needs and
reinvent a life to reflect your inner self. He (or she) will sort
through your closet, and bring you clothing to select from small
boutiques. He will coordinate your house with your wardrobe,
analyze your Palm-Pilot and show you how much time you're spending
on negative energy. He'll create a workout that doesn't need a
trainer and a diet that doesn't need a workout. He'll setup
automatic order systems so that your home will always be
well-stocked. And he may even makes plans for the child that you
aren't even planning for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Your life will be customized to fit your vision of success and
happiness. A vision of not only who you truly are, but who you are
meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some savvy stores and magazines are showing signs of early
LifeStyling _ providing a full vision of the life in which you
would use the products they sell. Language, a store in downtown
Manhattan, caters to the shopper's full life experience. Created
with three sections, the front-third features an eclectic mix of

   ``The concept of the store is a lifestyle,'' says Mary

person would like to present themselves and their home. It's about
how a person perceives themselves and would like others to perceive
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Language is geared toward people who want to be perceived as
''very cutting edge, very much what's happening at the moment in
fashion,'' Keehbauch says.

   The increasing popularity of Wallpaper magazine also reflects
this trend. Wallpaper treats interior design, fashion, travel, food
and architecture as equally important elements of a larger picture
_ the life that someone wants to live. It doesn't depict actual
apartments or places, it creates perfect artificial versions of the
way things should be.
</P>
<P>
   LifeStyling offers a variety of expressions. As we seek more and
more to understand and express our individuality, the need for
knowing oneself will continue to grow, and so will the need for
people to help us get that knowledge and translate it into how we
live.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the drain lines in plumbing systems develop
clogs. These are frustrating and annoying because they require
immediate attention and removing the blockage can be messy. Many
homeowners first try a liquid drain opener. Sometimes these
products can be effective, but if they don't free the blockage, you
are left with a basin full of caustic solution that can be
difficult to work around.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to dislodge a block in the drainpipe is
mechanically. For this you'll need a few basic tools: a plunger, an
auger and a few wrenches. Every homeowner should have a plunger on
hand. The best type of plunger is a funnel-type one with a flexible
extension tube. The tube is designed for plunging a toilet, but it
can be folded back into the cup to plunge sink drains.
</P>
<P>
   The plunger is the first tool to reach for to unclog a drain. If
the clog is relatively minor, this tool can free it in a few
minutes. To clear a clogged sink, remove the stopper or strainer,
then stuff a wet rag into the overflow opening on the side of the
sink if there is one. Place the plunger in the basin so the cup
covers the drain opening, then fill the basin with enough water to
cover the cup. Vigorously work the plunger up and down several
times before pulling it abruptly from the drain. In most cases,
this should clear the drain. If not, you'll have to work below the
sink.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bucket under the sink and unscrew the slip nuts that
hold the drain trap in place. Sometimes you can loosen them by
hand; if not use an adjustable wrench. Most lavatories have drains
with chrome-plated pipes and nuts. If you are working on this type
of fixture, wrap the jaws of the wrench with masking tape. This
will keep the wrench from marring the finish on the slip nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the water in the trap into the bucket. If the trap is
filled with sediment, remove it with a stiff-bristle bottle brush.
This may clear the clog and you can reassemble the trap. If the
trap is clear, however, then the obstruction must lie within the
drainpipe in the wall. Switch to the sink waste auger to clear this
part of drain.
</P>
<P>
   The sink waste auger has a long coil of flexible steel cable
with a boring gimlet (essentially a steel spring with a hook on the
end), and a handle with a locking screw. It is not difficult to use
this tool. First, remove the horizontal drainpipe and feed the
auger cable into the stub-out (the short piece of pipe projecting
from the wall) until you meet with resistance. Pull about a foot of
the cable out of the drain, tighten the lock screw on the handle,
then push the cable back into the drain pipe as you crank the
handle clockwise. If the cable catches on something, don't force
it. Instead, reverse the handle direction and pull the cable back a
bit to free it then continue as before.
</P>
<P>
   This technique should break up the blockage. In some cases, it
may push the obstruction farther down the drain line. At that
point, pull the cable out again, loosen the lock nut to feed more
cable into the drain and continue as before. When you have cleared
the pipe, remove the cable and reassemble the drainpipe.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the basin with the hot water, then see if it drains
satisfactorily. If it seems slow, it could be that some of the
sediment from the broken-up obstruction has settled and is impeding
the water flow. Use the plunger to push it through.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution about the auger; the flexible steel auger
spring will not harm modern drains, but the pipes in some older
houses may have bends and traps made of soft metal, like lead.
Pushing the auger into these sections can rupture the soft walls of
the pipe. Work carefully and avoid pushing the auger with excessive
force when trying to clean an old drain.
</P>
<P>
   Toilet clogs usually form at the top of the trap in the bowl.
Sometimes you can generate enough pressure with the plunger to push
the obstruction through. If not, you will have to use a closet
auger. The closet auger has a flexible steel snake that is partly
contained in a long tube. The snake comes out at one end of the
tube, and there is a crank handle on the other. Push the auger end
into the bowl as you crank the handle clockwise. Gradually force
the snake through the tight curves of the toilet trap and push the
obstruction through.

IF IT QUACKS, IT MUST BE A KWAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I provided a pronunciation guide in this column,
for Japan's Asahi beer, a letter poured in from a reader. This
person took me to task for issuing bad information and then
questioned my qualifications. This indicated to me that some people
have more time on their hands than is good for them and me. So
herewith, I set forth new rules: I pronounce it any way I want to,
and so can you.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why I rhyme Kwak Belgian Ale with ``Quack.''
Nobody at the pub where we tried it knew how to pronounce it
either, including the barkeep. But we all had a jolly good time
making lots of amusing duckie noises. So as far as I'm concerned,
it's Kwak. Jimmy Kwak corn, and I don't care, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Deep cleansing breath. All right, now that I've vented,
let's yak about Kwak.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it IS pronounced ``Quack,'' but with less emphasis
on the final ``ck.'' The Web site said so. So there. Second, you
may not be familiar with the beer, but you've probably seen those
top-heavy mugs with small globes at the bottom that require a
wooden stand for serving _ that's a stirrup-cup, a Kwak
innovation/marketing gizmo. Third, Kwak has been brewed since 1791
by the same family operation, which is kind of neat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the beer. Kwak builds up an enormous head of
thick, creamy foam that throws off a nicely scented bouquet. Tiny
bubbles make delicate, textbook-style Belgian lace patterns on the
inside of the glass. The rich amber color confirms the spicy,
almost clove palate, and bitter, chewy caramel finish.
</P>
<P>
   One final thing: the complete name of this beer is ``Pauwel
Kwak,'' pronounced ``PAW-uhl KWA-ck.'' ``Pauwel'' is in teeny-tiny
letters, while ``Kwak'' predominates. Is it the name of the 18th
century, mutton-chopped dude pictured on the label, hoisting a cold
one? Is it a place? A thing? Animal, vegetable, mineral?
</P>
<P>
   Haven't a clue. Twenty minutes online couldn't help me, either.
I may not know what it means, but by God, I can pronounce it, which
means I can order it and drink it.
</P>
<P>
   What more do I need?

   NY-TRANSIT (New York) _ The tentative contract that the transit

   CIR-WORKER-MONITORING (Undated) _ In 1999, at least 45 percent
of employers said they monitored their employees' phone calls,
computer files or e-mail messages, according to the American
Management Association. That number, based on a survey of more than
1,000 human-resources managers at corporations of varying sizes, is
up from 35 percent two years ago. The monitoring is necessary,
employers argue, because of the changing nature of the workplace.
Supervisors must keep tabs on which workers are wasting company
time by surfing to entertainment Web sites, which ones are sending
e-mail messages that create a hostile environment for women or
members of minority groups, and which ones are distributing company
secrets or jamming their networks with bulk e-mail. Balancing that
desire for control with an employee's rights to privacy has never
been easy. By Lisa Guernsey.

CONDUCTIVE EDUCATION GIVES CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY NEW HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ They sit snuggled with their mothers at the end of
three slatted tables.
</P>
<P>
   Timea Molnar, a young woman wearing a black T-shirt with the
words ``Making a Miracle Happen,'' moves among them offering
instruction and encouragement in a thick, Hungarian accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, sit up nice and tall, everyone,'' she says. ``I want to
see your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, responding to the soothing tones as the moms and Molnar
sing ``We are soldiers standing tall, one, two, three, four, five,
we are soldiers standing tall,'' the children _ Sean DuPree among
them _ sit up.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with their backs straight may seem like a small feat to
most of us, but for Sean and the other children, it represents
progress bordering on the miraculous. Three years ago, Penny DuPree
had no hope that her son would ever sit, dress or eat without her
help.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who was delivered via an emergency Caesarean section Nov.
18, 1996, was eight weeks premature and had cerebral palsy, a
neurological disorder resulting from injury to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, DuPree enrolled Sean, now 3, in an intensive
program of exercise and learning called Conductive Education of
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Sean could not sit up on his own. He could not crawl or talk. He
kept his right hand balled into a fist so tight that his nails cut
into his palms.
</P>
<P>
   When DuPree told Sean's neurologist about Conductive Education,
he told her she'd be wasting her money but to try it anyway, so
that she wouldn't have any regrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mansfield mother, a registered nurse and administrator for a
home-care agency, says she was skeptical at first. But after five
sessions with Molnar, Sean could sit up in a shopping cart at the
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the seventh, he was able to sit in a high chair in a
restaurant,'' DuPree said, recalling the day employees at Cha Cha's
cheered her son's success.
</P>
<P>
   DuPree's tears of joy are understandable. And this is only one
of almost a dozen stories being played out at Conductive Education.
Parents who had no hope of their child ever leading a ``normal''
life, now see progress they never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hoped and prayed,'' DuPree said. ``But I didn't
expect to see results so soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Conductive Education is a holistic approach to teaching designed
to improve the children's motor skills so that, ultimately, they
can succeed in a regular school program and even college. Dr.
Andras Peto of Budapest, Hungary, developed the system more than 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although popular in Europe, the approach wasn't introduced in
the United States until the late 1980s. American Conductive
Education was formed in 1992 to broaden awareness. There are now 50
programs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas branch was founded in 1997 by Tamala Day and
Elizabeth Osborne, shortly after Day learned about Conductive
Education on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Day said that through Conductive Education, her son Jaxsen
progressed from using a walker to walking with a cane, which
requires better balance and coordination.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the program's success to the continual physical
training. The program also incorporates academics, speech, feeding
and social skills that help shape the child's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Conductive Education teachers are called conductors because Peto
wanted to distinguish them from therapists, whose skills focus on
specific aspects of development, not overall progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not physical therapy,'' Day said. ``It's a method of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Conductive Education Association said that
about 500,000 adults and children nationwide have cerebral palsy.
And the United Cerebral Palsy Association estimates that about
5,000 children are born with the disorder each year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of growing demand, Aquinas College in Grand Rapids,
Mich., has formed a partnership with the Peto Institute in Budapest
to train conductors in a graduate and undergraduate program
beginning in August _ the first of its kind outside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got involved as a result of having some pilot programs
happening in our community and the parent's strong desire to have
this established as a program option for their children,'' said
Kathy Barker, director of the Aquinas-Peto School for Conductive
Education at the private liberal arts school.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said that there are fewer than 500 conductor-teachers in
the world and that those individuals come primarily from the Peto
Institute.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 a.m., the ``Mom and Baby'' class that DuPree and Sean
have been attending the last two months is almost over, and the
pre-kindergarten/kindergarten class is about to begin. A class for
school-age children is from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows mothers to play a major role in their
children's education, encouraging them to help their children make
movements impeded by brain damage. They use a gentle but firm
hands-on coaching approach to teach their children to roll over,
sit and stand. The smallest success is accompanied with nursery
songs and encouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, four boys are writing the alphabet on miniature
blackboards while soaking their feet in hot sage water that helps
to relax their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Doyel sits nearby, watching her son Devin, who is 4. She
radiates pride.
</P>
<P>
   Doyel and her husband, Darren, had been told that Devin would
always be in a wheelchair, and that as he got older he'd become
more deformed. At 3 1/2, he wasn't potty-trained, couldn't sit up,
and couldn't feed or dress himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been around the wheel looking for someone to help him,''
she said. ``My husband actually found Tamala on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of when Devin first came to Conductive Education
of Dallas, he was potty-trained. He has now exchanged his walker
for a cane, and he brims with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just really neat to see him feeling like he's on the same
level as everyone else,'' Doyel said. ``It's extraordinary the
difference we've seen in him.''

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Bill Callen, Albany Times-Union; originally sent Dec. 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vice president of a large ski company commented privately
the other day: ``This is getting scary.'' Of course, he was talking
about the current lack of snowpack in the northern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new about warm autumns, or December meltdowns. Nothing
new about an upper air pattern that blocks the cold Arctic air out
while the warm soup spreads from the South all across New England .
. . and sits for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this before. But, what if this is new?
</P>
<P>
   What if there is a permanent warming going on? So far as anyone
can tell amid all the political wrangling about global warming, no
one really knows. Or at least no one has been convincing one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Certain pieces of data seem unsettling - the shrinking of the
polar ice cap; the fact that some species of migrating waterfowl
from the Canadian maritimes do not range as far south to their
ancestral wintering grounds anymore (just ask the fifth generation
goose hunters from Maryland's Eastern Shore who see a fraction of
the birds that used to return for winter).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, we humans are semi-schooled at best in the long
rhythms of climate and geological evolution and do not know whether
we are dealing with a real change in the planet's climate or merely
moving through cycles heretofore unrecognized. After all, in terms
of accurate record-keeping, meteorology is a relatively new
science.
</P>
<P>
   Our long-term memory often proves untrustworthy in recreating
accurate pictures of our past. A week-long power outage caused by a
blizzard in February when we were 8 years old will color our
memories of winter for a lifetime. We might conjur up images of the
Klondike, home of Sergeant Preston and King, as we remember and
long for our nostalgic past.
</P>
<P>
   In those ringing days, there was always deep fresh morning snow
after nightly blizzards. The skiing was limitless. The winter life
as gay and robust as some old David Niven movie set in a Tyrolean
resort.
</P>
<P>
   But, back to the dismal reality of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sure there have been winters, and starts of winters, like this
one. Warm autumns, with unrelieved weeks of tepid soup that retards
natural cycles even of flower and insect. Check out your backyard.
</P>
<P>
   But no, we'll skip the global warming for now and take the easy
explanation. The warm autumn is just that, and made all the worse
because of heightened expectations of skiers with pent-up energy
carried over from last year's stingy season. And with the Christmas
week fast approaching, the collective knot in the stomach of the
ski industry is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Peak, one of the most naturally snowy mountains in the
Northeast, intends to open its new lift, the Green Mountain Flyer,
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,500-foot lift, designed to carry 2,600 skiers per hour,
was going to provide some free skiing Saturday for those attending
the opening celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. The celebration will take place sans the skiing and
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but with a little cold weather we'll have the
skiing going hopefully for the holidays,'' said Jay Peak spokeman
Conrad Klefos.
</P>
<P>
   The American Skiing Company, with its six New England and two
Rocky Mountain resorts, has put forth a bet with skiers. By the
holidays, says ASC chairman Les Otten boldly, ``We will have
snow.'' ASC areas have often touted guaranteed skiing, but this
year they are making an even greater promise to vacationing skiers
and boarders: ``If we can't give our guests at least 70 percent of
their mountain, we'll activate the guarantee,'' says Otten.
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee will give guests a 25 percent price reduction on
their next visit this season and a voucher worth up to $500 toward
a vacation at The Canyons in Utah or Steamboat in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is made to guests reserving a ski vacation between now
and Dec.
</P>
<P>
   24 and is good for vacations between Christmas and Jan. 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to ASC spokesman Skip King, the
resorts are taking the risk out of booking a ski vacation during
the holidays. ``We know people down there are concerned with the
amount of snow they're going to find,'' said King. ``Our bottom
line is if you go skiing over the holidays you'll have a good
time.'' The ASC guarantee applies to Sunday River, Sugarloaf/USA,
Killington, Mt.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, Sugarbush, and Attitash/Bear Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some resorts we can open four to six trails a day,'' said
King. ``And we're looking for some natural snow, too. We'll have
the stuff. If not we'll activate the guarantee.'' Hmmm, with 26 of
120 trails currently open at Sunday River, King is hoping that the
forecast for cold weather after this weekend will come true. With
about two weeks to Christmas, even at the rate of 4-6 trails a day,
70 percent coverage seems ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' says King. ``We've got our work cut out for us.
But if people get here, they'll have a good time.''
</P>

SKI-COLUMN &QL; 
By Tony Chamberlain, Globe Staff &QL; 
SPEED LIMITS IN PLACE; RESORTS GET SERIOUS WITH `HEADS UP' MOVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago at Killington, a speeding skier or
snowboarder might get a mild reprimand from a ski patroller. It was
a somewhat casual enforcement, patrol officials acknowledge, and
whenever the question of lifting a ticket came up, ``we'd give
skiers every benefit of the doubt,'' according to Killington
spokesman Steve Wright.
</P>
<P>
   This was pretty standard policy throughout ski country: Try to
maintain safe conditions, but also let skiers have their fun. At
the sprawling twin resorts of Vail and Beaver Creek in Colorado,
the Wild West spirit of point-'em-straight-down-and-go was widely
hailed as a skier's creedo for many years.
</P>
<P>
   But times change. This year at Killington, says Wright, ``the
ski patrol has the freedom to pull someone's ticket immediately if
they see the person acting recklessly.'' And at Vail, Killington's
Western counterpart, the National Ski Patrol has added a new safety
squad called the Yellow Jackets, dedicated to busting the fast and
reckless. To date this season, they have snatched more than 50
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for a new industry-wide campaign called Safety
Initiative 2000 or ``Heads Up'' may not have as much to do with
reality of skier safety, as public perception.
</P>
<P>
   Four agencies - the National Ski Areas Association, National Ski
Patrol, Profesional Ski Instructors of America, and Snowboard
Industries - all had a hand in creating the Heads Up campaign as a
unified effort to minimize skiing and snowboarding accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cornerstone of our safety message is that each one is
responsible for the choices (he makes) on the slopes,'' says Stacey
Gardner of the Ski Areas Association. ``Skiing is relatively
serious, and you have to be paying attention.'' But the campaign
has little to do with trends or fatality records. Since the 1970s,
reportable injuries on the slopes have been cut nearly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Better grooming, wider trails, and better equipment in the last
30 years of skiing's growth all are part of the safety picture.
</P>
<P>
   Skier fatalities or catastrophic accidents have been relatively
steady at about .8 per million skier visits. In an average winter,
about 50 million skiers and boarders hit the slopes, and the
average of 34 fatal crashes has been fairly constant. Last year, 39
deaths occurred in US ski country, highest number in the last four
years, but the year before, there were only 26 skier/rider
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the big safety push came because, according to National
Ski Areas of America spokesman Michael Berry, ``we're confronting
an old adage, `perception becomes reality.' `` Two years ago, when
Michael Kennedy and Sonny Bono died in ski crashes in the Rocky
Mountains, the media attention focused on skiing as never before,
Berry said. ``It didn't matter what the safety record had been up
to that time.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were celebrities, there was a new focus on skier
safety.'' Tim White, educational director for the National Ski
Areas Association in Denver and one of the architects of Heads Up,
says the campaign is largely aimed at people unfamiliar with
figures showing skiing to be among the safer outdoor sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that people are getting the wrong message about skiing
when all they hear about in the media is the most serious
incidents,'' said White. ``Our goal is to get our message out that
the industry has a wonderful safety record.'' The sport has always
suffered from the perennial broken leg joke. Just this year, said
White, a commerical was released showing a busload of happy skiers
showing up at the lodge. The next frame shows the bus returning
``with the skiers in neck braces, full body casts, and dripping
IV,'' White fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is how perceptions are created for people outside the
sport,'' he said. ``The LA Times and Wall Street Journal printed
some negative (editorials), and that is what we're trying to
confront with Heads Up.'' White, Berry, and members of the National
Ski Patrol agree that Heads Up is not a new approach as much as an
intensification of what has been ongoing safety policy at ski
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, they point out, most ski areas have established
``slow skiing'' zones, though enforcement has been uneven.
</P>
<P>
   White does not advocate a zero-tolerance policy that would
summarily tear the tickets off speeders. He would rather see
enforcement of the safety code on a case-by-case basis, and have
judgment become a part of the ski patroller's education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps for the first time (a skier or rider) breaks the
rules, he will get his ticket marked, then get it pulled on the
second offense. It's a case-by-case thing,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real message to people is that we are on the hill with
eyes that are watching.'' Interestingly, the National Ski Areas
Association does not take a definitive position on helmets, whose
popularity has soared the past two years, a fact often attributed
to the Kennedy and Bono deaths, which were caused by head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the position that helmets are a personal choice. A
helmet is a piece of equipment just the same as the equipment on
the feet and under them,'' said White. ``They certainly are not the
whole picture. We would be concerned if people feel a helmet is the
one answer to safety.''

 &HT;    Divorce mediator meets with Gingriches today
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich will try to reach
a divorce settlement today in their first face-to-face meeting
since theirsplit.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is scheduled to appear for a court-ordered mediation
session in Cobb County, Ga. The meeting will be held at the offices
of Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement today may be a lot to ask, however.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has yet to question under oath her estranged
husband's admitted girlfriend, Callista Bisek. Marianne Gingrich
and Mayoue have considered the deposition a key element of their
case. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich
has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Washington judge ordered Bisek to answer questions
under oath for Marianne Gingrich and provide documents related to
her affair with Gingrich. The documents include cards, phone
records and bank statements dating back to 1995, when Newt Gingrich
became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Gingrich and
Bisek, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, have
admitted they've been seeing each other for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has begun turning over the documents to Marianne Gingrich,
but the two sides have been unable to agree on a deposition date.
It's uncertain now whether Bisek's deposition will be taken at all
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he needs time to examine Bisek's documents, although
he originally demanded only that Bisek bring the documents to the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has not returned phone messages left at his office for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said this week that Gingrich is prepared to split the
couple's marital assets and pay his wife alimony. He said he wasn't
sure whether a settlement could actually be reached today, but he
said Gingrich is going into the mediation with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   A standing judicial order in Cobb Superior Court requires all
civil cases to be taken to mediation before they can be granted a
trial date. The Gingriches elected to use a mediator chosen by the
court's Alternative Dispute Resolution division, so there would be
no complaints later about how a mediator was selected.
</P>
<P>
   After today's session, the mediator will report to the court
whether the Gingriches have hit an impasse, reached a settlement or
made progress toward a divorce agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Said Evans: ``I would be surprised if the judge didn't order at
least one more mediation session before it goes to trial.''

 &HT;    HISTORIC ISRAEL, SYRIA PEACE TALKS GET OFF TO ROCKY START
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting a hopeful gaze toward reconciliation and a
wary eye on their blood-stained past, senior Israeli and Syrian
officials huddled with President Clinton Wednesday to try to forge
an end to a half-century of enmity and war.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes talks got off to a jarring start, though, when
Syria's senior negotiator
</P>
<P>
   blamed Israel for the discord, saying Israeli occupation of Arab
land was ``undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded at midday that talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
were no diplomatic picnic. Tensions ran so high that the men
refused even to shake hands at the outset of the talks, a standby
in diplomatic proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard going,'' Clinton told reporters when asked about his
morning meetings with the two officials. ``We've got work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks opened, Barak signaled that he was prepared to
pull troops from the occupied Golan Heights in exchange for
security guarantees and a new partnership with Syria, a country
that has fought Israel off-and-on since the inception of the Jewish
state 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step
forward toward peace,'' Barak told White House reporters at a Rose
Garden ceremony opening the talks. ``We are fully aware,'' of the
price Israel must pay to get there, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any doubt, Sharaa, said his country was prepared
to embrace Israel, but only after the Golan territories _ on
Israel's northeastern edge _ are restored in full to Syrian
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return
of all its occupied land,'' Sharaa said, as Barak stood by, his
face as stony and grey as the December skies.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa then gave his version of the land for peace formula at
the heart of the talks _ tacking on an icy jab at Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Israel,'' Sharaa said, ``peace will mean the end of the
psychological fear which the Israelis have been living in as a
result of the existence of occupation, which is undoubtedly the
source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Barak, who spoke before
Sharaa. However, the Syrian foreign minister's comments were not
well-received in Israel and were expected to make Barak's task of
convincing Israelis to accept a peace accord with Syria that much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa went on to assail the Western media, saying it focused on
the plight of Israelis while ``the vision of the Arabs and their
sufferings were totally ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those tribulations, said Sharaa, was the loss of homes by
half a million Syrians who were run off by Israeli troops occupying
the Golan Heights, ``where their forefathers lived for thousands of
years and their villages were totally wiped out from existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa then revisited the origins of the 1967 war, in which
Syria joined Jordan and Egypt in attacking Israel, alleging that
Israeli provocations along its border with Syria had helped to
incite the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli forces captured the Golan Heights, strategically
valuable territory in Syria's southwest corner, during the 1967
fighting. A United Nations resolution that year called on Israel to
return the territory to Syrian control in exchange for Syrian
acceptance of Israel's right to exist within secure borders.
</P>
<P>
   That so-called ``land for peace,'' formulation remains the
framework for the peace effort Clinton hopes to push forward during
this week's talks _ largely dedicated to charting a course for more
detailed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A peace accord between Syria and Israel is seen as one key to a
larger prize _ a comprehensive settlement between Israel and its
Arab foes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been trying since his first year in office to broker
peace among Israel and Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He remains hopeful of helping to shepherd the parties to an
overall peace accord before leaving office 13 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath oppressively grey skies on a cold and damp day, Clinton
led Barak and Sharaa into the Rose Garden for what he hoped would
be an upbeat beginning of admittedly difficult talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing today is not yet peace, and getting
there will require bold thinking and hard choices. But today is a
big step along that path,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history,'' he said, ``there is a chance
of a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and indeed, all
its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hopeful rhetoric, administration officials expected
difficulties during the talks, scheduled to continue on Thursday.
White House aides said they were encouraged that Barak and Sharaa _
the highest ranking Israeli and Syrian officials ever to negotiate
anything _ showed up at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected this to be easy. The issues are complicated,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. He said ``a lot
of work and a lot of intensive negotiations,'' lie ahead on the
road toward Israeli-Syrian peace.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``Today's meetings were indeed a breakthrough.
These are the highest level meetings ever between Israel and Syria
on any subject, much less peace between the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Barak and Sharaa met together for half an hour in the
Oval Office. Then Clinton met separately for about an hour with
each official, first Barak and then Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   While one met with Clinton, the other conferred with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then hosted further talks between the two leaders in
the Blair House, across the street from the White House, for most
of the afternoon before an early evening break. The talks were
supposed to resume at 7 p.m. EST, but White House officials said
negotiations would start up again Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Albright was scheduled to meet again with Barak in a
downtown hotel after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to discuss the substance of the talks, other
than to say that ``Both sides made clear their desire for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a former military commander elected earlier this year
largely on his pledge to try to negotiate peace among Palestinians,
Lebanon and Syria, appeared to set a conciliatory tone.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Barak told the Knesset, Israel's parliament, that the
country must brace itself to bear the ``high price'' for peace,
meaning the return of the Golan Heights to Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully aware of the opportunity, of the burden of
responsibility, and of the seriousness, determination and devotion
that will be needed in order to begin this march, together with our
Syrian partners,'' Barak said in the Rose Garden Wednesday, ``to
make a different Middle East, where nations are living side by side
in peaceful relationship and in mutual respect and
good-neighborliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa also struck a tone of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching the moment of truth,'' he said. ``We hope
that this is going to be the last resumption of negotiations, which
will be concluded with a peace agreement, a peace based on justice
and comprehensivity; an honorable peace for both sides that
preserves rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He seasoned those remarks, though, with his broadside attack on
Israel and its allies, continuing with a stark warning that a
failure to return the Golan would condemn the region to ``a
conflict of existence in which bloodshed can never stop.''

 &HT;    Turner seed money blossoms
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BO, Sierra Leone _ The initial loan to the Splendid Farmers
Association was only 500,000 leones _ about $268. But it has been
repaid several times over, and, to hear the women in the
association tell it, the benefits from that relatively small amount
of money continue to flow.
</P>
<P>
   The money started as a tiny drop in the oceanic portfolio of
Atlanta media magnate Ted Turner. From there it went to the U.N.
Foundation, which was set up to distribute Turner's gift of $1
billion over 10 years to U.N.-related projects. From the
foundation, it went to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund,
as part of a $500,000 grant ``to improve nutrition and household
food security for vulnerable groups in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   From UNICEF, the money was given to a relief and development
organization called Africare. From there, some of it made its way,
at least temporarily, into the pockets of of an association of 150
women who had been displaced by Sierra Leone's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   That loan, in 1998, was meant to help the members of the
Splendid Farmers Association, as the displaced women called
themselves, start some petty trading activities so they could feed
their children and buy some clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of providing poor women with small, unsecured loans was
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker and economic
professor who is now also a member of the U.N. Foundation board.
The theory, backed now by more than two decades of experience, is
that tiny loans can help poor women become permanently
self-sufficient _ and that they pay back the loans, with interest,
as reliably as any other group.
</P>
<P>
   The money then becomes a revolving fundF, using Turner's money,
has delivered eight of the graters, and seven more are on the way.

 &HT;    HISTORIC ISRAEL, SYRIA PEACE TALKS GET OFF TO ROCKY START

 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting a hopeful gaze toward reconciliation and a
wary eye on their blood-stained past, senior Israeli and Syrian
officials huddled with President Clinton Wednesday to try to forge
an end to a half-century of enmity and war.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes talks got off to a jarring start, though, when
Syria's senior negotiator
</P>
<P>
   blamed Israel for the discord, saying Israeli occupation of Arab
land was ``undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded at midday that talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
were no diplomatic picnic. Tensions ran so high that the men
refused even to shake hands at the outset of the talks, a standby
in diplomatic proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard going,'' Clinton told reporters when asked about his
morning meetings with the two officials. ``We've got work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks opened, Barak signaled that he was prepared to
pull troops from the occupied Golan Heights in exchange for
security guarantees and a new partnership with Syria, a country
that has fought Israel off-and-on since the inception of the Jewish
state 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step
forward toward peace,'' Barak told White House reporters at a Rose
Garden ceremony opening the talks. ``We are fully aware,'' of the
price Israel must pay to get there, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any doubt, Sharaa, said his country was prepared
to embrace Israel, but only after the Golan territories _ on
Israel's northeastern edge _ are restored in full to Syrian
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return
of all its occupied land,'' Sharaa said, as Barak stood by, his
face as stony and grey as the December skies.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa then gave his version of the land for peace formula at
the heart of the talks _ tacking on an icy jab at Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Israel,'' Sharaa said, ``peace will mean the end of the
psychological fear which the Israelis have been living in as a
result of the existence of occupation, which is undoubtedly the
source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Barak, who spoke before
Sharaa. However, the Syrian foreign minister's comments were not
well-received in Israel and were expected to make Barak's task of
convincing Israelis to accept a peace accord with Syria that much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa went on to assail the Western media, saying it focused on
the plight of Israelis while ``the vision of the Arabs and their
sufferings were totally ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those tribulations, said Sharaa, was the loss of homes by
half a million Syrians who were run off by Israeli troops occupying
the Golan Heights, ``where their forefathers lived for thousands of
years and their villages were totally wiped out from existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa then revisited the origins of the 1967 war, in which
Syria joined Jordan and Egypt in attacking Israel, alleging that
Israeli provocations along its border with Syria had helped to
incite the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli forces captured the Golan Heights, strategically

 &HT;    Changes at pinnacle of Coca-Cola a hot topic

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It seems everybody has taken a crack at explaining the
surprise retirement of Coca-Cola's M. Douglas Ivester. Now Business
Week (Dec. 20) takes its shot.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem, the magazine ventures, is Ivester's
background. ``An accountant by training, Ivester knew the math, but
not the music, required to run the world's leading marketing
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Also behind the move, says Business Week, is the issue of a No.
2 executive at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   On the cover: How and why regional shopping malls are becoming
like amusement parks.

<P>
   Forbes (Dec. 27) invokes the name of Benjamin Graham in offering
``eight investing rules that have stood the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, credited as the father of modern security analysis, had
a theory that flies in the face of the Internet craze but still
makes sense today, Forbes says. His theory was that you shouldn't
buy a stock just because it is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Forbes: A little literary license is used to explore
what the pieces of General Electric would be worth if the company
were to be broken up after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jack Welch retires.

   Every magazine seems to have its own list of ``greatest stocks
to own'' in the next millennium. Mutual Funds (January) offers a
twist.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine picked up ideas from the well-known and powerful,
including Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown economist Edward Yardeni and
Sheryl Pressler, chief investment officer for the California Public
Employees' Retirement System. The magazine then suggested a handful
of funds that represent investments along the lines each investment

</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor (January) offers its list of stocks you

of 79.7 percent, the magazine notes.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor picked 25 stocks, in five different
``sectors,'' so to speak. The magazine identified five
``highfliers,'' those with the wind at their backs; five stocks in
the ``bargain bin''; five that haven't shown up on Wall Street's
radar; five that represent ``turnaround plays''; and five more that
analysts regard with lukewarm feelings.

&HT;     NAVY SAYS IKE BATTLE GROUP WILL BE READY FOR GULF  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER _ The Navy battle fleet led by
this aircraft carrier wrapped up training for the Persian Gulf on
Wednesday, with senior commanders declaring that the armada will be
ready for possible combat in Iraq even though the force was denied
live-fire exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders said they plan final live-fire combat training at
target ranges on the Italian island of Sardinia or in Scotland as
the battle group heads for patrol duties in the Persian Gulf to
enforce the allied ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The force of 15,000 sailors, air crews and Marines aboard 16
ships began returning to port for the Christmas season after
concluding sharply modified combat training along the Atlantic
Coast. The fleet begins departing for the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy suspended training at the 58-year-old Vieques target
range following a fatal bombing mishap in April that rallied Puerto
Rico's political leaders to demand cessation of bombardment and
Navy withdrawal from 22,000 acres of Navy-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello failed to
negotiate an agreement that would allow the bombing range to be
reopened in time for the Eisenhower battle group's Navy strike
pilots, naval gunnery crews and Marines of the three-day combat
rehearsal that has been carried out by every departing battle fleet
for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. William Fallon, commander of the Atlantic-based 2nd
Fleet, and Rear Adm. John Foley III, commander of the battle group,
said that adaptations in the forces' training during the two-week
exercise completed Wednesday _ coupled with additional live-fire
training for the battle group en route to the Persian Gulf _ should
enable the armada to be fully combat ready by the time it arrives
in the Persian Gulf in March.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon, a three-star admiral, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday that the Eisenhower battle group will set sail ``not in
the state of readiness that I want.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the additional training en route should make
the force ``ready to go'' when it reaches the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   He said the training shortfalls caused by the absence of Vieques
training included air-to-ground attack, naval gunfire support and
coordinated fire support for Marines' amphibious landing.
</P>
<P>
   But after the training en route, ``They are going to be in
pretty good shape _ very good shape. They got the foundation here.
What they'll need is the end game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the two-star admiral who commands the battle group at
sea, said he was ``comfortable taking this battle group on
deployment to the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf'' as long as
his forces obtained the additional training that is planned at
either Cape Wrath, Scotland or Capoteulado, Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the eight surface warships accompanying the Eisenhower
must each fire about 100 rounds of explosive, 5-inch ammunition to
requalify for their naval gunfire support mission. Foley said he
also hopes to provide pilots additional training for air-to-ground
attacks in Sardinia and possibly stage a combined, integrated air,
sea and amphibious assault including Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crown jewel question is, `Will we be ready to deploy?'''
Foley said. ``Yes, we will be ready to deploy. That last piece of
training will do that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley spoke on the flag officers' bridge as he surveyed
warplanes landing and taking off from the Eisenhower's 4.5-acre
flight deck during simulated U.S. combat operations in a war
scenario involving the fictitious countries of Koronan, Kartunan
and Floridian laid out along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques target range, an 899-acre site on the picturesque
island located between Puerto Rico and St. Croix, has been closed
since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly targeted the range
observation post, killing Navy contract security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four civilian workers on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have camped out on the target range ever since,
staging a peaceful civil disobedience protest that has thwarted
resumption of combat training.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon diverted the Eisenhower battle group from scheduled
training on Vieques on Dec. 3 and ordered it to carry out its final
pre-deployment training along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier-based pilots from squadrons with colorful combat
monikers such as Knighthawks, Red Rippers and Pukin' Dogs bombed
target ranges in North Carolina and Florida with explosive and
non-explosive bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Marines stormed ashore at Camp Lejeune, N.C. ,
without rehearsing battlefield coordination with warplanes, which
were forced to strike targets at a bombing range some 30 miles
away. Surface warships used computers to simulate naval gunfire
from 5-inch deck guns to support the Marines' assault, without
firing a single shell off North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Richard D. Jaskot, commander of the six dozen
warplanes aboard the Eisenhower, said his pilots have dropped only
about 40 percent of the heavy bombs and live ordnance that they
dropped on Vieques and other ranges during pre-deployment training
aboard the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jaskot said between 30 and 40 of the air wing's strike pilots
are leaving for the Persian Gulf without the benefit of
unencumbered live-fire bombing experience that has been available
on Vieques. Pilots in the latest exercise were forced to fly
tortuous bombing runs from the Eisenhower through congested East
Coast commercial air corridors to reach target ranges in North
Carolina and Florida, a task requiring pilots to constantly switch
mental gears from combat to civilian aviation to combat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jaskot said, thanks to the additional training en route to
the Persian Gulf, his pilots should be ready for possible combat
operations when they arrive there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm in the mode where I'll take whatever training I
can get, wherever I can get it,'' said Jaskot. ``We'll be ready.
We'll do everything we can to be as ready as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Steve Kreiser, 34, an FA-18 Hornet pilot based at
Oceana, Va., says training has been less demanding without Vieques
but his squadron will be ready nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good at making do and making it work,'' said Kreiser,
who flew combat missions against Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.
``Are we still good enough to go over and do the work? Yes. But I
don't think we're as good as we could be. That's probably something
you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft carriers operating in the Persian Gulf enforce
Operation Southern Watch, an air patrol and surveillance operation
over southern Iraq designed to prevent operations by the remnants
of the Iraqi air force. Iraqi forces routinely harass and target
U.S. warplanes with anti-aircraft radar, often provoking U.S.
pilots to respond with anti-radar missiles or bombs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplanes, including carrier-based Navy aircraft and
land-based Air Force planes, have engaged Iraqi forces at least 65
times so far this year, according to Pentagon statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy admirals' assessment of the fleet's eventual readiness
for combat contrasted with earlier warnings by Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration was looking for ways to design
training for the Navy without using Vieques, Fallon had warned that
realistic live-fire combat training on Vieques was essential.
</P>
<P>
   Closure of the range on Vieques and the ``lack of suitable
substitute training ranges is severely inhibiting the ability to
prepare our people without substantial increase in risk,'' Fallon
warned the Senate Armed Services Committee's panel on seapower on
Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said on Wednesday that he did not ``like the precedent''
of sending naval forces to sea without completing all of their
final combat training. ``To send people forward without this
training is just not in our best interest. We're putting additional
risk on our people that we shouldn't be putting on their backs.''

 &HT;    Nortel buying Qtera in $3.25 billion deal
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nortel Networks said Wednesday it is buying Qtera, a
South Florida optical network equipment maker, for up to $3.25
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Canadian-based Nortel a company with no product
on the market and no revenue, but loads of potential.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to close early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, Manning &AMP; Martin, the Atlanta law firm that handled
United Parcel Service's initial public offering, represented Qtera
in the deal. It has handled Qtera since the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera is developing ways to send voice and data over light waves
through fiber-optic wires. Most of the data sent over fiber-optic
lines need to be regenerated every few hundred feet. Qtera's
equipment can send data over fiber-optic lines almost 2,000 feet
without regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Firms like Qtera are developing the tools that companies like
Nortel and Lucent will use in the next generation of high-speed
networks _ which will handle increasingly heavy Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's acquisition is the latest among several networking
equipment firms attracting attention recently. In November, Cisco
Systems bought Cerent for $7 billion. Sycamore Networks went public
in October. The Massachusetts-based company has a market
capitalization of more than $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera was started in 1998. About 30 percent of the firm is owned
by its management and employees. The rest is owned by venture
capital investors, including Battery Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel executives said in a morning conference call that they
expect Qtera, which will be run as a separate business unit, to
start earning revenue within six months.

 &HT;    Turner hangs on to big idea of buying broadcast network
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly 15 years after his failed attempt to buy
CBS, Ted Turner would still love to own one of the big four
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be big, then let's be big and own one of
everything,'' said Turner, referring to Time Warner Inc. ``I'd make
a great Noah. I want two of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is vice chairman of Time Warner. He quickly added that
his company didn't necessarily share his desire for a television
network. ``This is just me speaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner made his comments on the opening panel of the Western
Show, one of the cable TV industry's biggest conventions. It runs
through Thursday and has attracted some 30,000 industry executives.
Among those attending are executives from Atlanta-based companies
such as Turner Broadcasting, Cox Communications, Scientific-Atlanta
and the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Turner, the opening panel featured a stellar
lineup of industry leaders. They included CNN commentator Jeff
Greenfield, who moderated the panel; USA Networks Chairman Barry
Diller; and Michael Bloomberg, founder of the financial news
service that carries his name.
</P>
<P>
   The star, of course, was Turner _ and he quickly stole the show.
Asked by Greenfield what Time Warner needed, Turner quickly
responded that a broadcast network would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doesn't Time Warner already have one in the WB?''
countered Greenfield, referring to the fledgling service that
features youth-oriented shows.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Turner. ``It doesn't have news. It doesn't have
sports. It's better than nothing, but the WB is not a true
network,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   That Turner wants to buy a network, say NBC, is no secret within
the media industry. But it's also no secret that other Time Warner
executives are skeptical. Turner has yet to marshal enough support
within his company to mount a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has always enjoyed poking fun at conventional thinking,
and his target Wednesday was interactive television, touted as one
of the next big opportunities for cable. Two-way television,
available through new digital networks, lets viewers use TVs to
order products, send e-mail and even change the outcome of shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a push of a button you can change the outcome of a game
so that your team always wins,'' said Turner. ``And if you ignore
the news, you could take your team to a championship. Of course,
that's not real. People will still want to be just entertained by
television. Interactivity is not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   With a snicker, Greenfield interjected, ``That computer would
have not helped the Atlanta Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, a Time Warner employee based in Atlanta, was
referring to the Braves' World Series defeat this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On one issue dear to cable TV executives, Turner supported the
industry consensus. That issue is open access, referring to opening
the industry's digital cable networks to other services, such as
those providing Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, MindSpring and some government officials
advocate open access, while the cable television industry opposes
it. ``It's our wire, and we'll do what we want with it _ unless, of
course, we're forced to do otherwise,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   His fighting words were greeted with applause from the several
hundred cable TV executives watching the panel at the auditorium in
the Los Angeles Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Turner described open access as one of several big challenges
facing the industry. Another is direct broadcast satellite
providers, such as DirecTV, which has some 11 million subscribers.
It is growing by 200,000 subscribers nationwide a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of threats, but cable is holding the
distribution high ground,'' said Turner. ``The game is ours to
lose.''

   OK, so it's not technically the millennium. People who spend
their time telling us that calendars skipped a year as they went
from 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 tell us we don't hit the millennium until
next year, New Year's Eve 2000. Hooey. We're still going to party
like it's 1999, for I was dreaming when I wrote this, forgive me if
it goes astray. (Sorry, but a Y2K bug in our system inserts Prince
lyrics into every applicable story.) But will everyone be welcoming
2000 in a big way? To find out, we asked some well-known folks and

McCAIN AGAIN TACKLES SOFT MONEY CONTRIBUTIONS ON EVE OF TOWN FORUM 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Getting a jump on a campaign finance town
forum Thursday with Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley,
Republican contender John McCain said Wednesday that purging large
sums of money from the political system would allow his party to
better pursue its conservative goals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used a speech in South Carolina to rebut charges from
many in his party, including GOP front-runner George W. Bush, that
his proposals to eliminate soft money contributions would make it
harder for the Republican Party to compete with Democrats, who
benefit from union money.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to the unregulated contributions given to
political parties, who are supposed to use it for party building.
In recent years, both parties have used the money indirectly to
help their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that huge contributions from special interest have
made it harder for Republicans to accomplish their agenda of
trimming wasteful spending from the federal budget and ridding the
tax code of loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Washington soft-money game, big business and big labor
amplices, working together to protect the mushy middle of
big government, with plenty of special-interest plums: big unions
get big spending; and big business gets corporate welfare and
special tax breaks _ all at the expense of average Americans,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, however, acknowledged concerns that Bush
raised in Monday night's Iowa debate that eliminating soft money
would put the GOP at a disadvantage because organized labor runs
its own independent campaigns for Democrats financed by union dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands now, the only institutions that can take your
money without your knowledge are the IRS and the labor unions,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would bar unions from taking members' dues for
political purposes without getting written permission. But he added
he would place the same restrictions on corporations that use their
shareholders' money on behalf of political campaigns and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments provided a preview of the discussion expected
Thursday in Claremont, N.H., where both McCain and Bradley will
participate in a town meeting hosted by ABC-TV's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual bipartisan summit by two primary candidates is
taking place at the same senior citizens center where President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich shook hands in June
1995 and agreed to form a blue-ribbon commission on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   That panel never materialized. Congress is in a stalemate over
campaign finance reform. The Republican leadership has blocked the
changes, including the ban on soft money, proposed by McCain and
Sen. Russell Feingold, R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign finance advocates say McCain and Bradley are
equally shrewd when it comes to fund-raising. Both have raised
prodigious sums of money for their presidential campaign, much of
it from individuals who work for corporations who have interests in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to the center, McCain raised $9.2 million as of Nov.
1, much of it from executives of companies who have interest in
legislation before the Senate Commerce Committee, which McCain
chairs. His top contributors work for such communications and
financial giants as Viacom, US West, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., and
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said that the Commerce Committee has oversight over
so many companies it would be hard to avoid contributions from
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   This year, executives and the families of those who worked at
Goldman Sachs also gave $209,500 to Bradley's campaign, the biggest
bundle delivered to any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised $18 million so far, not far behind the $24
million collected by Gore, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, soft money contributions have fattened the war
chests of both political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of 1999, the Republican Party committees
raised $30.9 million in soft money, a 42 percent increase over the
fist six months of the 1997-98 election cycle, according to the
Federal Election Commission. During the same period the Democratic
Party committees raised $26.4 million, a 93 percent increase from
the last election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   By pounding on the campaign finance reform theme Bradley and
McCain have scored points with independent voters who now comprise
the largest chunk of the electorate in the first primary state of
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts say that this appeal to independents has helped
McCain inch ahead of Bush and given Bradley a lead over Vice
President Al Gore in several surveys.

Soundtrack/``Magnolia'' (Reprise)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former 'Til Tuesday singer Aimee Mann's cynical love songs
played an unusually large part in the development of Paul Thomas
Anderson's remarkable new film, ``Magnolia,'' which hits screens
today.
</P>
<P>
   The director says the screenplay was actually an adaptation of
some of Mann's material. Taken apart from the movie, these new Mann
tracks, including ``Save Me,'' ``Build That Wall'' and ``You Do,''
are memorable, but once you see how they're woven into
``Magnolia,'' they resonate deeply. Standout cut ``Wise Up,'' for
example, touches so closely on the film's central themes that, in a
highly affecting sequence, Anderson has every major character
singing along to the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Along with eight Mann originals, the recommended ``Magnolia''
soundtrack includes a marvelous rendition of the Harry Nilsson
perennial ``One,'' a pair of Supertramp numbers (``Goodbye
Stranger'' and ``Logical Song'') we could've frankly done without
and selections from Jon Brion's moody score. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
Django Reinhardt/``The Complete Django Reinhardt and Quintet of the
Hot Club of France Swing/HMV Sessions (1936-48)'' (Mosaic)
</P>
<P>
   The great gypsy guitarist Reinhardt is mentioned often in Woody
Allen's bittersweet new film, ``Sweet &AMP; Lowdown,'' and, hopefully,
a new interest in his music will result. This wonderful six-disc
box from the mail-order-only Mosaic label collects 118 tracks from
Django's most productive years as a solo performer and in duet with
violinist Stephane Grappelli.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely rhythmic and amazingly nimble _ despite having just
three fingers on his fretting hand _ Reinhardt is much admired for
incorporating be-bop idioms and harmonies in his highly nuanced
playing. ``The Complete Django Reinhardt'' is a complete delight.
To order, call (203) 327-7111, or e-mail mosrec(AT)mindspring.com.
4 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
Perla Batalla/``Mestiza'' (Mechuda Music)
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Monica-born singer of Mexican descent, sultry-voiced
Batalla sang backup for Leonard Cohen, k.d. lang and others. For
her second album, chosen best of 1999 by amazon.com, Batalla's
unusually expressive and soulful delivery help put across a warm
song cycle that traces Mexico's spiritual history.
</P>
<P>
   Influences include gypsy, folk, gospel and pop on such crossover
winners as ``Scarlet Thread'' and ``Iberia,'' tracks that add new
colors to the world music spectrum. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
Errol Garner/``Collection'' (Telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Garner is best-known for writing ``Misty,'' but he was also a
terrific pianist, creating a wide-ranging, vast body of work that
incorporated a number of styles into a fresh voice that was his
own. Telarc has been reissuing Garner's catalog since 1994; this
six-disc collection features those dozen albums, which are also
available separately.
</P>
<P>
   The swinging, evocative music within is remarkably consistent in
quality and features some of Garner's best work _ ``Now Playing: A
Night at the Movies,'' ``Dreamstreet'' and ``One World Concert''
are among the great albums included. And, yes, ``Misty'' is here
among the many standards and 28 original compositions. No one will
be disappointed. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
Sheryl Crow and Friends/``Live in Central Park''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Crow headlined a free concert in New York's
Central Park, where various famous friends dropped by for duets.
The best of this gutsy set of greatest hits and all-star jams
include a countrified ``Strong Enough'' featuring the Dixie Chicks,
a cover of Fleetwood Mac's ``Gold Dust Woman'' with Stevie Nicks,
and Chrissie Hynde playing guitar and sharing the microphone on the
Crow hit ``If It Makes You Happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added treat, Eric Clapton lets loose with the Cream
classic ``White Room.'' A good time was had by all. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
Notorious B.I.G./``Born Again'' (Bad Boy)
</P>
<P>
   In rock and rap, nobody stays dead for long. In this second
posthumous release from the former Christopher Wallace _ aka
Notorious B.I.G. _ an all-star cast including Snoop Dogg, Lil' Kim,
Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep, Nas and Busta Rhymes is digitally reunited
with the murdered New York rapper for a set that's long on cliche
and short on innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with lots of so-so hard-core rap, there's a monologue by
Biggie's mom that only the most loyal fan will want to hear twice.
``Born Again'' will see some chart action but the disc will have
none of the shelf life of Biggie's landmark 1997 release, ``Life
After Death.'' 2 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
Lester Young/``The Complete Studio Sessions on Verve'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that, like Elvis Presley, tenor sax
man Lester Young was never the same after his stint in the Army and
that is true _ to a point. Young, who made his name playing with
Count Basie and Billie Holiday in the '30s, suffered what he
describes as ``one mad nightmare'' during his year in the service
from 1944-45. But this eight-disc package shows he had plenty of
fire left, adapting his swing style to bebop (his earlier
recordings actually helped build that sound) and creating a number
of fine records.
</P>
<P>
   His collaborators here include Nat King Cole and Buddy Rich in
some excellent early postwar trio sessions, the Oscar Peterson Trio
and, later, trumpeters ``Sweets'' Edison and Roy Eldridge. Young
wasn't always inspired during his Verve dates; toward the end, he
just sounds tired. But the music typically has plenty of feeling
and lyricism, showing why Young will always be considered one of
the giants of jazz. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
Angie Stone ``Black Diamond'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   From the cover picture with her giant 'fro and clothing straight
outta Sly's attic to the lush string arrangements and wah-wah
guitars inside, Angie Stone's album screams old-school soul heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is cinched by a guest appearance from musical excavator
Lenny Kravitz and by a cover of Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man.''
Highlights are everywhere, including the wistful ``Coulda Been
You,'' the funky ''Visions,'' and another great ballad in ``No More
Rain (In This Cloud).'' Fans of '70s Philly and Motown sounds will
warm quickly to this slow-groove soul for late night with your
lover. Sweet stuff. 3 stars &QL; 
_ David Bloom &QR; 
David Bowie ``hours ...'' (Virgin Records)
</P>
<P>
   The English chameleon made a splash by making this oddly subdued
CD available initially on the Web only, part of an ongoing series
of online experiments on Bowie's part that have included not only
his own Web site, but his own Internet service provider, Bowie.com,
among other gambits.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opening song, ``Thursday's Child,'' is a winner, worth
buying as an individual MP-3 (selling music on the Web is welcoming
the single back into the entertainment-biz lexicon after its death
in the post-vinyl CD era).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of this music is all right, rather lugubrious
and slow moving, and sometimes pretty or moderately interesting _
but not nearly enough to demand your attention, which is something
one never used to say about Bowie. Maybe he needs to spend less
time breaking ground in new media and more time crafting better old
media. 2 stars &QL; 
_ David Bloom &QR; 
Grateful Dead ``So Many Roads (1965-1995)'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this handsomely done collection, or
something nearly as encyclopedic, hasn't come out before now,
almost five years after the band split in the wake of Jerry
Garcia's death. Five discs of performances pulled from virtually
every conceivable corner of the band's history, including studio
work, rehearsals, sound checks and live jams, from its early Autumn
Records sides to its last concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, given the band's road-warrior status, much of this
music was recorded live, and it nicely captures the ensemble's
improvisational power. To help put it all in perspective, the
handsome boxed set also comes with annotation about each track and
a separate booklet of essays by several noted writers and critics
on the band's place in the musical firmament.
</P>
<P>
   If you're ever going to get what made the band such a durable
American icon, both in and off to the side of mainstream culture
over three decades, it likely will be here. 4 stars &QL;

`BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR': LOSING THE PAIN IN THE RHYTHMS OF GYPSY
MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potent testament to the infectious spirit of music is offered by
two documentaries that begin a two-week run Thursday in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-minute ``Black and White in Color,'' a Czech film
directed by Mira Erdevicki-Charap, portrays the formidable Gypsy
singer Vera Bila; and the 15-minute ``Ziganska Musica,'' a German
film directed by Joachim Kreck and Detelina Grigorova-Kreck, takes
as its subject an electric Gypsy band, Trustenik, and its
clarinetist, Philip Simeonov, called Fekata.
</P>
<P>
   If music is the strength of these films, their weakness resides
in the narrowness of their focus, in decisions that have more to do
with design that remains almost steadfastly on the visual and aural
surface of their subjects and declines to explore the personal and
ethnological questions each raises.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Ms. Bila and Trustenik as their centerpieces, these
films are enjoyable on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bila, an enormous woman who calls herself a typical Romany,
is a force to be reckoned with. In Prague, Paris and Germany she
attracts a devoted following, but as depicted in ``Black and White
in Color,'' she lives in a shabby apartment, pawns belongings to
deal with her debts and worries about the future of a son in jail
for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sing about the troubles I have,'' she says at one point
as she explains her soulful magic.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as Ms. Bila occupies center stage, either singing or
shopping barefoot in the streesiting a ramshackle community
where she hopes to find a wife for the betterment of her son,
``Black and White in Color'' remains arresting.
</P>
<P>
   When it turns its attention elsewhere, as to the members of her
band, Kale, its energy falters. And in portraying Ms. Bila, the
film raises questions about her and about Gypsy culture that remain
frustratingly unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziganska Musica,'' filled with the energy of folk, jazz and
rock 'n' roll, unfolds nearly wordlessly at a Gypsy wedding in
northern Bulgaria. As the busy camera darts among the sometimes
self-conscious participants while they dance, eat, sing and bestow
gifts, it also turns its attention to the band and to those
villagers who watch the proceedings with curiosity, longing and
vicarious joy from behind a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the music gives pleasure, but curiosity about these
people, their lives and their customs remains unsatisfied. &QL;

   &UR; MIDEAST TALKS &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans a page of coverage on the beginning of
talks between Israel and Syria and their ramifications in the
Mideast and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ Israel and Syria resumed peace
negotiations that stalled nearly four years ago, with the modest
goal of surviving and making plans to move beyond two days of
breaking the ice in a relationship long frozen by mutual mistrust.
By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-U.S. (Washingon) _ Peace is a costly proposition. Any
agreement reached in the current Israel-Syria talks is certain to
entail huge costs _ to monitor security arrangements, to relocate
Israeli settlers and to bolster the Syrian economy. If the past is
any guide, the United States will bear the lion's share of the
burden. And if negotiations ultimately succeed, President Clinton
will face the prospect of trying to win billions of dollars to pay
for peace from an ideologically charged Congress that is loath to
grant Clinton any victories, especially in a presidential election
year. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ Two key Israeli Cabinet ministers
said they may pull their small but influential parties out of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's ruling coalition if he agrees to return the
Golan Heights to Syria. ``I think at some point that it will become
impossible to stay in the government,'' Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky, the leader of the Yisrael B'aliyah party, said Wednesday
night. Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, head of the National
Religious Party, met with Sharansky Wednesday morning in what he
termed an effort to ``coordinate'' their opposition to a Golan
Heights withdrawal, expected to be the linchpin of the prime
minister's planned peace accord. By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-SYRIA (Damascus) _ It was 32 years ago that Israeli
forces drove Syrians by the many thousands from the Golan Heights.
Today, many of those same Syrians were fixing eyes and ears at
Washington, in the hope they were witnessing a watershed. ``People
are exhausted by this stalemate,'' said Ali Rahil, the headmaster
of a primary school outside Damascus, who was relying on a
satellite dish to monitor the news from abroad. ``They want the
talks to move forward.'' Still, with Israeli-Syrian negotiations
once again under way after a 45-month break, the Syrian government
has been trying to keep optimism in check. By Douglas Jehl.

&HT;     NINERS NEED NEW BLOOD IN FRONT OFFICE

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ When this disaster of a season finally
ends around midnight on Jan. 3, it's imperative that the San
Francisco 49ers make the right moves toward rebuilding their
once-mighty franchise. Whether that means finding a new quarterback
or a new set of cornerbacks or a new general manager, they have to
get it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate having another year like this,'' said John
McVay, the club's director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   At least, they hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Getting it right means having a clear idea of who's in charge
upstairs. Is it John York or Bill
</P>
<P>
   Walsh or some murky combination thereof?
</P>
<P>
   York, husband of owner Denise DeBartolo York, seems to enjoy
this ownership thing; it is, after all, a rather exclusive club.
However, he doesn't seem to be too cozy with Walsh, the general
manager who has a long history with the club juxtaposed against
York's recent involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his three-year contract, Walsh is not a lock to return
in 2000. He's 68, for one, and in charge of a fading franchise that
will take several years to rebuild. Does a man of his
accomplishments want to go through that again when the job is so
daunting?
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there is a feeling within the 49ers' organization
that Walsh actually wants York to fire him to relieve him of the
responsibility of running the show when the show is about to be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the front office are also 68, McVay and
Bill McPherson, director of pro personnel. That's a lot of wisdom
and experience but is the vigor for the job still there? Not to be
ageist, mind you. As per his contract, McVay will scale back to
three days a week next year and two days a week the year after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Might a younger presence be needed here? Someone like Matt
Millen? There's nobody quite like Millen, in football or any other
perversion of life. He's an American original. This is a man who
dresses like he was tossed naked into a Salvation Army bin and told
to find some clothes. The only time he combs his hair is when he
goes on camera for a Fox broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers issued the standard denials about rumors that Millen
might be interested in working for them in an executive capacity.
The party line is that the front office will remain as it is, with
Walsh, McVay and director of player personnel/meteorologist Terry
Donahue in charge of everything above the coaching level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know from him if he put anything out,'' said
coach Steve Mariucci, who played phone tag with Millen on Tuesday.
``I certainly didn't and our organization didn't. I can understand
why some of these rumors would exist. He almost considered it last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen is as sharp as they come in evaluating football and
football players. He played the game, he knows what an NFL player
looks like, he knows absolutely everybody in the game and, with a
rare misanthropic exception or two, everybody likes him.
</P>
<P>
   He's someone you would want on your team, whether as a player or
someone in charge of evaluating players. Millen and Mariucci are
friends. It seems they'd get along if joined in common toil on the
second floor of the Marie P. DeBartolo Sports Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone were to leave the organization, obviously you want
to consider all the best candidates,'' Mariucci said. ``I don't
know if he's ready to make a move like that. He has a heck of a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   That job has made Millen a valuable resource around the league.
In his role as an analyst and broadcaster, he knows every team's
personnel. He knows whether Baltimore's long snapper is worth a
spit. He knows if Kansas City's left tackle can handle a speed
rusher. He knows who's been naughty and who's been nice. Why, if
you gave him a Santa suit he would wear it if it meant he didn't
have to buy or launder his own clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt is a very astute guy,'' McVay said. ``I like him.
Everybody loved him when he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in their history, maybe the 49ers need a little
hybrid vigor in the form of Millen, someone who could graft onto
the organization to make the whole thing stronger and more vital.
</P>
<P>
   Everything hinges on what Walsh wants to do, or what the Yorks
want him to do. Has he had enough or does he have one more surge of
brilliance left?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have fallen so far so fast they have to be concerned
not with the big picture but with their own little division, the
NFC West. With those skilled offensive players, the Rams could be
dominant for years to come. George Seifert has the Panthers playing
well after a slow start. The Falcons should get a healed Jamal
Anderson back next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' Mariucci said of the coming
offseason. ``We have to be right on most of our acquisitions and we
have to work well together.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's a pointed comment directed at Walsh, the old master
better have thick skin or a padded suit. This is no time to be
jolly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In mock surrender, Clippers coach Chris Ford
opened his postgame _ or postmortem _ press conference Tuesday
night by leaning rigidly against a concrete wall in the bowels of
the Staples Center with one arm outstretched, as if preparing to
face a firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   If his players had been doing the shooting, his safety would
have been guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's good-humored grace under misfire aside, the Clippers
played as if they had been issued blindfolds, and as a result, they
opened new vistas of horrors, even by this franchise's execrable
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the first meeting between housemates at the new arena shared
by the two Los Angeles NBA residents, the Clippers needed to rally
in order to escape with mere humiliation in the form of a 95-68
thrashing by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the worst franchise in league history added to
its lugubrious legacy by pouring in 19 points in the first half _
an NBA record low since the shot clock was implemented in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully knocking the New Orleans Jazz _ who scored 20 points
in a half against Seattle on Jan. 4, 1975, and eventually had to
leave town _ out of the outhouse, the Clippers piled up 3 points in
the second quarter. Only a 10-foot jumper by Michael Olowokandi at
8:28 and a free throw by Lamar Odom at 6:27 prevented the Clippers
from pulling off basketball's version of a no-hitter. Odom's
freebie ruined their bid for a dreadful double because it left them
with 1 more point in a quarter than the record low established by
their fellow NBA stalwarts, the Dallas Mavericks, against the
Lakers in 1997. Obviously, Odom, the rookie from the University of
Rhode island, has no sense of history. So the Clippers had to
content themselves with the mark for fewest points in a second
quarter, bettering (worsening?) the 5 by the Utah Jazz (they could
escape New Orleans, but not their sharpshooting inheritance) in
1981 and the New York Knicks last season.
</P>
<P>
   To Clippers guard and Providence College alumnus Eric Murdock,
the performance was worthy of ``making you want to hide your
face.'' That's what the Clippers appeared to be doing before they
took their shots _ and missed 17 of 18 _ in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't exactly light up the night, scoring just 17
points in Period 2, but they still owned a 30-point lead at the
half as the Clippers shot 18.4 percent (7 for 38), the worst ever
by a Laker opponent. In fact, Lakers coach Phil Jackson's biggest
concern was that whatever the Clippers were doing might be
contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came apart at the seams,'' he said. ``For a young team as
talented as they are, they can do a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   No NBA team has done worse, and the Clippers nearly stretched
their mastery of misery to a full 48 minutes. Improbably, they
expanded their deficit to 34 points, 80-36, after three quarters
and were on pace to fall into the cellar for post-shot-clock
scoring: 49 points by the Chicago Bulls against Miami last April.
By the time the last 12 minutes rolled around, the Laker Girls'
uniforms were getting progressively skimpier, but it was the
Clippers who were being undressed.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackson philanthropically went to his scrubs, giving
Shaquille O'Neal (21 points, 19 rebounds) _ who had made Olowokandi
(13 points, 10 rebounds) look like a foreign exchange student when
it mattered _ the rest of the night off. Even then, it seemed to
take the Clippers about five minutes to realize that O'Neal wasn't
in the game and that trying to gain inside position was no longer a
death sentence. Once that sank in, they started hitting something
besides air, leaving the Bulls' record etched in stone hands. But
the wasted effort wasn't entirely wasted. The Clippers tied the
franchise nadir for points in a game and shot worse (26 for 80,
32.5 percent) than any other Laker opponent over the full 48.

   Wilberforce player learning about race and hoops
</P>
<P>
   Byc. 1999 Cox News ServiceWILBERFORCE _ He said no to Vanilla
Ice.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the season opener for the Wilberforce University
basketball team, it was Homecoming and he knew the gym would be
packed. And, as is pregame ritual, each player would take the floor
to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys wanted me to go out to Vanilla Ice,'' Jon Inrig said
with a smile, ``but I wouldn't do it. For the rest of my days here,
I didn't want to be called Vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a teammate suggested Eminem, a white rapper with a popular
song about a guy called Slim Shady. Inrig liked that and so did the
fans. Slim Shady, catchy name, but they wondered if the new kid had
game. Was he all hip and no hops? Was this a lot of hype and no
hoop?
</P>
<P>
   That was answered in the opener against Voorhees College when
Wilberforce coach Sean Bledsoe sent Inrig _ the only white player
on his team and the only white male undergrad on the campus _ into
the game for the nation's oldest, historically black private
liberal arts college.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I think the crowd was like, 'Oh, the white guy's
finally on the floor,''' Inrig said. ``I think they expected me to
be terrible.'' But when he got the ball, Inrig took a quick
cross-over dribble, stopped and let fly a jump shot that snapped
the net cords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Inrig said. ``That's the loudest I've
ever been applauded in my life. The place roared.'' Bledsoe agreed:
``That's the biggest cheer I've ever heard anyone get here.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell, there's something more than basketball going on
in the Wilberforce gym this season. It's the ``Guess Who's Coming
to Dinner'' deal in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Inrig is a 6-foot-5 freshman from Abbotsford, British Columbia
with reddish hair, a galaxy of freckles on his pale shoulders and a
lot of questions in his path: ``Why did you come here? Where are
you from? ...And, uuh, by the way, do you have a girlfriend?''
</P>
<P>
   With that first question, Inrig said, the answer seems to change
the longer he walks around the campus. In the beginning _ after
spending a year loading trucks at an ice cream company while
dealing with some family and health matters _ he thought this was
simply an unexpected, but much appreciated, chance to play college
ball.
</P>
<P>
   It has turned out to be a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a reason I'm here and it's not just to play
basketball,'' said Inrig, sounding more wizened than his 19 years.
``This is a real learning experience for me. And I think it's the
same for the other guys on the team, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For Inrig, this is quite the odyssey. Abbotsford is 45 minutes
east of Vancouver. Inrig's father, Rick, played basketball at the
University of British Columbia, then coached in high school and
college. He was the president of Basketball British Columbia and
now is an assistant at the Mennonite Educational Institute (MEI),
where Jon starred two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The school is a basketball powerhouse in British Columbia. As a
junior, Inrig averaged 16 points per game on a provincial Final
Four team. His senior season, he averaged 24 points and seven
rebounds for a team that went 34-10.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out a year _ working and dealing with a severe
viral infection that effected his heart _ Inrig wanted to play
college ball. A Canadian recruiting agency started to spread his
name around and soon college pamphlets were arriving in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them I never even read, but it's weird, I remember
the one from Wilberforce,'' he said. ``My friends and I were
looking at it and I remember there wasn't one white face in it. I
figured that would be the last place I'd end up.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been no black players on Inrig's high school team,
although he played against blacks, was on a 3-on-3 team with two
black players last summer and said he has a few black friends at
home. ``He's always been a little different that way, more so than
a lot of kids around here,'' said MEI coach Arnie Dick. ``Jon's a
kid who suprises you. When he spreads his wings, he blossoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe _ who has another Canadian in Toronto's Calvin Meikle _
stepped up the recruitment once he cleared up one matter: ``I
wanted to make sure his family knew this was a predominantly black
institution. And I wanted to know if Jon could survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Inrig said he had no doubts, though he did want to see the
school first. So over the summer father and son visited the campus
and liked what they saw. Still, Jon had no idea what he was walking
into: ``I didn't ask for any of this. I just came to go to school
and play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the first two days of open gym, people from campus
showed up just to stand and watch Inrig: ``I think 90 percent of
the people are glad Jon's here. It's gone from 'Hey, there's a
white kid on campus,' to 'Hey, Jon's real cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   Inrig has been befriended by another freshman, Adrian Wilkinson.
Since Wilkinson has a car, he's shown Inrig the area, socialized
with him and spent a lot of time sharing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not say it, but I know there's so much pressure on
him coming to a black college,'' Wilkinson said. ``There's a
nervousness because you feel you've got something to prove. You
want to live up to expectations. And when they see a white guy,
whether it's fair or not, they expect him to be a 3-point
shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Inrig knows the thinking: ``On both sides _ black and white _
stereotyping happens all the time. Sometimes that leads to real
misconceptions. I know white people sometimes see a group of young
black guys and think they're up to no good when they're only going
to restaurant or just having fun. And sometimes a black guy will
think white people are always out to get him when that's not it at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you, I've learned some things about racism here.
I've heard stories, heard things said to black players. I've seen
racism on both sides now and I realize how wrong it is. I also see
how much we're really alike. Truthfully, I think everyone should
experience this. Experience what it's like to be the outsider. You
feel things you never felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as his teammates are learning about him, so are opponents.
When the Kentucky State players saw him two weeks ago, they all
made mention of ``the white boy.'' Inrig said he's ``usually pretty
light-hearted'' about that, but this time he thought, ``OK, let's
go out and see.''
</P>
<P>
   In that game _ with his dad sitting in the stands next to
Wilberforce President Dr. John Henderson _ Inrig scored 22 points.
It's been his best outing. Through 11 games, he's averaging 6.2
points. Tuesday night against the University of St. Francis from
Fort Wayne, Inrig _ with the sparse crowd cheering his every move _
scored four points in a 69-64 Bulldog loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon needs to be confident out there and not hesitate to take
his shot,'' Bledsoe said afterward. ``And we've got to find some
guys to get him the ball better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a work in progress and there are some rough spots. But
you see signs it's working when you watch the camaraderie and hear
the jokes. The best give-and-take comes with Wilkinson. ``We'll be
riding in the car, listening to the radio and all of a sudden I'll
say, 'OK, try clapping on the beat,''' Wilkinson grinned. ``Next
we'll work on his dance steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some girls in the stands Tuesday night said they saw Jon at a
party and want to teach him the Booty Call dance. ``Oh yeah, Jon's
popular with the girls,'' Wilkinson said with a laugh. ``We'll walk
together on campus and girls who once said 'hi' to me are all
going, 'Hi Jon! What you doing, Jon?' I go, 'OK, I guess I don't
exist any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after the Bulldogs' game with Ohio Dominican College,
Inrig will fly back to British Columbia for Christmas. ``Everybody
here is telling me, 'Jon you're not going to know how to act.
You're going to be wondering where all the black people are,''' he
said. ``They figure I'm going to get asked all the same questions
again. And I know they're wondering what I'm going to be
saying...''
</P>
<P>
   After thinking a second, he began to smile:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just be telling my old friends about my new friends.''

 &HT;    IOC president's reform promises met with skepticism from
lawmakers
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Making his first appearance Wednesday on Capitol Hill,
the president of the International Olympic Committee gamely
defended the IOC's reform process. Juan Antonio Samaranch told
lawmakers the IOC had ``cleaned the house'' and could be trusted to
keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But a bipartisan congressional panel expressed skepticism that
the IOC's reforms were worth more than the paper on which they were
printed. Several members of the House committee investigating
allegations of corruption in the Olympic site selection process
suggested the IOC had flagrantly ignored the rules in place and
would fail to enforce new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you we will deliver what we promise,'' Samaranch
said during three hours of testimony before feisty questioning by a
House Commerce subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton took the opportunity to reiterate his call for
Samaranch to resign. ``It's time for some new blood and some new
leadership,'' the Texas Republican said. ``And this would be a
great setting for you to be a true statesman of sport and announce
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who didn't falter despite the lengthy and intense
grilling, chose not to respond to Barton's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Barton and his House colleagues questioned the 79-year-old
Spaniard about a visit Samaranch's wife and friend made to Atlanta
at the bid team's expense. Samaranch was also asked why the IOC
should pay for his $250-a-night suite in the Palace Hotel in
Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch denounced as ``a lie'' the report in Sports
Illustrated that said the suite cost the IOC $500,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed an overly hospitable Atlanta team bidding to be hosts
of the 1996 Summer Games for encouraging his wife to make an
``unofficial'' visit to see the American South and its shopping
malls. He eventually conceded that the Atlanta bid team probably
should not have picked up the $12,000 tab for his wife's visit to
Charleston, S.C., and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wanted to know why the new reforms, including a ban on
gifts and future visits by IOC members to cities competing for the
Games, didn't apply to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said it was ``not necessary'' that the restrictions
apply to him.
</P>
<P>
   Barton retorted: ``But what if this subcommittee thinks it is
necessary?''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Samaranch said he would ``be glad to listen and review
your proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce panel's subcommittee on oversight and
investigations made a number of proposals that Samaranch agreed to
discuss with the IOC, including changing wording in already-adopted
reforms to tighten a ban on all gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, accompanied by the IOC's director general, Francois
Carrard, made his opening statement in English, but spoke through
translators during the lengthy questioning by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers voiced concern that the new ethics commission
would not ferret out improprieties unless it received irrefutable
proof of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear these reforms will be cosmetic purely to mask the
aristocratic aura formed around the organization,'' said Rep. Diana
DeGette (R-Colo.). She said the reforms were vaguely worded and the
enforcement power of the ethics commission was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous gift rules were flagrantly violated time and time
again,'' DeGette told Samaranch. ``Why do you think the new gift
rules, which are admittedly quite vague, will be obeyed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are no more visits, there will be no more gifts,''
responded Samaranch. He suggested the most expensive presents came
when IOC members went on shopping sprees in candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House panel, quoted
former U.S. Sen. Howard Baker's legendary Watergate inquisition as
he first addressed Samaranch: ``What did you know and when did you
know it?''
</P>
<P>
   Upton and others questioned why the IOC ignored evidence of
abuses of the bidding process that had surfaced as early as 1984
when Los Angeles won the Games and was outlined in detail in a 1991
report from the Toronto bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said the IOC was not able to take action to stop such
abuses before this year because no one ever provided the committee
with names of offending members.
</P>
<P>
   Upton seemed to speak for most of the panel members when he
said, ``The conduct by IOC members and the bidding cities did not
spring up yesterday and it will not go away simply because there
are new rules written on a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it's hard to have confidence in the success of these
reforms given some of the disturbing statements'' by IOC members
after their meeting last weekend, Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, the chairman of the IOC ethics commission was
quoted as saying they did not plan to initiate investigations and
follow up new cases that develop out of an ongoing federal probe in
Salt Lake City. Another commission member said, ``We will not be
detectives or Scotland Yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton said he wanted to be assured that the ethics commission
would ``be strong enough to end the mentality that `rules are made
to be broken.'''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch had two strong U.S. allies on hand to offer
assurances. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a member of
the IOC 2000 reform commission, and former Sen. Howard Baker, who
serves on the ethics commission, told lawmakers they were confident
the new rules would be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enormous confidence in the ethics commission,''
Kissinger said. ``They will have a major responsibility for the
spirit in which the reforms are carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kissinger was asked whether he thought the new reforms
recommended by his panel should apply to Samaranch as well, he
said, ``I would certainly expect the president of the IOC would set
an example for the membership for meticulous adherence to the
letter and spirit of the reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Kissinger expressed admiration for Samaranch and
lauded his cooperation and positive influence over the IOC
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is worth saving,'' said Baker, noting the ethics group
still had much work to do in fine-tuning the code of ethics and
appointing an administrator. ``It's a great institution with a
great history.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who had delayed his appearance before Congress until
after the IOC vote on the reform package, said after Wednesday's
hearing that he hoped the Olympic crisis was now over. Samaranch
had sidestepped appearances at three previous congressional
hearings _ two in the Senate and one in the House. His agreement to
appear Wednesday came with an assurance that he would not be
subpoenaed as a witness in the ongoing Justice Department inquiry
into the Salt Lake City scandal. He has agreed to speak to the FBI
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said Congress would monitor the
IOC's behavior and take punitive action if necessary. He cited
legislation he introduced that would bar American companies from
financially supporting the games if the IOC does not change its
practices.
</P>
<P>
   John Naber, a gold medal swimmer, also encouraged lawmakers to
give the reforms time to work, but to keep watch. Naber said the
recent changes were ``a remarkable testament to the disinfectant
power of sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette suggested the ethics commission was a work in progress.
``Significant work remains,'' she said. ``There's a saying you must
trust in God, but always tie your camel. I am going to have to keep
my camel tethered.''

SAMARANCH DEFENDS IOC REVAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Antonio Samaranch had promised he would answer
anything he was asked on Capitol Hill Wednesday _ about Olympic
corruption, his wife's $13,000 trip to Atlanta, even the cost of
his Swiss hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   And so the longtime International Olympic Committee president
did for three hours, testifying under oath and in Spanish, as
skeptical members of the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight
and investigations questioned whether the sweeping reforms passed
by the IOC last weekend would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct by IOC members and the bidding cities did not
spring up yesterday and it will not go away simply because there
are new rules written on a piece of paper,'' said chairman Fred
Upton (R-Mich.). ``Rules on paper, no matter how tough or complete,
are just that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 79-year-old Samaranch, who pushed through 50 proposals
covering everything from age limits for members to visits to bid
cities, insisted the reforms were sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that we deliver what we promise,'' he said
through an interpreter. But Samaranch, who will step down when his
term ends in July 2001, conceded that he couldn't guarantee lasting
reform. ``People will come after me and they may change the
rules,'' he said. ``I don't think any organization in the world can
have permanent rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seven committee members present said that comments
from some IOC members indicated they had voted for the changes
reluctantly out of loyalty to their embattled leader. ``I fear that
the reforms will be cosmetic, merely to mask the autocratic aura
that surrounds the organization,'' said Representative Diana
DeGette (D-Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Upton, who said previous hearings made it clear that Salt Lake
City and Atlanta were not the only bid cities engaged in a
``culture of corruption,'' charged that the IOC under Samaranch had
``consistently, arrogantly, unbelievably turned a blind eye to the
ugly truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know, what did you know and when did you know it?''
Upton asked Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who has agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents next
year, insisted he knew nothing for certain until the IOC began its
own investigation of the Salt Lake scandal a year ago. Though he
said he had heard numerous rumors and allegations about corruption,
``every time we tried to get proof, nothing that could have begun
an inquiry was ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the IOC had facts and names, Samaranch said, it moved
decisively to expel or force out 10 members, ban visits to bid
cities, and restructure itself. ``I think we clean the house,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the House subcommittee has no direct oversight over the
IOC and no power to compel him to testify, Samaranch agreed to
appear even though some of his fellow members thought it unwise _
and said he would appear again (``no problem'') if asked. ``They
ask questions, they are trying to get information,'' he said. ``I
deliver the best I can the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he was also prepared for personal questions,
especially about the 1990 trip his wife Bibis was treated to by the
Atlanta organizers. ``Not only did I know it, I advised her to
go,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no vote, she didn't want to see the venues,''
Representative Joe Barton (R-Texas) told Samaranch. ``She just
wanted to go to artsy-craftsy places and sample high society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are probably right, sir,'' said Samaranch, who read a
subsequent letter to his wife from then-Vice President Dan Quayle,
hoping that she had been able ``to sample some hospitality for
which the American South is famous.'' ``This is a problem of the
organizing committee. That was an invitation based on friendship
and this is all I can affirm.''
</P>
<P>
   The visits for IOC members and their families and the expensive
gifts that came with them are finished, Samaranch declared. ``That
problem has disappeared completely,'' he said. ``Gifts were closely
connected to trips. If there are no more visits, there will be no
more danger of gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said, though, that he will continue to accept gifts in
his position as IOC president and turn them over to the Olympic
museum. He also will continue to live in his two-room suite at the
Palace Hotel near IOC headquarters in Lausanne, which he denied is
luxurious or expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the usual rate reportedly is $960 a day, Samaranch said
the IOC is charged only $250 and just $70 when he is out of town.
``Because I am living there year-round,'' he said, ``they have a
special price.''

`OLIVE': IN THIS HOLIDAY TALE, THE POSTMAN CHASES THE DOG
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody spiked the eggnog with attitude, and the results are
yummy. See for yourself Friday night when Fox unveils ``Olive, the
Other Reindeer.'' This animated Christmas special will delight the
preadolescent wise guy who lurks in your head (whatever your age)
without tweaking the wide-eyed child in your heart (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Matt Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' has
transformed the children's book (by J. Otto Seibold and Vivian
Walsh) into a witty hourlong musical in which Olive, a plucky
little dog, saves Christmas from the clutches of an evil letter
carrier whose mind and muscles have been twisted by too many sacks
of junk mail. The show, directed by Oscar Moore, has antic fun with
Groening's Crayola-hued palette, bombarding you with deceptively
simple-looking images that keep revealing more depth as you watch.
</P>
<P>
   Just as clever is the script by Steve Young, who also wrote the
lyrics to the songs, with music by Christopher Tyng. Their best
collaboration is the postman's big number, in which he explains to
Olive just why he wants to scuttle Christmas. Dancing his
government-approved shoes off to toe-tapping swing accompaniment by
the band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the malevolent mailman (with a voice
supplied by Dan Castellaneta, taking a busman's holiday from his
Homer Simpson role) wails:
</P>
<P>
   They cut down bigger, fatter logs,
</P>
<P>
   So I can bring more catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   First class, third class, book rate, bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder why I sulk?
</P>
<P>
   The plot turns on the announcement by Santa Claus (Edward Asner)
that he may not be able to make his rounds this year because
Blitzen is injured. Olive (Drew Barrymore) hears the news bulletin
on the radio in her doghouse, where she is looking happily forward
to Christmas with her owner, Tim (Jay Mohr). Olive's pet flea, Fido
(Peter MacNicol), doesn't quite hear the sound bite. So when Santa
says, ``Maybe we'll make do with all of the other reindeer,'' Fido
is sure he said, ``Olive, the other reindeer'' and urges Olive to
high-tail it to the North Pole to bail Santa out.
</P>
<P>
   So Olive, along with her pal Martini (Joe Pantoliano), a
larcenous penguin who steals office supplies from the zoo and sells
fake Rolexes on the street, heads north, pursued by the postman.
They make friends along the way, including Blitzen's cousin
Schnitzel, who can't fly but can sing (with the voice of Michael
Stipe of REM).
</P>
<P>
   Olive reaches Santa, who is a bit dubious that this little dog
can help him. ``I know I don't look like much, but give me a try,''
says Olive. Santa does, and you can guess the happy results.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Christmas that is rescued here is of a most
secular sort, just like the ones you used to know. The only
religious symbol on view is the menorah that blazes atop Santa's
house, although many viewers will recognize the beaming man in
white who wordlessly steps onto his balcony in Rome to accept his
gift from Santa, a Phillies baseball cap. (It's scarlet, see, with
an ornate P for pope.)
</P>
<P>
   Additional viewings will no doubt reveal more clever gems, like
the repeated references to Johnny Marks' 1949 pop song, ``Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' the source of the show's title. When
Olive gets to the North Pole, she hears about reindeer games, but
when she inquires about Rudolph, she's told that he's only an urban
legend.
</P>
<P>
   Is this holiday tale just too icily hip for its own good? Nah.
Good does triumph over evil, and love over hate. Nobody gets hurt.
And, hey, it's a girl dog who saves the day. So enjoy. But keep an
eye on the mailman. This just might be the year for a gratuity.

TEXAS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS REJECTS APPEALS OF SIX KILLERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ten days before Christmas, the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals made the holy season even bleaker than normal for
six killers, moving them a step closer to the death chamber by
rejecting their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Among those whose cases were rejected is Larry Keith Robison, a
42-year-old Fort Worth man with a history of mental illness.
Robison was convicted and sentenced to die for the 1982 slaying of
33-year-old Bruce Gardner, the boyfriend of Robison's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Robison, a paranoid schizophrenic, also confessed to slaying
four other people in the same episode, including his former
roommate, whom he decapitated and sexually mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   His case has been championed by groups calling attention to the
plight of the mentally ill in Texas' criminal justice system.
Earlier this year, they appealed unsuccessfully to Gov. George W.
Bush to grant Robison clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the criminal appeals court spared Robison's life
four hours before his execution. The appeals court ordered a trial
court to determine if Robison is mentally competent to understand
his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Fort Worth judge ruled Robison mentally competent
to be killed after he testified that he is ``ready to accept
responsibility'' for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Wednesday's ruling by the appeals court, Robison's
case now goes back to the trial judge for a new execution date.
Tarrant County prosecutor John Stride said he would ask for a Jan.
21 execution date.
</P>
<P>
   Other death-sentenced prisoners whose cases were turned down
Wednesday include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Howard Paul Guidry, sentenced to death in the 1994
murder-for-hire slaying of Farah Fratta in Houston. Guidry was one
of seven death row prisoners who tried to escape in 1998 by scaling
a 10-foot fence Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   Guidry was convicted of fatally shooting Fratta, 33, the mother
of three, in her Atascocita home in a deal with her estranged
husband, Paul Fratta.
</P>
<P>
   Then, weeks after Farah Fratta's murder, a second
murder-for-hire scheme was hatched to avenge the woman's death by
killing Paul Fratta. That plot was never carried out, but William
Planter, a former Harris County Sheriff's deputy, was convicted of
solicitation of capital murder.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Coincidentally, Planter got good news Wednesday from the
criminal appeals court. On a 6-3 vote, the judges ordered the trial
court to issue an acquittal in his solicitation case.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jermar Arnold, a poetry-writing violent prisoner convicted in
a 1983 robbery-slaying in Corpus Christi. Arnold claims, by his own
tally, to have raped at least 30 women in his long criminal
history. Like Robison, Arnold is a former mental patient,
hospitalized for a time in Colorado. But those who have championed
the cause of Robison have not spoken out on Arnold's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Arnold claimed in a death row interview that he wanted
to be executed _ and soon. ``I've prayed to be executed right this
moment if it's possible,'' he said more than eight years ago. ``I
feel I owe society a debt. I've committed about the worst crime a
person can commit. I've taken a young lady's life. If someone would
stick a knife in my chest, I wouldn't feel any regret.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Arnold stabbed two fellow death row inmates when
he argued with them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Carl Edward Napier, condemned for the 1986 shooting deaths of
Jack Carlin, 63; his wife, Martha, 63; and their son, Andrew, 31,
aboard a houseboat in Channelview.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter J. Miniel, an Illinois man sentenced to die for the 1987
robbery-stabbing death of Paul Manier in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Charles Ladd, a parolee sentenced to die for the 1996
rape-slaying of a mentally handicapped Tyler woman. The victim was
bound, strangled and bludgeoned and her body set afire.

it became clear that selective disclosure has a constituency, and

 &HT;    Falcons line hits rock bottom
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If last season was a dream for tackle Ephraim Salaam
and the Falcons' offensive line, this year has been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending knee injury to All-Pro running back Jamal
Anderson in the second game made everybody's job a lot tougher. But
the bottom line is the line rarely has played well.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have rushed for more than 100 yards just three times
and rank 30th in the NFL in rushing, averaging 72 yards per game.
They've also given up 47 sacks, and their average of one sack every
9.6 passing plays is second-worst in the NFL, better than only
expansion Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Super Bowl season, the same five players started
every game on the offensive line. ``We're just not getting the job
done, and that's disappointing to all of us,'' Salaam said.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow this year came after the preseason, when coaches
decided to bench Calvin Collins and start Bob Hallen, last year's
second-round choice, at left guard. That lasted six games before
Greg Bishop replaced Hallen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Gene Williams was injured, Collins went in at right
guard. When Bishop sprained his left knee, Hallen went back in at
left guard.
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's 26-7 loss at San Francisco, center Robbie
Tobeck left in the second quarter with a left hip strain. Collins
moved to center, and Williams went in at right guard. Coach Dan
Reeves said Williams is still battling a sprained right ankle that
took him out of the starting lineup last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always important that you ... play the game the way you
practice,'' Reeves said. ``It caused some problems ... because the
communication is basically done by the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Does all this have an effect on the collective confidence of the
remaining linemen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it does, but you try not to let that affect you,''
Salaam said. ``If I don't know where my guard is going to be,
that's makes it tougher. But we've been playing together two years;
that shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, a seventh-round pick in 1998, is 6 feet 7 and played his
rookie season at about 290 pounds. Coaches wanted him to gain
weight, so he did, beginning this season at 303 pounds. He has
looked unsure of himself, occasionally lacking the foot speed that
was a strong suit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of weight on real fast, and maybe I wasn't
adjusting to it right,'' Salaam said. ``But guys in this league are
getting bigger and faster. I've got to keep building. I plan to be
in this league a long while.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point for Salaam came in a 34-28 loss at Carolina two
weeks ago. On the Falcons' last two possessions, he jumped offsides
once and gave up two critical sacks to Kevin Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that Carolina game, I felt I let the team down,'' said
Salaam. ``If I had ever been blamed for a loss, I would put that
one squarely on my shoulders. I had a real good season last year,
and I'm not this year. This whole season has been hard on me.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS TEXAS HIGHWAY POLLUTION WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a free-wheeling state where driving is seen almost as a
birthright, the proposals sound positively un-Texan. Lower freeway
speed limits to 55 mph? Require people to take the bus to work once
a week? Ban heavy construction vehicles in the morning?
</P>
<P>
   Under mounting pressure from the federal government, regulators
in Austin will debate just such controversial proposals Thursday as
they try to clean up widespread air pollution in urban areas such
as Houston, which replaced Los Angeles as the nation's smog capital
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the administration of Gov. George W. Bush talks
about tough actions, Texas lobbyists are trying to seriously weaken
one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's strongest tools to
prod states to clear the air: the power to stop highway
construction in polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
   Top Texas officials are pushing Congress to change the Clean Air
Act so that hundreds of millions of dollars in highway projects
from Dallas to San Antonio could not be halted even if EPA finds
they would increase smog. Environmentalists say the lobbying
campaign casts doubt on the sincerity of the state's plans and
could threaten air cleanups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of officials in Texas government who think
that the way to play this game is to trash the Clean Air Act . . .
so they can just build highways whenever they want to,'' said
Michael Replogle, transportation director at the New York-based
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's position as frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination has already brought national media
attention to Texas pollution. If elected president, Bush has
promised to clean up the nation's air, but environmentalists and
even some self-described Bush admirers say he seldom stood up for
the environment in five years as governor until recently.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Texas officials say they just want flexibility to
clean up the air without wrecking the economy. They say they don't
need a highway freeze to motivate them to clean up Houston's air,
noting that Bush and the legislature have already endorsed a sharp
reduction in pollution from old power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is cleaning up the air. You have the regulatory
pressures that can be pretty crushing at times (but) we are moving
in the direction that we want to move in,'' said Patrick Crimmins,
spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Crimmins said the more drastic proposals before his agency, such
as a 25 percent cut in driving in Houston, are unlikely to be
adopted, but their presence om the commission's agenda underscores
how seriously officials take the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and EPA officials alike warn that, without
a threatened crackdown on highway construction, Texas won't have to
stop the urban sprawl that increases smog by inducing people to
drive more. The Texas Department of Transportation forecasts
another 45 percent increase in driving statewide by 2017, on top of
a 325 percent increase since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that law is gutted and there are no longer billions of
dollars of highway dollars at stake, believe me, there will be a
complete switch'' in the state's air cleanup, said Neil Carman,
clean air director for the Sierra Club in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The air war in Texas has been brewing for years as major cities
in the eastern part of the state mushroomed with relatively few
environmental limits. While officials in states such as
Massachusetts and California took steps like forcing automakers to
build cleaner cars, Texas put off strong action, even scrapping a
$140 million system for testing vehicle exhaust in 1995 after it
had already been constructed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, EPA turned up the heat, threatening in May to
withhold federal highway money if the Dallas-Ft. Worth area did not
come up with a complete ``state implementation plan'' outlining how
the area would control ozone, the main ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest concern to Texas officials may be the type of
penalty facing Houston, where EPA last month froze construction of
new roads except those that are already funded or essential to
public safety. The freeze, known as a ``conformity lapse'' to
regulators, is intended to make sure that polluted cities don't
undercut pollution control efforts by building more highways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Houston freeze is likely to end once the state comes
up with new proposed pollution reductions, Texas officials fear it
is the start of a wave of ``conformity lapses'' that could stop
billions of dollars worth of highway projects for up to five years
as they try to curb air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bush administration backs a bill that
make it harder for EPA to stop highway projects. The Texans argue
that projects with completed environmental studies should be exempt
from any freeze, while the current standard exempts only projects
that have received funding.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists argue that Texas is trying to open a
loophole that a federal court closed earlier this year after the
city of Atlanta abused it. Faced with a highway freeze, Atlanta
regional officials rushed 130 road projects through environmental
studies so that the freeze would not affect them, providing enough
work to keep road crews busy for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Since a Washington court of appeals shot down Atlanta's road
building strategy, however, officials have poured money into mass
transit projects. Texas, say environmentalists, would do well to
follow Atlanta's example rather than trying to reduce environmental
penalties.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' is an old-fashioned valentine for all
those people who say they don't make movies like they used to. The
film, with its exotic landscapes, grand sets and lush visuals,
feels as much like a fairy tale as director Andy Tennant's last
effort, ``Ever After.'' And while ``Anna'' has its share of
shortcomings _ it's a half-hour too long, for one thing _ audiences
craving romantic spectacle will undoubtedly come away satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna'' is the third movie to be based (quite loosely) on the
story of British teacher Anna Leonowens, who traveled to Siam in
1862 to teach the country's royal family. The most famous version,
of course, is ``The King and I,'' the 1956 Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical that made Yul Brynner a star and moviegoers whistle a happy
tune. Twelve years earlier, Irene Dunne and a horribly miscast Rex
Harrison matched wits in ``Anna and the King of Siam.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting is the new film's strength, with Jodie Foster starring
as the headstrong teacher and Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat
playing the king of the male-dominated society of Siam. Anna comes
east with her young son, Louis (Tom Felton), looking for a change
after the death of her soldier husband. She, of course, gets more
than she bargained for in Siam, a country that treats women as
second-class citizens, condescendingly calling them ``sir'' just to
make sure they get the message.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Anna'' isn't a message movie, and Siam's sexism is
simply used to fuel a light-hearted gender battle between Anna and
the king. Anna's job is bigger than she imagined, since the number
of royal children comes to nearly 60, thanks to a bevy of
concubines. Tennant uses the kids as adorable props, used to
highlight the differences between Anna's western ideas and the
eastern ways of Siam.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has two subplots, neither of which quite work. In
one, the king's latest concubine, Tuptim (Bai Ling), has trouble
leaving behind her home and the man she truly loves. Meanwhile, the
king must contend with political and military threats to his
throne. Tennant, with no background in staging battle scenes or
adventure set pieces, is in over his head here and trades heavily
on ideas from ``The Bridge Over the River Kwai'' for his finale.
</P>
<P>
   But then, originality would be a little much to demand from a
third-generation remake. (Tennant also shows he has been paying
attention to such sweeping romances as ``Dr. Zhivago'' and ``Out of
Africa,'' among others.) ``Anna'' aspires to warm the heart and it
does so whenever it returns to the relationship between the two
title characters.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, with eyes impossibly (and improbably) blue, wavers
occasionally with her British accent, but possesses the strength
and (somewhat surprisingly) the warmth to make audiences root for
her character. Chow is the major revelation, confidently commanding
the screen with imposing stillness and impressive feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Together they are (to borrow a song title from ``The King and
I'') something wonderful, making ``Anna and the King'' the kind of
undemanding crowd-pleaser tailor-made for good tidings of the
holiday season. &QL;

SYRIAN MINISTER LOSES LITTLE TIME IN ATTACKING ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening the highest level talks ever between Israel
and Syria, President Clinton Wednesday urged both sides to ``write
a new chapter in the history of our time'' and seize the
opportunity to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone doubted the difficulty of the task, one indicator
_ embarrassing the president _ came a minute after Clinton finished
speaking in the misty Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking from the scripted public appearance, which originally
called for no comment from either side, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Sharaa launched into a two-page, single-spaced typed address
saying the world had largely ignored the Syrian plight and labeling
Israel as the aggressor and Syria the wronged party in the loss of
the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Sharaa) pulled a Suha on us,'' said a US official on
condition of anonymity, referring to assertions last month by
Yasser Arafat's wife, Suha, before First Lady Hillary Clinton that
Israel was using gas to poison Palestinian women and children.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton peered over Sharaa's shoulder to try to read the
Syrian official's speech and National Security Adviser Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger puffed out his cheeks in exasperation, Sharaa said
Syria demanded the return of ``all its occupied land'' before
offering Israel a ``just and comprehensive'' peace.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharaa, speaking on behalf of Syrian President Hafez Assad,
also challenged the Arab world's thinking of its conflict with
Israel, asking whether the ``Arab side ... will wonder, after
reviewing the past 50 years, whether the Arab-Israeli conflict was
the one which solely defined Arab unity or the one which frustrated
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, in a brief statement, said
that his negotiators had come to Washington ``to put behind us the
horrors of war and to step forward toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sharaa and Barak _ who didn't shake hands, a gesture
that the Israelis had hoped for and photographers at the ceremony
had yelled for _ walked together with Clinton for a half-hour
meeting at the Oval Office. Clinton then met separately with the
two leaders, who later moved across Pennsylvania Avenue at a
presidential retreat for discussions with Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright. Orginally, the two sides were to meet alone.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said both sides declined its offer to continue
talks later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters after his talks the negotiations were
``going pretty well, but it's hard going.'' Clinton privately
expressed his displeasure to Sharaa about the tone of his speech,
the US official said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that
during the Clinton meetings ``both sides made clear their desire
for peace. They expressed the importance that both sides attached
to the Syria-Israel component as critical to an overall
comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the Israeli disappointment in Sharaa's opening
comments, there were several indications that the negotiations were
on a fast track and could be wrapped up within a few months. Most
importantly, all sides said the talks picked up from where they
left off in March 1996 when Israel ended discussions following a
series of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier talks included intensive rounds over four months
at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. ``The entire record of
what was agreed and accomplished is written down clearly by (US
Middle East envoy) Dennis Ross,'' said Helena Cobban, who has just
finished a book, ``The Israeli-Syrian Peace Talks,'' which will be
published early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The two chief negotiators, Barak and Sharaa, know well the
details of the talks, although Barak at the time expressed serious
reservations at a deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Barak and Assad ``seem very serious'' about a peace
formula that would return the Golan Heights and withdraw soldiers
from southern Lebanon in exchange for security arrangements, the
end of guerrilla attacks from Hezbollah fighters and diplomatic,
economic and cultural relations with Syria and Lebanon, Cobban
said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that both leaders will want to move quickly to head
off ``the anti-withdrawal forces in Israel and the anti-peace
forces in Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has called Syria's Assad more than a dozen times in
recent months to reopen talks, cautioned in his opening statement
that ``what we are witnessing today is not yet peace. And getting
there will require bold thinking and hard choices. But today is a
big step along that path.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``For the first time in history, there is a chance of
a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and indeed all its
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, Clinton raised the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace track, which remains the central obstacle of a wider Middle
East peace with outstanding disputes of Jerusalem, Palestinian
statehood, sharing precious water and the return of Palestinian
refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the president
said: ``We see now leaders with an unquestioned determination to
defend and advance the interests of their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians leaders are worried that the Syrian peace track
could leave them in a much weaker negotiating position. Barak has
said that he can negotiate with both sides simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Clinton said, there were no guarantees of success in the
Israeli-Syrian talks. After Sharaa's opening statement, several
Israeli officials attempted to put a positive gloss on his words,
saying it contained some conciliatory remarks and at least it
wasn't as bad as his comments at the opening of the Madrid peace
conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There, Sharaa held up a ``Wanted'' poster featuring then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, charging Shamir with terrorism for his
deeds before the state of Israel was created in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sharaa did strike another raw nerve Wednesday by
saying that former Israeli Defense Moshe Dayan ``himself explained
in his memoirs that it was (Israel) who insisted on provoking the
Syrians until they clashed together.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, while not accurate, contained some truth. Dayan,
who died in 1981 without completing his memoirs, told a young
journalist in 1976 that he regretted capturing the Golan Heights
and that Israel deliberately provoked Syria before the war. ``We
would send a tractor to plow some area where it wasn't possible to
do anything, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that
the Syrians would start to shoot,'' Dayan said in the conversation,
which was published in Israel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth day of the 1967 Six-Day War, Dayan ordered Israeli
troops to attempt to capture the Golan Heights after
easier-than-expected battles against Egypt and Jordan _ the two
neighbors who have since made peace with Israel.

HOUSTON'S METHAMPHETAMINE PROBLEM PART OF NATIONWIDE SCOURGE, DRUG
CZAR SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign that Houston's illegal drug problem might
be getting worse, police have recently uncovered a new narcotics
threat, the leader of an anti-drug force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican methamphetamine has infiltrated our community,'' said
Stan Furce, who heads a combined federal, state and local anti-drug
task force in Houston. ``It wasn't there last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Furce, a retired federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
did not say how much of the home-made, highly addictive drug is
being smuggled into the fourth-largest city in the nation. But he
said his agents will increase their efforts to stem its importation
as well as that of other illegal narcotics into Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The city's methamphetamine problem is part of a nationwide
scourge, said Barry McCaffrey, who heads the federal Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, widely referred to as the nation's drug czar, said
federal, state and local law enforcement must combat
methamphetamine trafficking to prevent a repeat of the crack
cocaine epidemic that infiltrated inner cities in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a minority problem,'' he said, noting that many
whites, especially women, use methamphetamine. ``Drug abuse in
America affects all populations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also released a report Wednesday that shows Houston
remains a major transportation hub for illegal-drug trafficking,
nine years after the U.S. government began a massive crackdown on
narcotics in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ground transportation is the favored method for smuggling drugs
into Houston, according to the report from McCaffrey's office. But
the Texas Gulf Coast, with its many ports and large volume of
container cargo, also is attractive to distributors, the office
stated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the high volume of air traffic to Houston's two
airports makes that an inviting mode of transportation for
smugglers, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Furce and McCaffrey said they remain optimistic
that the flow of illegal drugs to and through Houston can be
stopped through a massive federal, state and local police effort.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, law-enforcement
officials in Houston seized 266,000 pounds of marijuana, 37,492
pounds of cocaine, 385 pounds of methamphetamine and 122 pounds of
heroin, Furce said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston drug problem first attracted federal attention in
1990, when the then-fledgling federal drug-control office listed
the city as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. In the ensuing
years, the list has grown from five to 31 areas and includes North,
South and West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal program, U.S. law enforcement officials have
joined state and local police in each of the high-intensity areas
to fight the illegal-drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The city's anti-drug initiative focuses on stemming the flow of
illegal narcotics by keeping close watch on the area's ports,
airports, rail stations, bus terminals and truck stops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston program also uses undercover officers to try to
catch drug dealers who attempt to make their ill-gotten gains
harder to detect by funneling, or ``laundering'', the money through
legitimate businesses, Furce said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, undercover agents attempt to infiltrate criminal
gangs that are dealing drugs in Houston, he said.

 &HT;    Richardson's fall of discontent
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern University coach Pete Richardson refers to
the Georgia Dome as a second home for his team. After five
consecutive appearances in the McDonald's Heritage Bowl, Richardson
should feel at home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But as Richardson arrives in Atlanta for Saturday's game, he's
not a happy camper. He has already voiced his displeasure over
playing Hampton, which finished third in the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, but he's also upset with the new championship game
format in the SWAC established by commissioner Rudy Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Southern won the first SWAC title game over Jackson State 31-30
last weekend in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are set up now, the only thing our conference
has to look forward to is the McDonald's Heritage Bowl,'' he said.
``If things had been different, I think Jackson State would've gone
to playoffs. But we drew nearly 47,000 in Birmingham Saturday, so I
don't think our championship is going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to come up with is a plan where you've got a
better representation of both conferences in the bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he would not be opposed to having the bowl
showdown between a member of the SWAC against a MEAC member at the
beginning of the season rather than the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not have the conference champions because a team may
lose 25 seniors, and wouldn't be the same team,'' he said. ``But a
committee could choose the best representative from both
conferences. It would probably be more exciting at the beginning of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as matters are, the SWAC has no automatic berth in the I-AA
playoff. To qualify for such a berth, a conference must have all of
its games played the week before the opening round of the playoffs.
Southern and Grambling face each other annually in the Bayou
Classic on the same day the playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be economically feasible for those schools to
change that game, since it generates more than a million dollars
for each program compared to mere expenses derived from a playoff
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   And the SWAC championship has virtually ruled out an at-large
berth to the playoffs. Conversely, the MEAC gets an automatic
playoff bid, and the past few years has had a team receive an
at-large berth, also.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case several weeks when conference champ North
Carolina A&AMP;T represented the league in the playoffs and knocked off
top-seeded Tennessee State before losing to Youngstown State.
Florida A&AMP;M also made the field and beat Appalachian State and Troy
State before last weekend's 27-24 loss to championship game-bound
Youngstown State.
</P>
<P>
   All of this talk from Richardson and his displeasure with the
game hasn't gone unnoticed by Hampton coach Joe Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us kind of look forward to this game a little more,''
Taylor said.

 &HT;    Scott leads Tuskegee into Pioneer Bowl
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tuskegee running back Michael Scott entered last
year's Pioneer Bowl with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Scott rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season and led the
Golden Tigers to the SIAC Championship, but was left off the
all-conference first team. He took out his frustration with a
touchdown in Tuskegee's 23-9 defeat of Livingstone of the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Scott makes another return to the Pioneer Bowl as
Tuskegee (9-2) will face Winston-Salem State (7-3) at the Georgia
Dome. This time, the 5-foot-7, 175-pound Scott is not only
all-conference after rushing for 1,346 yards, but he's the SIAC
offensive player of the year and perhaps the key figure in the
SIAC's push for the third victory in a row in this postseason
showdown between the Division II conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as (Scott) is able to run, he can make some things
happen and we're in the game,'' Tuskegee coach Rick Comegy said.
</P>
<P>
   Winston-Salem State, hoping to become the first CIAA team to
gain a Pioneer Bowl victory, is gearing up to stop Scott and
Tuskegee quarterback Aaron James, a 6-0, 180-pound sophomore who
was recruited by both Alabama and Auburn as high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are really looking forward to this opportunity in
the Dome,'' said Winston-Salem State coach Kermit Blount, whose
team went undefeated (7-0) in conference play. ``Our defense will
be the key. It's played well all year _ stopping people and
creating turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston-Salem's defensive unit, which held its first nine
opponents to 7.7 points a game before a regular-season-ending 25-23
loss to Grambling in San Diego on Nov. 13, features tackle Thomas
Washington. A 6-4, 305-pound senior, Washington had 58 tackles 10
games _ among them 18 hits for losses and 10 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The playmakers in the Winston-Salem's secondary are junior
Willie Crite, who led the CIAA in interceptions with six, and
senior Deryl Wilson, the team's spirtual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Tuskegee to be aggressive because that's the nature
of Coach Comegy,'' Blount said. ``Of course we'll be eyeballing
Scott because he's pretty good. But it's probably going to come
down to the team that makes the fewest mistakes.''

&HT;     NAVY SAYS IKE BATTLE GROUP WILL BE READY FOR
 &HT;    GULF  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: SUBS 5thgraf, President Clinton, to add dropped words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER _ The Navy battle fleet led by
this aircraft carrier wrapped up training for the Persian Gulf on
Wednesday, with senior commanders declaring that the armada will be
ready for possible combat in Iraq even though the force was denied
live-fire exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders said they plan final live-fire combat training at
target ranges on the Italian island of Sardinia or in Scotland as
the battle group heads for patrol duties in the Persian Gulf to
enforce the allied ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The force of 15,000 sailors, air crews and Marines aboard 16
ships began returning to port for the Christmas season after
concluding sharply modified combat training along the Atlantic
Coast. The fleet begins departing for the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy suspended training at the 58-year-old Vieques target
range following a fatal bombing mishap in April that rallied Puerto
Rico's political leaders to demand cessation of bombardment and
Navy withdrawal from 22,000 acres of Navy-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello failed to
negotiate an agreement that would allow the bombing range to be
reopened in time for the Eisenhower battle group's Navy strike
pilots, naval gunnery crews and Marines to conduct the three-day
combat rehearsal that has been carried out by every departing
battle fleet for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. William Fallon, commander of the Atlantic-based 2nd
Fleet, and Rear Adm. John Foley III, commander of the battle group,
said that adaptations in the forces' training during the two-week
exercise completed Wednesday _ coupled with additional live-fire
training for the battle group en route to the Persian Gulf _ should
enable the armada to be fully combat ready by the time it arrives
in the Persian Gulf in March.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon, a three-star admiral, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday that the Eisenhower battle group will set sail ``not in
the state of readiness that I want.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the additional training en route should make
the force ``ready to go'' when it reaches the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   He said the training shortfalls caused by the absence of Vieques
training included air-to-ground attack, naval gunfire support and
coordinated fire support for Marines' amphibious landing.
</P>
<P>
   But after the training en route, ``They are going to be in
pretty good shape _ very good shape. They got the foundation here.
What they'll need is the end game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the two-star admiral who commands the battle group at
sea, said he was ``comfortable taking this battle group on
deployment to the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf'' as long as
his forces obtained the additional training that is planned at
either Cape Wrath, Scotland or Capoteulado, Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the eight surface warships accompanying the Eisenhower
must each fire about 100 rounds of explosive, 5-inch ammunition to
requalify for their naval gunfire support mission. Foley said he
also hopes to provide pilots additional training for air-to-ground
attacks in Sardinia and possibly stage a combined, integrated air,
sea and amphibious assault including Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crown jewel question is, `Will we be ready to deploy?'''
Foley said. ``Yes, we will be ready to deploy. That last piece of
training will do that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley spoke on the flag officers' bridge as he surveyed
warplanes landing and taking off from the Eisenhower's 4.5-acre
flight deck during simulated U.S. combat operations in a war
scenario involving the fictitious countries of Koronan, Kartunan
and Floridian laid out along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques target range, an 899-acre site on the picturesque
island located between Puerto Rico and St. Croix, has been closed
since April 19 when a Marine pilot mistakenly targeted the range
observation post, killing Navy contract security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four civilian workers on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have camped out on the target range ever since,
staging a peaceful civil disobedience protest that has thwarted
resumption of combat training.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon diverted the Eisenhower battle group from scheduled
training on Vieques on Dec. 3 and ordered it to carry out its final
pre-deployment training along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier-based pilots from squadrons with colorful combat
monikers such as Knighthawks, Red Rippers and Pukin' Dogs bombed
target ranges in North Carolina and Florida with explosive and
non-explosive bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Marines stormed ashore at Camp Lejeune, N.C. ,
without rehearsing battlefield coordination with warplanes, which
were forced to strike targets at a bombing range some 30 miles
away. Surface warships used computers to simulate naval gunfire
from 5-inch deck guns to support the Marines' assault, without
firing a single shell off North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Richard D. Jaskot, commander of the six dozen
warplanes aboard the Eisenhower, said his pilots have dropped only
about 40 percent of the heavy bombs and live ordnance that they
dropped on Vieques and other ranges during pre-deployment training
aboard the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jaskot said between 30 and 40 of the air wing's strike pilots
are leaving for the Persian Gulf without the benefit of
unencumbered live-fire bombing experience that has been available
on Vieques. Pilots in the latest exercise were forced to fly
tortuous bombing runs from the Eisenhower through congested East
Coast commercial air corridors to reach target ranges in North
Carolina and Florida, a task requiring pilots to constantly switch
mental gears from combat to civilian aviation to combat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jaskot said, thanks to the additional training en route to
the Persian Gulf, his pilots should be ready for possible combat
operations when they arrive there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm in the mode where I'll take whatever training I
can get, wherever I can get it,'' said Jaskot. ``We'll be ready.
We'll do everything we can to be as ready as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Steve Kreiser, 34, an FA-18 Hornet pilot based at
Oceana, Va., says training has been less demanding without Vieques
but his squadron will be ready nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good at making do and making it work,'' said Kreiser,
who flew combat missions against Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.
``Are we still good enough to go over and do the work? Yes. But I
don't think we're as good as we could be. That's probably something
you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft carriers operating in the Persian Gulf enforce
Operation Southern Watch, an air patrol and surveillance operation
over southern Iraq designed to prevent operations by the remnants
of the Iraqi air force. Iraqi forces routinely harass and target
U.S. warplanes with anti-aircraft radar, often provoking U.S.
pilots to respond with anti-radar missiles or bombs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplanes, including carrier-based Navy aircraft and
land-based Air Force planes, have engaged Iraqi forces at least 65
times so far this year, according to Pentagon statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy admirals' assessment of the fleet's eventual readiness
for combat contrasted with earlier warnings by Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration was looking for ways to design
training for the Navy without using Vieques, Fallon had warned that
realistic live-fire combat training on Vieques was essential.
</P>
<P>
   Closure of the range on Vieques and the ``lack of suitable
substitute training ranges is severely inhibiting the ability to
prepare our people without substantial increase in risk,'' Fallon
warned the Senate Armed Services Committee's panel on seapower on
Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said on Wednesday that he did not ``like the precedent''
of sending naval forces to sea without completing all of their
final combat training. ``To send people forward without this
training is just not in our best interest. We're putting additional
risk on our people that we shouldn't be putting on their backs.''

   No doubt part of the attraction was that only 300 people were
able to squeeze into the club to catch the show live, although the
star made provision for the spillover: about 12,000 people stood in
the cold to watch via closed-circuit television in Chavasse Park
nearby, and there was an Internet Webcast, although the lines
became overloaded after a reported 3 million viewers logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, it was the hallowed place of the Cavern in
Beatles mythology that gave the show its allure, and lured the
singer back for a performance that most people present understood
was meant to promote his new album, ``Run Devil Run'' (Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   Although the Beatles tramped through dozens of Merseyside bars,
clubs, dance halls and auditoriums during their formative years,
the Cavern _ a converted underground vegetable warehouse with low
vaulted brick ceilings and a tiny stage _ was essentially their
headquarters from 1961 to 1963. They played nearly 300 lunchtime
and evening shows in the club, where they were first heard by Brian
Epstein, who became their manager and sold them to the world. ``A
Cellarful of Noise,'' the title of Epstein's 1964 autobiography, is
a reference to the legendarily crowded, sweaty, unventilated and
poorly lighted club.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only by a technicality that Tuesday night's 50-minute
concert can be said to have happened at the Cavern. It isn't just
that the Cavern as it exists now isn't the Cavern of the early
'60s: that was demolished in 1973 as part of a plan to run a rail
line through the site. When the city belatedly discovered the
Beatles' potential as a tourist lure, after John Lennon was killed
in 1980, the railway plan was scuttled and a replica of the Cavern
was built at roughly the same location, using about 15,000 bricks
from the original.
</P>
<P>
   The replica, which opened in 1984, is where McCartney gave a
news conference _ actually a 30-second statement, with no questions
allowed _ Tuesday afternoon. The concert itself took place in a
slightly larger, wider and decidedly more modern adjacent room.
Several reasons were offered: the acoustics of the brick Cavern are
terrible, and its layout _ three tunnels connected by archways,
with a stage at one end of the middle shaft _ would have prevented
two-thirds of those present from seeing much.
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool rock fans say the new room is now regarded as the
Cavern as well. But surely anyone who expected to hear McCartney
perform in at least a facsimile of the club that the Beatles called
home _ which is to say, virtually anyone who came any distance to
see the show _ was disappointed. If it wasn't to be on that stage,
it might as well have been anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the show had other attractions. In fine voice and
fronting a band that included the guitarists David Gilmour of Pink
Floyd, and Mick Green, formerly of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates
(another old Cavern band); Ian Paice, the drummer from Deep Purple;
Pete Wingfield, a session keyboardist; and Chris Hall, an
accordionist, McCartney played a blistering set devoted mostly to
the 1950s rock oldies on his new album. Included were songs made
famous by Elvis Presley (``All Shook Up'' and ``Party''), Gene
Vincent (``Blue Jean Bop'') and Big Joe Turner (``Honey Hush'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shake a Hand,'' first recorded by Little Richard, whose
histrionic vocal style McCartney has often impersonated, Green and
Wingfield took solos that were more extensive and enlivening than
on the recorded version. And McCartney's soulful rendering of ``No
Other Baby,'' an obscure song released by the Vipers in 1958, was a
bow to the more lyrical side of his own music, otherwise kept in
check on ``Run Devil Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Also notable were two songs that are not on the album: ``Twenty
Flight Rock,'' an Eddie Cochran song that was McCartney's showpiece
when he met Lennon in 1957, and the only Beatles song in the set,
``I Saw Her Standing There,'' certainly the hardest-rocking entry
in the early Lennon-McCartney songbook.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-song set, though less than half of what the musician has
played on his last few tours, was nevertheless his first real show
since Linda McCartney's death. Since then, he has made only a few
cameo appearances: he joined a jam session at the New York ceremony
at which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
played a few songs at a musical memorial for his wife in London,
and offered six of his ``Run Devil Run'' oldies at a benefit
concert in Hollywood for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, one of her causes.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Run Devil Run'' and the Cavern show are clearly part of
McCartney's finding his way back into his work after a period of
grieving. By recording mostly oldies (the three original songs are
in a vintage rock style), he has avoided the scrutiny of listeners
keen to know how he might deal with his wife's death in his music,
particularly since he has always said that his love songs of the
last 30 years were written with her in mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he was hardly idle in the year between Ms.
McCartney's death and the sessions for ``Run Devil Run.'' Last
winter he completed and released ``Wide Prairie,'' the album on
which his wife had been working, and promoted it in a 90-minute
appearance on the World Wide Web. He also finished ``Rushes,'' his
second ambient music album released under a nom de plume, the
Fireman. And he oversaw a gallery show of his paintings in Siegen,
Germany. He also released ``Working Classical,'' his third album of
symphonic music.
</P>
<P>
   Although several listeners said after the show that their
fantasy had been to hear McCartney in the old Cavern (at least the
replica), most took the change in stride. The event had, after all,
taken on a life of its own. Since the former Beatle announced the
concert two weeks ago on ``Parkinson,'' a popular BBC television
interview show, it had created something close to hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 300 available tickets, half were reserved for the press
and guests of the star, and the others were distributed to winners
of a lottery. When the entry forms were made available at HMV
record shops in Liverpool, London, Birmingham, Newcastle and
Glasgow last week, several thousand were snapped up within hours.
Reports quickly followed of offers of about $3,200, vacations and
sex for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Beatlemania is a renewable resource in Britain. The Beatles have
placed high in several Millennium polls here, including one
published in November by The Independent in which 600,000 voters
named them the best band of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In the same newspaper poll, ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' was voted best album, with Lennon as the most influential
musician (McCartney came in fifth, after Elvis Presley, Michael
Jackson and Jimi Hendrix), and Lennon and McCartney, in that order,
topping the best songwriters list.
</P>
<P>
   And it was announced over the weekend that when the new
Millennium Dome opens in London on New Year's Eve, the first song
to be performed there will be a Lennon-McCartney collaboration,
either ``All You Need Is Love'' or ``Let It Be.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Liverpool, the Beatles are serious business. Visitors
can take bus tours of their childhood houses and schools as well as
the Strawberry Field orphanage and the roundabout on Penny Lane,
both commemorated in song, and at least a dozen other sites. Near
the Cavern, on the once tattered and newly spiffy Mathew Street,
virtually every shop, restaurant and pub has a Beatles-related
name. Stores offer Beatles records, books and all manner of
memorabilia, and there is a Beatles museum in Cavern Walks, a mall
near the club.
</P>
<P>
   The other Beatles put Liverpool behind them as soon as they
left, but McCartney still has family here, and he has kept his
contacts warm. He performed here with his post-Beatle band Wings,
and his first classical work, the ``Liverpool Oratorio,'' was given
its world premiere here in 1991. Around then he began pouring money
into transforming his old school, the Liverpool Institute High
School for Boys, into an arts college. It is now thriving as the
Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, and its famous benefactor
visits it periodically. In 1997 the National Trust bought his
childhood home at 20 Forthlin Road, where he and Lennon
collaborated on their first songs, and restored it to its late-'50s
working-class not-quite-splendor before opening it as a museum,
even matching the original wallpaper and vintage telephone and
radio models.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason for McCartney's return to the Cavern was
that, as he put it, ``I can't think of a better way to rock out the
end of the century than with a rock 'n' roll party at the Cavern,
singing the songs of my heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concert was an unabashed bid to get some attention for
the new album. He released the album in October, and it spent two
weeks on Billboard's Top 50 chart before beginning a quick descent.
The entry blank for tickets included questions that could only be
answered by reading the album's liner notes. And at his news
conference Tuesday afternoon, he could not have been plainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come back because I have a new rock 'n' roll album called
`Run Devil Run' and we're plugging it,'' he said. `This is where it
all began, and for me this is where the century is going to end,
with me playing rock 'n' roll, which, if you remember, the Beatles
before the Beatles was a fabulous little rock 'n' roll band. It was
rock that held us together for so long and made us so good, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing uneasiness among Beatles fans about the
degree to which McCartney leans on the Beatles to promote his own
work. The promotional campaigns for most of his recent albums have
involved announcements that have more to do with the Beatles than
with the work at hand.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Run Devil Run,'' McCartney has been invoking the Beatles
almost nonstop. The recording sessions, he said on an interview
disc packaged with early copies of the CD, were conducted much as
the early Beatles sessions were. Now the Cavern show _ at which he
played the violin-shaped Hofner bass that was his trademark in the
Beatles days _ is tugging on Fab Four memories.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, one can hardly blame him. His Beatles music was his
best work. In that sense, he let an opportunity slip by. Had he
played under the brick arch, the concert would have been a
Barnum-quality publicity stunt with a real touch of historical
poignancy.

HASBRO THROWS DICE TOWARD THE WEB WITH ON-LINE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc., the Pawtucket, R.I., toy maker, announced a deal
with Seattle-based on-line company Go2Net Inc. Wednesday to create
a new service built around Hasbro's stable of popular games.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, to be called Games.com, will go on line by the
middle of next year. Hasbro has signed a three-year deal to have
Go2Net operate the service, and will pay Go2Net a $7.5 million fee.
Hasbro will also spend $60 million to create Internet versions of
its games.
</P>
<P>
   The site will feature on-line versions of Monopoly, Clue, and
Risk, and traditional card and board games. In addition, users of
Hasbro Interactive computer games, such as the popular flying game
Falcon 4.0, will be able to meet each other at the site and engage
in simulated combat over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games.com will be the ultimate on-line gaming experience as we
roll out the world's favorite games to the Internet,'' said Alan G.
Hassenfeld, the chairman and CEO of Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are a number of major Internet services devoted to
on-line gaming. Perhaps the best known is Microsoft's Gaming Zone,
which often attracts over 20,000 players at a time. America Online
Inc. also draws thousands of players to the gaming section of its
service.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassenfeld said most of today's on-line gamers either play
very simple games such as checkers or bingo, or complex and
difficult computer games such as Falcon 4.0 or Microsoft's Age of
Empires. Hassenfeld believes there's an untapped market for games
that fall somewhere in between _ moderately challenging, but easy
and fun to play.
</P>
<P>
   So Games.com will feature new Internet versions of popular
Hasbro board games Hassenfeld thinks will appeal to the casual
player. ``We probably have the most formidable library ever created
in gaming,'' Hassenfeld said. ``Probably 65 to 70 percent of the
games you can think of are in our portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with popular board games, Hasbro's 1998 acquisition of
Microprose gave the company a major presence in desktop
computer-game software. And this year, Hasbro acquired Wizards of
the Coast, makers of two wildly popular card game, Magic: The
Gathering and Pokemon. These acquisitions were made partly with an
eye to future on-line gaming opportunities. ``We have been going
out and buying up whatever content we thought would be valuable for
future playing,'' Hassenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was getting the game content onto the Internet.
For this, Hasbro has chosen Go2Net. The company runs a major Web
portal site and the Dogpile and MetaCrawler search services. But
Go2Net also has a gaming service called PlaySite, which lets users
play card, board and word games free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Go2Net service relies on Java software, which can run on
many different kinds of computers. Any visitor with a Java-capable
machine can play games at the site, whether he's using a Windows
computer, a Macintosh, or a machine running Linux.
</P>
<P>
   This is different from other on-line gaming sites that generally
rely on Windows software. For instance, Mac and Linux users can't
play games on the Microsoft Gaming Zone. But Hasbro plans to use
Java software to make most of the games at the site playable by any
visitor with any type of computer. Many of the games will be free,
while others will require payment of a subscription fee. Hasbro
also expects to profit from selling advertisements on the site, and
selling merchandise to visiting gamers. Al Verrecchia, Hasbro's
chief financial officer, predicted that Games.com would bring in
$15 million next year and up to $70 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   About 38 million Americans play games over the Internet, and
will generate revenue of $105 million this year, according to
Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro executives Wednesday cited a Jupiter report that claimed
Internet gaming would be a billion-dollar business by 2002. But
Jupiter analyst Billy Pidgeon said his firm will soon release
figures that cut this estimate in half, to $545 million. The change
reflects doubts users of video game consoles like the Sony
Playstation will use them to play on-line games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pidgeon thinks Hasbro's game site will appeal to millions
of casual Internet users who may welcome the chance for a quick
game of Clue or Risk. ``A lot of the people who may have drifted
away from gaming but have fond experiences may play those games,''
Pidgeon said.

A FILMMAKER REROUTES THE FLOW OF HISTORY

</P>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ang Lee, a sly explorer of family dynamics and social
convention in films like ``Eat Drink Man Woman,'' ``Sense and
Sensibility'' and ``The Ice Storm,'' has a simple explanation for
why he is here with some of Hong Kong's biggest action stars
making, of all things, a Chinese-language kung fu movie set in the
early-19th-century Qing dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boyhood fantasy,'' said the Taiwan-born Lee on the set
at the Beijing Film Studio, where he is approaching the end of five
grueling months filming ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' at
several Chinese locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's involved a lot of agony, but making a martial arts film
is also lots of fun,'' he said. ``For me, it's a new adventure, and
a chance to expand my production skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crouching Tiger'' features two Hong Kong superstars _ Chow
Yun-Fat is the male lead, and Michelle Yeoh (who was in 1997's
James Bond movie, ``Tomorrow Never Dies'') has one of two major
female roles _ along with the rising Chinese star Zhang Ziyi, who
is known as the next Gong Li. The central story is a struggle
between two female warriors: Ms. Zhang's character, a defiantly
free spirit who becomes a criminal in a rigid traditional society,
and Ms. Yeoh's, a righteous, repressed investigator who aims to
bring her down.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate fighting scenes between the two women and others,
which swoop into the fantastical, often involving the use of
harnesses and ropes, definitely posed a new challenge for Lee. The
fighting was choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping, the Hong Kong kung fu
master who worked on the Hollywood science fiction movie ``The
Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a sure bet, though, that in Ang Lee's hands this will
not be your ordinary grade-B Hong Kong thriller. As he described
his challenge in melding stylized action with high dramatic and
acting standards, it sounded as though ``Crouching Tiger'' could
become the first truly highbrow martial-arts film.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the movie Lee frequently made comparisons with
``Sense and Sensibility,'' his acclaimed 1995 adaptation of the
Jane Austen novel, written by and starring Emma Thompson. It was
the witty, subtle, Austen-like perception of social bonds and
tensions, apparent in his Chinese-language family dramas, ``The
Wedding Banquet'' and ``Eat Drink Man Woman,'' that led Ms.
Thompson to ask Lee to direct his first major English-language
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family dramas, and `Sense and Sensibility' are all about
conflict, about family obligations versus free will,'' he said. The
martial arts form ``externalizes the elements of restraint and
exhilaration,'' he continued, punching his fist outward. ``In a
family drama there is a verbal fight. Here, you kick butt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinematically,'' he said, ``the advantage of the martial arts
form is that you can really go abstract, or surreal, with the
flying fighting.'' But in the opening scenes, he said, it is
crucial to establish the ground rules of the film for the audience,
to draw viewers into the kung fu fantasy world while introducing it
to the society and its restraints, which will shape the fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a balance between the drama and the B-movie action
element, that's the hardest thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The filming seemed more exasperating than fun the other day on
an unheated and frigid set at the Beijing studio, a mock two-story
wooden tavern. In a heavy blue parka and jeans, the weary Lee was
practically pulling his hair out just trying to get a one-minute
fight sequence right as the morning stretched on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang's character, a renegade woman who in this scene is
dressed in men's clothing, was supposed to fight off an attacking
male warrior and twist his arm just so to rip off his sleeve. It
took dozens of takes to achieve the right energy and momentum, with
Lee alternately watching each effort on a video screen and jumping
up to talk with the tiring actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the toughest shoot I've ever had,'' he said of
the five months in China. ``It's hard to put martial arts and drama
together, production-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   As reflected in the endless takes for that one small fight, all
action scenes must be constructed with meticulous care. Lee said he
could not have made the movie without relying on many of Hong
Kong's finest film artisans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different from shooting family drama,'' he said. ``If
anything looks good, I've learned, it was probably dangerous and
very time-consuming.'' Months of shooting at such locations as the
deserts of Xinjiang in the far west, a bamboo forest in southern
China, and a multitude of constructed sets had to be altered after
Ms. Yeoh tore a ligament in her left knee during a routine flying
kick.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee, who now lives in the northern suburbs of New York City
and has already made the rare transition from foreign-language
sleepers to major Western movies, the decision to make a Chinese
film in China is perhaps surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going back to my cultural roots as well as to my
fantasy,'' he said, noting that his parents had moved from China to
Taiwan in 1949 and that he grew up reading Chinese melodramas not
unlike his current story, adapted from a 1920s novel. He said he
had never set foot on the mainland until recently but grew up
dreaming about China.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's $15 million budget came from the advance sale
of rights in Asia, North America and Europe. Featuring two of
Asia's biggest stars, the movie has a good chance of being a
moneymaker across Asia, and it seems a natural for China.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is to be released in the United States late next
year by Sony Pictures Classics, will be shown in the West with
subtitles, which Lee acknowledged would limit its audience. ``But I
hope we can go wider than art-house release,'' he said.

 &HT;    Strong effort pulls ECU to Mobile Alabama Bowl
 &HT;    By Alan Wooten
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Sometimes it's hard to tell if the coaching
has developed the preparation or the effort has exceeded anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina has blocked nine kicks on the way to a 9-2 regular
season, and its case is the latter _ all effort. It has to be
because the Pirates, who face Texas Christian next Wednesday in the
inaugural Mobile Alabama Bowl, don't have a coach assigned to
kick-blocking duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do _ the defense,'' said senior linebacker Jeff Kerr when
asked who coaches the unit. ``It's a pride deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just line up in practice and go after the kicks. It's not
one of those things where it's got to be a coached unit. It's just
a pride unit.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Pirates, although not nearly as proficient as Virginia
Tech, have pride in their nine blocks. Some have been more pivotal
than others, but in the three games _ Miami, Southern Miss and N.C.
State _ considered largest on this year's schedule, the Pirates got
at least one each time out and won two of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just nothing more than a contagious disease,'' said
eighth-year head coach Steve Logan. ``You do it once and you start
thinking you can do it again. And it works the other way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a kick blocked, the other teams see that on film
and say, 'We can do that, too.' And it becomes a manic type
mentality and you start having a loss of confidence in yourself to
protect the kick. It cuts both ways. We've done fairly well. We had
a kick or two blocked with (Andrew) Bayes, but (Kevin) Miller
hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Miller had field goals blocked by Duke and Southern
Mississippi. Bayes had two punts blocked in the first four games,
and a field goal and two extra points blocked at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pirates' defense has thrived in not allowing opponents
to score, even on what would appear to be ``gimmes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people take that play off,'' Kerr said. ``When people
line up for the extra point, they take that play off and nobody
really goes hard, especially other defenses. But for us, it's one
of the most important plays of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you deny them one point, it's going to deny them two
somewhere else. That's a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest block might have been the first _ possibly for the
contagiousness Logan speaks of, but certainly for the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Then-No. 9 Miami was trying to pad a 23-10 lead against East
Carolina in the fourth game of the season. The Pirates had just
scored their first touchdown, and a swing of momentum was hanging
in the balance of Andy Crosland's 42-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkston, Ga., senior Tohma McMillan kept it with the Pirates
when he broke through the middle and swatted away the scoring
opportunity. East Carolina went on to win 27-23, completing a
second-half comeback from 20 points behind, one of the nation's
biggest upsets this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes went inside the ECU 20 in the last two minutes,
but having to go for a touchdown eventually led to four incomplete
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tohma and Miami, we would have lost the game right there,''
said senior Norris McCleary, who also has two blocks. ``He won the
game for us. It's a play that people take off the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Dave) Huxtable always preaches to us to deny them
points. We go all out on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Devone Claybrooks and McMillan also have two each. The
other block was by junior Ty Hunt on an extra point at Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where everybody has figured out the weakness is up the
middle,'' Logan said. ``I don't care if you've got a 320-pound
guard next to your center. If you put two 300-pound linemen on that
guy, you're going to push him back. And that's what people are
beginning to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put 700 pounds of people on 300 pounds of people, 700
pounds wins. Then you get somebody behind them that can get into
that block lane. There is a responsibility to the kicker. They've
got to get it up. It's a chip-shot type deal, you've got to get up
under the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   McCleary blocked a field goal and McMillan an extra point during
a tight game with Southern Miss, but the Golden Eagles eventually
won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the last five _ two at Houston and three against rival N.C.
State _ were all significant.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars were hanging close but had five scoring
opportunities inside the ECU 30 where they got no points. Two of
them were blocks of Mike Clarke field goals by McCleary (31-yarder
in the second quarter) and Claybrooks (33-yarder in the third
quarter).
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates got their final bit of breathing room in a 19-3
victory on an interception return for touchdown in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Wolfpack, Kerr blocked the extra point when the
Wolfpack got on the board first. With the Pirates nursing a tenuous
14-6 lead, Claybrooks blocked a 20-yard field goal try by Kent
Passingham with 9:29 to go in the third quarter and Kerr blocked
Passingham's 21-yarder with 10:32 to go in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates eventually won 23-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an effort call,'' Logan said. ``If you're going to go
block a kick, somebody has to go give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Kerr added, ``It's no science; it's all effort.''

11% OF TOP FORTUNE 500 BOARD SEATS OCCUPIED BY WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women now hold 11.2 percent of all board seats in the top
Fortune 500 companies, up from 8.3 percent six years ago when a New
York research group began monitoring their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst, which has been studying women in business for years,
said in a report Wednesday 685 of the 6,120 board seats at Fortune
500 firms are occupied by women, suggesting some progress has been
made since the group began its annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still work to be done. The study of women's board
participation at top US firms found that the percentage of seats
held by US businesswomen grew only 0.1 percentage point in 1999.
Moreover, only two Fortune 500 companies reported an equal number
of women and men _ or more women _ on their boards.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst, which had restricted its survey to top Fortune 500
firms in the past, expanded its study this year to include the
nation's top 1,000 companies, as measured by the size of their
revenues. It found that women in this category hold only 8.5
percent of board seats. Catalyst believes the disparity may have to
do with revenue: The higher a company's revenue, the more likely it
will invite a woman to join its board.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Wellington, president of Catalyst, said Wednesday the
research group's goal is to advance women in business by focusing
on those companies in the Fortune 1,000 and Fortune 500 that have
not yet integrated their executive boards.
</P>
<P>
   Jann Leeming, owner of Golf at Provence Lake, a golf course in
Parsonsfield, Maine, and a member of five boards, said the news was
both good and bad. ``Is it significant?'' she asked. ``Yes and no.
The problem is that the companies all want the token woman. Many
times, you'll find, the same women are serving on so many boards
they cannot do the job they would like to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of qualified women out there,'' said Leeming,
``but it's the same old stuff. They want high-profile women, women
who are associated with very large companies. But women are only
now beginning to make it to the very top echelons of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   When the research group looked at participation rates of
minority board women at top US firms, it found they hold only 159
seats on the executive boards of 777 companies. Of those women, 111
are African-American, 25 are Hispanic, 18 are Asian. The racial
background of 5 were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an active chief executive officer and a committed
board to bring business women with a wide range experience onto a
board,'' said Donna Latson Gittens, president and chief executive
of Watertown marketing communications firm cause media inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the common response is, well, we could not find a woman
with a financial background, or we could not find a woman who has
run a major business,'' added Gittens, who is African-American.
``The women are out there, but you have to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to increase the number of women in top executive
positions in the Boston area, members of The Boston Club, an
organization of women executives, plans to conduct a census of
women executives and board members at public and private firms with
revenues of $50 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice A. Cramer, president of Next Frame Inc., a Boston
consumer consultancy and head of The Boston Club research effort,
said the firms with the least representation on their boards are
often consumer products companies that serve large numbers of
women. ``How can these (companies) pretend to understand customers
without having more women in senior management?''

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR OVERCOMES POPULIST CHALLENGE TO WIN 2ND
TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON,  
 &HT;     ZACHARY COILE and ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, who embraced the political
center to trounce the more liberal Tom Ammiano, heads into his
second term with a convincing mandate from San Francisco voters.
</P>
<P>
   A life-long Democrat, Brown became the first San Francisco mayor
to win re-election in more than a decade by attracting Republicans,
other conservatives and middle-of-the-road voters into a new,
broader coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Brown promised his new allies a voice in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in political campaigns now for 35 years,'' said
Brown, who served in the state Assembly for 31 years and became one
of California's most powerful politicians before winning the
mayor's job four years ago. ``I've been in every kind of campaign
that you can think of. This one, however, absolutely takes the
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown beat Ammiano, the president of the city's governing Board
of Supervisors, by a margin of 60 to 40 percent. Although both men
are Democrats, voters from the more conservative west side of San
Francisco turned out heavily in favor of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters supported either former Mayor Frank Jordan or
political consultant Clint Reilly in the Nov. 2 general election.
Ammiano rode a populist write-in campaign to a second-place
finished in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knew during the six-week run-off campaign that he would
have to broaden his political base beyond the more liberal east
side he has long cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Republican votes, Brown ran strongly among
Asian-American voters, a growing force in the city's electoral
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, 65, also spent more than $3 million in the costliest
mayoral election in the city's history and was the beneficiary of
more than $1 million spent by outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ammiano spent less than $300,000 and received
little financial help from independent sources.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's victory defies the recent past of his administration,
which has overseen a glittering economy but chronic problems with
public transportation, the homeless and the rising cost of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has been campaigning for the past 13 months, said he
ran the race of his life and it paid off: Nearly three of every
five voters decided to give him another term.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said at least part of his success was his
ability to portray Ammiano as a tax-and-spend politician who would
divide the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were successful in creating a bogeyman. It scared people,
and caused them to say that Willie Brown isn't so bad,'' said San
Francisco-based pollster David Binder.
</P>
<P>
   And if the landslide victory gave Brown a mandate, it is simply
to keep the economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Also key to Brown's win was a well-honed, and well-financed
get-out-the-vote effort that relied heavily on help from organized
labor, the Democratic Party and downtown interests.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pitched in, making phone calls to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, 58, wooed tenant activists, younger people voting for
the first time, homeless advocates and segments of the gay
community and rank-and-file labor. He said his candidacy should not
be looked at as a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not conceding the war. I am conceding the battle,''
Ammiano told his cheering supporters early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment that one seasoned political observers said
should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next battle is going to be district elections,'' Binder
said, refer to the November 2000 elections for the Board of
Supervisors. ``Now Brown has to work to see whether he can hold on
to his board majority. The next question is whether Ammiano puts
together a viable opposition group to challenge Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ammiano's immediate future, he remains as board
president. He said the contentious run-off campaign would not
change his working relationship with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be no different from now,'' Ammiano said. ``He feels I
never should have been elected president. He's had an aversion to
me.''

<P>
   Book publishing is seldom ahead of the curve. But as we get
ready to pop into a millennium of snap and speed, worrying
ourselves toward a time of communication concocted for its
abruptness, publishers seem to have caught on that there is a
longing out there for authentic personal connection. So letters are
in, and it should be acknowledged that there are few things more
fun than reading someone else's mail.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably why there are two collections of letters on
The New York Times best-seller list, two more on its extended Web
site list and several other rich ones in the bookstores. Part of it
is publishers' sensing a millennium-ending bittersweetness about
the past as we speed toward the eventual. Part is that obviously
the pleasures of gossip, voyeurism and intimacy have never left us,
but the only way to get intimate details is in a letter or a
conversation, and conversation disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greatest Generation Speaks'' (Random House), Tom Brokaw's
letter-collection follow-up to his ``Greatest Generation'' (Random
House), will be No. 2 on The Times' hardcover nonfiction list on
Dec. 26, and former President George Bush's ``All the Best, George
Bush'' (Scribner) will be No. 16. On the extended list is Andy
Rooney's ``Sincerely, Andy Rooney'' (PublicAffairs) and ``Letters
of the Century'' (Dial Press), edited by Lisa Grunwald and Stephen
J. Adler. The latter is in some ways the most interesting of the
collections in that its 400 letters were written by ordinary
people, politicians, scientists and writers, and the book provides
a sort of writerly syllabus to the entire century.
</P>
<P>
   Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam Dell, of
which Dial Press is an imprint, said that it ``connects in the way
a literary novel might, even though it doesn't have that heft.'' He
went on: ``It's the ultimate bathroom reading.'' The same could be
said of the others.
</P>
<P>
   The range of the best sellers consists of history, family and
celebrity letters, but Viking has two collections of literary
letters in bookstores, ``Henry James: A Life in Letters,'' edited
by Philip Horne, and ``Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters 1957-1969,''
edited by Ann Charters. Henry Holt &AMP; Co. has published ``Selected
Letters of Dawn Powell,'' edited by Tim Page. There is also
``Beloved Sisters and Loving Friends'' (Alfred A. Knopf), letters
of two 19th-century black women, one a teacher, the other a
domestic servant.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail may have contributed to the apparent renewed interest in
the epistolary. For although e-mail is mostly quick and terse, and
usually about as grounded in substance as a cork on water, it does
consist of putting one word after another and marching them off.
And they can be saved, so the form just might be a muted beginning
of a return to literacy after generations when it had appeared that
personal communication had taken place only over the telephone.
People seem now to seek actuality, which might be one lesson of the
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think this craving is not real, it should be noted
that Scribner has given Andrew Carroll a $500,000 advance for a
collection he is putting together of previously unpublished letters
from soldiers in all of the nation's wars. (Carroll is donating the
entire advance and his royalties to veterans' groups.)
</P>
<P>
   Where did all this one-to-one writing start? Cicero, a prolific
letter writer, likely wrote the first of what could be called the
literary (and gossip) letters. But the genre was fixed in form in
the salons of 17th-century France where les grandes dames wrote
letters that not only contained information pertinent to the
recipient but also news and gossip about their circles of friends,
and colorful descriptions of life of the aristocracy, including
juicy stuff going on in the court of Louis XIV. The letters were
written with wit, bite and drama; indeed, Proust referred to the
``Dostoyesvskyan style'' of ``The Letters of Mme. de Sevigne,''
whose correspondence was published in three volumes about 40 years
after her death in 1696. (A Paris street is named after her.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course writers and thinkers always corresponded. Voltaire
wrote thousands of letters; Raymond Chandler spent his insomniac
nights writing letters. Carroll, whose ``Letters of a Nation''
(Kodansha International, 1997) was a best seller, feels the current
appeal of letters comes ``at a time when things seem increasingly
dehumanized and technological and fast-paced, so there's a
nostalgia for tangible handwritten expressions of love and
friendship and support.'' He added, ``Letters are almost like
poems, requiring a lot of time to read and write.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Osnos, who is publishing Rooney's correspondence, said the
book had a first printing of 60,000 and a second of 40,000. He also
used the word nostalgia for what he described as a ``time when
people reflected.'' He said, ``I noticed that when I write e-mail,
I write them the way I used to receive cables, but I sign them
`best' or `regards.''' In essence, they are getting more letterish.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Grunwald, one of two editors of ``Letters of the Century,''
which has 100,000 copies in print, explains the appeal of such
books this way: ``There's nothing like reading other people's mail,
a privilege you don't usually get. You almost expect to find
yourself when you're reading. There's a voyeuristic sense that
gives you a kind of thrill; you find some personal stroke that
connects back to you. Thoughts. Feelings. You can browse.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the nice thing about a letter is its individuality.
Implicit in a letter not sent by e-mail _ whether you write it by
hand, type it or print it out on your computer _ is a suggestion to
the recipient, put in a leisurely way, that she is worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Jefferson, who has, as on so many subjects,
the last word on the unhurried appeal of the letter. He sent this
note to his secretary of state: ``We have not heard from our
ambassador to France for three years. If we do not hear from him
this year let us write him a letter.''

`THE CAST OF CHARACTERS': PUTTING `ULYSSES' ON FREUD'S COUCH TO
SEEK CLARITY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of literary illusion, it has been remarked that the simplest
peasant tilling the soil in a field is more complex a character
than Prince Hamlet. Yet Paul Schwaber, a practicing psychoanalyst
and a professor of letters at Wesleyan University, seems to give
the lie to that observation in his brilliant work of criticism,
``The Cast of Characters: A Reading of `Ulysses.''' The title
refers to the various dramatis personae, to what Schwaber calls the
``tenacious presence'' of the people in Joyce's great novel (as in
``the cast of a lengthening shadow''), and finally to the
``singularity within variousness'' that the characters in
``Ulysses'' achieve (in the sense of cast as the form in which
something is created).
</P>
<P>
   By examining the actions, statements and thoughts of Stephen
Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom and a few of the minor characters,
Schwaber reveals their rich inner lives, thereby making them seem
not only more complex than any peasant but also very nearly as
layered and contradictory as readers of ``Ulysses'' may seem to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Joyce's novel is perhaps uniquely suited to such
psychoanalytic treatment. Not much happens in the way of dramatic
action _ in 18 episodes a troubled young aspiring writer, Stephen,
and a middle-aged canvasser for advertisements, Leopold Bloom, go
their separate ways in Dublin and eventually cross paths _ but the
reader is given an incomparably intimate view of what goes on in
the characters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   As Schwaber reminds us: ```Ulysses,' by means of
characterizations that in context make real and credible the inner
lives of fictive persons, provides _ through artistic form and
aesthetic experience _ what scientific case studies cannot manage.
For it portrays minds in action: the specificity, rhythms, ideas,
associations, feelings and recurrences that distinguish and, in the
clinical situation, reveal distinct persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he concludes, ```Ulysses' allows us to test anew the
relevance of psychoanalytic observation and interpretation to
literary character as well as the adequacy of psychoanalysis itself
when brought to the bar of great literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwaber warms up by applying his technique to a few of the
characters in the 10th episode, ``The Wandering Rocks,'' which
Joyce intended as an entr'acte dividing the early, more
realistically written chapters from the later, more stylized
episodes, and which takes the form of 19 short segments tracing the
movements of various Dubliners around the city. Schwaber, by
showing how the novel ``grants epic attention to the psyches'' of
relatively minor characters, argues that it dovetails both ``with
Freud's psychoanalysis and, for all its elite demandingness of
readers, with a liberal and democratic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Schwaber settles down to questioning what is on the
unconscious minds of the major characters, not only Stephen and the
Blooms but also the narrator himself, whom he sees as separate from
Joyce and as increasingly asserting his quirky individuality as the
novel progresses.
</P>
<P>
   By pulling together fragments of verbal evidence that are
scattered throughout the book and that repeatedly take on a
dramatic life of their own in the climactic ``Circe'' chapter,
where Stephen and Bloom visit Nighttown, Schwaber offers some
answers. To sum them up as they apply to the three major characters
would risk a caricature in the most extreme vein of psychobabble.
Suffice it to say that they try to explain why Stephen and Bloom
are drawn to each other and why Molly's concluding soliloquy is
less an affirmation of life and love (``and yes I said yes I will
Yes'') than an extended expression of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one makes of Schwaber's analyses, their greatest appeal
lies in the process by which he arrives at them. For in gathering
his evidence he takes familiar passages and turns them from
two-dimensional words on the page into three-dimensional psychic
portraits. More than anything else, ``The Cast of Characters'' is
worthwhile as an aid to reading ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat less satisfying is Schwaber's analysis of the novel's
narrator, whom he sees as competing ``with his characters while
eccentrically identifying with them, all the while testing the
limits of his medium and the adequacy of his readers.'' While this
theory contrasts refreshingly with the traditional view that the
style of each episode was dictated in Joyce's mind by whatever
Homeric episode he was re-enacting, its results sometimes seem
faintly far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Schwaber proposes that the styles of the chapters
from ``The Oxen of the Sun'' to the end (Episodes 14 through 18)
reflect the narrator's being unhinged by the birth of Mina
Purefoy's child described in that chapter. ``Birthing defeats him.
He cannot match it, not with the best male help in the world.''
Schwaber continues: ``The self-awareness of `Ulysses,' apparent
from the first but showing increasing skepticism about words,
narratives and comprehensibility, would dovetail with the
flamboyant ventures of form and style by which the story continues
and the narrator shines _ silently shouting, `I am here,' afraid he
may not be. Whatever else they achieve, the vaunting styles may
elaborately deny a fear of nothingness _ as continual change may
confirm it.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems a very far cry from the Dedalean ideal of the artist
as the God of his creation, ``refined out of existence,
indifferent, paring his fingernails.'' Unless Joyce is so far
removed from his narrator that he could regard the hysteria with
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwaber's analysis of Joyce's characters remains
germane. For instance, by touching on Stephen's unrecognized need
for an understanding older man, and on Bloom's dependence on his
ill-observed Jewishness to be such a man, he suggests why Stephen's
singing a strain of Christian anti-Semitism at the climax of the
Ithaca chapter constitutes such an act of ``staggering rudeness''
as to sunder any hope of friendship between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not this is an exercise in gratuitously putting
Joyce's characters on the couch, it takes us to the heart of the
drama of ``Ulysses'' and sheds light on one of the many things that
happen in this novel of infinitely complex meaning.

 &HT;    Triangle fits neatly into Jackson's L.A. plan
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So far, dominating behemoth Shaquille O'Neal, brazenly
creative Kobe Bryant and prolific marksman Glen Rice have coexisted
wonderfully, like a trifecta of kindred spirits.
</P>
<P>
   And so, they've made the Los Angeles Lakers a juggernaut that's
something less than ``Showtime,'' but NBA's best road draw
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Tied with Portland for the best record in the league at 17-5,
the Lakers amble into Philips Arena tonight to take on the Hawks.
It is quite an accomplishment considering they've overcome:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bryant's broken hand that kept him sidelined at the start of
the season; they were 11-4 without him.
</P>
<P>
   _ O'Neal's horrible foul-shooting that at one time saw him at
less than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the constant trade rumors involving Rice that could have
affected his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly for first-year coach Phil Jackson, the team's
best three players have played together. The concern coming into
the season was if O'Neal could be content watching Bryant go
one-on-one and if Bryant could feel free to create if O'Neal's
begging for the ball in the low post and if Rice would feel left
out in either case.
</P>
<P>
   The answers have come back to be what Jackson envisioned _ or at
least hoped for. That is, the pecking order has been established
and accepted. The offense evolves around O'Neal, the 7-foot-1,
315-pound center who has performed like an MVP _ even with the
deplorable free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who returned last week from his stint on the injured
list, plays off O'Neal, finding the open spots on the floor.
Jackson's hyped triangle offense promotes spacing, and it allows
the 21-year-old Bryant room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   And because O'Neal and Bryant both command double-team
attention, it's important for Rice to have consistent movement away
from the ball, to the open areas on the floor. One of the best
spot-up shooters in the league, Rice plays off O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the offense was stagnant, but this year, with all
the movement, it can work with me and Glen,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice added: ``Whoever says we can't play together, that's the
most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   It works because of a few reasons. One, Jackson is the coach,
and the six championship rings he earned with the Chicago Bulls and
Michael Jordan gave him the ultimate respect of the players. In
short, they listen, something that could not be said about previous
coaches Del Harris and interim Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it will be a problem,'' Jackson said of
ball-sharing. ``Everything I've heard about, I haven't seen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What he has not seen too much of is the Lakers operating as they
did last year as a group of one-one-one players. Bryant, in
particular, tried O'Neal's patience by looking for his shot no
matter if O'Neal had low-post position or if Rice was open. It got
so bad that O'Neal had words with Bryant, and the word traveled
around the league that the young stars were at odds.
</P>
<P>
   If that was true then, it is not now. Bryant invited O'Neal to
his birthday party in the summer, and O'Neal attended. Since
Bryant's return from the injured list, he's had only brief flashes
of the doing-too-much antics that were troublesome last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of responsibility on (Bryant), because he's a
creative player and also a very talented player,'' Jackson said.
``He fully understands the role. But I think he doesn't quite grasp
the severity of the situation, the responsibility of the whole
situation. We'll have to ... wait until Kobe braces the season
enough to have that experience to handle those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation between O'Neal and Bryant has been smooth because
of the other reason they've been successful: O'Neal has been
utterly dominant, the axile of that offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have flourished despite a deficiency at power forward
because O'Neal, 27, has been mammoth inside. He's averaging a
league-leading 28 points and second-best 14.0 rebounds. Many times,
he is so imposing, it's frightening.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of the triangle offense allows O'Neal to catch the ball
in various positions and advantagous angles that allows the big man
to use his mobility and strength.
</P>
<P>
   And he's doing it better than anyone else. ``I look at him at 27
years old, and if he's not MVP of this league so far,'' executive
vice president Jerry West said, ``I don't think the award means
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a free agent after this season, means much to the Lakers'
plans. Since Jackson's arrival, the rumors persist that he'd be
dealt, particularly for Scottie Pippen. He's battled through them
in a way that pleases Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really congratulated him on keeping himself as
professional as possible during the period of time when there's so
much speculation on his availability, his being a part of a
trade,'' Jackson said. ``I've thought he's kept his head in the
game, he's kept his mood positive, he hasn't lost his
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither has the team. It's O'Neal first, everyone else
second. O'Neal said: ``I'm like Donna Summer. I work hard for the
money.''

E-COMMERCE FRUSTRATING TO SOME, BOON TO OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Genest, a public relations executive, is upset. On
crutches with a foot injury, she decided to do her holiday shopping
on line rather than go to the malls.
</P>
<P>
   But when she tried to buy a car racetrack set for her 6-year-old
son, she wound up with a large toy airplane instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total nightmare,'' she said of shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, e-commerce professor Bruce D. Weinberg has
had a different experience. As of September, he stopped shopping in
brick-and-mortar stores altogether, buying everything from holiday
gifts to tires and light bulbs on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ton of fun,'' said Weinberg, who added, ``I'm straining
to think of something terrible that happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With holiday shoppers expected to spend $6 billion to $10
billion this season, anecdotal evidence abounds about retail Web
sites crashing or fouling up orders, but e-commerce analysts claim
on-line shopping is not all that different from shopping in the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are on-line hassles, analyst said, but there are
hassles at malls and department stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   On-line horror stories have been ``well publicized,'' said Seema
Williams, an analyst at Forrester Research. ``But there have been
no wholesale disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, on-line holiday shopping went mainstream last
year when consumers spent a total of about $3 billion on
holiday-related purchases, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of problems in 1998. Many Web sites couldn't
handle the crush of business. Consumers found some sites hard to
navigate, and other sites couldn't manage to get the right orders
to the right consumers at the right times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, traffic is far heavier. According to Jupiter, 28.8
million consumers will shop on line this year, 10 million more than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are seeing exponential jumps. In Waltham, Mass.,
toysmart.com equaled the number of orders it received for all of
December 1998 in the first 30 hours of December 1999, spokesman
Patrick Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several big retailers have seen traffic to their Web
sites double since October, said Christopher Vroom, an analyst with
Thomas Weisel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   One reason some consumers have problems with retail Web sites
may be that their expectations are too high, said analyst Alan
Alper with Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce technology is still ``immature,'' he said, yet some
people expect it to function as smoothly as ``clockwork.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter, the most experienced on-line shoppers know
better than to place too much faith in Web retailers just yet. In a
recent survey, shoppers told Jupiter that they plan to spend less
than 10 percent of their holiday budgets at retail Web sites
because they expect to encounter on-line snafus.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to take a chance that their holiday orders won't
arrive on time _ or that they'll get the wrong stuff _ these
consumers said they plan to do the bulk of their shopping at
old-fashioned stores and malls, Jupiter found.
</P>
<P>
   Given the novelty of on-line shopping, some consumers might
think a mysterious new technology is to blame for most problems.
But the real challenge may be more mundane, and more humbling.
</P>
<P>
   After a consumer hits the ``buy'' button at a Web site, a
retailer must perform a sequence of steps that can add up to a
logistical headache: first, the order must be picked from warehouse
shelves, then it must be properly packed, and finally it must be
turned over to a delivery service such as UPS to get the package to
a consumer's home.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound all that difficult, but multiply it many
times over, compress the crunch time into a six-week window, and
order fulfillment can become a daunting task indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the brick-and-mortar world, te retailer is known for its mastery of technology, yet its
retail Web site is not working as smoothly as hoped. Last week,
Wal-Mart posted a note on its Web site saying it can't guarantee
orders will be delivered by Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Many so-called ``pure-play'' e-commerce retailers _ retailers
that have no stores and sell products only over the Internet _ hire
third parties to handle many order-fulfillment tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Amazon.com, have invested heavily in building a
network of automated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Because e-commerce companies employ different strategies and
because some of them execute those strategies much better than
others, a consumer's experience can vary widely from Web site to
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Web is chock-a-block with e-commerce upstarts,
and a post-holiday period of shakeout and consolidation is almost
inevitable, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Vroom believes the survivors will be the Web sites with
which consumers have the fewest hassles, and those probably will be
the ones that have focused the most on the logistics of fulfilling
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Genest, from Stoneham, Mass., had her order fulfilled all right.
It was just that eToys.com, the Web site at which she made her
purchases, sent her a toy airplane instead of toy cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane is taking up the better part of my living room,''
she said of the six-foot-long package.
</P>
<P>
   Genest said she has contacted eToys twice by phone. Once she was
put on hold for 30 minutes. If things aren't straightened out by
the weekend, she'll brave the mall, bad foot and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really need a heavy incentive to do this again,'' she said
of on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some customers are experiencing frustrations, and we're
genuinely sorry about that,'' said eToys spokesman Ken Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with a ``significant uptick'' in the number of orders it
has received, eToys is working ``24 hours a day seven days a week''
on service and delivery and is dedicated to improving all aspects
of its shopping experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider eToys to be one of the best e-commerce
retailers and they agreed with Ross's claim that bad experiences at
the eToys Web site is the exception and not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, BU professor Weinberg said he's had mostly good
shopping experiences on line. Amazon.com and Landsend.com are among
the sites that have impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   For many e-commerce retailers, a bigger challenge may come after
Christmas, when many consumers attempt to return and exchange
gifts, said Alper, the Gomez analyst.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many Web sites suffer from growing pains, but
eventually the best ones will get it right, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Alper, ``The time savings and convenience'' that on-line
shopping offers to consumers ``are too much to give up on.''

RULING PROTECTS CHINESE FLAG IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE HOR-CHUNG LAU AND INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a ruling that calls into question the promise to
safeguard civil rights following Hong Kong's return to China, Hong
Kong's chief justice has declared the desecration of China's flag
offensive, and warned that ``freedom of expression is not an
absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   This former British colony and financial center was returned to
China in 1997 with written guarantees that it would retain its
capitalist economy and legal system for at least 50 years, and
enjoy autonomy on most issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling Wednesday by Hong Kong's highest court that free
speech here has limits _ as well as its Dec. 3 judgment that
China's parliament has the right to interpret local law and
overrule the court _ cast serious doubt on the willingness of Hong
Kong's top justices to defend the territory's independence from
mainland rule.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the landmark case was a controversial ``flag law''
banning the desecration of Hong Kong's flag and China's flag _ a
law enacted by temporary, Beijing-appointed local legislators just
hours after Hong Kong's handover to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, pro-democracy activists Ng Kung-Siu, 25, and
Lee King-yung, 19, were arrested for scrawling the Chinese
character for ``shame'' on the national flag to protest the
killings of hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy
demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were originally fined about $250 and put on
probation for 12 months. But last May, an appeals court overturned
the ruling and backed the two activists, saying the flag law
violated personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government took the case back to court, and Chief
Justice Andrew Li ruled in the government's favor, saying that
mutilating the flag is an insult to the nation's ``dignity, unity
and territorial integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the US Supreme Court struck down state laws that
prohibited the desecration of the US flag. In the last four years,
conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives have
thrice passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban
flag burning or desecration, but twice so far, the Senate has
struck down the plan, and is expected to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, government lawyers hailed their local victory,
with Acting Solicitor General Robert Allcock asserting the decision
does not restrict freedom of speech, but rather bans a mode of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   But Law Yuk-kai, director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor,
called Ng and Lee ``criminals of conscience'' and said the ruling
had far-reaching and frightening implications. It is a serious
``blow to Hong Kong's democracy ... the second disappointing
judgment within a month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court seems to be happy to be part of the state machinery,
instead of a guardian of liberty,'' Law complained. ``The truth is
that our courts can no longer adjudicate without being tainted by
fear and favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ng's frustrated lawyer, pro-democracy legislator Albert Ho, put
it even more simply: ``Certain rights that Hong Kong people used to
enjoy before the handover can now be taken away by law,'' Ho said
in disbelief.

EVEN CRITICS GIVE CLINTON CREDIT FOR DIPLOMATIC SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was plenty of tension and no handshake, but
for President Clinton, the mere presence of Syrian and Israeli
leaders in the Rose Garden Wednesday was enough to underscore
perhaps his greatest strength as a world leader: an uncanny ability
to bring feuding parties to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   From Northern Ireland to the Balkans and the Middle East,
Clinton has used his personal powers of persuasion to persuade
leaders of warring nations to sit down together. The re-opening of
talks between Israeli and Syria Wednesday, if successful, could end
up being a cirtical part of Clinton's foreign policy legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's critics concede that the president's personal
style is unusually conciliating, even healing, quality that aids
his efforts at diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the open question is whether the president's personal pleas
for reconciliation are compelling enough to bring lasting peace to
long-troubled regions. A number of foreign policy experts say no,
and contend that the Clinton administration has frequently failed
to do the necessary follow-through after an international crisis
disappears from the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what he does _ he loves to make it happen. And then he
forgets about it,'' said Bulent Aliriza, a policy analyst the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``He
goes all over the world trying to solve whatever problem that ever
was,'' but he does not, and probably cannot, commit the time, and
US military might, to make it stick, Aliriza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's most comfortable in his role as negotiator. The
kind of foreign policy he feels most comfortable with is a classic
confrontation,'' said Richard Haass, a scholar with the Brookings
Institution and a former Bush administration official. ``It is
somewhat analagous to his upbringing in the South, during the civil
rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Clinton is less successful, Haass said, is in cases where
there is no immediate crisis to solve, when the question is how to
deal with powers like China whose interests conflict with US goals,
or the economic and political troubles in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good many foreign policy problems don't lend themselves to
`let's-split-the-difference,' '' Haass said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has often voiced a deep personal commitment to bringing
harmony to all sorts of ethnic and racial groups. He preaches a
message of tolerance at home and abroad, urging an end to ethnic
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, one of the most important aspects of the president's
foreign policy, as he sees it, is the United States as
peace-maker,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. ``There's no doubt that the president's own
personality is ideally suited for this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, Clinton gets personally involved in seeking a
rapprochement, Leavy said, almost compulsively working the phones
to convince sparring leaders to meet. In the case of Syria and
Israel, the president made 31 phone calls since July to arrange a
sit-down between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, the president's
can't-we-all-just-get-along message often doesn't work, analysts
said, particularly in cases where the hatred runs long and deep.
</P>
<P>
   On his 11-day trip to Europe last month, the president made
appeals for harmony to the Serbs and the Albanians, the Russians
and the Chechens, the Greeks and the Turks, and the Armenians and
the Azeris. Weeks later, Russia is still pounding Chechnya with
bombs, violence between Albanians and Serbs continues in Kosovo,
and there has been no progress in the dispute between Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Doure, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, said Clinton, who campaigned on a domestic
agenda when he won the presidency in 1992, has had a series of
international crises dumped on his desk and has mistakenly used a
domestic approach to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   The message of racial and ethnic healing ``appeals to the
American sense,'' Doure said. ``That's what his instincts are.''
</P>
<P>
   One place Clinton appears to have had some success is in the
ongoing dispute between Turkey and Greece over the divided island
of Cyprus. Turkey was recently invited to begin negotiations to
join the European Union _ a move Clinton strongly supports _ and
the Turkish press has given great credit to Clinton for his
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   No president is capable, however, of forcing peace when two
sides are committed to fighting, analysts agree. ``There's only so
much influence the United States has,'' Leavy said.

 &HT;    Daft named interim director of Coca-Cola
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta and Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co.'s board has added another director,
Douglas Daft, the new president and chief operating officer who is
expected to become chairman and chief executive officer in April.
</P>
<P>
   Daft's appointment further solidifies his position at the soft
drink company following the surprise notice last week that Chairman
and CEO M. Douglas Ivester will retire in the spring. That decision
was made at a specially called board meeting Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, 56, will serve as an interim director until the annual
shareholders meeting in April, when shareholders will vote on
whether to name him to the board permanently.
</P>
<P>
   With his addition, the number of Coke directors increases to 13.
Ivester will continue as chairman and CEO until April and will
serve as a consultant to the company afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The board also elected four company officers to new positions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary P. Fayard was promoted to senior vice president and chief
financial officer, succeeding James Chestnut, who was promoted in
October to senior vice president of operations support.
</P>
<P>
   Fayard, who has been with Coca-Cola Co. since April 1994, was
vice president and controller until Dec. 1, when he became acting
chief financial officer. He previously was a partner at Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   _ Connie D. McDaniel will succeed Fayard as vice president and
controller. McDaniel was named acting controller on Dec. 1.
Previously she had been finance director for the company's German
division.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alexander R.C. ``Sandy'' Allan was named senior vice president
in charge of the Middle and Far East Group, a position Daft held
before a management reorganization in late October. Allan,
president of the Middle and Far East Group, has been with the
company for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark D. O'Shaughnessy, a 21-year veteran of the company, was
named vice president. O'Shaughnessy has been with the company's
McDonald's Group since September 1995, and he assumed
responsibility for worldwide McDonald's restaurant business in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock, meanwhile, continued to lose ground this week
in the aftermath of Ivester's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which had shown signs of a comeback since falling
sharply days after Ivester's initial announcement Dec. 6, was down
$1.62 1/2 at $59.81 1/4 just after trading stopped for the day on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   So far this week, the stock is down about 5 percent. It traded
as low as $59.37 1/2 Wednesday.

A CHAMPION OF CAPITALISM IN INDIA HOLDS OUT HOPE FOR THE
DOWNTRODDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGALORE, India _ The slight, bespectacled computer engineer
who starts each day by cleaning the toilet in his family's spartan
two-bedroom apartment hardly seems to be the new archetype of a
wildly successful Indian entrepreneur, boldly steering his country
away from decades of state-dominated, bureaucratic socialism and
into a new era of capitalist growth.
</P>
<P>
   But in India, where a long line of Hindu ascetics have captured
the popular imagination _ most famously, the independence leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi _ it is fitting that one of the country's most
influential champions of capitalism and hottest software tycoons
should be a man who lives as if he were a humble government clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The man, N.R. Narayana Murthy (pronounced MOOR-tee), was making
$25,000 a year as a software engineer in a Bombay company when he
founded Infosys Technologies Ltd. in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He sheepishly estimated his net worth at $600 million in stock
recently as he sat on a plain, angular couch in his living room,
harshly lighted by a bare fluorescent bulb.
</P>
<P>
   As the gap between the richest and poorest widens in booming
cities like this one, Murthy, 53, the son of a high-caste Brahmin
math teacher, says the new rich must live simply, even austerely,
if capitalism is to become an accepted model for social betterment
in a country where 300 million poor people still struggle just to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary rise of Murthy, his company and the software
services industry in India has come to represent the hope that what
he calls ``compassionate capitalism'' can provide decent,
desperately needed jobs and the national wealth to improve health
and literacy levels in a country whose population has more than
tripled since it won independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to sell capitalism to the people, we have to
practice a lifestyle that does not seem unattainable,'' he said.
``We want more and more people to become entrepreneurs. If the tea
stall owner in a small village can say, `Hey, these guys can do it;
so can I,' and get his business into the next orbit, then our job
is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Murthy, a former leftist who is the first member of his family
to go into business, saw the potential of the software services
industry earlier than most.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that Indian companies could employ Indian computer
engineers _ who speak English and are willing to work for a
fraction of what their American counterparts earn _ to make healthy
profits selling software services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   The first decade was hard. The country still had a centrally
planned, government-dominated economy. It took Murthy nine months
to get the company's first telephone line and three years to
persuade the bureaucracy to allow Infosys to import its first
computers. Whenever people in the company needed to travel abroad,
they had to get permission from a government official.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, facing a severe balance of payments crisis, the
Indian government began loosening its hold on the economy. Murthy's
staff no longer needed permission to travel, and barriers to
importing the latest technology were removed. The government office
that had set the prices on stock offerings at below-market levels
was abolished. In 1993, Infosys went public with a $10 million
valuation, generating the capital for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies like Infosys have been less hobbled by
India's chronically poor roads, unreliable phone lines and frequent
power outages than other industries. Infosys can ship its products
over private satellite lines. And it has built its own power
generators to guarantee a steady supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken off in the 1990s, growing at rates that
have ranged from 27 percent to 106 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   This year its stock seems to scale dizzying new heights daily.
It has climbed past more established companies to become the second
or third most highly valued company on the Bombay stock exchange,
depending on the day, with a market capitalization of more than $7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In March it became the first Indian company listed on an
American stock exchange, Nasdaq, where its share price then
rocketed from $34 to more than $250, with a market capitalization
above $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has pioneered changes in the business culture of
India, offering stock options to workers, opening its books to
independent auditors and starting a foundation to help the
underprivileged, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves have built investor confidence and employee loyalty,
enabling Infosys to hang on to talent that has been assiduously
courted by the multinationals that have moved to India. Other
companies in the south Indian triangle of high technology _
Bangalore, Madras and Hyderabad _ have adopted similar strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of the newly minted yuppie wealth in Bangalore, with a
population of over 5 million, are visible in bustling streets lined
with brand-name stores, a profusion of pubs where twentysomething
programmers go to party, and large new apartment complexes decked
out with health clubs, bowling alleys, swimming pools and tennis
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in India, where the biggest industrial houses have
traditionally been handed down through families like feudal
empires, Murthy founded Infosys with six men who had each been
earning about $5,000 a year while they worked under him in a Bombay
company's software unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infosys shows that it is possible for middle-class people with
no family heritage of being in business to build a lot of wealth
from scratch in one generation,'' said Nandan M. Nilekani, who
helped found the company in his 20s and who is now its 44-year-old
chief operating officer and president. ``It is creating
opportunities for people who thought the only way to get ahead was
to migrate to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Like young people now thronging the industry, the company's
founders were educated in the huge network of universities and
engineering colleges in India that has produced a pool of
technically skilled, English-speaking workers second only to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While India has neglected primary education, it built first-rate
schools in the 1950s and 1960s like the Indian Institutes of
Technology as part of its striving, as a young nation, for
scientific and industrial achievement. Murthy earned his master's
in electrical engineering at the institute in Kanpur and has since
become a benefactor of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many institute graduates still migrate to Silicon Valley in
search of high-paying jobs, but increasingly there are
opportunities for them at home.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of Infosys' 5,000 employees _ whose average
age is 26, as in the industry as a whole _ hold stock options and
125 of them have become millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 74,000 people, virtually all of them engineers,
applied for 1,500 jobs at the company. Salaries start at about
$4,000 a year in a country where per capita income is less than
$400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Murthy, who makes a salary of $36,000 a year for serving as
chief executive of Infosys, was horrified when asked recently if
his children would inherit the business. ``No, no!'' he exclaimed.
``Absolutely not. I can stand on any platform and say we run our
company in the most professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The software industry is growing up not just in south India, but
also to the north in New Delhi and nearby Gurgaon and to the west
in Bombay and Pune. India's software exports have risen from to
$2.7 billion last year from $150 million in 1991, most of them
bo the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 600 companies in India that export
software services, employing 280,000 computer engineers, according
to the New Delhi-based industry association, the National
Association of Software and Service Companies.
</P>
<P>
   These young men and women write computer programs for basic
corporate functions: payroll, inventory, billing and sales
commissions. They fix Y2K problems. And they design systems for
electronic commerce ventures, as well as for the myriad other
software applications of computers in business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them will strike out on their own. ``The bug is biting
in Bangalore,'' said Ashwin Hegde, 26, a computer engineer at
Infosys. ``That's what everybody is thinking about all the time _
starting your own company. There's a lot of money to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   While the software industry has provided good jobs, and those
workers in turn have created a demand for housing, restaurants and
other services in Bangalore, the presence of the industry has not
done as much as executives at Infosys would like to broadly improve
the city's schools, roads and health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to form a stronger link between the software boom and
the benefit to society,'' said Nilekani, president of Infosys.
``How does the city get hard cash to improve itself?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is no state income tax in Karnataka. The system for
collecting property taxes in the city is weak, they say. And the
national government levies no income tax on profits from software
exports _ a situation that Murthy says should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country like India, which is starved for resources, I
don't see any justification for tax exemptions for companies which
compete successfully in the global marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Infosys' 42-acre campus in Bangalore, Murthy rushed around
one recent afternoon, overseeing the large-scale expansion of
office space now going up, scribbling his OK on every aspect of the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is a balding man with dark circles under his eyes whose pants
are pulled up a little high on his waist. At Infosys, his word is
law. In the men's room, decorated in malachite green marble, he
said the white cabinets had to go. In the pantry, he decreed there
must be a place for the man who makes the tea to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   On a decorative bracket painted bright yellow, he simply
scribbled, ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For young engineers, this new workplace will offer many perks: a
gymnasium and aerobics studio, a meditation room and pool hall, a
jacuzzi na, not to mention beautifully landscaped grounds
planted with trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed in the details of the building project, Murthy seemed
surprised when asked how he could be so caught up in the aesthetics
of the company's home and so inattentive to his own. Pen raised to
sign off on a soft gray stone tile, he paused to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long we have emphasized matters that are personal and
familial,'' he said. ``I have a fetish. I am extremely fastidious
about anything public. In my personal life, as long as its clean
it's OK. In this country, people have to start putting the public
ahead of the personal good.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS TEXAS HIGHWAY POLLUTION WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a free-wheeling state where driving is seen almost as a
birthright, the proposals sound positively un-Texan. Lower freeway
speed limits to 55 mph? Require people to take the bus to work once
a week? Ban heavy construction vehicles in the morning?
</P>
<P>
   Under mounting pressure from the federal government, regulators
in Austin will debate just such controversial proposals Thursday as
they try to clean up widespread air pollution in urban areas such
as Houston, which replaced Los Angeles as the nation's smog capital
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the administration of Gov. George W. Bush talks
about tough actions, Texas lobbyists are trying to seriously weaken
one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's strongest tools to
prod states to clear the air: the power to stop highway
construction in polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
   Top Texas officials are pushing Congress to change the Clean Air
Act so that hundreds of millions of dollars in highway projects
from Dallas to San Antonio could not be halted even if EPA finds
they would increase smog. Environmentalists say the lobbying
campaign casts doubt on the sincerity of the state's plans and
could threaten air cleanups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of officials in Texas government who think
that the way to play this game is to trash the Clean Air Act . . .
so they can just build highways whenever they want to,'' said
Michael Replogle, transportation director at the New York-based
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's position as frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination has already brought national media
attention to Texas pollution. If elected president, Bush has
promised to clean up the nation's air, but environmentalists and
even some self-described Bush admirers say he seldom stood up for
the environment in five years as governor until recently.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Texas officials say they just want flexibility to
clean up the air without wrecking the economy. They say they don't
need a highway freeze to motivate them to clean up Houston's air,
noting that Bush and the legislature have already endorsed a sharp
reduction in pollution from old power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is cleaning up the air. You have the regulatory
pressures that can be pretty crushing at times (but) we are moving
in the direction that we want to move in,'' said Patrick Crimmins,
spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Crimmins said the more drastic proposals before his agency, such
as a 25 percent cut in driving in Houston, are unlikely to be
adopted, but their presence om the commission's agenda underscores
how seriously officials take the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and EPA officials alike warn that, without
a threatened crackdown on highway construction, Texas won't have to
stop the urban sprawl that increases smog by inducing people to
drive more. The Texas Department of Transportation forecasts
another 45 percent increase in driving statewide by 2017, on top of
a 325 percent increase since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that law is gutted and there are no longer billions of
dollars of highway dollars at stake, believe me, there will be a
complete switch'' in the state's air cleanup, said Neil Carman,
clean air director for the Sierra Club in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The air war in Texas has been brewing for years as major cities
in the eastern part of the state mushroomed with relatively few
environmental limits. While officials in states such as
Massachusetts and California took steps like forcing automakers to
build cleaner cars, Texas put off strong action, even scrapping a
$140 million system for testing vehicle exhaust in 1995 after it
had already been constructed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, EPA turned up the heat, threatening in May to
withhold federal highway money if the Dallas-Ft. Worth area did not
come up with a complete ``state implementation plan'' outlining how
the area would control ozone, the main ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest concern to Texas officials may be the type of
penalty facing Houston, where EPA last month froze construction of
new roads except those that are already funded or essential to
public safety. The freeze, known as a ``conformity lapse'' to
regulators, is intended to make sure that polluted cities don't
undercut pollution control efforts by building more highways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Houston freeze is likely to end once the state comes
up with new proposed pollution reductions, Texas officials fear it
is the start of a wave of ``conformity lapses'' that could stop
billions of dollars worth of highway projects for up to five years
as they try to curb air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bush administration backs a bill that would
make it harder for EPA to stop highway projects. The Texans argue
that projects with completed environmental studies should be exempt
from any freeze, while the current standard exempts only projects
that have received funding.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists argue that Texas is trying to open a
loophole that a federal court closed earlier this year after the
city of Atlanta abused it. Faced with a highway freeze, Atlanta
regional officials rushed 130 road projects through environmental
studies so that the freeze would not affect them, providing enough
work to keep road crews busy for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Since a Washington court of appeals shot down Atlanta's road
building strategy, however, officials have poured money into mass
transit projects. Texas, say environmentalists, would do well to
follow Atlanta's example rather than trying to reduce environmental
penalties.

`DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY DOESN'T WORK  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN WEDNESDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The military's ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy is a
clumsy political dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Its failures are illustrated in ugly detail by the beating death
of a gay soldier at Fort Campbell, Ky., and the threatened
dismissal of Rep. Steve May, a valuable reserve officer right here
at home.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's characterization of the policy as ``out of
whack'' is a hollow understatement from a commander-in-chief who
refused to take command of this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for a re-examination of the policy is another
inadequate response. The president ought to follow his wife's
example and insist that gays be allowed to serve openly in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing them into shameful silence encourages abuse and results
in demonstrable injustices.
</P>
<P>
   Pfc. Barry Winchell, for example, was bludgeoned to death in his
Fort Campbell barracks after enduring months of the kind of taunts
and harassment that are supposedly forbidden by the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than protect a gay or lesbian soldier from harassment,
the policy protects the abuser. A soldier under homophobic attack
exposes himself or herself to forced dismissal from the service by
describing the reason for the taunts.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, as Winchell's case shows, such taunts can escalate
into deadly violence.
</P>
<P>
   Simple honesty also results in negative consequences under an
idiotic policy ostensibly designed to protect homosexual service
members.
</P>
<P>
   Reservist Lt. May was characterized as ``one of the finest young
officers`` in an Army performance review. Yet May faces discharge
because he spoke openly about his sexual orientation. He revealed
that he is gay in response to an anti-gay bill at the Arizona
Legislature, where he serves his constituents with the kind of
candor the military forbids.
</P>
<P>
   If he is forced from the service under the ``Don't ask, don't
tell'' policy, the nation will lose a highly trained and effective
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has cost the military many such people. The Pentagon
reported that 1,145 people were discharged last year for being gay.
That's nearly twice the number than in the year the policy went
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain is moving to end its ban on homosexuals in
the military. ``Someone's sexuality is a private matter,'' British
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said. A new code of conduct that's
expected to be drawn up next year will prohibit sexual activity by
on-duty personnel. Sexual orientation will no longer be a reason to
exclude people from the service.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of reasoned approach Clinton and the United
States military need to embrace. &QL;

`THE SHATTERED MIND': A NEW ROLE FOR THE FAMILY IN CASES OF
SCHIZOPHRENIA
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schizophrenia produces headlines when a tormented mind produces
an act of violence that is often described as senseless or random.
But the violence has its reasons, churning in brains afflicted by
delusions of threat or persecution or superiority. ``The Shattered
Mind'' offers hope in new generations of psychotropic drugs that
cannot cure the ailment but can subdue its outbreaks while
scientists strive for a better understanding of the workings or
misworkings of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   By the estimate of Friday night's A&AMP;E documentary, some 2
million people have schizophrenia, about 10 percent of them
potentially violent. Most don't acknowledge their illness, and even
those who do may not take medication for it. Dire case histories
are featured, such as the young man, in and out of mental
institutions, on drugs and off, who ran a souvenir sword through
his mother's body, killing her. A psychiatrist suggests that he
struck out in what he believed was self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Although some psychiatrists maintain that schizophrenia should
be treated by therapy and that drugs can further damage the brain,
the program reports that ``the overwhelming majority of
psychiatrists'' now put their faith in medication. Instead of
tracing the illness to a patient's family in a traditional
psychoanalytic approach, they are more inclined to see the family
as an asset in making sure that the patient takes his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   First-person testimony to the delusions of schizophrenia come in
particular from a Long Island man who had a breakdown while an art
student. He tells of believing he was King Tut, throwing bottles
and phones through windows and spending time in jails and mental
wards. Now on medication, he can laugh about his past disturbances
and evidently confines his hallucinations to his canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kurtis, the host of ``Investigative Reports,'' discerns a
``unique style'' shining through his work. Viewers may differ about
the quality of the paintings, but if they offer a channel for
emotions that once threatened his own life as well as others, even
connoisseurs are not likely to quibble.

POLITICAL PRIORITY IN N.H.: THE INDEPENDENT VOTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John McCain and Bill Bradley grasp hands across party lines
amidst a forest of camera tripods in Claremont, N.H. Thursday over
their common support for campaign finance reform, both candidates
will also share the same political priority: corralling Independent
voters who seem attracted by their outsider status.
</P>
<P>
   Few voters rate the campaign finance issue itself very highly on
the spectrum of national priorities. But its symbolism _ that
Washington needs to be wrested from the grasp of insiders _ has
become a powerful elixir for many voters and has already helped
lift both men into contention for their party's presidential
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday, strategists in both parties said
Republican McCain and Democrat Bradley both hope to solidify their
images, especially among Independents, as innovators willing to
take on the established interests who have gathered around Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The joint meeting has also served to focus attention on the
state's swelling ranks of Independent voters, and whether they may
place a decisive role in the outcome of either, or both, party
primaries on February 1.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, at least, Bradley and McCain have found a
receptive audience among such voters, one that has surprising
overlap considering how far apart the two are ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain tells you what he thinks and what he'll do. I like
that. We've had too many liars in the White House,'' said Lucille
Bradley, a retired nurse from Manchester who said she regrets
voting for Bill Clinton. Patricia Anderson, an undecided voter who
lives in Marlow, a town near Keene, said she's undecided but added:
``I like Bill Bradley. He's got new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, noted Wednesday that a new TIME/CNN poll in
New Hampshire shows both McCain and Bradley scoring well against
their intra-party rivals for inspiring voters and offering fresh
ideas. Both insurgents, Kohut said, appear to be benefiting from a
perception that they are genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty smart thing for them to be doing -- whatever
their differences -- to draw attention to how new and different
their candidacies are,'' Kohut said, of the joint appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a critical audience for both men, it is Independent
voters like Anderson, who says she's leaning toward taking a
Democratic ballot but just might take a GOP ballot and vote for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   According to several recent polls, which have McCain even with
Bush and Bradley deadlocked with Gore in voter preference, it is
Independent voters who have provided both men with their strongest
support.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independent voter infatuation with McCain and
Bradley looms large in New Hampshire; both men are hugely popular
with this group, much more so than Gore or Bush, according to
several recent polls. These voters, officially called
``unenrolled,'' can vote in either primary, and they are now a
plurality in the state. Secretary of State William Gardner, in an
interview Wednesday, said newly registered voters are predominantly
unenrolled and young, with most believing the government is run by
special interests and that officeholders do not work for the common
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young voters don't have any party allegiance, but we
don't know if they will actually vote,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth of unenrolled voters, most analysts believe
the vast majority of Independents are either predictable Republican
or Democratic voters in primaries. And though polls show that
Democratic-leaning Independents like McCain and Republican-leaning
Independents admire Bradley, substantial doubt remains that there
is a large pool of potential crossover voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not convinced that there are a lot of Independent
voters who could vote for either Bradley or McCain, since these two
candidates are so far apart on policy positions,'' said Dean
Spiliotes, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. But for
some Independents, Spiliotes added, it's possible that
preoccupation with general traits _ like leadership style and
reformist tendencies _ ``could trump'' their concerns about issue
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even on campaign finance, the differences of style and
substance McCain and Bradley are notable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a greater rhetorical claim to the issue: It is the
foundation to his campaign, that the special interests -- and not
the voters -- control what happens in Washington, even in the
Senate Commerce Committee he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley makes more sparing use of the issue. Some Democrats
Wednesday said it often seems largely a cudgel that can be used to
bloody Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if John McCain raises the fundraising abuses of the
Clinton-Gore campaign of 1996, Bill Bradley will be happy to be
standing there,'' said William G. Carrick, a Democratic political
consultant based in California.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a former state attorney general who is
supporting Bush, said the campaign finance appeal holds
considerable potential for Bradley, since Democrats are more likely
to be receptive on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rath said registered Republicans are more likely to be cool to
changing a system that tends to benefit their party more. ``John
McCain is hoping to appeal to ``small i'' Independents who have
less allegiance to the party. ``There's a quirkiness to these
voters, and John McCain wants everyone to know that he's the guy
who's out of step,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   If campaign finance reform has added to the Bradley and McCain
appeal, and gives it more lustre, it is not because either man
holds the moral high ground on the issue, say their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, Gore's spokesman in New Hampshire, was somewhat
bemused by the reform labels Bradley and McCain are wearing. Both
men, he noted Wednesday, have been flying around the country on
corporate jets provided by special interests, and paying just a
fraction of the cost -- a common, and legal, practice under the
present campaign finance system. And both men have mined special
interests for much of the money they have raised.
</P>
<P>
   Then too, Bradley and McCain have far different ideas about what
constitutes reform. McCain wants to ban so-called soft money, the
unlimited amounts that corporations and individuals can give to
party committees for party-building, though the donations are often
spent to support the candidates. Bradley supports an end to soft
money. But he also advocates public financing of Congressional
campaigns _ which McCain opposes
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley and McCain campaigns chose Claremont for symbolic
reasons too. It is where Clinton and then House Speaker Newt
Gingrich met in 1995 and, with a handshake, promised to create a
commission to look at changing campaign finance laws. The
commission never materialized. And a year later, both parties
loosely interpreted existing law to raise tens of millions of
dollars. Clinton, for one, was accused of renting out the Lincoln
Bedroom in the White House in return for large donations. Gore even
raised funds during a visit to a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, there remains a bitter aftertaste for some
voters. ``I believed in Bill Clinton. But he destroyed any trust I
had in him -- and in the people around him,'' lamented William D.
Granfield, an Independent from Manchester, who said he will not
vote for Gore because of his ties to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Granfield said, he's leaning toward McCain. But
he added that he knows very little about Bradley, and might yet
find him a possible alternative. ``I'm leaning toward the
Republican primary, and McCain,'' he said. ``But it's a long time
until Feb. 1, and I could change my mind.''

`DEVIL' IS A MILD RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ang Lee's masterful earnestness can reduce even a wild hare of a
novel like ``The Ice Storm'' into a droll, and eventually mild,
comedy of manners. ``Ride With the Devil,'' about young men drawn
into the Civil War, is a peculiar movie, with components
reminiscent of other weird westerns. It has the bland stateliness
of old western TV series such as ``The Virginian,'' which tried to
bring an epic sensibility to the small screen. It's also similar to
early '70s attempts to recast the western after years of
sure-footed white-man imperialism on the plains, pictures such as
``Bad Company'' and ``The Culpepper Cattle Company.''
</P>
<P>
   As in those films, much of the action takes place on the
margins, with small, intense battles rather than bigger ones.
Although those do come eventually in this movie that feels like
it's the length of the Civil War, or at least that multihour Ken
Burns documentary on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and screenwriter James Schamus try to bring a
larger-than-life feel to confusion and the need of young men to
find action. Tobey Maguire is the son of a German immigrant, who's
looked down upon. He falls in with the rebellious scion of a rich
family (Skeet Ulrich), and they begin a swing as ``bushwhackers''
in the service of the South. They're joined by a former slave
(Jeffrey Wright), who sides with them because a former owner freed
him. Lee's attempt at a unique perspective is honorable. ``Ride''
is full of the elements that could make for a potentially
fascinating big-screen depiction of a war that people generally
have no trouble sorting their feelings about.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's interest in class and its subtle distinctions _ seen in
his earlier films such as ``Storm'' and his sly comedy ``Eat Drink
Man Woman'' as well as ``Sense and Sensibility'' _ are in full view
in ``Devil.'' It's just that his stars, with the exception of
Wright's fluky honesty and a not-bad performance by Jewel as a
widow who's looking for a different kind of action _ aren't quite
up to the task. (Jewel brings to mind a whole tradition of singing
stars slipping into movies via westerns, lining her up alongside
Ricky Nelson.) Lee's staging of action is perfectly fine. But his
purview robs the film of urgency, which is the last thing a movie
out to dramatize confusion needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil'' is rated R for violence, adult language
and situations.

DEALING WITH THE DEMISE OF SANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Dec. 23)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Golden Book encyclopedia was spread open on the floor of my
son's bedroom. I picked it up and smiled as I read the entry about
Santa, the ``spirit'' of Yuletide. I carried the volume downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading up on Christmas, huh?'' I asked my 8-year-old as he
built a Lego scape.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you ... oh, I left it open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out anything interesting about Santa?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Adam, I know that you know,'' I told him. ``I looked
it up in the Golden Book encyclopedia, too, when I was just about
your age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known since you told me about the Tooth Fairy,'' he said
indignantly. ``They're all kind of the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he asked The Question.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I believe in the SPIRIT of Santa, do I still get
presents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. Especially since you have a little sister,'' I said.
``You keep Santa alive for her, he'll still deliver to you, too.
Deal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Santa. I remember the almost physical pang of
finding out as a child that magic and reality didn't really
coexist, after all. Reality won out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did I wholeheartedly embrace Santa, the Easter Bunny
and the Tooth Fairy, I kept trying to find the right top hat to put
on my snowmen to make them dance and sing.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on my grandmother. Each summer of my childhood, she
convinced me that an elf lived in the top drawer of her dresser.
Every time we went on a trip, the drawer was empty, but when we'd
come back, a small gift for me was always tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you ever notice that she would always say she had
forgotten her purse, or left a light on, and had to go back inside
for a minute?'' my mother asked me years later, when I was trying
to figure out the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I was a sucker. But when I had kids, I was all for trying
to give them that same sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I know there's a group of dissenters out there who think the
whole Santa thing goes too far and is a cruel deception, teaching
children only that parents tell tales and can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm firmly in the New York Sun's camp on this one: ``Santa
exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist. ...
Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus!''
</P>
<P>
   On the night Adam asked about the Tooth Fairy, he wanted a
straight answer. So his dad and I sat on the bed and gave him one.
He bravely shrugged it off. But not before Jim and I watched his
face fall before his cavalier recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He did, in that painful moment, realize all.
</P>
<P>
   So is it worth it? Setting your children up for disillusion and

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DETROIT _ Caryn Mathes and her attorney husband hit the Internet
months ago in search of a hot spot for welcoming the millennium.
The general manager of Detroit's public radio station found a
flight, room, and rate for Venezuela's Margarita Island online, but
fortunately she doubled-checked the fare with a travel agent before
buying. Total savings: US$3,400.
 &HT;    Affordable transport and lodging are always difficult to find
during the holiday season. And this year, with all the hullabaloo
about the year 2000, prices started to rise hard, fast and early
for what promised to be a once-in-a-lifetime bash. However, travel
operators who expected Latin America to pop the millennium cork
with a bigger-than-normal bang say the fizz has gone out of their
bubbly.
 &HT;    As they do each year end, expedition cruise vessels will ply the
Galapagos; New Age travelers will scramble around Machu Picchu;
Cancun will host an onslaught of revelers; and Rio de Janeiro will
burst with merrymakers simultaneously celebrating New Year's and
the festival of Lemanja, goddess of the sea. But the region won't
cash in big-time from millennium fever.
 &HT;    ``This millennium was a big, big hype,'' says Joel Marchal,
owner of Global Connections, a Canadian travel agency specializing
in Latin America. ``It was blown out of proportion.''
 &HT;    Marchal and travel operators in the region say airlines and
hotels that hiked prices almost tenfold in some cases early in the
year are starting to offer discounts in an 11th-hour bid to profit
from 2000 fever. But travelers just aren't biting.
 &HT;    ``There isn't one spot in the region that stands out as a
millennium destination like Paris, New York, Las Vegas or
Australia,'' explains Maria Teresa Torruella, international public
relations manager at Marriott International, as she recites the
laundry list of ``hot'' Dec. 31 destinations. ``Individually, our
hotels are putting together New Year's Eve activities, but this is
a time of year when the properties normally sell out anyway.''
 &HT;    Torruella predicts Marriott's two dozen hotels in Latin America
and the Caribbean will teem with expatriates returning home for the
holidays, North Americans and Europeans seeking warm weather and
local residents bound for hotel parties. But she describes that as
year-end ``business as usual.'' Marchal says hotels in Buenos Aires
and Santiago have done little millennium marketing.
 &HT;    At the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino in Puerto
Rico, General Manager Horst E. Sicher is gearing up for as many as
2,000 party lovers at a gala featuring six bands and fireworks over
the hotel's beach. While nearly double last year's attendance,
Horst says the popularity of the $250-per-person bash is more
thanks to the success of the prior year's party than on millennium
fever.
 &HT;    ``I think there's going to be a lot of hoopla and people are
probably going to spend a little more this year, but the crowd will
be big simply because in Puerto Rico the people like to go out,''
he adds.
 &HT;    Latin Americans appear no more likely to embark on millennium
trips than their stateside counterparts, who are opting by a wide
margin to stick close to home. A U.S. survey conducted for Travel
Weekly, a trade magazine, found more than 80 percent of those
polled definitely would not travel to mark the new millennium.
Travel Weekly Editor-in-Chief Nadine Godwin says the July telephone
survey involved 405 people whose average family income was $79,000
a year, making them more-likely candidates for travel than the
population at large.
 &HT;    ``My unscientific sense is that this is not wildly different
from any other New Year,'' says Godwin. ``Only 8 percent of those
surveyed had firm plans. Another 9 percent are exploring the
possibility. The rest simply aren't going anywhere.''
 &HT;    Mathes initially balked at a Margarita Island trip when she
discovered the DetroitCaracas airfare alone would exceed $1,000. A
travel agent eventually found the Michigan couple a week-long,
hotelair package for $1,700 per person, less than half the original
price. But Venezuela is earning a reputation for stratospheric
prices at year's end.
 &HT;    Canadian travel agency owner Marchal says Canaima Camp at
Venezuela's Angel Falls is guilty of ``gouging'' with its year-end
rates. ``When I usually arrange the three-day, two-night package
with airfare from Caracas, it's about $400,'' Marchal says. ``When
we asked for the New Year's price, it was $5,000 per person.''
 &HT;    A whopping $14,265 per-couple millennium hotel package in
Caracas had no takers by late September. The four-night
presidential suite deal at the Gran Melia Caracas Hotel Suites and
Conference Center promises intensive pampering, including Dom
Perignon champagne, an open bar and wine cellar, gourmet dinners,
chauffeurs, massages and facials at a spa, a national park tour and
an invitation to a New Year's Eve gala featuring musicians from
Cuba.
 &HT;    ``Some people in this country and other Latin American countries
are concerned about the Y2K problem and don't want their executives
to go abroad,'' says Simone Lara, director of sales and marketing
at the Gran Melia Caracas. ``There may be some heads of state or
presidents of companies who might be interested in a really good
millennium celebration like this.''
 &HT;    The Gran Melia Caracas' 10 Royal Suites, offering a more
economical array of extras than the presidential suite deal plus a
ticket to the hotel's $250-per-person New Year's party, by early
September had lured only four couples willing to shell out $4,400
for the four-night package. The 432-room hotel was only 50 percent
booked three months before Christmas.
 &HT;    A spokeswoman at Lima Tours in Peru says hotel rates in that
country are running about a third higher for Dec. 23 to Jan. 5.
When the American Society of Travel Agents, an international
organization that includes Latin American travel agents, queried
its members, most reported end-of-year package and tour prices up
an average 30 percent.
 &HT;    ``We've found that the airlines were asking for too much deposit
_ $250 a seat, non-refundable. Normally they ask between $40 and
$100 and it's refundable until 60 days before travel,'' says Sarah
Erskine, manager of MILA Tours, a suburban-Chicago-based operator
specializing in Latin American destinations for nearly two decades.
``The hotels didn't necessarily hike prices, but they wanted
prepayment three months in advance. Normally, they require about 30
days.''
 &HT;    Most tour operators complain that airlines _ especially U.S.
carriers _ dramatically inflated fares, claiming the most
economical seats were not available. Because of the volatility of
pricing, some travel agents are encouraging their clients to skip
New Year's and plan Year 2000 trips weeks or months later. Others
predict panicky price slashing will surface in the weeks before
Christmas.
 &HT;    Latin America may take a back seat to the South Pacific, where
revelers at the International Dateline will be the first to hail
the new millennium, but the region will still see a good party.
Although tour operators say Costa Rica and Belize have sold out for
the year-end bash, in part because they have restricted numbers of
hotel rooms, Brazil is emerging as party central.
 &HT;    Cariocas will flood Copacabana Beach to make candlelight
offerings to sea goddess Lemanja as New Year's fireworks explode
over the bay. The party is expected to lure three million
merrymakers, including many who have shelled out $460 a piece to
samba at the Hotel Inter-Continental Rio fete atop Pao de Acucar
(Sugarloaf Mountain).
 &HT;    In the Galapagos, meanwhile, New Year's cruise packages were
snatched up as soon as they were announced earlier this year.
``They sold out quickly,'' explains David Moore, director of sales
at Dallas-based Adventure Associates, the North American office for
Ecuador's Metropolitan Touring. Metropolitan's 90-passenger MV
Santa Cruz and 40-passenger yacht Isabela II will interrupt their
normal expedition itinerary to anchor at Latitude 0 and pop open
the champagne as the calendar flips to 2000.
 &HT;    Luxury cruises are emerging as one of the most popular ways to
celebrate the millennium, despite prices running two to four times
higher than usual, but Latin American itineraries are not figuring
prominently. The only Princess Cruises' millennium ship with berths
still available was the one slated to ply the coast of South
America. The Royal Princess, sailing from Buenos Aires Dec. 19,
offers a New Year's party at sea during its 16-day cruise to
Santiago. Santiago, meanwhile, is the departure point for Norwegian
Cruise Line's Norwegian Crown, which plans a 14-day millennium
sailing through the Chilean fjords and onto Buenos Aires.
Passengers aboard Crystal Cruises' Crystal Harmony, en route from
Buenos Aires to Barbados, will dock Dec. 31 in Rio to watch the
fireworks.
 &HT;    In Peru, Cuzco and Machu Picchu are hoisting the party banner.
Revelers are expected to flood the ruins at Machu Picchu and
Sacsayhuaman, which will be illuminated New Year's Eve. Operators
reported Cuzco hotels booked to capacity _ despite price hikes.
 &HT;    At Lima Tours in the Peruvian capital, Luli Gamarra de Noriega
says limited lodging and transportation to the former center of the
Inca empire will hold down some of the crush at Cuzco. She notes
that the highland city and Machu Picchu hold most appeal for people
who believe in mysticism _ and who are willing to pay for it.
 &HT;    ``It's going to cost more,'' says Gamarra de Noriega, image and
communications chief at Lima Tours. Maupintour, a Kansas-based
travel operator with a strong presence in Latin America, is
charging $4,845 per person for a nine-day MiamiMachu Picchu
package.
 &HT;    In Mexico, officials say there will be festivities in Mexico
City and at Mayan and Aztec ruins, although the tourist board has
no coordinated millennium promotions as yet. Beach destinations,
including Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco, are expected to
burst with parties. U.S. travel operators say their clients are
shelling out hundreds of dollars more than normal for air fare and
hotel rooms to join the celebrations.
 &HT;    Some Latin American hoteliers say low-level concern over the Y2K
bug may be keeping some folks from planning elaborate trips in the
region. ``When I tell people we're going to Margarita, they gasp
and say `What about the millennium computer crash?''' Mathes notes.
``But I figure, if the computers go down and we're stranded, what
better place to be than on a beach in Venezuela?''

Cruise Line's Norwegian Crown, which plans a 14-day millennium
sailing through the Chilean fjords and onto Buenos Aires.
Passengers aboard Crystal Cruises' Crystal Harmony, en route from
Buenos Aires to Barbados, will dock Dec. 31 in Rio to watch the
fireworks.
 &HT;    In Peru, Cuzco and Machu Picchu are hoisting the party banner.
Revelers are expected to flood the ruins at Machu Picchu and
Sacsayhuaman, which will be illuminated New Year's Eve. Operators
reported Cuzco hotels booked to capacity _ despite price hikes.
 &HT;    At Lima Tours in the Peruvian capital, Luli Gamarra de Noriega
says limited lodging and transportation to the former center of the
Inca empire will hold down some of the crush at Cuzco. She notes
that the highland city and Machu Picchu hold most appeal for people
who believe in mysticism _ and who are willing to pay for it.
 &HT;    ``It's going to cost more,'' says Gamarra de Noriega, image and
communications chief at Lima Tours. Maupintour, a Kansas-based
travel operator with a strong presence in Latin America, is
charging $4,845 per person for a nine-day MiamiMachu Picchu
package.
 &HT;    In Mexico, officials say there will be festivities in Mexico
City and at Mayan and Aztec ruins, although the tourist board has
no coordinated millennium promotions as yet. Beach destinations,
including Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and Acapulco, are expected to
burst with parties. U.S. travel operators say their clients are
shelling out hundreds of dollars more than normal for air fare and
hotel rooms to join the celebrations.
 &HT;    Some Latin American hoteliers say low-level concern over the Y2K
bug may be keeping some folks from planning elaborate trips in the
region. ``When I tell people we're going to Margarita, they gasp
and say `What about the millennium computer crash?''' Mathes notes.
``But I figure, if the computers go down and we're stranded, what
better place to be than on a beach in Venezuela?''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DETROIT _ Caryn Mathes and her attorney husband hit the Internet
months ago in search of a hot spot for welcoming the millennium.
The general manager of Detroit's public radio station found a
flight, room, and rate for Venezuela's Margarita Island online, but
fortunately she doubled-checked the fare with a travel agent before
buying. Total savings: US$3,400.
 &HT;    Affordable transport and lodging are always difficult to find
during the holiday season. And this year, with all the hullabaloo
about the year 2000, prices started to rise hard, fast and early
for what promised to be a once-in-a-lifetime bash. However, travel
operators who expected Latin America to pop the millennium cork
with a bigger-than-normal bang say the fizz has gone out of their
bubbly.
 &HT;    As they do each year end, expedition cruise vessels will ply the
Galapagos; New Age travelers will scramble around Machu Picchu;
Cancun will host an onslaught of revelers; and Rio de Janeiro will
burst with merrymakers simultaneously celebrating New Year's and
the festival of Lemanja, goddess of the sea. But the region won't
cash in big-time from millennium fever.
 &HT;    ``This millennium was a big, big hype,'' says Joel Marchal,
owner of Global Connections, a Canadian travel agency specializing
in Latin America. ``It was blown out of proportion.''
 &HT;    Marchal and travel operators in the region say airlines and
hotels that hiked prices almost tenfold in some cases early in the
year are starting to offer discounts in an 11th-hour bid to profit
from 2000 fever. But travelers just aren't biting.
 &HT;    ``There isn't one spot in the region that stands out as a
millennium destination like Paris, New York, Las Vegas or
Australia,'' explains Maria Teresa Torruella, international public
relations manager at Marriott International, as she recites the
laundry list of ``hot'' Dec. 31 destinations. ``Individually, our
hotels are putting together New Year's Eve activities, but this is
a time of year when the properties normally sell out anyway.''
 &HT;    Torruella predicts Marriott's two dozen hotels in Latin America
and the Caribbean will teem with expatriates returning home for the
holidays, North Americans and Europeans seeking warm weather and
local residents bound for hotel parties. But she describes that as
year-end ``business as usual.'' Marchal says hotels in Buenos Aires
and Santiago have done little millennium marketing.
 &HT;    At the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino in Puerto
Rico, General Manager Horst E. Sicher is gearing up for as many as
2,000 party lovers at a gala featuring six bands and fireworks over
the hotel's beach. While nearly double last year's attendance,
Horst says the popularity of the $250-per-person bash is more
thanks to the success of the prior year's party than on millennium
fever.
 &HT;    ``I think there's going to be a lot of hoopla and people are
probably going to spend a little more this year, but the crowd will
be big simply because in Puerto Rico the people like to go out,''
he adds.
 &HT;    Latin Americans appear no more likely to embark on millennium
trips than their stateside counterparts, who are opting by a wide
margin to stick close to home. A U.S. survey conducted for Travel
Weekly, a trade magazine, found more than 80 percent of those
polled definitely would not travel to mark the new millennium.
Travel Weekly Editor-in-Chief Nadine Godwin says the July telephone
survey involved 405 people whose average family income was $79,000
a year, making them more-likely candidates for travel than the
population at large.
 &HT;    ``My unscientific sense is that this is not wildly different
from any other New Year,'' says Godwin. ``Only 8 percent of those
surveyed had firm plans. Another 9 percent are exploring the
possibility. The rest simply aren't going anywhere.''
 &HT;    Mathes initially balked at a Margarita Island trip when she
discovered the DetroitCaracas airfare alone would exceed $1,000. A
travel agent eventually found the Michigan couple a week-long,
hotelair package for $1,700 per person, less than half the original
price. But Venezuela is earning a reputation for stratospheric
prices at year's end.
 &HT;    Canadian travel agency owner Marchal says Canaima Camp at
Venezuela's Angel Falls is guilty of ``gouging'' with its year-end
rates. ``When I usually arrange the three-day, two-night package
with airfare from Caracas, it's about $400,'' Marchal says. ``When
we asked for the New Year's price, it was $5,000 per person.''
 &HT;    A whopping $14,265 per-couple millennium hotel package in
Caracas had no takers by late September. The four-night
presidential suite deal at the Gran Melia Caracas Hotel Suites and
Conference Center promises intensive pampering, including Dom
Perignon champagne, an open bar and wine cellar, gourmet dinners,
chauffeurs, massages and facials at a spa, a national park tour and
an invitation to a New Year's Eve gala featuring musicians from
Cuba.
 &HT;    ``Some people in this country and other Latin American countries
are concerned about the Y2K problem and don't want their executives
to go abroad,'' says Simone Lara, director of sales and marketing
at the Gran Melia Caracas. ``There may be some heads of state or
presidents of companies who might be interested in a really good
millennium celebration like this.''
 &HT;    The Gran Melia Caracas' 10 Royal Suites, offering a more
economical array of extras than the presidential suite deal plus a
ticket to the hotel's $250-per-person New Year's party, by early
September had lured only four couples willing to shell out $4,400
for the four-night package. The 432-room hotel was only 50 percent
booked three months before Christmas.
 &HT;    A spokeswoman at Lima Tours in Peru says hotel rates in that
country are running about a third higher for Dec. 23 to Jan. 5.
When the American Society of Travel Agents, an international
organization that includes Latin American travel agents, queried
its members, most reported end-of-year package and tour prices up
an average 30 percent.
 &HT;    ``We've found that the airlines were asking for too much deposit
_ $250 a seat, non-refundable. Normally they ask between $40 and
$100 and it's refundable until 60 days before travel,'' says Sarah
Erskine, manager of MILA Tours, a suburban-Chicago-based operator
specializing in Latin American destinations for nearly two decades.
``The hotels didn't necessarily hike prices, but they wanted
prepayment three months in advance. Normally, they require about 30
days.''
 &HT;    Most tour operators complain that airlines _ especially U.S.
carriers _ dramatically inflated fares, claiming the most
economical seats were not available. Because of the volatility of
pricing, some travel agents are encouraging their clients to skip
New Year's and plan Year 2000 trips weeks or months later. Others
predict panicky price slashing will surface in the weeks before
Christmas.
 &HT;    Latin America may take a back seat to the South Pacific, where
revelers at the International Dateline will be the first to he new millennium, but the region will still see a good party.
Although tour operators say Costa Rica and Belize have sold out for
the year-end bash, in part because they have restricted numbers of
hotel rooms, Brazil is emerging as party central.
 &HT;    Cariocas will flood Copacabana Beach to make candlelight
offerings to sea goddess Lemanja as New Year's fireworks explode
over the bay. The party is expected to lure three million
merrymakers, including many who have shelled out $460 a piece to
samba at the Hotel Inter-Continental Rio fete atop Pao de Acucar
(Sugarloaf Mountain).
 &HT;    In the Galapagos, meanwhile, New Year's cruise packages were
snatched up as soon as they were announced earlier this year.
``They sold out quickly,'' explains David Moore, director of sales
at Dallas-based Adventure Associates, the North American office for
Ecuador's Metropolitan Touring. Metropolitan's 90-passenger MV
Santa Cruz and 40-passenger yacht Isabela II will interrupt their
normal expedition itinerary to anchor at Latitude 0 and pop open
the champagne as the calendar flips to 2000.
 &HT;    Luxury cruises are emerging as one of the most popular ways to
celebrate the millennium, despite prices running two to four times
higher than usual, but Latin American itineraries are not figuring
prominently. The only Princess Cruises' millennium ship with berths
still available was the one slated to ply the coast of South
America. The Royal Princess, sailing from Buenos Aires Dec. 19,
offers a New Year's party at sea during its 16-day cruise to
Santiago. Santiago, meanwhile, is the departure point for Norwegian
Cruise Line's Norwegian Crown, which plans a 14-day millennium
sailing through the Chilean fjords and onto Buenos Aires.
Passengers aboard Crystal Cruises' Crystal Harmony, en route from
Buenos Aires to Barbados, will dock Dec. 31 in Rio to watch the
fireworks.
 &HT;    In Peru, Cuzco and Machu Picchu are hoisting the party banner.
Revelers are expected to flood the ruins at Machu Picchu and
Sacsayhuaman, which will be illuminated New Year's Eve. Operators
reported Cuzco hotels booked to capacity _ despite price hikes.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Leigh, the dazzling impresario of electrical
splendor who festooned Broadway with miles of electrical signs, a
gargantuan steaming coffee pot and the celebrated giant Camel sign
that puffed real smoke, died Tuesday in a Manhattan hospital. He
was 92 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was also the man who lit up the city's Manhattan's
skyscrapers, beginning with the Empire State Building in 1976, and
who made the city's fountains flow red, white and blue for that
year's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, an Alabama native, hit town at 28 in a second-hand Ford
with $9 in his pocket and parlayed a soft-spoken sales ability and
a flair for the fabulous into the multi-million-dollar business of
designing and erecting breathtaking signs. The A&AMP;P coffee cup, 25
feet-high and steaming, was his. So was the Old Gold sign with its
4,100 bulbs. The Bromo-seltzer sign with actual effervescent
action? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh gave the Great White Way its legendary Camel smoke ring
sign, which ran for 26 years and expanded to 22 additional cities.
He created the Super Suds detergent sign with 3,000 large
``floating'' soap bubbles per minute. The 120-foot Pepsi Cola
waterfall was indisputably his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an idea man, a concept guy,'' he said last year, still
very much on the job at Donald Trump's building at 40 Wall Stt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Empire State Building, Leigh splashed
dazzling lights at the summits of other skyscrapers, including
Citicorp, the Helmsley and Crown Buildings and the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel. Leigh became as dominant in the new business of lighting
buildings as he had been in designing spectacular signs.
</P>
<P>
   His life was an exuberant exercise in creative
attention-getting. He owned and operated blimps on both the East
and West Coasts to advertise Wonder Bread, Mobil Oil and other
products. In the 1960s, he owned 1 Times Square, the building where
the New Year's Eve ball is dropped. He stripped off the marble and
envisioned the building as what it has now emphatically become, a
showcase for signage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he served as official decorator for the Democratic
convention, causing Manhattan's fountains to flow in red, white and
blue, among other effects. In 1984, he installed a 2 1/2-story
snowflake with 3,000 lights above Fifth Avenue at 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   His work extended beyond New York, and in 1987, he was hired by
Cincinnati to develop a master plan for lighting that city. He also
dealt with such seemingly prosaic, but surely profitable jobs as
for years handling the advertising on New York City buses.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was the spiritual pioneer of today's Times Square, where
giant neon displays are required on new buildings. It was he who
bridged the gap from the Broadway of the 1880s, an industrial area
of blacksmiths and carriage factories, and the 1930s when signs
became considerably more than mere add-ons to existing buildings.
</P>
<P>
   By 1936, City Bank Farmers Trust Co. built a two-story building
with a sign that more than doubled the height of the structure. The
huge sign, the work of designer and artist Dorothy Shepard,
featured a fish blowing bubbles advertising Wrigley's Spearmint
gum. The nightclub in the building lasted only a few years, and in
1940 Bond Clothes took over much of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Leigh persuaded Bond to put up a $350,000
montage rising 90 feet above the entire length of the store on
Broadway from 44th to 45th Street. At the base of the Bond sign was
an electric news zipper, about five feet high, running along the
entire facade. In Leigh's design, twin 50-foot-high figures, one
male and one female, flanked a central waterfall 27 feet high and
120 feet long. Strands of electric lights seems to clothe the
chunky classical figures at night, but by day they appeared nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had yet equaled the colossal exhortations of Douglas
Leigh's 1948 Bond clothing sign,'' Christopher Gray wrote in the
Times in 1997. ``It lasted only six years, but some fragments still
peep out from under the latest advertisements.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was born in Anniston, Ala., and began selling things as a
youth. He graduated from the University of Florida where he bought
the entire advertising space in the year book for $2,000, on
credit. He then sold the same space for $7,000, making a profit of
$5,000. He immediately dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in New York in the early 1930s, and in 1933 scored
his first success. He secured the right to put up a sign at the
intersection of Fordham Road and Crotona Avenue in the Bronx. He
then persuaded the St. Moritz Hotel to put up a billboard there. He
got $50 a month, enough to eat at the Automat, as well as
stationery with the hotel's prestigious central Park South address.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1933, he came up with the idea for the steaming coffee
cup, 15 feet wide, at the southeast corner of 47th Street and
Seventh Avenue. He began to create a comfortable niche. Within a
few years he had thrown switches in Times Square to illuminate a
blinking penguin for Kool cigarettes, a clown tossing quoits in the
shape of the Ballantine ale logo, and an animated cartoon for Old
Gold cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1941, E.J. Kahn Jr. profiled him in The New Yorker and
said he had been responsible in the preceding seven years for 32
large signs with more than 75 bulbs. ``If New York is ever
thoroughly blacked out,'' Kahn said in reference to the war in
Europe, ``no man will take it harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, wartime blackouts began, but they only stimulated
Leigh's imagination. He did not need lights to develop the Camel
billboard at the southeast corner of 44th Street and Broadway,
which puffed out 5-foot-wide rings of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was a smallish, soft-spoken sort who said, ``yes, sir''
and ``no, sir'' to business executives and laborers alike. The New
Yorker described him as a ``Princeton freshman.'' He dressed in
tweeds and bow ties and wore a fresh boutonniere of cornflowers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Elsie; two daughters, Lucinda Leigh
of Phoenix, and Heidi Duke of San Diego; four stepchildren, Amanda
Borghese of Short Hills, N.J.; Pidgie Chapman of Pinehurst, N.C.;
Prudence Blair of Summit, N.J.; and Winthrop Lewis of Singapore,
and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His visions were legendary. In 1944, he told The New York Times
that he foresaw a postwar Times Square full of three-dimensional
signs in softer colors; a colossal, translucent glass of orange
juice and a huge bottle of perfume with scent puffed out on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   He saw wind machines blowing trees and flags, searchlights
playing on blimps, artificial snow and fog; the smells of coffee,
cocoa and beer, even live giraffes and other animals. Times Square
would be a spectacular performance event in the service of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   He also thought the Empire State building would make a dandy
glowing cigarette for Lucky Strike.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    DETROIT _ Caryn Mathes y su esposo, que es abogado, entraron en
la Internet hace meses en busca de un lugar atractivo para esperar
el nuevo milenio. La gerente general de la estacion de radio
publica de Detroit encontro en linea un vuelo, una habitacion y una
tarifa para la isla Margarita, en Venezuela, pero por suerte
verifico el costo del pasaje con un agente de viajes antes de
comprar. En total se ahorro US$3.400.
 &HT;    Siempre es dificil encontrar transporte y alojamiento asequible
en epoca de fiestas. Y este ano, con todo el alboroto por el 2000,
los precios aumentaron con rapidez ante lo que prometia ser una
fiesta que solo se da una vez en la vida. Sin embargo, los
operadores de viajes que esperaban que America Latina celebrara la
llegada del milenio con mas bullicio que nunca, dicen que el
entusiasmo esta muy por debajo de lo que esperaban.
 &HT;    Como cada fin de ano, habra expediciones en barco a las
Galapagos; los creyentes de la Nueva Era subiran a Machu Picchu y
Rio de Janeiro trepidara al ritmo de las celebraciones simultaneas
de Ano Nuevo y de Lemanja, la diosa del mar. Pero la region no le
sacara la esperada fortuna a la fiebre del milenio.
 &HT;    ``Hubo mucha exageracion con este milenio,'' afirma Joel
Marchal, propietario de Global Connections, una agencia de viajes
canadiense que se especializa en America Latina.
 &HT;    Marchal y los operadores de viajes de la region dicen que las
aerolineas y los hoteles que aumentaron los precios casi diez veces
en algunos casos a principios de 1999, ya estan ofreciendo
descuentos de ultima hora para no perder todas las ganancias que
esperaban con el 2000. Pero los viajeros no pican la carnada.
 &HT;    ``No hay un solo lugar en toda la region que se destaque como un
sitio para esperar el milenio, como Paris, Nueva York, Las Vegas o
Australia,'' explica Maria Teresa Torruella, gerente de relaciones
publicas internacionales de Marriott International.
``Individualmente, nuestros hoteles preparan actividades para la
vispera de Ano Nuevo, pero esta es una epoca del ano en que
normalmente se llenan de todas formas.''
 &HT;    Torruella pronostica que las dos docenas de hoteles Marriott en
America Latina y el Caribe se llenaran de latinoamericanos que
regresan a casa para pasar la fecha, norteamericanos y europeos en
busca de un clima calido, y gente del lugar que acudiran a las
fiestas en los hoteles. Pero dice que este fin de ano no diferira
de otros. Marchal indica que los hoteles de Buenos Aires y Santiago
han hecho poca propaganda sobre el milenio.
 &HT;    En el San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino en Puerto
Rico, el gerente general Horst E. Sicher se dispone a recibir a
2.000 festejantes en una gala con seis bandas musicales y fuegos
artificiales sobre la playa del hotel. Aunque la asistencia sera
casi el doble de la del ano pasado, Horst dice que la popularidad
de la fiesta, a US$250 por persona, se debe mas al exito de la
celebracion del ano pasado que a la fiebre del 2000.
 &HT;    ``Creo que la gente probablemente gaste un poco mas este ano,
pero la multitud sera mas numerosa simplemente porque en Puerto
Rico a la gente le gusta salir,'' agrega.
 &HT;    Al parecer, los latinoamericanos no van a viajar mas para
esperar el milenio que los norteamericanos, que por amplio margen
deciden quedarse cerca de casa. Una encuesta realizada en Estados
Unidos por la revista Travel Weekly determino que mas del 80 por
ciento de los entrevistados no viajaran para celebrar el nuevo
milenio. Nadine Godwin, jefa de redaccion de la revista, dice que
en la encuesta telefonica hecha en julio participaron 405 personas
con un ingreso familiar promedio de US$79.000 anuales, nivel que
les facilita viajar mas que a la poblacion general.
 &HT;    ``Mi percepcion no cientifica me dice que este Ano Nuevo no sera
muy distinto a los demas,'' comenta Godwin. ``Solo el 8 por ciento
de los encuestados tenian planes en firme. Otro 9 por ciento
explora las posibilidades. El resto no va a ir a ninguna parte.''
 &HT;    Mathes puso el grito en el cielo cuando descubrio que para ir a
la isla Margarita, solo el viaje en avion de Detroit a Caracas
costaba mas de US$1.000. Al final un agente de viajes le encontro a
la pareja de Michigan un paquete de una semana, con hotel y vuelo,
por US$1.700 por persona, menos de la mitad del precio original.
Pero Venezuela esta ganando fama de poner los precios por las nubes
a fin de ano.
 &HT;    Marchal, el dueno de una agencia de viajes en Canada, dice que
en Canaima, un centro turistico del Salto del Angel, en Venezuela,
le saquean el bolsillo al publico con sus tarifas de fin de ano.
``El paquete normal de tres dias y dos noches, con vuelo desde
Caracas, cuesta unos US$400,'' dice Marchal. ``Cuando pedimos el
precio de Ano Nuevo, era de US$5.000 por persona.''
 &HT;    A fines de septiembre, nadie habia adquirido un costoso paquete
de hotel para esperar el milenio en Caracas, a un costo de
US$14.265 por pareja. El paquete, con alojamiento de cuatro noches
en la suite presidencial del hotel Gran Melia Caracas, promete una
gran dosis de atencion, con champan Dom Perignon, bar, bodega de
vinos, cenas de gourmet, choferes, masajes y faciales, una gira por
un parque nacional y una invitacion a una gala de vispera de Ano
Nuevo con musicos de Cuba.
 &HT;    ``En este pais y en otros paises latinoamericanos hay personas
preocupadas con el problema informatico del 2000 y no quieren que
sus ejecutivos vayan al extranjero,'' senala Simone Lara, directora
de ventas y mercadeo en el Gran Melia Caracas.
 &HT;    Las 10 suites reales del Gran Melia Caracas, que ofrecen una
serie de extras mas economica que el paquete de la suite
presidencial, mas un boleto a la fiesta de Ano Nuevo del hotel, que
cuesta US$250 por persona, a principios de septiembre solo habian
atraido a cuatro parejas dispuestas a pagar US$4.400 por el paquete
de cuatro noches. De las 432 habitaciones del hotel, solo el 50 por
ciento estaban reservadas tres meses antes de Navidad.
 &HT;    Un portavoz de Lima Tours en Peru dice que las tarifas de hotel
en ese pais estan un tercio mas altas para el 23 de diciembre que
para el 5 de enero. La mayoria de los miembros latinoamericanos de
la Sociedad Americana de Agentes de Viajes informo que los precios
de las giras y de los paquetes de fin de ano habian subido como
promedio el 30 por ciento.
 &HT;    ``Hemos encontrado que las aerolineas pedian un deposito
demasiado alto: US$250 por asiento, sin devolucion. Habitualmente
piden entre US$40 y US$100 y es reembolsable hasta 60 dias antes de
viajar,'' senala Sarah Erskine, gerente de MILA Tours, operador de
Chicago que tiene casi dos decadas de experiencia en destinos
latinoamericanos. ``Los hoteles no necesariamente aumentan los
precios, pero quieren un pago inicial con tres meses de adelanto.
Normalmente piden unos 30 dias.''
 &HT;    La mayoria de los operadores de turismo se quejan de que las
aerolineas, sobre todo las norteamericanas, inflaron
espectacularmente los pasajes al afirmar que los asientos mas
economicos estaban reservados. Debido a la volatilidad de los
precios, algunos agentes de viajes exhortan a sus clientes a evitar
el Ano Nuevo y planean viajes en celebracion del 2000 semanas o
meses despues de la llegada del milenio. Otros pronostican que en
las semanas anteriores a las Navidades habra enormes reducciones de
precios.
 &HT;    America Latina esta a la zaga del Pacifico Sur, donde los que
festejen en la Linea Internacional de la Fecha seran los primeros
en dar la bienvenida al nuevo milenio, pero la region tambien
tendra una gran fiesta. Los operadores de turismo dicen que Costa
Rica y Belice ya no tienen reservaciones para fin de ano, en parte
porque cuentan con relativamente pocas habitaciones de hotel, por
lo que Brasil se ha convertido en la sede de la fiesta.
 &HT;    Los cariocas invadiran la plCopacabana para hacer
ofrendas a la diosa Lemanja mientras los fuegos artificiales
estallan sobre la bahia. Se espera que la fiesta atraiga a tres
millones de personas. Muchos han pagado US$460 por persona para
bailar samba en la fiesta del Hotel Inter-Continental Rio en la
cima del Pan de Azucar.
 &HT;    Entretanto, en las Galapagos, los paquetes de viaje desde Nueva
York se reservaron en cuanto se anunciaron a principios de ano.
``Se vendieron como pan caliente,'' dice David Moore, director de
ventas de Adventure Associates, de Dallas, la oficina
norteamericana de Metropolitan Touring, de Ecuador. El barco Santa
Cruz, de 90 pasajeros, y el yate Isabela II, de 40, ambos de
Metropolitan, interrumpiran su itinerario habitual para anclar en
la latitud cero y celebrar con champan la llegada del 2000.
 &HT;    Los cruceros de lujo se han convertido en una de las formas mas
populares de celebrar el milenio, a pesar de que los precios son de
dos a cuatro veces mas altos que los habituales, pero las rutas
latinoamericanas no estan entre las mas buscadas. El unico barco de
Princess Cruises con plazas vacantes es el que recorrera la costa
de Sudamerica. El Royal Princess, que sale de Buenos Aires el 19 de
diciembre, da una fiesta de Ano Nuevo en el mar, durante su viaje
de 16 dias a Santiago. La capital chilena es el punto de partida
del Norwegian Crown, de Norwegian Cruise Line, que planea un viaje
de 14 dias por los fiordos chilenos y luego hacia Buenos Aires. El
Crystal Harmony, de Crystal Cruises, en ruta de Buenos Aires a
Barbados, tocara tierra el 31 de diciembre en Rio para ver los
fuegos artificiales.
 &HT;    En Peru, Cuzco y Machu Picchu se preparan para la fiesta. Se
espera una invasion de turistas en las ruinas de Machu Picchu y
Sacsahuaman, que estaran iluminadas la vispera de Ano Nuevo. Los
operadores informan que los hoteles de Cuzco ya estan totalmente
reservados a pesar del alto precio.
 &HT;    En Lima Tours, en la capital de Peru, Luli Gamarra de Noriega
dice que las limitaciones en alojamiento y transporte al antiguo
centro del imperio inca aliviara en algo la congestion en Cuzco.
Senala que esta ciudad y Machu Picchu tienen una gran atraccion
para la gente que cree en la mistica y que puedan costearla.
 &HT;    ``Va a costar mas,'' dice Gamarra de Noriega, jefa de imagen y
comunicaciones de Lima Tours. Maupintour, una agencia de viajes de
Kansas con negocios en America Latina, cobra US$4.845 por persona
por un paquete Miami-Machu Picchu de nueve dias.
 &HT;    En Mexico, las autoridades dicen que habra festividades en
Ciudad de Mexico y en las ruinas mayas y aztecas, aunque la junta
de turismo todavia no ha coordinado promociones del milenio. Los
centros costeros, como Cancun, Puerto Vallarta y Acapulco, deben
colmarse de fiesta. Las agencias de viajes norteamericanas dicen
que sus clientes pagan cientos de dolares mas de lo normal por el
pasaje de avion y el alojamiento para estar presentes en las
celebraciones.
 &HT;    Varios hoteleros latinoamericanos dicen que muchas personas no
planean viajar a la region por el temor al problema del milenio.
``Cuando le digo a la gente que vamos a Margarita, me preguntan
sobre el desastre de las computadoras por el problema del 2000,''
observa Mathes. ``Pero yo me digo: si las computadoras no funcionan
y nos quedamos estancados, en que lugar se puede estar mejor que en
una playa de Venezuela?''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    DETROIT _ Caryn Mathes y su esposo, que es abogado, entraron en
la Internet hace meses en busca de un lugar atractivo para esperar
el nuevo milenio. La gerente general de la estacion de radio
publica de Detroit encontro en linea un vuelo, una habitacion y una
tarifa para la isla Margarita, en Venezuela, pero por suerte
verifico el costo del pasaje con un agente de viajes antes de
comprar. En total se ahorro US$3.400.
 &HT;    Siempre es dificil encontrar transporte y alojamiento asequible
en epoca de fiestas. Y este ano, con todo el alboroto por el 2000,
los precios aumentaron con rapidez ante lo que prometia ser una
fiesta que solo se da una vez en la vida. Sin embargo, los
operadores de viajes que esperaban que America Latina celebrara la
llegada del milenio con mas bullicio que nunca, dicen que el
entusiasmo esta muy por debajo de lo que esperaban.
 &HT;    Como cada fin de ano, habra expediciones en barco a las
Galapagos; los creyentes de la Nueva Era subiran a Machu Picchu y
Rio de Janeiro trepidara al ritmo de las celebraciones simultaneas
de Ano Nuevo y de Lemanja, la diosa del mar. Pero la region no le
sacara la esperada fortuna a la fiebre del milenio.
 &HT;    ``Hubo mucha exageracion con este milenio,'' afirma Joel
Marchal, propietario de Global Connections, una agencia de viajes
canadiense que se especializa en America Latina.
 &HT;    Marchal y los operadores de viajes de la region dicen que las
aerolineas y los hoteles que aumentaron los precios casi diez veces
en algunos casos a principios de 1999, ya estan ofreciendo
descuentos de ultima hora para no perder todas las ganancias que
esperaban con el 2000. Pero los viajeros no pican la carnada.
 &HT;    ``No hay un solo lugar en toda la region que se destaque como un
sitio para esperar el milenio, como Paris, Nueva York, Las Vegas o
Australia,'' explica Maria Teresa Torruella, gerente de relaciones
publicas internacionales de Marriott International.
``Individualmente, nuestros hoteles preparan actividades para la
vispera de Ano Nuevo, pero esta es una epoca del ano en que
normalmente se llenan de todas formas.''
 &HT;    Torruella pronostica que las dos docenas de hoteles Marriott en
America Latina y el Caribe se llenaran de latinoamericanos que
regresan a casa para pasar la fecha, norteamericanos y europeos en
busca de un clima calido, y gente del lugar que acudiran a las
fiestas en los hoteles. Pero dice que este fin de ano no diferira
de otros. Marchal indica que los hoteles de Buenos Aires y Santiago
han hecho poca propaganda sobre el milenio.
 &HT;    En el San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino en Puerto
Rico, el gerente general Horst E. Sicher se dispone a recibir a
2.000 festejantes en una gala con seis bandas musicales y fuegos
artificiales sobre la playa del hotel. Aunque la asistencia sera
casi el doble de la del ano pasado, Horst dice que la popularidad
de la fiesta, a US$250 por persona, se debe mas al exito de la
celebracion del ano pasado que a la fiebre del 2000.
 &HT;    ``Creo que la gente probablemente gaste un poco mas este ano,
pero la multitud sera mas numerosa simplemente porque en Puerto
Rico a la gente le gusta salir,'' agrega.
 &HT;    Al parecer, los latinoamericanos no van a viajar mas para
esperar el milenio que los norteamericanos, que por amplio margen
deciden quedarse cerca de casa. Una encuesta realizada en Estados
Unidos por la revista Travel Weekly determino que mas del 80 por
ciento de los entrevistados no viajaran para celebrar el nuevo
milenio. Nadine Godwin, jefa de redaccion de la revista, dice que
en la encuesta telefonica hecha en julio participaron 405 personas
con un ingreso familiar promedio de US$79.000 anuales, nivel que
les facilita viajar mas que a la poblacion general.
 &HT;    ``Mi percepcion no cientifica me dice que este Ano Nuevo no sera
muy distinto a los demas,'' comenta Godwin. ``Solo el 8 por ciento
de los encuestados tenian planes en firme. Otro 9 por ciento
explora las posibilidades. El resto no va a ir a ninguna parte.''
 &HT;    Mathes puso el grito en el cielo cuando descubrio que para ir a
la isla Margarita, solo el viaje en avion de Detroit a Caracas
costaba mas de US$1.000. Al final un agente de viajes le encontro a
la pareja de Michigan un paquete de una semana, con hotel y vuelo,
por US$1.700 por persona, menos de la mitad del precio original.
Pero Venezuela esta ganando fama de poner los precios por las nubes
a fin de ano.
 &HT;    Marchal, el dueno de una agencia de viajes en Canada, dice que
en Canaima, un centro turistico del Salto del Angel, en Venezuela,
le saquean el bolsillo al publico con sus tarifas de fin de ano.
``El paquete normal de tres dias y dos noches, con vuelo desde
Caracas, cuesta unos US$400,'' dice Marchal. ``Cuando pedimos el
precio de Ano Nuevo, era de US$5.000 por persona.''
 &HT;    A fines de septiembre, nadie habia adquirido un costoso paquete
de hotel para esperar el milenio en Caracas, a un costo de
US$14.265 por pareja. El paquete, con alojamiento de cuatro noches
en la suite presidencial del hotel Gran Melia Caracas, promete una
gran dosis de atencion, con champan Dom Perignon, bar, bodega de
vinos, cenas de gourmet, choferes, masajes y faciales, una gira por
un parque nacional y una invitacion a una gala de vispera de Ano
Nuevo con musicos de Cuba.
 &HT;    ``En este pais y en otros paises latinoamericanos hay personas
preocupadas con el problema informatico del 2000 y no quieren que
sus ejecutivos vayan al extranjero,'' senala Simone Lara, directora
de ventas y mercadeo en el Gran Melia Caracas.
 &HT;    Las 10 suites reales del Gran Melia Caracas, que ofrecen una
serie de extras mas economica que el paquete de la suite
presidencial, mas un boleto a la fiesta de Ano Nuevo del hotel, que
cuesta US$250 por persona, a principios de septiembre solo habian
atraido a cuatro parejas dispuestas a pagar US$4.400 por el paquete
de cuatro noches. De las 432 habitaciones del hotel, solo el 50 por
ciento estaban reservadas tres meses antes de Navidad.
 &HT;    Un portavoz de Lima Tours en Peru dice que las tarifas de hotel
en ese pais estan un tercio mas altas para el 23 de diciembre que
para el 5 de enero. La mayoria de los miembros latinoamericanos de
la Sociedad Americana de Agentes de Viajes informo que los precios
de las giras y de los paquetes de fin de ano habian subido como
promedio el 30 por ciento.
 &HT;    ``Hemos encontrado que las aerolineas pedian un deposito
demasiado alto: US$250 por asiento, sin devolucion. Habitualmente
piden entre US$40 y US$100 y es reembolsable hasta 60 dias antes de
viajar,'' senala Sarah Erskine, gerente de MILA Tours, operador de
Chicago que tiene casi dos decadas de experiencia en destinos
latinoamericanos. ``Los hoteles no necesariamente aumentan los
precios, pero quieren un pago inicial con tres meses de adelanto.
Normalmente piden unos 30 dias.''
 &HT;    La mayoria de los operadores de turismo se quejan de que las
aerolineas, sobre todo las norteamericanas, inflaron
espectacularmente los pasajes al afirmar que los asientos mas
economicos estaban reservados. Debido a la volatilidad de los
precios, algunos agentes de viajes exhortan a sus clientes a evitar
el Ano Nuevo y planean viajes en celebracion del 2000 semanas o
meses despues de la llegada del milenio. Otros pronostican que en
las semanas anteriores a las Navidades habra enormes reducciones de
precios.
 &HT;    America Latina esta a la zaga del Pacifico Sur, donde los que
festejen en la Linea Internacional de la Fecha seran los primeros
en dar la bienvenida al nuevo milenio, pero la region tambien
tendra una gran fiesta. Los operadores de turismo dicen que Costa
Rica y Belice ya no tienen reservaciones para fin de ano, en parte
porque cuentan con relativamente pocas habitaciones de hotel, por
lo que Brasil se ha convertido en la sede de la fiesta.
 &HT;    Los cariocas invadiran la playa de Copacabana para hacer
ofrendas a la diosa Lemanja mientras los fuegos artificiales
estallan sobre la bahia. Se espera que la fiesta atraiga a tres
millones de personas. Muchos han pagado US$460 por persona para
bailar samba en la fiesta del Hotel Inter-Continental Rio en la
cima del Pan de Azucar.
 &HT;    Entretanto, en las Galapagos, los paquetes de viaje desde Nueva
York se reservaron en cuanto se anunciaron a principios de ano.
``Se vendieron como pan caliente,'' dice David Moore, director de
ventas de Adventure Associates, de Dallas, la oficina
norteamericana de Metropolitan Touring, de Ecuador. El barco Santa
Cruz, de 90 pasajeros, y el yate Isabela II, de 40, ambos de
Metropolitan, interrumpiran su itinerario habitual para anclar en
la latitud cero y celebrar con champan la llegada del 2000.
 &HT;    Los cruceros de lujo se han convertido en una de las formas mas
populares de celebrar el milenio, a pesar de que los precios son de
dos a cuatro veces mas altos que los habituales, pero las rutas
latinoamericanas no estan entre las mas buscadas. El unico barco de
Princess Cruises con plazas vacantes es el que recorrera la costa
de Sudamerica. El Royal Princess, que sale de Buenos Aires el 19 de
diciembre, da una fiesta de Ano Nuevo en el mar, durante su viaje
de 16 dias a Santiago. La capital chilena es el punto de partida
del Norwegian Crown, de Norwegian Cruise Line, que planea un viaje
de 14 dias por los fiordos chilenos y luego hacia Buenos Aires. El
Crystal Harmony, de Crystal Cruises, en ruta de Buenos Aires a
Barbados, tocara tierra el 31 de diciembre en Rio para ver los
fuegos artificiales.
 &HT;    En Peru, Cuzco y Machu Picchu se preparan para la fiesta. Se
espera una invasion de turistas en las ruinas de Machu Picchu y
Sacsahuaman, que estaran iluminadas la vispera de Ano Nuevo. Los
operadores informan que los hoteles de Cuzco ya estan totalmente
reservados a pesar del alto precio.
 &HT;    En Lima Tours, en la capital de Peru, Luli Gamarra de Noriega
dice que las limitaciones en alojamiento y transporte al antiguo
centro del imperio inca aliviara en algo la congestion en Cuzco.
Senala que esta ciudad y Machu Picchu tienen una gran atraccion
para la gente que cree en la mistica y que puedan costearla.
 &HT;    ``Va a costar mas,'' dice Gamarra de Noriega, jefa de imagen y
comunicaciones de Lima Tours. Maupintour, una agencia de viajes de
Kansas con negocios en America Latina, cobra US$4.845 por persona
por un paquete Miami-Machu Picchu de nueve dias.
 &HT;    En Mexico, las autoridades dicen que habra festividades en
Ciudad de Mexico y en las ruinas mayas y aztecas, aunque la junta
de turismo todavia no ha coordinado promociones del milenio. Los
centros costeros, como Cancun, Puerto Vallarta y Acapulco, deben
colmarse de fiesta. Las agencias de viajes norteamericanas dicen
que sus clientes pagan cientos de dolares mas de lo normal por el
pasaje de avion y el alojamiento para estar presentes en las
celebraciones.
 &HT;    Varios hoteleros latinoamericanos dicen que muchas personas no
planean viajar a la region por el temor al problema del milenio.
``Cuando le digo a la gente que vamos a Margarita, me preguntan
sobre el desastre de las computadoras por el problema del 2000,''
observa Mathes. ``Pero yo me digo: si las computadoras no funcionan
y nos quedamos estancados, en que lugar se puede estar mejor que en
una playa de Venezuela?''

TROOPERS' SUIT CHARGES AGE DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Eight Massachusetts State Police troopers filed a
federal discrimination suit against the state Wednesday, claiming
they were continually bypassed for promotion because of their age.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, now ranging in age from 44 to 61, were members of
the Metropolitan District Commission force who were on a waiting
list for promotion to lieutenant in 1992 when the Metropolitan,
Capitol, and Registry police were consolidated under the State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were on the list to be promoted and lost out on
that,'' said lawyer Cornelius J. Sullivan, who filed the suit on
the heels of a ruling by a federal judge that struck down a state
law requiring troopers to retire at 55. US District Judge A. David
Mazzone ruled in June 1998 that forcing someone to retire solely
based on age violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling settled a lawsuit filed in December 1992 by former
Metropolitan, Registry, and Capitol police challenging the
mandatory retirement age established when the forces were
consolidated. Previously, State Police had been forced to retire at
50, while officers in the other departments could work until 65.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sullivan says the state ``demonstrated an animus against
those over 50,'' which was further evidenced by its failure to
promote the older officers. He is seeking to have the men promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has rejected the
troopers' claims that they weren't promoted because of their age,
noting that seven of the eight in the suit had scored below 70 on
the written portion of the lieutenant's exam. State law prohibits
the promotion to lieutenant of any State Police officer who scores
less than 70 on the written test.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the troopers scored differently on various tests
but had all passed the lieutenant's exam and were on a waiting list
for promotion before the consolidation of the police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Troopers Jerome Gately, 61; Richard A.
Donovan, 51; Peter J. Perez, 52; David F. Ford,44; Thomas Ryan, 53;
Edward Lee, 54; Carl Casagrande, 52; and Greg D'Aiuto, 52.

   TRUMP-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Donald Trump builds buildings. I
write about them. So far, he hasn't given me an occasion to write
glowingly about his architectural projects. It would be great if
this changed. I'm not hopeful. But I love the color,
contentiousness and comedy Trump brings to the contemporary urban
scene. Adrian Stokes, the British art critic, once wrote that
``Architecture is limited to forms without events.'' I disagree. As
a social, public and urban art form, architecture can't be
separated from the events that buildings contain, shape and
provoke. Architecture criticism, in written appraisals or the
comments of sidewalk superintendents, qualifies as an event in this
sense. Even when criticism is negative, it is part of the fabric
that holds a great city together. I don't hate Trump's buildings,
but even if that were the case, I would still see them as a
challenge to examine my preferences in relation to his. By Herbert
Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DOCUMENTARY-FILMS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ The Fantasy building has
been the birthplace of cinematic flights of fancy _ to the Sahara,
to the concert halls of 18th-century Vienna, to the Amazon jungle.
But this seven-story glass and concrete structure, also houses a
different breed of filmmaker. For more than a decade, the film
producer, Saul Zaentz has offered low-cost space to local
documentarians, making his building a center for San Francisco's
growing, well-regarded documentary community. By Edward Wong.

</P>
<P>
   SNOW-ON-CEDARS-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is
a complex story that spreads across many years and while it is, at
heart, a love story, it also contains elements of epic historical
importance, like the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in
detention camps during World War II. And there are three main plot
threads, according to Scott Hicks, the film's director. A murder
mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a
white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a
soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and
editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife)
and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their
community. The film opens Wednesday. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SHOAH-VIDEO (Undated) _ Time doesn't fly in Claude Lanzmann's
monumental film; it melts. A chronicle of the Holocaust, ``Shoah''
(``annihilation'' in Hebrew) proceeds deliberately, inexorably, for
9 hours and 23 minutes, set always to the click-clack of boxcars
that carried Jews to the gas chambers and crematoriums. Released in
theaters in 1985 and now back on video after seven years out of
distribution, the documentary focuses primarily on the death camps
in the Polish towns of Treblinka and Auschwitz. By Peter M.
Nichols. (Moved).

   PARSONS-DANCE (New York) _ As the choreographer for ``Times
Square 2000,'' Manhattan's round-the-clock salute to the
millennium, David Parsons is putting the finishing touches on
nearly a dozen new dances by the end of the month. Colleagues say
he has kept his part of the program on track _ despite a trip to
the hospital to be treated for dehydration _ with shrewd planning,
a lively imagination and undisguised pragmatism. The outdoor
celebration will start around sunrise on Dec. 31 and continue for
24 hours. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-LANGUAGE (subslug) (Undated) _ A musical observer a
century ago could have looked around at a number of living
composers whose works were being regularly performed wherever
Western classical music was known. And most of those composers were
relatively young. We live in a different world. Most of the
composers who are widely admired today are over 50, and some are
over 90. Once John Cage had produced his silent piece ``4' 33'',''
in 1952, there was perhaps nowhere to go but sideways. The only
progress made after that was in electronic music and in the
recovery of large form, whether by erstwhile Serialists, such as
Pierre Boulez, or by the new Minimalists, such as Steve Reich. And
even in these areas, not much has changed in the last 20 years. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-CITY-CHRISTMAS (New York) _ Once my critical colleagues
have dispatched themselves to various ceremonies of carols, the
``Messiah'' of the day or the latest ``Christmas Oratorio,'' I
check to see that no one is looking and make a beeline for Radio
City Music Hall. I like the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular''
because it tells me how the season is progressing. I like a Santa
not afraid to loosen his hips to a boogie beat. The Rockettes make
my heart beat fast. There is in this year's show a dance sequence
of multiplying Santas: so many that by the end they barely fit
onstage. It's comforting to know that there will be enough Kriss
Kringles available for every borough and congressional district in
New York City, with some left over for the immediate suburbs. By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Country music almost by definition
exists in a convoluted, almost duplicitous relationship with its
past. Inherently reactionary _ that's the whole point _ country on
the surface is all about roots, constancy, shared references both
in terms of the music and the lyrics. But, from its beginnings as a
commercial force country has always been an intensely marketed
amalagm of old and new, real and contrived that was willed into
existence in the 1920s by the modernizing influences of radio, new
recording technology and urbanism. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-DECO-ANTIQUES (New York) _ As stocks soared this year, the
New York market for antiques, collectibles and 20th century objects
eclipsed even the levels reached in the boom years of the 1980s.
Auctions, fairs and exhibitions at museums and galleries attracted
new collectors and dealers as well as a new art fair to Manhattan,
heightening the awareness of the decorative arts, especially in the
Art Deco style. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-ARCHITECT (Paris) _ Having designed 30 airport terminals
around the world, Paul Andreu can hardly escape being known as an
airport architect. Not that there is anything amiss with that.
Airports today are what railroad stations were at the turn of the
century, gateways that every year provide tens of millions of
travelers with their first and last impressions of a city. And if
Andreu keeps being invited to build airports, it is because this
engineer-turned-architect enjoys a worldwide reputation for
designing visually striking and passenger-friendly terminals. By
Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TOMASELLI-ART (New York) _ The painter, Fred Tomaselli, uses
cutout photos of birds, flowers, insects and pictures of lips and
eyeballs clipped from fashion magazines as materials for his
collages, which are sealed in several coats of resin. Pictorially
the work veers between the figurative and the abstract, but the
result is usually the same: eye-popping imagery that is dense,
decorative and witty. The latest and largest example, ``Gravity's
Rainbow (Large),'' is now on view at the Whitney Museum of Art at
Philip Morris on 42nd Street through Jan. 7. By William Harris.

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-DAUGHTER (Los Angeles) _ The scene is a brunch in an
elegant living room in Georgetown, the upper-class Washington
enclave. Christine Lahti and a half-dozen actresses and actors are
filming ``An American Daughter'' in a home in the upscale Hancock
Park section of Los Angeles. Washington _ the town's hypocrisies,
its self-important journalists and snarky politics _ serves not
only as the setting for the Wendy Wasserstein
comedy-drama-turned-television-movie but the catalyst for the
unique personal and professional pitfalls that face women in and
around government. The drama, which explores the corrosive effects
of a private life turned public before the television cameras, is
now completing production in Los Angeles, and is set to be shown
next spring over Lifetime. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).

HONG KONG HIGH COURT RULES THAT DEFACING CHINA'S FLAG IS CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Steering clear of another legal confrontation with
the Chinese government, the top court in Hong Kong on Wednesday
ruled that defacing the Chinese flag is a crime. The decision was a
victory for the local government and reversed a lower court's
ruling that defacing the flag was a form of expression guaranteed
by the constitution of this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Striking down a Hong Kong law that protects the flag, legal
experts said, could have led to a showdown with China. The law was
adopted by the new legislature here hours after the colony reverted
to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The flag decision was released a week after the court had said
that Beijing had the right to overturn its landmark decision that
granted residency to more than a million people from mainland
China. Taken together, the rulings prompted some critics here to
contend that the Hong Kong judiciary had lost its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid people will see this as a trend,'' said Hong Kong
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee. ``It won't be long before Hong
Kong goes down the same route as Singapore or mainland China, where
the courts never rule against the government on sensitive cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a lawyer, refused to comment on the case itself. Other
legal experts noted that unlike the immigration case, where the
court made a well-reasoned decision that Beijing overturned,
Wednesday's decision involved a thorny issue that has bedeviled
courts in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people will say the court is collapsing,'' said
former Hong Kong Solicitor General Daniel Fung. ``But this ruling
is not a knee-jerk response to executive pressure. On the contrary,
the judges are looking at how other mature jurisdictions have
approached this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from a pro-democracy rally in January 1998 in
which two men, Ng Kung-siu and Lee Kin-yun, carried heavily defaced
Chinese and Hong Kong flags. Both flags were torn, smeared with
black ink and had the Chinese word for ``shame'' scrawled on them.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two argued that they had the right to express
themselves, even by destroying the flags, under the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is enshrined in the
Hong Kong constitution. The government countered that the men had
violated laws that protect national and regional flags. The
defendants won their case on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 51-page ruling, Chief Justice Andrew Li acknowledged that
the flag ordinance restricted civil liberties. But Li said it did
not stifle other forms of political expression, and he said it was
justified because the Chinese flag symbolized Hong Kong's effort to
integrate itself into the Chinese motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protection of the national flag and the regional flag from
desecration, having regard for their unique symbolism, will play an
important part in the attaining these goals,'' the judge declared.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, another justice, Anthony Mason, seemed
eager to show that Hong Kong was squarely in the mainstream of
international legal opinion. He noted that defacing the flag was a
crime in Germany and Italy. The Portuguese colony of Macau, which
returns to Chinese rule Sunday, also recently banned the practice.
Even in the United States, where the Supreme Court has struck down
state laws that would make flag burning a crime, Mason noted that
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy had expressed distaste in voting to keep
it legal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge acknowledged that the ban was ``just within the
outer limits of constitutionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Chen, the dean of the law faculty at the University of
Hong Kong, said, ``The case could have gone either way.'' But he
noted that the Chinese flag played a more sensitive role here than
national flags in other countries because it is ``one of the few
manifestations of Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong.''

SYRIAN PUBLIC FOLLOWING WASHINGTON TALKS WITH MIX OF HOPE AND
CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-U.S., MIDEAST-ISRAEL)  
 (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ It was 32 years ago that Israeli forces drove
Syrians by the many thousands from the Golan Heights. Wednesday,
many of those same Syrians were fixing eyes and ears at Washington,
in the hope they were witnessing a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted by this stalemate,'' said Ali Rahil, the
headmaster of a primary school outside Damascus, who was relying on
a satellite dish to monitor the news from abroad. ``They want the
talks to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Israeli-Syrian negotiations once again under way
after a 45-month break, the Syrian government has been trying to
keep optimism in check.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Wednesday evening when Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Shara and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appeared
together at the White House, Syria's two state-run television
stations were broadcasting the dramas that are a staple of this
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But even Damascus has begun to lift old restraints, to provide
Syrians with a taste of a possible future peace. Wednesday morning,
for the first time anyone here can remember, the front page of each
of Syria's government-controlled newspapers displayed a photograph
of an Israeli prime minister, Barak _ whose country is still
Syria's declared foe _ on his way to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And on the evening news, extensive Syrian television coverage of
the scene in the White House Rose Garden included, in full, the
statement delivered by Barak, although some deft editing made it
appear that Shara had spoken first.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, whose government has long worked overtime to control
citizens' perceptions, the Internet and mobile telephones are still
banned, except to a small elite sector. Newspapers and television
stations are not permitted to voice dissent, at least when it comes
to foreign affairs and President Hafez Assad's policies.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been the appearance of seamless consensus among
citizens who tend to echo an unswerving government line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want peace, but it will come down to the land,'' said
Michel Achkar, a 35-year-old electrical engineer. ``Syrians believe
in peace, but only if we get our land back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a national hunger for news often exceeds what the
government is willing to provide. Wednesday in particular, visits
to homes and offices almost invariably found that stations were
turned to foreign outlets, including Radio Monte Carlo, which
provides Arab-language broadcasts, and even to an Arab-language
Israeli television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Rahil, the headmaster, now lives in a refugee camp about 10
miles south of Damascus. Now 40, he was just 8 in 1967, when the
Golan was captured by Israel and his family fled.
</P>
<P>
   His new home, once a field of tents, has evolved over the years
into a village of cinder-block houses. The population of 50,000 is
divided about equally between those who fled Palestinian lands in
1948 and 1967 and those driven from the Golan, a main battle zone
of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   At least 500,000 Syrians, officials say, have roots in the
Golan, out of a total Syrian population of 16 million. Today, the
land, still furrowed with minefields and full of Israeli military
outposts, is home to 17,000 Israeli settlers and about 20,000
Syrians, most of them Druse, who stayed behind after the conflict.
Even now, people like Rahil describe vivid memories of Israeli
bombardment and of the truck that carried them northward, into
Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Rahil advertises his patriotism on school walls
adorned with murals that pay tribute to Assad, Syria's ruler for
the last 30 years. But he still likes to hear the news from abroad,
he said, and managed a few years ago to scrape up the $100
necessary to buy a share in a satellite dish that makes foreign
channel-surfing possible.
</P>
<P>
   His mood remained cautious; the Israelis, he said, are experts
in ``procrastinating and prevaricating.''
</P>
<P>
   One street away, however, Abu Hassan al-Masri, 80, another
refugee from the Golan, showed a darker side of the Syrian mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to work,'' Masri almost spat when asked about
the talks in Washington. ``Peace doesn't work with the Israelis,
only war.''

<P>
   When we first see the Littles (played in ``Leave It to
Beaver''-ish strokes by Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie), we
immediately know they are not like other people, certainly not like
other New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   They're pleasant, first of all, and somewhat wide-eyed, even
bumpkinish for folks who have long lived in the heart of that
metropolis, even in these hyperscrubbed, Giuliani-gentled days.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that rather fantastical nature is why, when they decide
to adopt a sibling for their young son (Jonathan Lipnicki, the
tousled, gap-tooth tot from ``Jerry Maguire''), they don't much
blink when a talking mouse begins chatting with them as they look
over the orphanage's charges.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse, of course, is Stuart, who quickly and without much
more explanation or question becomes Stuart Little.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart (voiced endearingly by Michael J. Fox) is a sweet little
fellow, eager to please, modest, as unassuming as a daisy. But he's
not exactly what brother George had been expecting when the folks
headed off to the orphanage that fateful morning. Nor, for that
matter, is he quite the cat's meow for the Littles' puffed-up
Persian, Snowbell (voiced in hilariously simpering mode by Nathan
Lane).
</P>
<P>
   Snowbell is, in fact, traumatized at the thought of being ``pet
cat to a mouse,'' and tries desperately to hide the mortifying fact
from his friends. Once word gets out, though, he seeks the dubious
help of street-tom toughs to end his misery and protect the
species' honor.
</P>
<P>
   That conflict provides most of the dramatic tension in what is
otherwise a relentlessly sweet story, a story that nevertheless
finds it necessary to repeatedly remind us it is a fairy tale (as
though the adventures of a talking mouse might be anything else).
</P>
<P>
   It is a mark of the film's technical achievements that we spend
more time being annoyed by Stuart's sometimes cloying sweetness
than we do accepting whether he's real, even though Stuart is
almost completely computer generated.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers, led by director Rob Minkoff (co-director of
``The Lion King'') and senior visual effects supervisor/second-unit
director John Dykstra, somehow have managed to effectively drop
Stuart's ephemeral presence in among live actors and sets, and have
him interact not only with them but with live cat actors whose own
``talking'' is also animated !ital!a la!off! ``Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many interaction problems that could arise here (see
Jar Jar Binks, Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson), the Sony Imageworks
visual effects allow us to believe he exists as a real ``actor''
every bit as much as his human, breathing counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger problems lie with the script, which M. Night Shyamalan
(who wrote and directed ``The Sixth Sense'') apparently struggled
to fashion into shape over several tries and a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame can be laid to the episodic structure of the
wonderful original book by E.B. White. Fashioned as a children's
tale to be read a chapter a night, it doesn't easily lend itself to
a film's more compressed and linear narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that some scenes, such as the nicely staged race
of miniature boats in Central Park, feel as though they were glued
onto the main story's superstructure, instead of being an organic
part of its flow.
</P>
<P>
   And the work of several uncredited but notable script doctors
have given the movie a number of quite funny lines, especially for
Lane's Snowbell, easily the movie's most entertaining _ and
conflicted _ character. But sometimes those lines feel glued on as
well, zingers that come out of nowhere and disappear nearly as
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, these are only moderate-sized quibbles in a
generally enjoyable film. Director Minkoff here makes an able
transition to mostly live action, keeping the pace brisk and
action-filled, the live actors' performances tuned to an
appropriately wide-eyed key of innocence. And he gets extra credit
for getting great performances from the live feline actors here,
who unlike his ``Lion King'' cats, can't be told what to do with
the stroke of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   The film's design is also terrific, with a sense of slightly
off-center fantasy that's perfect for the material. It is a movie
that children should enjoy greatly, and that adults _ if they can
avoid the sugar _ will find sweet and lovable and frequent good
fun. &QL;

TEACHERS UNTRAINED TO DETECT SUBTLE PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending on whom you believe, when seven-year-old Lydia Hanson
told people at her school her mother was dead, her teacher either
told her ``not to talk like that,'' or else made only a weak
attempt to find out if such a morbid comment was true.
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   But no one questioned the Peabody, Mass. first grader,so Hanson
took the schoolbus home and spent a night alone curled up with her
mother's corpse before her grandfather discovered them the
following morning.
</P>
<P>
   The grim tale was the talk of school hallways throughout
Massachusetts and made national headlines, setting off an angry and
anguished debate about what educators should or must do when
students approach them with shocking or disturbing comments.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and others who work with children agreed that Lydia's
teacher probably should have done more when the child said, ``My
mom is dead'' at school last Friday. But some of them said it was a
mistake any teacher could make, especially in today's
violence-saturated society, when the vocabulary of tragedy is
familiar even to the smallest children.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Friedland, professor of early childhood education at
Wheelock College in Boston, said children often make dark or
troubling comments.
</P>
<P>
   At their age, first graders are typically struggling to make
sense of what they see and hear, Friedland said. They can use
violent drawings to express fear, or make statements that do not
make sense to adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``At these ages, children will say all kinds of things, and
sometimes it is not clear if they are talking about fantasy or
reality,'' Friedland said. ``I could absolutely see a kid saying
that kind of thing. Kids at that age are very involved with trying
to understand death and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet most educators said teachers should never blithely dismiss
students' remarks, like Hanson's, that seem so alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem to me that it should have been checked out in
fairly short order,'' said Stephen Gorrie, president of the
Massachusetts Teachers Association, who was a fourth grade teacher
for 27 years. ``I know we run the risk of the little boy who cried
wolf, but still, at least check it out!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wednesday Lydia's grandfather, Richard Tucker,
continued to denounce the Kiley School, saying he will not allow
the girl to return there and may consider taking legal action.
</P>
<P>
   With the case sparking widespread controversy, Peabody Mayor
Peter Torigan said the city's school committee will review the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts teachers and principals interviewed Wednesday said
they probably would have treated Hanson's remarks with more
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton first grade teacher Lucille Boutiette said if a student
told her a parent had died, she would quickly respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, `That bothers me. Gee, why would you say that?'
'' Boutiette said. ``Even if they said `no reason,' or `never
mind,' I would still want to probe it further.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators had a much harsher judgment of the Peabody
teacher's actions, but were reluctant to speak publicly without
knowing the full details. Their feelings were reflected by one
superintendent from a city north of Boston, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not talking about Santa Claus,'' said the
superintendent. ``No kid ever says their mother is dead. Every day,
7-year-olds come in and tell teachers stories. You play along with
it, it's part of growing up. But they don't say their mother is
dead. ... That should make anyone sit up and listen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lydia's grandparents and family friends, the Kiley
School teacher sent the girl back to her desk when she stated _
without emotion _ that her mother was dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Superintendent Louis Perullo said Lydia told classmates, not
the teacher. Her teacher overheard her and went to a guidance
counselor for help, he said. The counselor was busy, however, and
neither took action before Lydia had already left for the day.
</P>
<P>
   She went home where her mother's body sat in a recliner in the
living room. Kimberly Hanson, 33, a single mother who had diabetes,
probably died of natural causes that morning, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   After doing her homework, eating leftovers for dinner and
microwaving popcorn, Lydia spent Thursday night curled up in a
quilt and sleeping in her dead mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the school has called to apologize and Perullo said
everyone ``feels awful,'' Tucker said Wednesday he is not
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apology is nice, but that's not an answer,'' Tucker said.
``I expect far more of an answer out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said he and his wife will seek permanent custody of
Hanson and enroll her in public school in Hamilton, Mass., where
they live, rather than allow her to continue at the Kiley School.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never should have had to spend the night alone with her
mom _ dead,'' he said. ``There is no excuse for what has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators stressed that Lydia's lack of emotion at school
should not have lulled her teacher into discounting her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have been traumatized, so she's totally numb _ her
effect is flat,'' said Diane Levin, author of ``Teaching Young
Children in Violent Times,'' and a professor at Wheelock. ``Also
little kids have learned something about death, but it doesn't have
a whole lot of concrete meaning to them. She doesn't understand
death the way you or I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have established guidelines specifying how to
report alarming behavior _ especially important since schools have
a legal obligation to report suspicion of abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Capone, principal of Hancock School in Brockton,
Mass., said busy school officials are so overwhelmed they might not
treat every case with appropriately weighty attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 800 kids here and one (guidance) counselor,'' Capone
said. ``In the course of a day, lots of things come up. ... You
need to check everything, and we do, ... but there are so many
things.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in a month a child was found to be
attending school with a dead parent at home. Family and friends
went to visit Travis Butler in Tennessee on Dec. 6 and found the
9-year-old boy alone with his 30-year-old mother's corpse.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had died of natural causes a month earlier, but
Travis covered her body and went to school as usual, afraid of
being sent to a foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Levin argues that teachers need better training in how to
respond when children talk about violence and death. They do so
more and more, she said, because of the influence of news and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But Lydia's story illustrates that teachers today have less time
and fewer resources to look after their students' emotional needs,
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a story for our time,'' Levin said. ``As we're
under more and more pressure to focus on things like MCAS, there's
less and less focus on the well being of our kids. Teachers are
being forced to shortchange the stuff that's really best for
children.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel and Syria Wednesday resumed peace
negotiations that stalled nearly four years ago, with the modest
goal of surviving two days of breaking the ice in a relationship
long frozen by mutual mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   As the day kicked off in a small ceremony in the Rose Garden, it
carried the making of a historic moment, with Israel and Syria
standing resolutely on the brink of a new dialogue that could spell
the end of a bitter decadeslong conflict. But the mood quickly
soured when the Syrians publicly reiterated well-worn grievances
against the Israelis, signaling just how rocky the road ahead may
be.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday did begin the highest-level Israeli-Syrian talks to
date, what President Clinton called ``a big step along the path''
to peace. First at the White House, then at the Blair House, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel met with Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa of Syria under the auspices of Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The face-to-face encounter sent a clear signal of intentions as
both sides approached the negotiating table with a determination to
see things through to an eventual agreement. A firm desire to make
peace was voiced by both sides, and Clinton urged them to seize the
moment and by Thursday present him with an itinerary for their
peacemaking, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not underestimate the importance of the simple fact
that the two parties are here,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was almost startling to see the Israeli and Syrian
officials file out and take their places side by side in the wet
grass behind the White House Wednesday morning. A skullcap on his
head, the Israeli attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, chatted
amiably with a Syrian official, as if small talk between the two
sides were an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barak, al-Sharaa and Clinton marched out in their somber
suits and did a little shuffle. Barak and al-Sharaa stood on the
wrong sides of Clinton, until Barak said, with a fleeting smile,
``I think we have to change,'' and they did.
</P>
<P>
   From there on, it was downhill, an inauspicious start. Clinton
and Barak did as planned, giving short, idealistic speeches about
the desire for peace and the difficulty of securing it. Al-Sharaa,
on the other hand, cleared his throat, placed his glasses at the
tip of his nose and took advantage of a rare platform.
</P>
<P>
   Making excuses for speaking at relative length on such a cold
day, he nonetheless launched into a substantial summary of Syria's
grievances. The Israeli occupation, in sum, is the root of all
misery, not just Syrian misery but Israeli misery as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return
of all its occupied land,'' he said, ``while for Israel, peace will
mean the end of the psychological fear that the Israelis have been
living in as a result of the existence of occupation, which is
undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   As al-Sharaa spoke those words, Barak clasped his hands, pursed
his lips and stared forward without expression. American officials
shifted uneasily from foot to foot. A senior official later said
the Israelis were upset by al-Sharaa's nonconciliatory tone, which
quickly and jarringly broke the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had talked broadly and hopefully, pronouncing this a
juncture unlike any other in the long Israeli-Arab peacemaking
effort. ``For the first time in history, there is a chance of a
comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and, indeed, all its
neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the resolve of both Barak, whom he called ``an
exceptional hero in war'' who is now ``a determined soldier for
peace,'' and President Hafez Assad of Syria, who also ``has known
the cost of war.'' Without such adornments, he referred to
al-Sharaa as ``an able representative'' of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Then, very succinctly, Barak reiterated his broad intentions in
pursuing peace, making a point to refer to the Syrians as ``our
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step
forward toward peace,'' he said in a three-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa, though, refused to be stage-managed. He spoke with
apparent awareness of his audience at home and throughout the Arab
world. He gave the impression that he could not let himself be
manipulated by the Israeli and the Americans into performing on
cue, not as he was entering negotiations in which Syria would take
the exceptional step of accepting the permanence of the Jewish
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He proclaimed that now as ever before, all Syria wanted was to
reclaim ``all its occupied land,'' that is, the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau that Israel seized during the 1967 war. He
criticized the media at large for portraying Syria as ``the
aggressor,'' the one ``who shelled settlements from the Golan prior
to the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These claims carry no grain of truth,'' he said, taking the
inflammatory step of citing the memoirs of Moshe Dayan, the
legendary Israeli general, as proof: ``As Moshe Dayan himself
explained in his memoirs, it was the other side who insisted on
provoking the Syrians until they clashed together and then they
claimed that the Syrians are the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa also made it clear that the Syrians still wanted to
pick up negotiations where they felt they had been broken off in
1996. The Syrians maintain that Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli
prime minister, had promised that Israel would withdraw from the
full Golan Heights, down to the border of June 4, 1967. That, in
the Syrians' interpretation, extended to the shoreline of the Sea
of Galilee. The Israelis deny that this promise was ever made, and
dispute the interpretation of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these talks are to succeed as rapidly as we all desire, no
one should ignore what has been achieved until now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, al-Sharaa did embrace the idealism of peace,
which he said could not only end violence in the region but also
``usher in a dialogue of civilization and honorable competition in
various domains _ the political, cultural, scientific and
economic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And he also posed an intellectual question, as if he were
already reflecting backward from the vantage point of a resolved
conflict: Would the Israeli-Arab conflict be that which ``defined''
or ``frustrated'' Arab unity?
</P>
<P>
   In Israeli-Arab peace negotiations, there is often a good deal
of public posturing aimed at the audiences back home. Sometimes,
belligerent words mask real progress at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Al-Sharaa met for a total of just under two hours, but
never, as had been expected, without the Americans present. They
started in a trilateral meeting with Clinton in the Oval Office and
picked up again in a three-way meeting with Albright. The Israelis
and the Syrians agreed to let the White House speak publicly about
the very sensitive talks so as not to harm whatever progress was
made with public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, the presidential spokesman, said that in the meeting
with Clinton, both sides ``raised their positions and concerns
while acknowledging that the other side's concerns needed to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides made clear their desire for peace,'' he said. ``We
believe that this is an historic start. No one expected this to be
easy. The issues are complicated. It's not surprising that there
are real differences at this point, but both parties displayed a
serious intent. ''

IT'S STILL ROCK 'N' ROLL TO BILLY JOEL, BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR
SOMETHING MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 50, Billy Joel _ one of the most important and prolific
songwriters in pop music _ is ending one phase of his career and
beginning another.
</P>
<P>
   Joel's current tour, he promises, will be the last of its kind.
After this, the Long Island-born pianist will immerse himself in
writing (and possibly recording) classical music. On the phone from
Houston, Joel looks back at his 20-year-plus career and ponders the
future:
</P>
<P>
   Question: You've been playing pop music all your life. Won't it
be weird not doing it?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Uh-uh. I did it. I've been on the road since I was 21.
I've been in bands since I was 14. Now I'm 50. Some people have
said, `You're gonna go crazy.' I took seven months off once, and I
did not go crazy. What I did was compose, what I've always been
doing, but now I'm composing without a tour in mind. I'd like to
walk away before I get kicked out, and, I'm sorry, but some people
should get kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about rock 'n' roll is that it represents
hormonal expressions of younger people, rage and joy. Rock didn't
come from a bunch of old farts playing the same song over and over.
It's like being an athlete; you've had your day, it was a good
game, so maybe it's time to coach or write a book about it. Make
room for the newer people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have you changed over the years and how have you stayed
the same?
</P>
<P>
   A: I thought that when I turned 50, I'd start falling apart and
selling insurance. But I'm young at heart. Thank God I picked rock
'n' roll as a job, 'cause it keeps ya young. So I've stayed the
same in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   How I have changed? I've been married and divorced twice. My
daughter being born, that changed my life. My needs as an artist
have changed. Pop music has a strict orthodoxy to it. You can't be
too complicated. You can be experimental, but you can't be too
musical. I needed to branch out. I see it happening with a lot of
other people like me: Paul Simon, Sting, Bruce Springsteen. We
don't want our feet stuck in clay. I always go back to this great
Dylan lyric, ``He who is not busy learning is busy dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you have so many hits, do you feel pressure to deliver
greatest-hits shows? Ever wish you could play a bunch of obscure
stuff?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like the obscure stuff, but every time we try to do
something obscure, the audience is like `OK, thanks, next!' Way out
in the vast stretches of the nosebleed section, someone'll yell,
``Yeah!'' But the majority of people are not familiar with those
songs. You spent your money, you schlepped through the parking lot,
you bought a crummy T-shirt that's gonna fall apart and you're
sitting next to someone's who's smoking pot and throwing up all
over you and then, what, I'm gonna start playing a bunch of songs
you've never heard? I'd get pissed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A career high point?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I made ``The Nylon Curtain,'' which I consider my
masterpiece. And when we played what was still the Soviet Union,
back in the '80s. They went crazy. I don't think they gave a damn
who it was. We had a huge PA system, lights and staging, and we
blew their heads off. And I'm not exactly Nine Inch Nails, you
know; we played some ballads. But someone came up to me and said
that this was the most important event there since the Russian
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it bother you that some of your most popular work _ like
say ``Uptown Girl'' _ has overshadowed your best work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think about that all the time. But when I write, I just
write. Once in a while, I write something that's an obvious hit, a
jellybean I like to call them, and the record company goes, `Oh,
goody, goody.' It's easy for them to digest. But if I only knew
Billy Joel from his singles, I wouldn't like the guy. Thing is, my
songs were written to be placed next to other songs on an album. My
albums are like little musicals. ``Uptown Girl'' made sense in
context of that album, ``An Innocent Man,'' which was a tribute to
R&AMP;B of the '50s and '60s; the people who do know the other songs
have remained loyal to what we do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you play some songs live, like ``Just the Way You Are,''
are you thinking about what you were thinking about the day you
wrote them, or have they taken on new meaning over time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before a show, I can't eat anything. You're supposed to go
onstage hungry. So when I'm singing that, I'm thinking, `Don't go
changing,' hmmm, maybe I'll get a club sandwich, ``to try and
please me,'' no, but the fries will be too soggy, and I'd end up
losing concentration, so we put that song away for a while. That
was about ex 1. And then I got another divorce, and who the hell
wants to sing about her? But we're back to playing those songs and
I go back to that original emotion and what I do is, I'll see a
face in the crowd and I'll connect them with that lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you want to be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would like to be remembered as a writer. Rock star, that
has no meaning to me. Writing is the hard part, and it's the most
satisfying thing for me. But once I heard Beethoven, it made me
realize how insignificant I am.

100 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS REPORTED DEAD IN GROZNY FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the worst setback in Russia's three-month campaign
in the Caucasus, as many as 100 Russian soldiers were reported
killed in heavy street fighting in Chechnya's capital Grozny
Wednesday night as separatist fighters beat back an assault by
federal tanks and troops into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Grozny said rebel fighters surrounded an armored
column that had driven deep into the city center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Russian armored forces had tried to move
into central Grozny since federal troops encircled the city last
month in an effort to drive out an estimated 6,000 rebel fighters.
The attack came as a senior commander predicted that the city would
fall within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fighting indicated that the Russian commanders had
seriously underestimated the Chechens' ability to fight back,
repeating a mistake that dogged them throughout Moscow's 1994-1996
campaign that failed to defeat the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Russian officials have consistently ruled out a major
ground operation in Grozny, fearing the kind of heavy loss of life
which accompanied their troops' entry into captial at the start of
the last war.
</P>
<P>
   But reports Wednesday, which did not clarify the size of the
Russian offensive, nonetheless described a scene stunningly
reminiscent of the disastrous New Year's Eve assault on Grozny five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, seven Russian tanks and eight armored personnel
carriers managed to reach a square about a mile from the center of
Grozny. The square, nicknamed ``Minutka'' for a fast-food cafe that
was destroyed early in the last war, provided ample cover for the
ambushers and a clear shot at the tanks in a large, open rotary
surrounded by the ruins of concrete apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   News reports suggested that the Russian troops had wandered into
Minutka by mistake and were trapped there, making it easier for
some 2,000 rebel fighters in the square to attack the convoy with
their hand-held anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides fought a pitched battle lasting some three hours
and I saw more than 100 bodies of dead Russian soldiers after
arriving at the scene,'' wrote Reuters reporter Maria Eismont, a
veteran Russian war correspondent who covered the last war in
Chechnya. Other reports described light rebel casualties, and as
many as 15 Russian armored vehicles carriers ablaze in the center.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene Russian commanders had vowed not to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   But five years later, the campaign in Chechnya is commanded by
many of the same generals who fought the previous war. The Russian
commanders claim to have learned the lesson of the last war, and
had avoided contact on the ground while bombing Chechen positions
from afar.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Russian advance through the lowlands,
which has taken more than two months and cost the lives of at least
400 soldiers despite tactics designed to avoid casualties, has been
portrayed as a great victory by the military, politicians and much
of the Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have prevented most journalists from
entering Chechnya, and this week closed off the military staging
area in Mozdok to most foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Russian forces kept up their round-the-clock shelling
of Grozny, where an estimated 10,000 to 45,000 hungry, freezing
civilians are trapped by the fighting. An Associated Press reporter
described plumes of black smoke rising over the city's devastated
center as salvos of Russian shells hit home. Footage from the city
showed women civilians running to hide behind walls.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has backed away from an ultimatum that it would kill
everyone left in the city after last Saturday, vowing instead to
allow civilians to leave through two ``safe corridors'' it has set
up north and south of the city. Until Wednesday, most of the heavy
ground fighting had been in the east. But only some 2,500 civilians
have dared brave the constant barrage of Russian shells and aerial
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a top military official predicted that Grozny would
be taken in ``a matter of days.'' General Valery Manilov, first
deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, said Russian forces now
control 60 percent of Chechnya, and would take two to three months
to defeat the estimated 12,000 to 15,000 rebels throughout the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts like Alexander Golz of the news magazine Itogi
have been more circumspect, cautioning that the army would have to
eventually fight the rebels on the ground in Grozny. While few
analysts believe the outnumbered and outgunned rebels can hold out
in Grozny for long against the Russians' 100,000-member force, they
say Russia's command of the skies and long-range artillery would be
less of a factor in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollbaek, in the Caucasus as
head of the Organization of for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
called for talks between Russia and rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov.
But Moscow rejected the idea of talks with Maskhadov, who Russian
leaders say does not control rival rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, just hours before the unsuccessful advance into the
center, Manilov said that ``no massive strikes, no storms, no
assaults will take place ... as long as there is a single civilian
in Grozny.''

`ANNA' ALMOST REIGNS SUPREME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics are calling 1999 a great year for movies, largely
because of a string of films _ mostly fall releases _ made by
directors willing to break or reinvent the rules, and supported by
studios willing to gamble on those directors.
</P>
<P>
   But something remains to be said for good, old-fashioned,
traditional filmmaking, and ``Anna and the King'' delivers on that
level. It's a qualified success, the type of movie whose virtues
outnumber its flaws. But everyone involved appears to be aiming for
a romantic epic on the level of ``Titanic'' _ and ``Titanic'' had
more flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get past whatever preconceptions you have about the
story, which has been filmed three times previously (including an
awful animated ``King and I'' this year). It's a chestnut, this
tale about widowed, indepedent-minded British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens and her experiences in 1860s Siam, where she agrees to
educate the king's 68 children (by 26 wives). As in all the other
versions, cultures clash _ and romantic sparks fly.
</P>
<P>
   For the '90s, we've been given an even more forward-thinking
Anna and an even more progressive king. It was wise to cast Hong
Kong star Chow Yun-Fat as the king, and Chow is the movie's most
pleasant surprise. Best-known for action roles, Chow uses a mix of
wry condescension and guarded respect in his portrayal of the king,
who is tied to old ways even as he tries to become more ``modern.''
That Chow has knife-edged comic timing shouldn't come as a
surprise; he first made his name in Hong Kong as a comedy star.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder, though, if the filmmakers could get an Asian star
for the king, couldn't they get a British star _ or at least
Gwyneth Paltrow _ to play Anna? It's not that Jodie Foster
struggles with her British accent, it's that the accent doesn't
quite fit.
</P>
<P>
   Foster appears uncomfortable, as if her corset were cinched too
tightly. She plays her Anna with more facial tics than usual,
risking crossing over into Ally McBeal territory. She appears
slightly miscast.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone seems ideal for an adaptation of Politically Correct
Bedtime Stories, it's Anna and the King director Andy Tennant,
whose last film was the goofily anachronistic and oddly
entertaining ``Ever After'' _ which gave us a Cinderella and a
Prince Charming so '90s, you all but expected them to cram on
headphones and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant has grown as a director (he probably couldn't help it
after TV's ``The Amy Fisher Story''), but he and his screenwriters
can't resist occasional indulgences, such as an anti-king
conspiracy subplot that gives Chow a chance to prove that he can be
romantic and an action hero.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant has a talent for pageantry, and the movie is a triumph
of art direction, especially with the stunning, grandiose design of
the king's palace, which was replicated on a golf resort in
Malaysia. But Tennant too often lets the grandeur of the movie's
look do the work for him; ``Anna'' has moments that are static,
saved by other moments _ a banquet, an execution, the action-scene
climax _ that bring the movie to life. When Tennant is at his best,
he almost approaches David Lean levels of epic filmmaking, but he
doesn't have Lean's sustained passion.
</P>
<P>
   It's what keeps ``Anna'' from greatness. For someone whose movie
has what is reportedly the largest set since 1963's ``Cleopatra,''
Tennant lacks the commitment and confidence (arrogance, really)
that helped James Cameron steamroller past ``Titanic's'' hokey
script. ``Anna'' is fine holiday entertainment, but its art
direction aside, it's not the Oscar-bait it was rumored to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' is rated PG-13 for brief but fairly
graphic violent scenes.

   For the '90s, we've been given an even more forward-thinking
Anna and an even more progressive king. It was wise to cast Hong
Kong star Chow Yun-Fat as the king, and Chow is the movie's most
pleasant surprise. Best-known for action roles, Chow uses a mix of
wry condescension and guarded respect in his portrayal of the king,
who is tied to old ways even as he tries to become more ``modern.''
That Chow has knife-edged comic timing shouldn't come as a
surprise; he first made his name in Hong Kong as a comedy star.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder, though, if the filmmakers could get an Asian star
for the king, couldn't they get a British star _ or at least
Gwyneth Paltrow _ to play Anna? It's not that Jodie Foster
struggles with her British accent, it's that the accent doesn't
quite fit.
</P>
<P>
   Foster appears uncomfortable, as if her corset were cinched too
tightly. She plays her Anna with more facial tics than usual,
risking crossing over into Ally McBeal territory. She appears
slightly miscast.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone seems ideal for an adaptation of Politically Correct
Bedtime Stories, it's Anna and the King director Andy Tennant,
whose last film was the goofily anachronistic and oddly
entertaining ``Ever After'' _ which gave us a Cinderella and a
Prince Charming so '90s, you all but expected them to cram on
headphones and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant has grown as a director (he probably couldn't help it
after TV's ``The Amy Fisher Story''), but he and his screenwriters
can't resist occasional indulgences, such as an anti-king
conspiracy subplot that gives Chow a chance to prove that he can be
romantic and an action hero.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant has a talent for pageantry, and the movie is a triumph
of art direction, especially with the stunning, grandiose design of
the king's palace, which was replicated on a golf resort in
Malaysia. But Tennant too often lets the grandeur of the movie's
look do the work for him; ``Anna'' has moments that are static,
saved by other moments _ a banquet, an execution, the action-scene
climax _ that bring the movie to life. When Tennant is at his best,
he almost approaches David Lean levels of epic filmmaking, but he
doesn't hve Lean's sustained passion.
</P>
<P>
   It's what keeps ``Anna'' from greatness. For someone whose movie
has what is reportedly the largest set since 1963's ``Cleopatra,''
Tennant lacks the commitment and confidence (arrogance, really)
that helped James Cameron steamroller past ``Titanic's'' hokey
script. ``Anna'' is fine holiday entertainment, but its art
direction aside, it's not the Oscar-bait it was rumored to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' is rated PG-13 for brief but fairly
graphic violent scenes.

SYRIAN-ISRAELI TALKS GET OFF TO SHAKY START 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Syria and Israel opened a historic round of
high-level peace talks on a cool note Wednesday as President
Clinton sounded hopeful that the last serious dispute among
Arab-Israeli neighbors in the Middle East may finally be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Clinton's optimistic tone, the two days of talks
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa began with the two men refusing to shake
hands and al-Sharaa issuing a strong condemnation of the
32-year-old Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa charged that a half-million Syrians had been uprooted
from their homes in the region and their ancient villages ``wiped
out from existence.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed contempt for what he called efforts by the
Israelis ``to muster international sympathy'' for some 18,000
Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights who will have to leave their
homes if a peace agreement is signed. He said the suffering of
Syrians who lived there before the Israelis had been ``ignored'' by
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, speaking on behalf of ailing Syrian
President Hafez Assad, made it clear, however, that there would be
no agreement without a commitment by Israel to give up all of the
Golan Heights region it captured during the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return
of all its occupied land,'' al-Sharaa said. He added that in
exchange Syria is prepared to provide security guarantees that will
help end ``the psychological fear (of Arab military attacks), which
the Israelis have been living in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak delivered a conciliatory, terse statement himself,
alluding to ``the horrors of war'' endured by the Jewish state
since its creation in 1948. But Barak expressed his determination
to end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for all, saying that
Israel is ready ``to do whatever we can'' to reach an agreement
that will return the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for
normalized relations and security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he hoped ``this march together with our Syrian
partners'' will produce ``a different Middle East where nations are
living side by side in peaceful (relations) and in mutual respect
and good neighborliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa indicated his government was ready to deal as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching the moment of truth,'' al-Sharaa said at a
brief ceremony held in the White House Rose Garden. He said the
talks promise ``for the first time the dawn of a real hope to
achieve an honorable and just peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa's remarks on the occupation of the Golan Heights
angered the Israeli delegation and Clinton administration
officials. Zalman Shoval, Israel's ambassador to the United States,
called the tone of al-Sharaa's comments inappropriate for someone
who had come to Washington ``in the spirit of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton ignored the remarks, choosing to emphasize the
importance of bringing the two sides together for the first time
since lower-level negotiations between them broke down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing today is not yet peace, and getting
there will require bold thinking and hard choices,'' Clinton
acknowledged before al-Sharaa and Barak began their face-to-face
sessions at Blair House, a government guest residence across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the presidential mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today is a big step along that path. For the first time in
history, there is a chance of a comprehensive peace between Israel
and Syria, and indeed all its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also stressed the importance of a Syrian-Israeli
agreement not only to the Middle East region, but to the world as a
whole and the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned from experience that tensions in the region
can escalate, and the escalations can lead into diplomatic,
financial and, ultimately, military involvement _ far more costly
than even the costliest peace,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton conceded that there were no guarantees of success
going into the first round of meetings Wednesday, he said the fact
that the two sides are even talking again is an indication that
they may be ready to put aside their long history of hatred and
walk ``the road to peace'' together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be challenges along the way, but we have never had
such an extraordinary opportunity to reach a comprehensive
settlement,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed to meet in Washington following months of
diplomacy by the Clinton administration, which included numerous
visits to the region by U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Clinton also put
pressure on Assad and Barak in a series of phone calls in which he
sought to gauge what it would take for peace negotiations to resume
again between them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Clinton's pressure and timing paid off. Assad agreed
to send al-Sharaa to Washington after a meeting with Albright
earlier this month in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said a number of circumstances played a
key role in convincing Assad that the time for an agreement with
Israel is now.
</P>
<P>
   They said Assad recognized that the next U.S. president may not
be as free politically as Clinton is now in his last year in office
to push for an accord. In addition, they said Assad was also aware
that Barak, who has made it clear that he wants a deal with Syria
sooner rather than later, may be his best hope to win back the
territory lost to Israel 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These officials also noted that the aging Assad would like to
have the problem with Israel resolved before he dies or
relinquishes office. They said Syria's ailing economy also played a
key role in convincing Assad that he must try to normalize
relations to create more trade and other economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the two sides had made progress in talks four
years ago before they broke off was also cause for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   During those negotiations Israel all but promised the return of
the Golan Heights in exchange for specific security guarantees
aimed at preventing surprise military attacks. But there are still
a number of touchy differences that must be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Syria wants all the Golan Heights, including the
territory bordering the Sea of Galilee. But Israel relies on the
sea for water supplies, and is reluctant to give in to that demand.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also wants the Golan Heights demilitarized, and is
demanding that Assad pull his forces back to a point north of
Damascus. In addition, Israel wants to leave behind several Israeli
military ``listening posts'' to help protect its borders with Syria
and Lebanon. Syria has refused that request.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters after
the first day's talks concluded in the early evening that it would
``be wrong to minimize how difficult this is and how much hard work
needs to be done'' to resolve ``long-standing differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president laid out how he thinks we should move forward
and where we should get to by the end of the two days. But I'm just
not going to get into the specifics of what that might be,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are scheduled to resume Thursday.

   BUCHAREST, Romania _ What kind of man specializes in buying up
the tchotchkes of a Stalinist dictator who was prevented only by an
untimely rendezvous with a firing squad from holding the world's
tackiest yard sale?
</P>
<P>
   The kind of man whose name is Dr. Kassem Nour of Orlando, Fla.
Or Dr. Ru Ru of Bucharest, depending on which one of his business
cards he hands you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I have more than one name,'' he says reassuringly, fishing
out a second card when the first does not match the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Nour, or whatever, an affable man whose face can explode into a
carnival-poster smile at the approach of a camera, claims to own a
``Renoir that's not in any book'' and to have drunk cheap wine with
Salvador Dali, whose work he says he collected.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where he is from, he goes a little vague and spins
diverting family yarns. (His grandfather from Russia, a
better-late-than-never type, married at age 60, fathered 10
children by the age of 96, died age 106. Car crash. No, he wasn't
driving.)
</P>
<P>
   Nour is still childless at age 72, but evinces an obvious
appreciation for the fabled beauty of Romanian women even during
pauses while looking at the _ we will do best to call it ``stuff.''
As he and his translator play chess with one of many hand-carved
sets on sale, he makes a move: ``I love Romanian girls! I love
you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you,'' she replies, checking him with a
skepticism that sounds even better in a Transylvanian accent.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend saw the fourth of the continuing auctions of
stuff that once belonged to Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, who ruled
Romania from 1965 to 1989 with iron fists concealed in custom-made
deerskin gloves. For a few of those years they were the darlings of
the West for defying the Soviet Union over its invasion of
Czechoslovakia, and they had the Buicks given them by President
Nixon to prove it. (Not to mention a tie-tack key to the city of
Chattanooga, Tenn., inscribed ``Pat Rose, Mayor.'')
</P>
<P>
   In their latter years, after a trip to North Korea, they became
obsessed with building their cults of personality; they were barely
literate but styled themselves the Great Builder and Hunter (he)
and the Great Scientist (she) as well as the Beloved Comrades of
the People. They had all sorts of stuff to prove that: A yard-tall
wood amphora carved with their portraits, gift of a local party
chapter. A microscope and a model of an atom from local schools, to
aid Elena in her ``research.'' A 9-inch model of an oil well's
pressure valve. Rugs woven with their likenesses. (The editor of a
political humor magazine bought one so his staff could tread on
it.) Several sets of deer-butchering instruments with handles made
of stag horn. And a large set of cobalt blue china from Mikhail
Gorbachev, of which Nour is the proud owner, for $320.
</P>
<P>
   He also wears Ceausescu's sealskin coat, his gray Italian woven
leather shoes and his hats. ``They fit perfectly _ his head is like
my head,'' Nour said. ``The only difference is mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   These first four auctions have raised almost $700,000 for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Nour has bought about half the items. Asked about the source of
his income, he says he gave up life as a surgeon _ ``Where? Oh, I
operate everywhere _ America, Middle East ...'' _ to make a fortune
in marble and granite, and owns hotels in America and the Far East.
He is a bit vague about his plans for his purchases: ``I'm a
collector. I love, I love, I enjoy. I'm planning to do a museum.
They're more valuable if you keep them some time.''
</P>
<P>
   He seeks uniqueness first, but has an appraiser's eye: he
knocked down his potential bid for the amphora (floor price $500)
because it wasn't of one piece of wood. (It didn't sell.) He passed
on a Belgian cut-crystal vase because nothing about it said
``previously owned by tyrant.'' He bids higher if another household
name is attached _ the mother-of-pearl table from Yasser Arafat,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   He ignored big items like the aging yacht Snagov 2, which seats
57 but has not been gassed up in a decade. He was outbid for the
3,000-pound bronze bust of Nicolae. That went, for $26,000, to an
American who would not disclose what he planned to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably an American museum,'' said Monica Anghelovici, an
economist for the state protocol administration who helps with the
auctions because her English is fluent.
</P>
<P>
   What American museum, for Pete's sake? she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many wax museums in your country, so why should
there not be bronze museums?'' she said. ``In America, in my
opinion, anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Ceausescus had 41 residences to furnish, from ski
dachas to palaces, nothing was too mundane for them to save. One
item was described thus in the catalog, ``Round bowls of black
plastic, painted, with the inscription Niagara Falls.'' They sold
for $17. Average Romanians refer to the collection in terms that
would once have sent them to labor camps. But it was Miss
Anghelovici, perhaps speaking for the Romanian womanhood Nour so
ardently admires, who delivered the most damning assessment: ``In
my opinion, a man receives a gift as he is. I give something
special to someone who is special. And I give something stupid to
someone I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, she was asked, in this era of $30 million paintings wasn't
this sale entrusted to Sotheby's or Christie's, who are used to
moving hundreds of items quickly and could probably round up more
bidders than will trek to Bucharest? After all, Nour may be one of
a kind, but the collecting mania draws all types.
</P>
<P>
   (In the interests of full disclosure, it must be noted here that
this reporter unexpectedly discovered that he is one of those
types, and is now the dubiously proud owner of an engraved
ceremonial ax and the aforementioned oil-well thingy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Miss Anghelovici replied. ``We didn't think of
it. The government decides, and we just do what we are told.''
</P>
<P>
   Sic semper tyrannis, even in yard sales and only 7,000 items
left to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Certain actors seem haloed in heat, even in cold
climates. In the less than fiery new revival of Peter Shaffer's
``Amadeus,'' which opened Wednesday night at the Music Box Theater,
a 30-year-old Welshman named Michael Sheen projects the kind of
air-warping waves given off by blacktop in the August sun.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that in this popular drama's title role, that of
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Sheen is often in a state of manic motion;
it's that his body temperature would seem to be several degrees
higher than that of anyone else on stage. Watching him trace
Shaffer's conception of a child prodigy grown up into prodigious
childishness, you start to appreciate the derivation of the term
star. This actor is so luminous it's scary.
</P>
<P>
   New York theatergoers whose memories extend to 1980 might recall
a similarly solar performance by another British actor, then little
known in the United States, in the very same play. His name was Ian
McKellen, and his role was not that played by Sheen in the current
production, which has been directed (as was the original version)
by the stage-savvy Peter Hall.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen portrayed Antonio Salieri, Mozart's politically astute
contemporary, rival and, the play has it, nemesis. That part has
now been taken on by David Suchet, an accomplished actor who simply
doesn't have it in him to blaze, at least not on this occasion.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, this leads to a seismic shift in the work's
center. Though one regrets to say it, it's mostly for the worse. In
spinning a tale from historical gossip previously given dramatic
life in Aleksandr Pushkin's playlet and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera,
both titled ``Mozart and Salieri,'' Shaffer had the inspired idea
of measuring genius through its impact on an artist who would never
possess it.
</P>
<P>
   Originally produced in London in 1979 with Paul Scofield as
Salieri, the drama was translated into an Oscar-winning 1984 movie
directed by Milos Forman and starring F. Murray Abraham. On the
stage and on film, ``Amadeus'' belonged squarely to Salieri, a man
cancerous with envy and at war with the God who has denied him the
gifts he so covets.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is said that Roman Polanski's Mozart ran away with the
play in European productions some years ago, this is the first
``Amadeus'' I've seen that lets its title character take over
altogether. It could be argued that this is yet another instance of
divine injustice. Poor old Salieri; he doesn't even have a play to
call his own anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly a consequence of Shaffer's having rethought
Salieri's character over the last two decades and decided that the
fellow had too much of the melodrama villain about him. In this
rewritten ``Amadeus'' Salieri has a louder conscience, and it leads
him to a new scene of openly expressed contrition. Unfortunately,
this takes place in the presence of Sheen's Mozart, who by now is
looking into the chasm of his imminent death with such raptness
that it's hard to pay attention to what Suchet is saying.
</P>
<P>
   Known to television audiences as Agatha Christie's self-admiring
Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, Suchet keeps swagger to a minimum
here, substituting arch glances to the audience that signal the
play's copious ironies. His Salieri is basically the awed onlooker,
a witness to the ineffable brilliance of a younger man lacking the
Machiavellian skills for survival in courtly Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   He often comes across as something like a docent in a museum, a
smoother variation on the tourist-deceiving heroine of Shaffer's
``Lettice and Lovage,'' though with far less sense of drama.
Salieri becomes a lens through which the audience perceives Mozart,
like the proverbial cats looking at a king.
</P>
<P>
   This might work better if Salieri didn't have pages-long
monologues in which he charts the rise and fall of his and Mozart's
fortunes. All the same, the shivery thrill of ``Amadeus''
traditionally came from letting a man who fashions himself as the
patron saint of mediocrities finally assume star status. Salieri at
last has his chance to strut and fret his hour (well, closer to
three hours) upon the stage, and he is determined to make the most
of it, starting with his introductory invocation to summon the
audience as his confessors.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's staging plays with the crowd-baiting audacity of this
conceit, right down to having the audience reflected in the mirrors
of William Dudley's set of ghostly scrims and reflective surfaces,
underscored by Paule Constable's crepuscular lighting. Yet there is
also an aura of anticlimax throughout. It's evident even in the use
of recorded Mozart music (overseen by Matt McKenzie), which has an
intrusive abruptness when it should bleed seamlessly into the
fabric of the production.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondingly, Suchet repeatedly passes on opportunities for
coups de theatre. The transformation of the aged Salieri of the
play's beginning into a robust 31-year-old is underplayed into near
nonexistence. The scene where Salieri, examining scores by Mozart,
swoons in reaction to their compositional brilliance _ rendered as
a Miltonian fall by McKellen _ is here a plebeian thud.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing remotely plebeian about Sheen's Mozart. Shaffer
has drawn noisy criticism for representing Mozart as a
scatological, foulmouthed, father-obsessed creep with a hyena
cackle. Yet Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role, an
undulating pattern of shock-provoking goonishness and abject
apology that lends a connecting air of compulsion to Mozart's
spontaneous art and bad behavior. (Think John McEnroe acting out on
a tennis court.)
</P>
<P>
   It is not, however, a good sign when you find yourself marking
the minutes when an actor isn't onstage, and there are long
stretches unblessed by Sheen's presence. David McCallum (fondly
remembered as the coolest sidekick of 1960s television in ``The Man
from U.N.C.L.E.'') offers a splendidly droll portrait of royal
fatuity as the Emperor Joseph II, and Cindy Katz brings a
refreshing earthiness and pragmatism to Constanze, Mozart's wife, a
part usually played as a fluffy, empty-headed kitten.

 NEW YORK: empty-headed kitten.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the representation of double-dealing politics in imperial
Austria starts to seem labored and repetitive without a volcanic
Salieri to raise the emotional stakes. Scale down Salieri's
villainy, and you sacrifice the guilty satisfactions of watching
just how evil banality can be.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, however, to imagine anyone not shrinking into the
shadows before the white-hot Mozart of Sheen, who recently scored a
critical triumph in London in John Osborne's ``Look Back in
Anger.'' The perspiration that bedews him here as his character
slides toward his early grave has the look of glitter, just as in
his earlier scenes the glittering embroidery on his jacket (also
designed by Dudley) seems as organic as sweat. Attention producers:
if you're looking for someone to give physical credence to the
romantic idea of the flame that consumes itself, Sheen is
definitely your man.

SYRUPY `BICENTENNIAL MAN' DEPICTS AN ODDLY LIFELESS TOMORROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, critics commonly complained that Robin
Williams was too manic _ that his performances in movies such as
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' were merely extensions of his hyperactive
offscreen persona. Williams' latest movie, ``Bicentennial Man,'' is
the latest in a long line of films that shows that these critics
should have been more careful what they wished for. Once our most
irrepressible actor, Williams has come full circle to being one of
our most repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' restraint follows a curious path in ``Bicentennial
Man;'' although he's playing a robot who wants to become more
human, as he starts looking more human, he acts more like a robot.
Williams spends much of the movie under heavy robot makeup, with
soulful eyes and a pleasant half-smile that make him look like a
grown-up Teletubby. When Andrew, his robot character, finally gets
a human face, he looks in the mirror with curiosity and subdued
pleasure. Williams does a nice little bit of nonverbal acting in
this scene, but instead of using it as a launching pad for bigger
things, he stays at the same level, like a TV remote that's stuck
on one volume setting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is because Andrew is merely imitating the humans
around him. Director Chris Columbus has everyone in the cast speak
solemnly, as if ``Bicentennial Man'' were the utmost in profundity
instead of a regurgitation of every Data plot on ``Star Trek: The
Next Generation'' (that it's based on an old Isaac Asimov story
doesn't make it any less familiar). Andrew is adopted by the
Martins, who treat him as half-servant, half-pet, and say he's
``one of the family'' just as people say that about their poodles
and tabbies. Andrew bonds with Mr. Martin (Sam Neill) and the
youngest Martin, whom he calls Little Miss (''Pepsi girl'' Hallie
Kate Eisenberg _ can a human be a product placement?), but works
less well with Mrs. Martin (Wendy Crewson) and sullen older child
``Miss'' (Lindze Letherman), who nearly breaks Andrew by making him
jump out a window. Maybe she's just upset that her role is so
underwritten; she all but disappears from the movie after this
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew spends several generations with the Martin family, and
their treatment of him _ and his fondness for Little Miss and,
later, her look-alike granddaughter Portia (Embeth Davidtz,
handling a dual role by doing a Julia Roberts impersonation) _
fuels his desire to be more human. This, too, is curious, because
the Martins seldom interact with one another and barely interact
with the rest of the human race; when the parties and weddings
occur over the course of this movie's 200-year period, the guests
are such filler, it's as if they were removed from storage. Nobody
in the movie acts particularly human; people rarely raise their
voice or interrupt anyone. This is Columbus' fault; maybe he
thought he cast the movie with robots.
</P>
<P>
   Saying ``Bicentennial Man'' isn't for cynics is an
understatement on a par with saying a car isn't for cliff-diving.
It's not just that the movie takes itself so seriously, or that
it's so sentimental that you could pour it over a stack of waffles.
It's the movie's impossibly idyllic vision of the future. It's a
future in which, the early attempted robotocide excepted, the worst
thing anyone does is act a little rude. A future in which Aretha
Franklin and George Gershwin songs still exist from the past (the
Celine Dion tune that plays over the closing credits won't be so
lucky). A future that's impossibly clean; not only is there no
pollution or litter, but even the beaches and deserts look as if
they've been swept by robots. It's a future that's airbrushed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a future in which all countries from the 20th century
remain intact, and the president is an African-American woman
(Lynne Thigpen) _ which wouldn't bear noting, except that the
outside world is startlingly lacking in racial diversity,
especially in terms of giving any other minority characters
speaking roles. The metaphors of Andrew's journey _ how he's a
slave who longs to be free, and then longs to be considered equal _
are mired in the movie's sap, which conceals the offensiveness of
its preaching about equality while doling out only token parts to
nonwhite actors.
</P>
<P>
   Many people might let this pass because the movie is so sweet
and gentle (which makes its occasional lapses into sexual and potty
humor an extremely uncomfortable fit), and because it looks great.
This is the second Robin Williams movie in a year and a half _
after 1998's ``What Dreams May Come'' _ in which he's upstaged by
the production design. The extraordinarily clean cities, with their
flying cars, stunning bridges and incredibly tall matte-painting
skyscrapers, look like the best parts of a travel-agency brochure
for the future. Much will be made of this movie's makeup effects,
used prodigiously to depict the characters' aging. But the makeup
is too carefully parceled out _ for instance, as the initial
Martins age, their temples gray in the exact same spots, at the
exact same pace.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Patch Adams,'' Williams' button-pushing effort from last
Christmas, ``Bicentennial Man'' will divide audiences in the way,
say, that a Celine Dion song does; millions will fall for it, while
millions of others will ignore it or plug their ears.
``Bicentennial Man'' is at least less of a screed than ``Patch
Adams;'' unlike ``Patch,'' it never harangues you, because it's too
polite. It's so nice that it's tempting not to hold too much
against it, even though it tells you exactly when to laugh and when
to cry. You can see why audiences, stressed from work or school or
too much Christmas shopping, will flock to a movie that does all
the work for them. Which means that whatever you think of
``Bicentennial Man'' as entertainment, at least it's doing its job
as public service.

content.

VENEZUELAN VOTERS APPROVE NEW CONSTITUTION GIVING PRESIDENT
SWEEPING POWERS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ For the fourth time in a year, Venezuelan
voters have eagerly endorsed President Hugo Chavez's promise of a
``peaceful revolution,'' voting overwhelmingly on Wednesday in
favor of a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter gives Chavez sweeping powers that he says he
will use to transform the country's political and social structure
but which the opposition predicts the president will use to to give
himself near-dictatorial powers.
</P>
<P>
   According to partial official results announced on Wednesday
evening, 71 percent of voters cast their ballots for the new
constitution. As that tally was announced, fireworks were set off
in neighborhoods all over the capital, and supporters of the
president took to the streets to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution, drawn up by an assembly in which
supporters of the president hold more than 90 percent of the seats,
increases Chavez's term of office from five years to six and allows
him to succeed himself. It also eliminates one chamber of Congress,
reduces civilian control of the military and significantly expands
government management of the economy, which is based on the largest
reserves of oil outside the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a 45-year-old former army colonel who was jailed after
leading an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, was elected president
a year ago this month. His platform called for junking the 1961
Constitution, which he dismissed as ``moribund,'' and replacing it
with a new charter that he said would eliminate corruption and
strengthen democracy by weakening the 40-year stranglehold on power
of the country's two traditional political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In April, voters approved Chavez's proposal to authorize a
National Constituent Assembly to draw up a new constitution. In
another round of balloting in July, they elected 131 delegates to
the body, which convened in August and, after spending its first
month trying to supplant Congress and the courts, drafted a text
with 350 articles in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's resounding victory means that virtually every feature
of the political structure here will undergo a change, beginning
with Venezuela's name. Once the new charter goes into effect, the
country will officially be known as the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, a modification that reflects the president's admiration
for the life and ideals of Simon Bolivar, the 19th-century
liberator of South America for whom Bolivia is also named.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shape of the new order that voters approved on
Wednesday is clear, the timetable for its installation is less so.
The Constituent Assembly's mandate expires on Feb. 3, but Chavez
said on Tuesday that the existing opposition-controlled Congress
would be dissolved immediately, with the constitutional panel
exercising legislative functions until new elections are held
sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now comes the good part,'' said Allan Brewer Carias, a
prominent lawyer here who is one of a handful of opposition members
of the Constitutional Assembly. ``Nothing is defined and anything
is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, economic analysts have said that passage of the
constitution is likely to discourage foreign investment and
accelerate capital flight. Nearly $4 billion is estimated to have
left Venezuela since Chavez took office last February, largely
offsetting the windfall his government has enjoyed as a result of
the spectacular increase in the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also said on Tuesday that he wants elections to choose
the new Congress and pick governors and mayors to be held ``as soon
as possible,'' which he defined as ``during the first quarter'' of
2000. He said he would also stand for election, thereby creating
the possibility that he could remain in power for a total of 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Venezuelan economy contracted by nearly 10 percent
during the first half of this year, Chavez's supporters have been
patient, willing to accept his promises that things would improve
once the new system he wanted was in place. With that achieved, he
will now face pressure to deliver a quick improvement in living
standards and economic opportunities for the three-quarters of
Venezuela's 23 million people who are mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is a time bomb that can explode at any moment,
tick-tock, tick-tock,'' he warned during a news conference on
Tuesday. ``It is our task, through the power of the vote, to defuse
it now, while there is still time.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain in most parts of the country, which led to mudslides
and flooding and the deaths of more than a dozen people, appear to
have held down Wednesday's turnout. Less than half of nearly 11
million eligible voters cast ballots. The balloting, however,
appears to have been orderly and with few complaints of
irregularities.

NOT SIMPLY SIAM IN `ANNA AND THE KING'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Embargoed until Friday, Dec. 17) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You just wanted to make a nice, slightly epic family
entertainment. You wanted to adjust a proven, beloved story's
somewhat retrograde racial and sexual politics to more enlightened
attitudes, sincere in your conviction not to offend. You got
America's most respected actress and Asia's hottest leading man in
the main roles.
</P>
<P>
   What could possibly go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Well, lots in the case of ``Anna and the King.'' This fourth
movie version of the popular cross-cultural romantic adventure
(first filmed in 1946 as ``Anna and the King of Siam'' with Irene
Dunne and Rex Harrison, then in the 1956 adaptation of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's musical ``The King and I'' with Deborah Kerr and Yul
Brynner, most recently as a kiddie cartoon ``King and I'' released
earlier this year) stars Jodie Foster as plucky English widow Anna
Leonowens and Hong Kong action icon Chow Yun-Fat as the visionary
19th-century Siamese ruler King Mongkut.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it's not the most flattering portrait of the
controversial Leonowens, a woman whose own accounts of her sojourn
in the court of Siam are considered highly suspect. But the chance
to reveal her personality warts was precisely what drew Foster to
the demanding part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna did a lot of exaggerating about her background _ that we
all know,'' Foster acknowledges, ``which was understandable since,
like everybody else in Victorian times, she wanted to appear to be
of better standing than she was. In terms of what she did, though,
I think she was pretty true in everything that she said. It's just
that her interpretation of things was quite exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a little self-important _ and quite hyperbolic in her
descriptions of things. I think that made her more complicated and
interesting; she was just trying to figure out how to survive with
a little kid and no money at a time when women barely went outside
the house, let alone traveled 6,000 miles to a country where she
didn't even speak the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was by no means perfect and by no means nice nor without
bitterness. And she was very judgmental, very opinionated; and even
she herself admitted that she was way too pushy. So, maybe the
difference between my version and the Deborah Kerr-Irene Dunne
versions is, in this era, we can actually create female characters
that change, that start off having a lot to learn and, by the end
of the movie, find their softness.''
</P>
<P>
   Like previous dramatic incarnations of the story, the latest
``Anna'' is founded on Leonowens' memoirs of her stint teaching
Western knowledgee to Mongkut's 58 children. But while the
Harrison-Dunne version drew heavily from Margaret Landon's highly
romanticized book on the subject, the new film's screenplay,
credited to Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes and extensively
rewritten by director Andy Tennant (``Ever After''), was more
informed by independent research.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Tennant and company tried mightily to present
Mongkut and Victorian-era Siam in an accurate and respectful
manner, they couldn't overcome the Thai government's long-standing
resentment of Hollywood's previous attempts to tell the story. Many
Thais have disliked the idea of Caucasian Harrison impersonating
one of their most venerated monarchs. And even though Brynner's
mysterious lineage likely included Asian ancestors, Thais
considered his performance as Mongkut insultingly clownish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extensive negotiations with Bangkok officials for
permission to film on authentic locations, Tennant and company
ultimately had to move the production to neighboring Malaysia _
where the Siamese royal palace and other important sets had to be
built from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Thailand's biggest objection to the project was that
we were making it,'' Tennant jokes, not playfully. ``They still
haven't recovered from `The King and I,' they are so offended by
it. As we went in and began talking to officials, I was incredibly
sympathetic to their objections. Once you learn the true story of
King Mongkut, you realize that he wasn't the barbaric buffoon that
he'd been painted as in that movie, who had to be rescued and tamed
by a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he was a monk for 30 years, and he handled tremendous
problems during his reign. Yet, he was the only ruler to maintain
his country's independence during all the partitioning of Southeast
Asia during the European colonizing period. So he was a really
remarkable man, and we kept saying that that's the story we wanted
to tell. But they also believe that their king is a god, so
anything in our script that made the king human was objectionable.
We finally ran out of time and patience and moved to Malaysia,
which made the movie more expensive. But we were going to make it
anyway, so in the end, I think, it was Thailand's loss.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a boon, however, to the then-depressed Malaysian
economy. For their set, Tennant and production designer Luciana
Arrighi, who won an Academy Award for her work on ``Howards End,''
had to virtually reproduce the 1860s Siamese palace on the back end
of a golf course. The largest single movie set built since
``Cleopatra'' nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox in the early '60s,
Tennant's palace not only dwarfed the real royal compound _ Chow
contends that his kingly estate is four times as large as the
current one in Bangkok _ but it had to be as practical as possible,
not just present a glittery facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to build interiors and exteriors, since we didn't have
any soundstages,'' Tennant explains. ``And we also wanted to be
able to have the access to take somebody in and out of doorways in
the same shot. And it all had to be made out of marble; it had to
be practical because it rained every day for two hours. When (Fox
executive) Bill Mechanic came to see the set, he wanted to know why
there was 4,000 square feet of marble, why we didn't just paint it.
Then it started to rain, and he saw why.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon precipitation was hardly the only physical
inconvenience. Temperatures on the equatorial peninsula regularly
reached 120 degrees, bugs Tennant describes as ``big as Miami''
abounded, an encephalitis outbreak was taking lives throughout the
vicinity (though no one involved with the production was stricken),
and the $75 million production was always mere days in back of its
ambitious construction schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that leading lady Foster had recently given
birth and had her little boy, Charles, with her the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult working circumstance, but he had a
great time,'' reports Foster, the former child star (``Taxi
Driver'') and double Academy Award winner (``The Accused,'' ``The
Silence of the Lambs''). ``He went to butterfly farms, we took him
in the water, so it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   While not as great for someone who was wrapped up in voluminous
Victorian dresses for most of the sweltering shoot, Foster hasn't
earned her reputation as one of Hollywood's best-liked superstars
by complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the actor's condition,'' she says with a shrug.
``You're either wearing a mink coat in the middle of summertime, or
a bikini in winter. It was hard, but we all agreed that it was
better than doing a movie like `Gorky Park,' where you're supposed
to be in Russia in the middle of winter at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the Asia of the past but with the sensibilities of
today was, as mentioned, as vital a part of ``Anna's'' atmosphere
as the physical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got a better color tone than Yul Brynner's,'' jokes
Chow, a highly versatile leading man who's primarily known in the
West for his work in John Woo's violent crime films, ``The Killer''
and ``Hard-Boiled.'' ``And even though the actors in the two older
movies tried very hard to imitate the Thai people's manner of
speaking, it was easier for me because I already have a thick Asian
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might have inferred from Chow's apolitical description,
he shares none of the Thai people's distaste for ``The King and
I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it!'' he says. ``I like the music, I like the chemistry
between Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr. And from what I've heard, the
Thai royal family loves it, too. It's just the film-board people
who don't want any damage done to the royal name and image.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chow is a citizen of Westernized Hong Kong, ``Anna's''
second-billed Asian actor, Bai Ling, hails from the highly
politicized People's Republic of China. But she, too, finds nothing
racist in ``The King and I,'' let alone in the new production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roots are the same as Thailand's, based in Buddhism,''
says Bai (``Red Corner,'' ``Wild Wild West''). ``And the royal
systems were kind of the same, too. I didn't find `King and I'
offensive at all; in fact, I thought it was quite lovely. And while
Yul Brynner could sometimes be cruel and dangerous, his childlike
innocence I found very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the Thai complaints are based on. Such
sensitivity has already produced some sniping at ``Anna''; Chow's
sword style is being called too Chinese, not Siamese.
</P>
<P>
   Localized controversy over ``Anna'' will, at least, be good
training for Foster. Her next two film projects threaten to be
international lightning rods.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a fuss over ``Hannibal,'' the ``Silence of the
Lambs'' sequel that's scared off director Jonathan Demme. Foster
denies recent reports that she won't make the sequel if her
character, FBI agent Clarice Starling, joins her demented
benefactor Hannibal Lecter in cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   But she hasn't committed to the project, either, and it's
already in pre-production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to make a sequel for 10 years,'' Foster says with
apparent enthusiasm. ``We're dying to do it, Tony Hopkins and
myself. But I think all of us love these characters so much that we
want to make sure the sequel is as good _ or, at least, almost as
good _ as the original, that it really grows on the premise that
(the source novels' author) Thomas Harris and we created. Clarice
has a really strong and very specific personality; I know exactly
what she would and wouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more alarming than the prospect of a flesh-eating Clarice
is Foster's plan to star in a movie biography of Leni Riefenstahl,
the admired and reviled genius of Nazi cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a cautionary tale,'' Foster enthuses, fully aware that
even the most critical portrait of Riefenstahl will anger many,
``about the brightest career in female filmmaking, by far, but
hopefully a movie that people will learn what not to do from. The
big challenge will be to get it right, and that's what scares a lot
of people about it. I feel like there are a lot of things I don't
know, but one thing I feel really confident about is my ability to
navigate complicated moral terrain. But it's going to be a hard
job, and I'm going to be very alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of puts tangling with overly cautious Thai officials in
perspective, doesn't it? At least the makers of ``Anna and the
King'' can be confident that the fundamental romance of their story
has overcome all criticism for nearly a century and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those enduring love stories, in fantasy,'' Tennant
notes. ``The fact that everyone out there has fallen in love with
somebody they can't have, for whatever noble reason, makes movies
like this and `Casablanca' endure. Rick and Ilsa still aren't
together, and the beauty of Anna and Mongkut's characters is that
they both do the right thing for the country. So many times, in our
own lives, we're selfish and we don't make the right sacrifices, so
it's actually fun to see a movie where people actually struggle for
the greater good.'' &QL;

TEXAS A&AMP;M BONFIRE EXCEEDED HEIGHT LIMIT, MEMOS INDICATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the time of its collapse, the Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire was 19 feet
taller than it should have been and would have dwarfed a
university-imposed height limit by the time it was finished,
according to internal memos released by the university Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonfire stood at 59 feet before it toppled Nov. 18, killing
12 and injuring 27 people on the College Station campus, according
to measurements taken from marks on the center pole.
</P>
<P>
   Because students were on the fourth of five tiers of logs, the
structure should only have been 40 feet tall at the time of the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The students planned to extend the Bonfire an additional 9 feet
with the fifth tier of logs making it 68 feet tall at completion.
The university had set a maximum height for the Bonfire at 55 feet
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our structural engineers in the course of their work
will be very interested in that,'' said Leo Linbeck Jr., chairman
of the commission investigating the cause of the Bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Linbeck said the five-member Special Commission on the 1999
Aggie Bonfire would look at much more than just the height of the
Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing the very best I can not to jump to conclusions as to
what caused the collapse,'' said Linbeck, chairman of a
Houston-based commercial construction corporation that bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   It was the responsibility of Bonfire adviser Rusty Thompson to
make sure students did not exceed the height limit of 55 feet,
according to university memos. Thompson was supposed to mark the
center pole, which supported the Bonfire, to let students know
where to stop building, according to a 1986 memo written by
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Bill Kibler.
</P>
<P>
   Phones calls made to the homes and offices of Kibler and
Thompson were not returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen and
Thompson said the Bonfire stack was 40 feet high when it
collapsed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It was by measuring marks on the center pole that John A.
Weese, an A&AMP;M professor of mechanical engineering, determined the
height of the Bonfire at its collapse. Weese is the university's
liaison to the commission Linbeck chairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to measuring marks on the center pole, Weese
interviewed the students who worked on the Bonfire, according to
the memo he prepared for the commission. Weese's memo was among the
hundreds of historical and contemporary documents related to the
Bonfire released by the university Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weese's memo, the first Bonfire tier was 18 feet
high; the second was 16 feet; the third 14 feet; and the fourth 11
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonfire collapse was the worst on-campus disaster in Texas
A&AMP;M history. Eleven of the dead were current students; one was a
recent graduate. Of the 27 injured, only freshman John Comstock,
19, of Richardson, remains hospitalized. He is in critical
condition at the College Station Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The height of the Bonfire was long a concern for campus
administrators, internal documents indicate. The tradition of
building massive Bonfires to rally students before the annual clash
between Texas A&AMP;M and the University of Texas football teams dates
back to 1909.
</P>
<P>
   A height limit of 55 feet was established more than 20 years ago
by then Vice President of Student Affairs John Koldus because
students were striving to build taller and taller Bonfires. The
tallest Bonfire ever built was 109 feet in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, University Health and Safety Officer Harry Stiteler Jr.
recommended the Bonfire be limited to no more than 45 feet high to
further improve safety. The suggestion was rejected that same year
because there had never been a problem with the Bonfire at 55 feet
and diminishing its size might cause an uproar among students,
Kibler's memo to Stiteler indicated.

STANDING UP TO CENSORS, MEXICAN FILM FINDS ITS VOICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An advertisement he read in the morning newspaper
made Luis Estrada, a Mexican film director, feel that his darkest
anxiety dream had become real.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was for the opening that same day of a movie, his movie.
It was opening at midday with no party and no fanfare at two small
art cinemas in Mexico City. He had not been invited. He had not
even been told.
</P>
<P>
   The semi-clandestine release on Dec. 3 of Estrada's latest film,
``La Ley de Herodes'' (``Herod's Law''), was part of a campaign by
the government's national film agency to bury it. The film gives a
comic but bald portrayal of the corruption of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has controlled Mexico for decades,
calling the party by its name for the first time in a Mexican
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The national film agency, the Mexican Cinema Institute, financed
most of the film and at first approved it. But officials there
apparently began to fear that its release in the heat of the
current presidential campaign, in which the long-ruling party is
facing serious competition, might annoy some top national brass.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Estrada's nightmare faded. Eduardo Amerena, the head
of the institute, was dismissed last week for what a senior culture
official called ``erratic behavior.'' The agency sold its $900,000
stake in the movie to Estrada on very soft terms, so he can release
it again exactly as he pleases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censorship no longer exists in the political lexicon of
Mexico,'' declared Rafael Tovar y de Teresa, Mexico's top culture
official. Happily for Estrada, the scandal heightened public
anticipation of the film.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also drew attention to the recent revival of
Mexican movie-making, in which a younger generation of directors
and producers, including Estrada, 37, are restoring the vitality
and momentum to an industry that had seemed virtually paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The first jolt of new life was felt in June with the release of
Antonio Serrano's ``Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas'' (``Sex, Shame and
Tears''). The movie played for six months in theaters around the
country and drew 5.4 million viewers, making it the most popular
Mexican film ever screened here. (It ranks third behind ``Titanic''
and Disney's ``Tarzan'' for the most-watched film over all.) The
film grossed $12.7 million at the box office, a staggering amount
for this country, and cost only $1.4 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas'' offered Mexico's urban middle class
the equivalent of a Woody Allen movie. Shot largely in interiors in
two Mexico City apartment buildings, it reveals the frenetic
romantic microenvironment of six young Mexicans. Serrano, who has
worked in theater but recently oversaw two successful nighttime
television soap operas, gave the film the unvarnished, episodic
look and feel of television drama.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a panorama of Latin angst with comic flourishes in
the style of the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, has a little
something for every modern-day Mexican: adultery, impotence, lust,
self-loathing. The men are either smooth-talking and macho, or
brooding misfits, and the women battle their dependence on the men.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano, who also wrote the screenplay, captured the shrill
thrust and parry of discourse between the sexes here, and audiences
laughed uproariously.
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Ehrenberg, the producer, said the film benefited from
strategic marketing. The cast was carefully selected to include
actors associated with both of Mexico's national television
networks, so neither one refused to carry advertising for the
movie. The film's pop theme song by the singer Aleks Syntek was on
the radio when the film reached the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been such heavy pessimism among Mexican
filmmakers,'' Ehrenberg said. ``But the problem was that we were
making films that had nothing to do with the public. Our public
wants to see films that show their own lives in their own
language.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, which lasted through the 1970s, the Mexican film
industry was sustained by the government and produced more than 100
movies a year for an avid national following. But as a series of
economic crises over 15 years cut into resources, the films veered
toward vulgar farce or difficult director's statements, both
unappealing to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now a generation of independent-minded filmmakers, raised in the
industry but with little allegiance to the state system, have come
into their own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking in the new crop is ``Un Embrujo,'' or
``Under a Spell,'' directed by Carlos Carrera, 37. The film,
released in March, is a coming-of-age story about an adolescent boy
during the political backlash of the postrevolutionary 1920s. His
sexual initiation by a lonely schoolteacher leads to a lifelong
passion for her, until both fall victim to a hex by disapproving
Mayan townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the arrival of several Oscar-winning foreign
movies, the movie failed to take off with Mexican audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Another film, set in tropical southern Mexico, ``Santitos''
(``Little Saints''), did much better. The movie, directed by a
newcomer, Alejandro Springall, 33, with some financial help from
the director John Sayles, is an allegory about a young, very devout
Roman Catholic woman who cannot accept the sudden death of her
teenage daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by her patron saint, she embarks on a journey to find the
girl. The journey takes her to hellish dens of sin in Tijuana and
Los Angeles, to the discovery of her own sensuality and finally
into the arms of an angel, or at least a pure-hearted Mexican
wrestler dressed up as one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recovering our rhythm,'' said Bertha Navarro, a producer
of ``Under A Spell.'' ``We had gone 15 years without a sustained
presence of Mexican films in our theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican filmmakers still depend on the government for a good
part of their financing, and that can mean long bureaucratic and
sometimes political battles. For Estrada, the struggle to resist
censorship was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   The director says he made ``Herod's Law'' as a cri de coeur
against the political system. ``I made it out of exhaustion,'' he
said. ``My grandfather and my father both suffered under the same
regime. Now I have two children, and I don't want them to be
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, set in 1949, tells a blunt tale of a small-town
politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party who
discovers that graft, extortion and even political murder can all
pay handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said officials at the national film agency allowed him
complete freedom to make the film, then balked at the result,
especially the final portrait of impunity. They tried to persuade
him to postpone its release until after the presidential elections
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But major private distributors liked the ruckus the film
created, and several have approached Estrada about releasing it in
Mexico. That will give him a chance to see whether moviegoers who
protested the attempt to stifle distribution will also want to see
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be famous,'' Estrada said. ``I want my movie
to be famous.''

NASDAQ EAST: HIGH-TECH ISSUES BOOM ON ASIA'S STOCK MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ It's beginning to look a lot like NASDAQ on Asia's
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there are few dot-com companies to speak of.
Fever over anything to do with the growth of the Internet has
spread to this part of the world, fueling a boom in stocks of
electronics and telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rush into high-technology Asian stocks
appears to lie in NASDAQ's record-setting jumps this month. A
technology-led rally in Singapore pushed the benchmark Straits
Times index up 8 percent to record highs. Mirrored in Hong Kong and
Seoul, the trend was repeated within a week in markets in Kuala
Lumpur and Bangkok. Even some telecommunications stocks in
Indonesia appear to be swept up in the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about anything other than tech, investors just
aren't interested,'' said Chang Chiew Yee, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ has also shown it can pull Asian stocks down.
Reacting to the 2.36 percent retreat in the NASDAQ on Tuesday, the
Straits Times index fell 1.68 percent Wednesday, the benchmark
index in Hong Kong fell 2.81 percent, and the Seoul index fell 3.90
percent. For the year, however, they all show strong performances,
comparable to the 63 percent advance in the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's markets have long responded reflexively to big moves on
Wall Street, but it usually has been large changes in the Dow Jones
industrial average that energized investors here on the other side
of the Pacific: signs of economic health in the United States are a
good omen for Asia's export-dependent economies.
</P>
<P>
   That Asian markets are beginning to track the technology-heavy
NASDAQ market rather than the Dow average illustrates not only the
evolving character of American corporate might, but also a shift in
attitudes about where this region's economic future lies.
</P>
<P>
   The rally partly reflects the fact that computers,
telecommunications equipment, mobile phones and the parts that go
into them represent a large share of Asia's exports and the belief
that demand for such products will continue to grow. The rally also
embodies a belief that the region is transforming itself in the
aftermath of its two-year financial crisis to more closely resemble
America's so-called new economy, in which the Internet forms the
basis of an electronic marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new fascination with Internet-related
investments has been accompanied by the same nagging doubts many
market experts have about the U.S. boom, particularly the
consequences for an economy where capital accrues fastest to
money-losing enterprises. More troubling to skeptics in Asia is
that most of this region's economies, while improving, can hardly
be called healthy. The largest corporations are still buried in
debts, and many banks are feeble.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still at the talking stage for all this new-economy
stuff in Asia,'' said David Fernandez, an economist at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The mess in Asia's banks means less money is available for
corporate expansion. According to Merrill Lynch, only Singapore and
Hong Kong have regained financial health. The banking systems in
South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand are still insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   But the story for Asia's electronics exports is compelling. Most
economists foresee continued economic growth in the United States
next year, and they think that will fuel orders for Asian
electronics, which are already near their highest level in 20
years, according to Merrill Lynch. That should benefit electronics
manufacturers as well as help finance Asia's bank bailouts and its
overall economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   More demand, economists predict, is likely to come from within
Asia itself as consumer spending accelerates with economic
recovery. Asia is one of the fastest-growing markets for cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a glorious situation out there,'' said Janardan Menon, an
analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in Singapore. ``There's a
global shortage in semiconductors; hand-phone sales are still
shooting through the roof; PC sales are strong. All put together,
there's no signs of any weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   And in contrast to times before the crisis, when Asian companies
and banks lagged the United States in exploiting technology, most
Asian governments have adopted policies to encourage companies and
individuals to catch up with the West. Many are also trying to
create their own versions of Silicon Valley, complete with a
freewheeling entrepreneurial culture. International Data Corp.
predicts that electronic commerce in Asia will soar in the next
five years, growing from 0.01 percent of the region's gross
domestic product to 0.59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sapura Telecommunications Bhd., a Malaysian telephone
equipment maker, have risen nearly 50 percent this month. Since
October, Shinawatra Satellite of Thailand has climbed more than 60
percent, and the South Korean telephone company-cum-Internet
service Dacom has more than doubled. Investors are even buying into
the Malaysian telephone operator Telekom Malaysia, pushing its
stock up nearly 16 percent this month. Chip-company stocks are also
soaring.

CHECHEN REBELS STRIKE BACK AGAINST INVADING RUSSIAN TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One of the Russian military's first serious forays into
Chechnya's besieged capital, Grozny, went disastrously awry late
Wednesday after thousands of Chechen rebels surrounded the invading
troops and pounded them with rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents at the battle scene, a square near central
Grozny, said the area was littered with blazing armored vehicles
and the bodies of Russian soldiers. A Reuters correspondent, Maria
Eismont, said she counted more than 100 Russian dead at the end of
the three-hour battle.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Defense Ministry officials had no immediate comment on
the reports. Earlier, they had denied claims by Chechen officials
that a long-anticipated invasion of Grozny by Russian troops had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian sources told the Interfax news service that their
troops had strengthened their grip on Grozny's eastern edge, near
the scene of Wednesday's battle, and that reconnaissance missions
into the center of the city had begun.
</P>
<P>
   If the Russian losses are as large as reported, it would be the
first major setback for the military since the Kremlin started a
campaign to retake Chechnya from Islamic rebels in September.
</P>
<P>
   It would also serve as an ominous reminder of the fate that
befell Russian troops the last time they tried to take Grozny, at
the end of a two-year civil war in 1996. At that time, thousands of
ill-prepared soldiers moved into the center of town, only to be cut
down or driven out by Chechen guerrillas who had been planning a
counterattack for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen forces have been promising the same sort of Grozny
welcome for Russian troops in the latest conflict. But Kremlin
military strategists have repeatedly said that they are ready this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, a senior Russian military official had
confidently predicted that the remaining militants would be driven
out of Grozny within days, and that all Chechnya would fall under
Russian control in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports from the scene of Wednesday's battle, in
Minutka Square about two miles from central Grozny, were sketchy.
But correspondents on the scene said a column of Russian armor had
been encircled by rebel forces after moving into the city from the
eastern suburb of Khankala, the site of a military airbase that the
Russians recently seized.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that seven tanks and eight armored
personnel carriers had moved into the square when the fighting
began. Reuters said that as many as 2,000 Chechen troops surrounded
the armored column, firing on it with rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades, before the battle ended about 11 p.m. Moscow time (3 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Except for a report on Moscow's leading news-radio station, Ekho
Moskvy, the battle went unreported by Russian news organizations
Wednesday evening. Russian defense officials insisted on Wednesday
that Grozny was not being bombarded and that the city was the scene
only of sporadic clashes with rebel bands, even as journalists
there reported constant shelling and rebels claimed heavy fighting
in five separate districts.
</P>
<P>
   The battle was precisely the sort of engagement that Russian
strategists have been trying to avoid _ successfully, until now _
as they try to retake Chechnya after three years of de facto
independence from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Kremlin ordered a counterattack this fall against
Islamic rebels who had moved from Chechnya into neighboring
Dagestan, perhaps 100,000 Russian troops have managed to occupy 60
percent of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   By Moscow's count, only 400 troops had died in fighting before
Wednesday's battle. Russian forces have kept their losses low by
relying on relentless air and artillery attacks to drive rebels and
civilians alike from targeted towns and villages before they are
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy _ essentially a repeat of the NATO campaign against
Yugoslavia last spring, but lacking the West's precision weapons _
has killed hundreds, if not thousands of civilians and provoked
international criticism from governments and human-rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute phone conversation Wednesday, the head of the
European Union, Prime Minister Paavo Liponnen of Finland, warned
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia that the European
confederation would review its relations with Russia if the war did
not halt and negotiations toward a political solution did not pick
up steam.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has insisted that it is putting down an internal
rebellion by terrorists and bandits. And while they have made some
moves to mollify critics, such as opening an escape corridor out of
Grozny for civilians and establishing refugee camps, Russian
leaders have also made it clear that neither their tactics nor
their goal of eliminating rebel activity in Chechnya would be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they been under any domestic pressure to change,
because the strategy has, until now, worked almost perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   With his rebellious province increasingly devastated by bombs
and occupied by government troops, Chechnya's elected president,
Aslan Maskhadov, all but pleaded for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not reject any proposals about political dialogue if they
could hasten a peaceful outcome to this crisis by even an hour,''
he said in a video-taped address, reportedly made at a hideout in
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov attached only one condition: that the talks be
overseen by an international mediator to assure Moscow's good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin and Russian military officials rejected that condition
immediately. And the Kremlin's emergencies minister, Sergei Shoigu,
said he would meet with Maskhadov only to negotiate the safe
passage of civilians out of Grozny so that Russian troops could
complete their occupation of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway,
was in nearby North Ossetia on Wednesday. He said he planned to
visit Russian-occupied areas of Chechnya on Thursday, and was ready
to join a search for a political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the deputy chief of the general staff, Gen. Valery
Manilov, told a gathering of foreign military attaches that Russian
troops would control all of Chechnya within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with rebels are pointless, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Grozny's liberation should take a matter of
days,'' he was quoted as saying. ``No massive strikes, no storms,
no assaults will take place in Grozny. We will not resort to these
tactics as long as there is a single civilian in Grozny.''
</P>
<P>
   He said more than 7,000 rebels had died in combat so far, and
that up to 15,000 rebels, including 1,500 mercenaries, remained in
the province. Rebel spokesmen say that just 150 of their forces
have been killed.

   WASHINGTON _ One exhibit shows step by step how Nakunte Diarra,
an artisan from Mali, uses mud and other organic ingredients to dye
cloth. Another, a detailed floor plan, visually condenses the
sprawling Makola market in the Ghanaian city of Accra into a
two-dimensional rendition of its teeming activity. And a life-size
television monitor shows two Somalis, who now live here in
Washington, sharing memories of growing up in migrant herding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of dispelling some misconceptions and stereotypes
about Africa, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History opened a new permanent exhibition Wednesday,
``African Voices.'' The collection of vivid hands-on exhibits is
designed to illuminate the diverse African experience along a time
line stretching from the origins of humans to the growth of African
immigrant populations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This multimedia exhibition, eight years in the planning and
costing $5.5 million, is complemented by a series of visiting
lecturers and an electronic resource center. It presents ``the
diversity and dynamism of Africa and Africans,'' said Robert W.
Fri, the museum director, ``by showing how Africans have created a
variety of rich cultures and dealt actively in a complex world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulayman Nyang, a professor of African studies at Howard
University in Washington, who helped develop the show, also
emphasized the diversity of Africa. ``I always tell people that
each time you make a statement about Africa, if I'm in the room, I
can get evidence to negate what you're saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A collage of television screens greets visitors as they enter
the exhibit, and images flash across the screens: a flaglike yellow
banner lettered in blue denoting the nationhood of Namibia; a
victorious Nelson Mandela after his election as president of South
Africa; children on bicycles; immunization posters.
</P>
<P>
   The main gallery of the exhibition depicts a complex historical
journey illustrated by significant moments in African history. One
display is devoted to the rise of the Nubian kings in the Nile
Valley. Another explains how the Almoravids, African Muslims,
occupied Spain and Portugal in 1086. Ballots from the 1994 South
African elections are tangible reminders of the struggle to end
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Tangential exhibits are devoted to specific African communities.
The subject of ``Wealth in Africa'' is Paa Joe, a middle-aged man
from Nungua in Ghana who designs coffins to fit the personalities
of their occupants. Personalized coffins, a Ghanaian tradition for
more than 50 years, illustrate an individual's life or, in some
cases, the life a person had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day Lamidi Fakeye, an artist from Ife, Nigeria,
discussed a temporary exhibition of his wooden sculptures. Trained
in the generations-old Yoruba style of wood craftsmanship, Fakeye
proudly proclaimed his heritage: ``I am the fifth generation of
artists in my family. My great-great-great-grandfather was an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of ``African Voices'' dovetails with the beginning
of a series of related lectures at the museum. On Friday at noon in
the Smithsonian's Baird Auditorium, Dr. Mary Jo Arnoldi, the

DIRECTOR HALLSTROM AND NOVELIST IRVING MAKE A GOOD FIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably one of the more unusual director-writer combinations
can be found in ``The Cider House Rules,'' which brings together
the heightened sweetness of director Lasse Hallstrom (''My Life as
a Dog'' and ``What's Eating Gilbert Grape'') and writer John
Irving. Irving's books, such as ``The World According to Garp'' and
``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' have been made into films before. (''A
Prayer for Owen Meany''-based ``Simon Birch'' would've been perfect
for Hallstrom, given his affection for young, eccentric
protagonists.) But in the case of ``Rules,'' Irving has chosen to
eliminate the middlemen _ screenwriters who undoubtedly provided
him with frustration over their adaptations _ and to turn his book
into a screenplay himself.
</P>
<P>
   The young protagonist in eccentric circumstances this time is
Homer (Tobey Maguire), who grows up in an orphanage. Essentially,
he's raised by Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who runs the orphanage.
Larch also occasionally performs abortions when he thinks the
situation requires it. And Homer eventually assists Larch in his
duties. Homer begins to take a position different from Larch's.
That is, until he leaves the orphanage and has to see for himself
the world he's judged.
</P>
<P>
   Irving has been as ruthless in cutting down his material for the
screen as any screenwriter adapting the work of someone else. His
work contains phalanxes of characters moving in and out, so that
the seemingly happy central figure can see his life compromised as
he meets them. (Irving's novels are like less fantastic versions of
Kurt Vonnegut's fiction _ although by less fantastic, I mean he
substitutes a benignly cruel fate for a sci-fi bent.) You'd expect
that ``Rules'' would be a sprawling four-hour work. Instead, it
comes in at just barely over two hours. On the road, Homer falls in
with migrant workers and finds himself another mentor (Delroy
Lindo, in an understated, powerful performance). Homer also finds
himself drawn into a complicated situation with a pregnant young
woman (Charlize Theron).
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the movie version of ``Rules'' feels more
like Larch's story, even though it's told from Homer's point of
view. Homer seems impassive, a sponge soaking up the world so that
he can learn to alter the severity of his own judgments. But Larch,
well-played by Caine, is a sad-eyed figure who's constantly in
motion. He came to conclusions about what works, and what doesn't,
a long time ago. The film's material, which could be construed as
pro-choice, may be upsetting to some. But Hallstrom and Irving turn
out to be much better suited for each other in this instance than
you might expect.

U.N. TO SHARE POWER IN KOSOVO WITH 3 ALBANIAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The United Nations has agreed to a
power-sharing pact with three Kosovo Albanian leaders, bringing
them into the official administration to help govern the unruly
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. special representative here, Bernard Kouchner, who
signed the deal Wednesday, remains in charge. But he will now have
a four-member Administrative Council that will propose policy and
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Kosovars an executive role in governing the
province and official status and council seats to three Albanian
leaders: Hashim Thaci, former political head of the disbanded
Kosovo Liberation Army; Ibrahim Rugova of the Democratic League for
Kosovo; and Rexhep Qosja of the Unified Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth seat was reserved for a Serb. But Serbian leaders
rejected Kouchner's invitation to send a representative.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the accord would dismantle the unofficial
local structures that the Albanians have been running and break up
the political rivalries that have frequently stymied U.N.
administration.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the signing, Kouchner described the
agreement as the ``first real success of the U.N. mission in
Kosovo.'' It would give substantial autonomy, followed by
self-government, to Kosovo, in keeping with a U.N. resolution on
Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the troops here, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, also
welcomed the accord, saying it would foster needed cooperation
among local officials, citizens and security forces in combating
the crime and revenge killings that have engulfed Kosovo since NATO
forced Serbian forces to withdraw in June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thaci seconded that view, saying: ``This structure will help
reduce the level of crime. I sincerely believe that with these
structures there will not be any more masked people, political
mafia and other crimes. And instead of hatred, I hope we shall
build a climate of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian leaders said they would work together and join
forces to build a new Kosovo until elections for a provincial
government could be organized next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal has quite obviously left the Kosovo Serbs out in
the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian leaders in Kosovo have yet to endorse the pact and have
not nominated anyone to fill their designated council position.
Ethnic Serbs have left the province in large numbers since the
NATO-led forces took over. But tens of thousands remain. They have
withdrawn more and more into their own enclaves for safety and
complain that their political and security needs are being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the participation of the Serbs, however, the U.N.
administration had arrived at such an impasse in managing civil and
political life in Kosovo that many here felt that an agreement was
desperately needed. Residents of Pristina, the provincial capital,
say fear has gripped the city, with rumors of kidnappings keeping
them at home at night.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the accord will spread responsibility from the
United Nations to local leaders. Thaci and Rugova are to disband
their alternative governments and integrate their people into the
new administration, physically moving into offices in the U.N.
administrative building in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovars are to take up positions throughout the administration
of the province alongside U.N. officials. There are to be 14
departments with responsibility for finance, commerce, education,
justice, health and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Defense will be left to the NATO-led forces. But the governing
council will have an expert committee on security that will work
with international troops and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner will be more like a presiding officer over the council,
said a spokeswoman at the United Nations, Nadia Younes.
</P>
<P>
   His deputy, Jock Covey, will be co-chairman of the council,
along with a rotating co-chairman from among the four Kosovo
council members.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, who has headed a self-declared provisional government
since the security forces took over the administration of Kosovo
from the Serbs, and Rugova, who calls himself president of a shadow
government elected by Albanians some years ago, appear to have
buried their personal rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they could not resist political digs at each other at the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three Albanians, Thaci was the main person who was
dragging his feet on the agreement, said a U.N. official. ``He had
done the most legwork setting up his own structures,'' the official
said, ``and in a sense had the most to lose.''

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Indianapolis (1) and Jacksonville (2), and a
larger difference between Indianapolis (1) and Tampa Bay (4).

OPPOSITION OF 2 ISRAELI MINISTERS ALREADY THREATENS ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-SYRIA, MIDEAST-U.S.) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two key Israeli cabinet ministers said Wednesday
that they might pull their small but influential parties out of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's ruling coalition if he agrees to return
the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at some point that it will become impossible to stay
in the government,'' Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, the leader
of the Yisrael B'Aliya Party, said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, head of the National Religious
Party, met with Sharansky Wednesday morning in an effort to
coordinate their opposition to a Golan Heights withdrawal, expected
to be the linchpin of the prime minister's planned peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, whose party unanimously opposed the Barak's latest peace
initiative in Parliament on Monday, said he had not yet decided to
quit the coalition. ``We have to reassess our ability to remain in
the government at every stage,'' he said Wednesday. ``But the line
is clear. We are launching a public battle on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Their defection would reduce the strength of Barak's government
in Parliament from 68 members to 59, two short of a majority. More
important, it could signal concerted resistance to a peace pact
with Syria from two of Israel's most formidable constituencies:
Russian immigrants and West Bank settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister can count on support for his Syrian
initiative from 10 Arab legislators and other left-leaning members
outside his coalition, assuring him of more than the 61 votes he
needs to submit a treaty to the promised national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But a narrow parliamentary margin and a bitterly divided cabinet
would make the referendum battle more difficult. Levy and Sharansky
said they would actively campaign against approval of a pact with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party and Yisrael B'Aliya were also
partners in the rightist governing coalition headed by Benjamin
Netanyahu, and skeptics noted that their relationships with that
government had been similarly tempestuous.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Barak circulated documents Wednesday purporting to
show that the Netanyahu government had been prepared to withdraw
from the Golan Heights in exchange for security guarantees.
Netanyahu has denied their assertion.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident cabinet members held their breakfast meeting just
hours before Barak stood next to President Clinton and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Washington for the first
high-level talks ever held between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Sharansky had already signaled their discontent,
appearing at protest rallies of Golan settlers on Monday and
declining to join cabinet colleagues in a ceremonial airport
send-off of the prime minister as he left for Washington on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party's strong following among West Bank
settlers is considered a great political asset in Barak's effort to
build support for a negotiated settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, though he controls just four seats in Parliament,
commands great influence as the highest ranking elected
representative of Israel's one million Russian immigrants. An
opposition Russian immigrant faction, also with four seats, is even
more adamantly opposed to a Golan withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   President Ezer Weizman, a staunch backer of the negotiating
effort, Wednesday used his elder statesman status to summon Levy
and Sharansky for private chats at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a question of a peace treaty,'' Weizman said,
defending his intervention on Barak's behalf. ``It is one of peace
and war.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Shai, the leader of the Shas Party, whose critical 17-member
delegation abstained in the parliamentary vote on Monday, also met
today with President Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky's objection to the return of the Golan Heights does
not depend on the details of possible security arrangements or the
exact demarcation of a new Syrian-Israeli border, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the exchange of the Golan Heights for an early warning
station is meaningless,'' he said in an interview Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, once a political prisoner in the Soviet Union, said
that on philosophical and pragmatic grounds, he opposed dealing
with ``a dictatorship'' that he says cannot be a trustworthy
partner. ``The depth of our concessions should be proportionate to
the openness and transparency of Syrian society,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ At his Christmas party a year ago, I went up to
John McCain and asked an off-the-wall question: What would it be
like if he and Bill Bradley ran against each other for president?
</P>

   He was momentarily taken aback, because the thought had not

turn out to be the dullest presidential campaign in American

   This week, the picture of the week in every newspaper and on
every television news show will be of Bradley and McCain, Mutt &AMP;
Jeff (Augustus Mutt was the tall one), the insurgent liberal and
the maverick conservative, coming together in Claremont, N.H. In
their ``summit of the underdogs,'' they will pledge to do
bipartisan battle against the power of big bucks in politics.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly dull. At the least, it is a dramatic stunt to
help them dominate the political world in the weekend before the
holiday whoop-de-do takes the public mind away from politics.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, it smacks conventional wisdom upside the head.
Most of us thought McCain and Bradley would compete there for the
votes of independents, who can choose to vote in either the
Republican or Democratic primaries. Whichever one took, the middle
would emerge the winner; the other would lose the other primary to
George W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the outsiders have chosen to join forces to enlarge the
middle. If the daring strategy of joining to press campaign finance
reform works, liberal Democrats will split between Gore and
Bradley, conservative Republicans will split between Bush and
McCain, and the expanded independent vote in the middle will elbow
Gore and Bush off the table.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working for McCain, who is doing to Bush in New
Hampshire what Dwight Eisenhower did to the GOP establishment
choice Bob Taft. Bradley has a tougher row to hoe in that state,
but he goes into his several debates with the vice president this
weekend propelled by the issue of his choice.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls at this stage, name recognition is still
decisive: the game of the name is the name of the game. But in
local races in small states, which in turn affect recognition and
national poll standings, debates and their repercussions are
replacing television spots as the most influential factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic debates, Bradley is being widely advised to
stop turning the other cheek, to take off the gloves and to slam
back at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bradley should cut the gentle whining about distortions of
his proposals. ``Stop lying about my record'' did not help Bob
Dole. Mournfully deploring demagoguery is a bore. Bradley should
get off the defensive and, quoting John Dryden, introduce a new
phase with: ``Beware the fury of a patient man.''
</P>
<P>
   But he will not beat Gore in debate by becoming a clone of Gore.
That would be to abandon the authenticity that has carried him so
far. Bradley can build on his campaign finance theme by asking Gore
if he is not ashamed of President Clinton's sale of the Lincoln
Bedroom and his own Buddhist temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   In all this escalation of rivalry, Bradley should remain himself
_ the good-guy counterpuncher. For hatchet work, he needs a
respected surrogate to put out the long-concealed memos of Maria
Hsia and to blast the excesses of Clinton-Gore's 1996 fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican debates, George Bush is gaining confidence but
needs work. His injection of his religious awakening into the
debate in Iowa this week _ causing a couple of minor candidates to
join in displaying their faith on their sleeves _ was dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   About the gang of four who share the platforms with Bush and
McCain: Only the voters can winnow the field, but it's up to the
media and McCain to put on the heat to arrange a series of
one-on-one GOP ``joint interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain needs the TV exposure to win the nomination, but Bush
needs the experience of high-pressure public jousting even more to
win the election. If Bush is unwilling or unable to go head-to-head
with McCain now, Bradley, or especially Gore will have his head on
a platter later.
</P>
<P>
   And if the outsiders get the nominations? A serious campaign,
surely, but far from dull.

MICROSOFT FINISHES WINDOWS 2000 DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft said Wednesday that it had completed the development
of its Windows 2000 operating system software. The often-delayed
program was sent to manufacturing plants and should reach the
public Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is the successor to Windows NT, the operating
system Microsoft sells primarily to businesses. A successor to
Microsoft's consumer operating system, Windows 98, code-named
Millennium, is expected next year, but no date has been set. The
programs currently remain separate, but Microsoft executives
Wednesday reiterated their intention to merge the code.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is a vital product for Microsoft because it will
determine the company's ability to compete in the crucial Internet
market with Sun Microsystems, IBM and various vendors of the Unix
operating system. Sun's Solaris operating system has flourished, in
part, because of reports that Windows NT was not robust enough for
heavy use on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 2000 release partly answers that challenge. It comes
in multiple versions, of which Microsoft released three:
Professional, for desktop business users; Server, for multiple
users on a network, and Advanced Server, for broader deployments
and Internet service. Data Center, a larger version aimed directly
at the Unix market, was not released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the big Data Center product comes out, which is about
six months behind, it's still not really competitive yet with
Unix,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information
Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``What this does is provide a step up so
that Microsoft technology is playing at a new level. At least on
the desktop, it is rock solid. There are some issues still to be
resolved at the server level, but it's not that the product breaks
or is of low quality, it's more about problems in certain
environments.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the various versions of Windows 2000 were more
robust and scalable, meaning able to grow with a user's business,
than any operating system the company had ever delivered. They said
the program had been evaluated by 750,000 testers before release,
and was currently running the microsoft.com Web site with no
problems.

E-COMMERCE PANEL HEARS ARGUMENTS AGAINST A TAX-FREE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Va., Texas, Utah)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Proposals to make the Internet a tax-free zone
came under withering attack Wednesday by major retailers,
shopping-center owners and state and local officials in testimony
before a commission created by Congress to study the question.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores, Federated Department Stores, the International
Council of Shopping Centers and other members of a hastily formed
alliance calling itself the E-Fairness Coalition said it would be
wrong for government to discriminate against bricks-and-mortar
retailers and in favor of those operating online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposals to make the Internet a sales-tax-free zone are
attractive,'' the coalition told the panel, the Advisory Commission
on Electronic Commerce, ``but have potentially devastating
economic, tax and social consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, speaking on behalf of state
and local governments whose largest source of revenue is sales
taxes, said, ``America can't survive if we have discriminatory
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot adopt a tax policy that assists in wiping out
small-town merchants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses spoke at the commission's third set of hearings this
year amid growing indications that the 18-member commission is
divided into three firmly entrenched camps. A consensus appears
unlikely to develop before an April deadline for the group to
recommend a national policy on taxing electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One faction, led by Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, the commission
chairman, favors a blanket tax exemption for Internet commerce.
Declaring that the Internet's growth ``must not be thwarted by
taxation,'' he would have the federal government increase grants to
the states to make up for revenue losses.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt and other commission members favor a
plan by the National Association of Governors and by local
governments to create a national clearinghouse, financed by the
states, to process sales taxes and turn them over to the 6,527
state and local agencies that impose sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A third faction, led by Dean Andal, chairman of the California
Board of Equalization, a state tax agency, favors maintaining the
system in which online sales are subject to sales tax only when the
merchant has a physical presence, like a retail store or warehouse,
in a state where it ships goods.
</P>
<P>
   The commission heard from several panels of witnesses who said
that complying with different tax rates from place to place, and
different rules on which items are taxable, would be a costly
administrative nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, a commission member, ridiculed those
arguments. ``These companies can reduce every color in the universe
to digits and put the complete details of building a car into a
computer but they can't handle sales taxes?'' he asked, mockingly.
``Totally incongruent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax
Reform, criticized state governments for going on a spending spree,
and said taxes from online sales would just allow more profligacy.
Norquist said that making the Internet a tax-free zone would force
state and local governments to lower sales tax rates, which often
total 8 to 9 percent in industrial states, to a range of 3 to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Janklow said the states had cut spending by $25 billion in
this decade, mostly by lowering income and property tax rates. He
said that making the Internet a tax-free zone would diminish the
power of the states and increase the power of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow's testimony drew a rebuke from Citizens Against
Government Waste, a Washington group calling itself the nation's
largest tax watchdog. ``South Dakota governor proposes Gestapo
tactics to collect the state sales tax,'' the group said in a press
release, calling e-commerce ``the vanguard of America's current
economic growth.''

FORMER WORKERS INDICTED FOR `ILLEGAL SEXUAL CONDUCT' OF TEXAS
INMATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fla.) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Twelve former employees of one of the nation's
largest private prison companies were indicted Wednesday on charges
ranging from rape to sexual harassment of 16 women held in the
state jail run by Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle said the
indictments for ``illegal sexual conduct'' of 11 former guards and
a former inmate counselor for the Wackenhut Corrections Corp. are
the first ``of what we expect to be a continuing series of
indictments'' stemming from allegations of widespread misconduct at
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents occurred, according to the indictments, between
May 6, 1997, and Aug. 30 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, one of many state jails created by the Texas
Legislature to house nonviolent felons sentenced for no more than
two years, was under contract from the state to County. The
county subsequently subcontracted the operation to Wackenhut
Corrections, which operates numerous state and county lockups
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Earle said that 20 other cases involving similar allegations of
illegal sexual conduct are still under investigation at the Austin
jail and will be presented to grand juries soon.
</P>
<P>
   Five guards are accused of rape; others are accused of a variety
of sex crimes or sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several defendants face multiple charges and some inmates were
victimized by more than one guard,'' Earle added. The indictments
resulted from a joint investigation by Earle's office and Travis
County Sheriff Margo Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Travis County Public Integrity Unit _ a special
arm of the district attorney's office _ and the state comptroller's
office are investigating the possibility of administrative and
financial fraud by Wackenhut.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they are looking into allegations of the
falsification of documents and misuse of funds by jail
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut spokesman Pat Cannan declined comment other than to
say the Palm Beach, Fla.-based company did not learn of the
indictments until reporters contacted company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Earle and Frasier said they were appalled at the widespread
abuse of the jail inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations and indictments stemmed from a federal
lawsuit filed this summer by a former prisoner who claimed she had
been raped by a guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the onset, we decided we should look at (possible)
additional victims,'' Frasier said. Investigators questioned more
than 100 witnesses, coming up with the list of at least 16 women
who said they were victims.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier attributed the problems at the facility to a jail that
not only was poorly run but also had guards that were poorly
trained and underpaid. She said she was particularly outraged by
the employees, who, she said, ``used their position and power of
the badge'' to mistreat the women. In addition to allegations of
sexual misconduct, she said investigators also turned up numerous
instances of contraband, including cigarettes and illegal drugs,
``flowing freely'' within the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Earle said the abuses, which he contends were widespread when
Wackenhut ran the jail, ``are an outrage in a civilized society,''
particularly in light of the ``national scandal'' of sexual abuse
of female prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were beyond that kind of primitive behavior,''
he said. Frasier said the investigation showed that a lot of the
women's complaints were brought to the attention of jail
administrators .
</P>
<P>
   But the administrators failed to adequately investigate the
inmates' claims, she said. ``Whether they don't know how to conduct
an investigation or chose not to, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, sexual assault, or rape, is a second-degree
felony punishable by as much as 20 years in prison and a $10,000
fine. Improper sexual activity with a person in custody involves
sexual intercourse or contact and is a state jail felony punishable
by up to two years in a state jail and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Official oppression involves such conduct as sexual harassment,
making sexual advances or requesting sexual favors. It is a Class A
misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in a county jail and a
$4,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Those indicted include &UR;  &LR; Nathaniel Jenkins Sr. and Nathaniel
Jenkins Jr. Whether they are father and son could not be verified.
The senior Jenkins is charged with one count of sexual assault, two
counts of improper sexual activity and one count of official
oppression. The indictment alleges he victimized two women
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins Jr. was charged with one count of sexual assault and two
counts of improper sexual activity. He victimized three different
women, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ages and addresses were not included in the indictment material.
</P>
<P>
   Others indicted were:
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Townsend, accused of sexual assault, and charged
earlier this year with that crime after an inmate gave birth to his
child; Eladio Serna, accused of deviate sexual intercourse; Anthony
Shane Henry, deviate sexual intercourse and sexual harassment;
Norwood Lee Hilstock, sexual assault, deviate sexual intercourse
and sexual harassment; Tyrone Means, sexual assault and sexual
intercourse; Christopher Colvin and Pervis Richard, also known as
Richard Purvis, accused of having sexual intercourse with a
prisoner; Rory Smith and Eric Garcia, official oppression; and
Arthur Benner, sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier said none of the defendants had been arrested by
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Travis County state jail is not the only Wackenhut-run
facility in Texas, where allegations of sexual misconduct between
guards and inmates have arisen.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a guard at a Lockhart facility operated by
Wackenhut was accused in a federal lawsuit of sexually assaulting a
prisoner during a four-month period in 1996.

LINDA TRIPPS BRIDGE CLUB KNEW ABOUT SECRET TAPES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Four friends of Linda R. Tripp, three of
them regular partners in her weekly bridge game, told a Maryland
court Wednesday that they were aware she had secretly tape-recorded
conversations with Monica Lewinsky before it was disclosed in the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Mancuso, a neighbor who is not a bridge club member,
told the court, ``I knew about the tape recorder before it came out
in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court ruled on
Tuesday that to try Mrs. Tripp on charges that she violated state
wiretapping laws, Maryland prosecutors must show that they gathered
evidence independently of the independent counsel's investigation
of Mrs. Lewinsky's relationship with President Clinton. The
counsel's office gave Mrs. Tripp immunity from prosecution in
exchange for her cooperation and her handing over the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was indicted on charges of knowingly violating
Maryland's law against taping another person without that person's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland prosecutors have said that they learned of the four
women, who testified before the grand jury, independently of the
counsel's investigation. Prosecutors have said that the women told
the grand jury that as early as October 1997, Mrs. Tripp freely
talked about taping someone named Monica who was having an affair
with Clinton and even invited Mrs. Lewinsky to a Christmas party so
the friends could meet her. Only one of the women in court
Wednesday said she had never heard Mrs. Tripp say anything about
the taping, but she suggested she was aware of it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The women were not questioned closely about their conversations
with Mrs. Tripp because they were there only for the purpose of
allowing the court to determine whether their testimony was
influenced by the barrage of news accounts about the impeachment
report to Congress by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They all asserted that their grand jury testimony about Mrs.
Tripp was based solely on their own experience and unrelated to
news accounts. One woman, Kathy Sarkis, said she first heard about
the Starr report as ``some referral to some sexual thing, and I
didn't read about it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers worked hard to suggest that the women's accounts
were influenced by the news accounts of the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   David Irwin, one of Mrs. Tripp's lawyers, asked Ms. Mancuso in
cross-examination: ``You were confused then and you're confused
now, and it's all a big blur, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Sarkis, he asked, ``Your brain had been saturated with
Ken Starr, the office of the independent counsel and all this
stuff, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said.

<P>
   VORONEZH, Russia _ Irina Venyaminova, who runs a family-owned
leather workshop in the center of this southern Russia city, has no
great desire to vote on Dec. 19, when Russia elects a new
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Andrei Myakinnikov, who like Irina started his own
company in the early 1990s, just as the dust was settling from the
collapse of the old Soviet state economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago these two entrepreneurs, both in their mid 30s,
were employees of the state _ as was just about everyone in Russia.
In those days they could have been arrested for doing what they do
now: running their own businesses, hiring employees, making enough
of a profit to survive the ups and downs of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Russia's new democracy stumbles into a new century, Ms.
Venyaminova, who employs 16 people in a second-floor
apartment-turned-studio, and Myakinnikov, 38, a regional
distributor of medical supplies with 90 people on his payroll, have
as little use for vote-seeking politicians as they once did for
Communist Party apparatchiks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no contact with our parliamentary deputies,''
Myakinnikov said, ``but I am sure that they don't care about the
problems I have. Politics don't interest me: What the politicians
do and say are two different things, and sometimes that is just as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   As voters go to the polls, in a warm-up for next summer's
presidential elections, many are professing apathy _ mixed with
disgust _ at the unseemly power struggle going on in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings were best summed up by a group of anarchists who
recently occupied the Lenin Mausoleum on Red Square long enough to
unfurl a banner proclaiming their choice, ``Against All of Them.''
</P>
<P>
   But among members of Russia's fledgling middle class, the mood
is not so much nihilistic as pragmatic. By their reckoning, the
powers that be have done little to help them get their businesses
up and running. And so at a time when Russia is getting ready for
another change at the top, the best they can hope for is to be left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may not be the best of all possible worlds, but its
small-business men and women are opting, like Candide in the novel
by Voltaire, to tend to their own gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who will be leading Russia in a year's time,''
said Myakinnikov. ``But in this little piece of Russia, I know what
we will do. We will improve services, we will hire new people, we
will improve salaries. These are our plans, and most of them are
realistic. We will do what we can in our own house,'' he said, in
an interview in his office in the heart of Voronezh's industrial
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to surviving,'' said Ms. Venyaminova, speaking
over the whir of sewing machines, by a window overlooking a
sidewalk market where the underemployed sell goods from shoes to
screwdrivers. ``I figure if a person works, he will find work to do
no matter who the president in Moscow is.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the czars and the Communists, the Russian state dominated
the life of its citizens. For the last decade, as President Boris
Yeltsin's team of economic reformers broke down the scaffolding of
a system that both hemmed in and propped up people's lives,
Russians have discovered the ambiguous freedom of fending for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 897,000 small businesses operating in Russia
in early 1999, the struggle has not been easy. High taxes, greedy
bureaucrats and uncertain laws have dogged their growth, and that
does not count periodic banking and financial crises that have
undercut the value of the ruble and frozen bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Voronezh, in the heart of Russia's so-called Red Belt,
where an aging population has consistently supported Communists in
local and national elections, the region's 61,000 registered small
businesses are only now getting a sympathetic ear from a mostly
hostile local administration.
</P>
<P>
   Myakinnikov described the ordeal of renting city-owned space for
his expanding chain of private pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big problem,'' he said. ``Not all bureaucrats are
ready to agree. Some just say we don't want to, and that's it. Many
are from the old school and look on us with suspicion. And then, of
course, there are those who want bribes.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of entrepreneurs, a local store owner listed
five infractions found by inspectors from one of the 33 agencies,
federal and local, authorized to check on his stores.
</P>
<P>
   They included citations for a Nestle chocolate bar that lacked
its ``characteristic luster'' and a can of Nescafe instant coffee
that did not list instructions on how to use the product.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate it is no wonder that so many Voronezh
businessmen are trying this year to run for the 450-seat lower
house of parliament. Half of the members are elected directly from
225 districts, with the others chosen on the basis of party lists.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Bezdetko, 34, a clothing manufacturer and head of a
small-business association, is running as one of 18 candidates in
the so-called Left Bank district of Voronezh. He is a candidate for
Yabloko, the party headed by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal who
has spent the last eight years in opposition to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces, a party made up of
Yeltsin's economic reformers, are expected to collect most of the
votes of Russia's entrepreneurs. Myakinnikov, for instance, is
wavering between those parties.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next summer's presidential election, Ms.
Venyaminova favors Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, 46, whom she sees
as a member of a generation close to her own.
</P>
<P>
   Bezdetko is not the first small-business man to run for office
in Voronezh, but he is part of a new wave making its voice heard
for the first time this year, says Aleksandr A. Slinko, a professor
of political science at Voronezh State University.
</P>
<P>
   Even more interesting, Slinko said, is a trend among the
region's governing Communists to become more pragmatic about
Russia's economic realities, shedding their old hard-line
dogmatism.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia's first parliamentary elections, in 1993, Russian
``biznismeni'' lured voters with their own money, sometimes
distributing packages of food at electoral rallies. This time,
their appeals are more subtle and more sophisticated, pitched at a
generation that wants to see government tackle government's
problems and leave business to others.
</P>
<P>
   Bezdetko recently invited voters to his Web site, enlisting the
Internet in Voronezh politics for the first time. Of the region's
13,000 Internet subscribers, 1,200 logged on.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign fliers _ featuring Yabloko's emblem, a green apple
with a slight tint of red _ offer voters, on the reverse side, a
list of local emergency telephone numbers and the routes of local
bus service.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other candidates who are promising to restore order in
Russia and loyalty to the Motherland, Bezdetko is offering a
program that is very local. His top priority is obtaining federal
funds to repair an aging sewage collector beneath the reservoir
that divides this city in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``My program is very concrete,'' he said. ``The collector is a
problem that no one, until now, has even tried to solve.''

SYRIAN PUBLIC FOLLOWING WASHINGTON TALKS WITH MIX OF HOPE AND
CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 4th and 6th grafs to fix spelling of Syrian foreign
minister's name)  
 (See also: MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-U.S., MIDEAST-ISRAEL)  
 (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ It was 32 years ago that Israeli forces drove
Syrians by the many thousands from the Golan Heights. Wednesday,
many of those same Syrians were fixing eyes and ears at Washington,
in the hope they were witnessing a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted by this stalemate,'' said Ali Rahil, the
headmaster of a primary school outside Damascus, who was relying on
a satellite dish to monitor the news from abroad. ``They want the
talks to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Israeli-Syrian negotiations once again under way
after a 45-month break, the Syrian government has been trying to
keep optimism in check.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Wednesday evening when Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak appeared
together at the White House, Syria's two state-run television
stations were broadcasting the dramas that are a staple of this
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   But even Damascus has begun to lift old restraints, to provide
Syrians with a taste of a possible future peace. Wednesday morning,
for the first time anyone here can remember, the front page of each
of Syria's government-controlled newspapers displayed a photograph
of an Israeli prime minister, Barak _ whose country is still
Syria's declared foe _ on his way to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And on the evening news, extensive Syrian television coverage of
the scene in the White House Rose Garden included, in full, the
statement delivered by Barak, although some deft editing made it
appear that al-Sharaa had spoken first.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, whose government has long worked overtime to control
citizens' perceptions, the Internet and mobile telephones are still
banned, except to a small elite sector. Newspapers and television
stations are not permitted to voice dissent, at least when it comes
to foreign affairs and President Hafez Assad's policies.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been the appearance of seamless consensus among
citizens who tend to echo an unswerving government line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want peace, but it will come down to the land,'' said
Michel Achkar, a 35-year-old electrical engineer. ``Syrians believe
in peace, but only if we get our land back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a national hunger for news often exceeds what the
government is willing to provide. Wednesday in particular, visits
to homes and offices almost invariably found that stations were
turned to foreign outlets, including Radio Monte Carlo, which
provides Arab-language broadcasts, and even to an Arab-language
Israeli television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Rahil, the headmaster, now lives in a refugee camp about 10
miles south of Damascus. Now 40, he was just 8 in 1967, when the
Golan was captured by Israel and his family fled.
</P>
<P>
   His new home, once a field of tents, has evolved over the years
into a village of cinder-block houses. The population of 50,000 is
divided about equally between those who fled Palestinian lands in
1948 and 1967 and those driven from the Golan, a main battle zone
of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   At least 500,000 Syrians, officials say, have roots in the
Golan, out of a total Syrian population of 16 million. Today, the
land, still furrowed with minefields and full of Israeli military
outposts, is home to 17,000 Israeli settlers and about 20,000
Syrians, most of them Druse, who stayed behind after the conflict.
Even now, people like Rahil describe vivid memories of Israeli
bombardment and of the truck that carried them northward, into
Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Rahil advertises his patriotism on school walls
adorned with murals that pay tribute to Assad, Syria's ruler for
the last 30 years. But he still likes to hear the news from abroad,
he said, and managed a few years ago to scrape up the $100
necessary to buy a share in a satellite dish that makes foreign
channel-surfing possible.
</P>
<P>
   His mood remained cautious; the Israelis, he said, are experts
in ``procrastinating and prevaricating.''
</P>
<P>
   One street away, however, Abu Hassan al-Masri, 80, another
refugee from the Golan, showed a darker side of the Syrian mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to work,'' Masri almost spat when asked about
the talks in Washington. ``Peace doesn't work with the Israelis,
only war.''

MEMBERS OF TRIPPS' BRIDGE CLUB SAY THEY KNEW ABOUT TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite hed.)  
DW) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ Four friends of Linda R. Tripp, three of
them regular partners in her weekly bridge game, told a Maryland
court Wednesday that they were aware she had secretly tape-recorded
conversations with Monica Lewinsky before it was disclosed in the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Mancuso, a neighbor who is not a bridge club member,
told the court, ``I knew about the tape recorder before it came out
in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court ruled on
Tuesday that to try Mrs. Tripp on charges that she violated state
wiretapping laws, Maryland prosecutors must show that they gathered
evidence independently of the independent counsel's investigation
of Mrs. Lewinsky's relationship with President Clinton. The
counsel's office gave Mrs. Tripp immunity from prosecution in
exchange for her cooperation and her handing over the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp was indicted on charges of knowingly violating
Maryland's law against taping another person without that person's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland prosecutors have said that they learned of the four
women, who testified before the grand jury, independently of the
counsel's investigation. Prosecutors have said that the women told
the grand jury that as early as October 1997, Mrs. Tripp freely
talked about taping someone named Monica who was having an affair
with Clinton and even invited Mrs. Lewinsky to a Christmas party so
the friends could meet her. Only one of the women in court
Wednesday said she had never heard Mrs. Tripp say anything about
the taping, but she suggested she was aware of it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The women were not questioned closely about their conversations
with Mrs. Tripp because they were there only for the purpose of
allowing the court to determine whether their testimony was
influenced by the barrage of news accounts about the impeachment
report to Congress by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They all asserted that their grand jury testimony about Mrs.
Tripp was based solely on their own experience and unrelated to
news accounts. One woman, Kathy Sarkis, said she first heard about
the Starr report as ``some referral to some sexual thing, and I
didn't read about it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers worked hard to suggest that the women's accounts
were influenced by the news accounts of the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   David Irwin, one of Mrs. Tripp's lawyers, asked Ms. Mancuso in
cross-examination: ``You were confused then and you're confused
now, and it's all a big blur, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Sarkis, he asked, ``Your brain had been saturated with
Ken Starr, the office of the independent counsel and all this
stuff, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said.

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR EASILY WINS ANOTHER TERM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the end, it was not even close. With a
victory margin of 20 points, Mayor Willie Brown could sit back
Wednesday and proclaim his re-election a people's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brown, beginning a self-described campaign to be ``a
mayor for all the people,'' sounded uncharacteristically tired, and
frankly relieved, the morning after winning the hardest-fought
victory of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in campaigns for 35 years,'' he said, grinning.
``This one absolutely takes the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Tom Ammiano, defeated but hardly humbled, went
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past two months, we have made history,'' Ammiano
said. ``San Francisco has been transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by San Francisco's offbeat standards, this race between two
liberal Democrats _ one African-American, one gay _ was unusual.
Ammiano, the president of the city's Board of Supervisors, had
jumped into what had been a three-candidate race as a write-in
candidate barely three weeks before the Nov. 2 election. His
populist platform, championing tenants over landlords and
mom-and-pop businesses over big chains, captured 25 percent of the
vote, becoming one of the most successful write-in candidacies in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, the former speaker of the California Assembly and one
of the state's most powerful politicians, Ammiano's candidacy,
which energized thousands of voters disenchanted with the mayor and
his conservative rivals, seemed to pose a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   But Ammiano's fervent base of support, with many volunteers new
to campaigns, never grew. The struggling homeowners and
small-business owners whom Ammiano tried to speak to seemed scared
off by Brown's repeated assertions that a Mayor Ammiano would raise
taxes. In debates over six weeks, Brown hammered Ammiano with a
conservative-sounding barrage of complaints. Ammiano, he said, was
an inexperienced free spender who would not forge a consenus among
the city's competing interests and would send developers running
scared.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ammiano's vows to scrutinize corporate tax breaks and
fight for an $11 per hour minimum ``living wage'' did alarm
developers and corporate business owners. Mark Mosher, a spokesman
for San Franciscans for Sensible Government, a business-sponsored
political action committee, spent at least $500,000 on Brown's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, executive director of the Chinese American Voters
Education Committee, said that in at least one voting precinct,
half the absentee ballots had Chinese surnames _ a sign that the
sensible government committee's campaign to get Asian-American
voters to cast absentee votes for the mayor had worked.
</P>
<P>
   Others helping Brown in the sometimes bitter election battle
included President Clinton, who recorded a telephone campaign call
for the mayor, and virtually every segment of the local and state
Democratic political establishment, not to mention the local
Republican Party and other special interest political action
committees. Brown's campaign received as much as $2 million from
these independent committees, including $1.4 million in the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The committees flooded the city with fliers and television and
newspaper advertisements. So did the mayor's campaign, which spent
$3.1 million on the election. Ammiano's campaign spent less than
$300,000, much of it on posters and fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who turned 58 Wednesday, would have been the first
openly gay mayor in what is the gay mecca of the nation. But
neither sexual orientation nor race were major issues in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, at the nightclub where Ammiano conceded at
12:15 a.m. _ long after Brown gave a 20-minute victory speech _
supporters said they were upset that the outcome had not been
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a dream to think Tom would win,'' said Serena
McClusky, a 31-year-old free-lance artist who moved to San
Francisco from New Jersey six years ago and had never voted here
before. ``But I thought the spread would be maybe 10 points or
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Close does not begin to describe the city's race for district
attorney. The incumbent, Terence Hallinan, a political progressive
who has emphasized rehabilitation programs over prison for
nonviolent petty offenders, led his challenger, Bill Fazio, a
veteran prosecutor, by 425 votes with all the precincts counted.
The Department of Elections said it would take one to two weeks to
count up to 14,000 absentee and provisional ballots, which include
ballots from voters who voted at the wrong polling place or whose
names were not on the rolls at their polling place.

 &HT;    Turning old computers into cash
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you can envision an industrial park as an
ecosystem with recycled computer components as links in the food
chain, you're well on your way to understanding J.D. Porter's
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Porter believes that old motherboards and monitors could not
only feed his Austin computer recycling business but the entire
Central Texas economy, and he is part of a local nonprofit group
that wants to create a place where that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Porter and other representatives of what's being called
the Computer and Electronic Disposition Eco-Industrial Park will go
before the Austin City Council to ask for support for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As unconventional as their idea might sound, an industrial park
centered around computer recycling is already getting some serious
support. The group just won a $200,000 federal grant to study the
feasibility of the project and is being backed by researchers at
the University of Texas at Austin and the Microelectronics and
Computer Technology Corp. research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the time is right for the city to step up to the plate and
make this thing happen,'' said Porter, who is also chairman of the
city's solid waste advisory board and former executive director of
Ecology Action, an Austin recycling group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the group's plans, it would develop an industrial park
that would be anchored by a computer recycling company. The company
would remove and resell computer parts for refurbishing or scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Other tenants in the park would include companies that could use
the old components. Automakers are one example of companies that
have expressed an interest in getting easy access to recycled
plastic, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   MCC and UT researchers would also work at the park, studying how
components could be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group would like the city to assist it in applying for more
funding, selecting a site, tackling permits and studying work force
development opportunities. A year ago, the City Council asked the
city to develop a plan for participating in the eco-industrial park
project but that plan never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said he would like Austin to lead efforts to reuse those
materials and an eco-industrial park could be the cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   Computer recycling is becoming an established industry locally
and nationally, but eco-industrial parks, where businesses come
together to reduce waste and damage to the environment, are
unproven concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Eco-industrial parks have been embraced by the Smart Growth
movement and talked about in scores of cities around the country.
They are currently being developed in about 25 cities, but the
process is a slow one. Projects that were conceived in the early
1990s have only recently recruited their first tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of small community groups _ nonprofits, nongovernmental
organizations _ who have really pushed this idea have really run up
against ... how you pay for it,'' said Rick Luna, director of
communications for the Brownsville Economic Development Council,
which also explored a park where tenant companies would cooperate
to reduce and reuse waste materials in 1993 but never got it going.
It also got a federal feasibility grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was that companies were not going to up and move
just to be in an eco-industrial park,'' Luna said. ``Something like
this could affect their bottom line but it wasn't going to drive
their relocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's group, which is also headed by Greg Pitts,
environmental director for MCC, and local businessman Garland
Luedecke, believes it is proposing the first eco-industrial park to
focus on only one industry _ computer recycling _ and to include
facilities for research and development and a small business
incubator.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for computer recycling is growing. Americans discard
about 12 million computers a year, creating 600 millions pounds of
equipment. Environmental activists say much of that equipment, some
of which contains plastics that aren't biodegradable and dangerous
heavy metals, ends up in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity here,'' said council member Daryl
Slusher, who favors the project. ``It's a problem that cities ...
are going to increasingly face of what to do with electronic
equipment that's outdated, and we know it gets outdated real
fast.'' But this may be the wrong time for an eco-industrial park
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parks that have progressed the farthest elsewhere
have been developed in economically depressed areas of the country,
such as Plattsburgh, N.Y., and Cape Charles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, Luna believes that the park was put on the back
burner as the Texas economy surged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been busy enough without this project,'' Luna said.
``The way it was told to me was, `When things slow down, this is
one of the first things we're going to look at.'''

MCCAIN AND BRADLEY COLLECT IMPRESSIVE SUMS FROM SOFT-MONEY
CONTRIBUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BRADLEY-MCCAIN) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill
Bradley plan to meet on Thursday to demand an end to unregulated
corporate contributions known as soft money, executives of
companies that are among the biggest soft-money donors continue to
pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are scheduled to hold a rare bipartisan
meeting in Claremont, N.H., on Thursday to underscore their call
for an overhaul of the campaign financing system, including the
elimination of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   But employees of many of the same corporations that provide
six-figure soft-money donations to both parties also provide
substantial sums to the campaigns of McCain and Bradley, albeit in
amounts that meet the $1,000 limit to individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from corporations that include Citigroup, BellSouth,
Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and Goldman, Sachs _ companies that are among the
biggest sources of soft money for both parties _ have given scores
of $1,000 contributions to McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, nor Bradley,
the former senator from New Jersey, have proposed to outlaw or
limit these $1,000 gifts to individual office seekers; they would
only eliminate the corporations' much larger donations to political
parties, which are often used to directly support the parties'
candidates for federal office.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's problem is with the corporations, unions and
individuals who contribute $100,000 to the parties, not the
individuals who give $1,000 to candidates,'' said Howard Opinsky, a
spokesman for McCain. ``The most pernicious part of the campaign
finance law is the loophole that allows these unregulated amounts
of money to find their way into the political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees of Goldman, Sachs have given $209,000 to Bradley and
$41,383 to McCain, according to Federal Election Commission
records. So far this year, the investment bank has contributed
$281,000 in soft money to the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup executives have given a total $100,000 to Bradley and
McCain; the company has given the parties more than $328,000.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of AT&AMP;T _ a company with significant issues before
the Senate Commerce Committee, which McCain heads _ have donated at
least $16,000 to the McCain campaign. AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest
source of soft money, with gifts to the two parties totaling
$954,000 already this year.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for an end to such unregulated soft-money
contributions to the parties, McCain has collected more than $14
million for his pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination,
more than $5 million since Sept. 30, when his slow-starting
campaign began to pick up steam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has qualified for more than $5 million in matching funds
and will abide by the state-by-state spending limits that go with
them, Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator still lags far behind Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who has collected more than $60 million in contributions and
has announced that he will not accept federal matching funds or the
spending caps they require.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who advocates public financing of political campaigns
and a ban on soft money, has raised more than $25 million this
year, the majority of it in $1,000 increments from wealthy donors,
according to aides and to records filed with the election
commission. But aides said successful fund-raising on the Internet
as well as a growing direct-mail operation had recently brought in
thousands of smaller donors whose donations range from $2 to a few
hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has applied for $8.2 million in federal matching funds
that will be delivered shortly after Jan. 1 for use in the
presidential primaries, said Tony Wyche, a Bradley campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign, which had raised $24 million
by Sept. 30, continues to hold fund-raising events and prospect for
donations though the mail and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's appearance by McCain and Bradley will focus on what
they call the evils of soft money, aides said. It is intended to
appeal to independents and to reform-minded voters whom they hope
will catapult them ahead of their better-financed opponents, Bush
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on campaign finance estimate that the two parties will
bank $525 million or more in big special-interest contributions in
this election cycle, more than double the $262 million in soft
money given to the parties in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic parties will spend at least $300
million of that to support their presidential nominees. That is in
addition to the $66 million in public funds that the major party
nominees will receive for the general election campaign in the fall
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the political money race, like the arms
race of the Cold War, produces more money than the system can
absorb. Most soft money will be spent on repetitive advertising,
which will simply bounce off a shell-shocked electorate, said Fred
Wertheimer of Democracy 21, a private group that advocates campaign
finance law revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that in the absence of this money we
wouldn't have a very healthy, very competitive race for
president,'' Wertheimer said. ``This stuff pours in because there's
no restraint on it.''

TRANSIT WORKERS WIN BIG PAY INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tentative contract that the transit workers union
reached early Wednesday calls for an increase of more than 18
percent in take-home pay over three years, giving subway and bus
workers the largest wage increase received by any of New York
City's public-employee unions in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement enabled Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to declare victory
over transit workers who favored a strike, but the contract's
sizable wage increases could create problems for him in next year's
bargaining with unions representing 300,000 municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
just minutes after a threatened midnight strike deadline averted a
much-feared walkout and allowed the city to return to normal on
Wednesday, except for a few disruptions during the morning rush
hour. A strike would have left the 3.5 million riders who use the
transit system every day scrambling to find other means of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement giving transit workers a 7 percent
compensation increase on average in the first year, union leaders
immediately said it would at a minimum influence the city's
contract negotiations and might perhaps serve as a model in an era
of budget surpluses and economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   After accounting for inflation, several union officials said it
was easily the most generous contract involving city workers since
the early 1980s, except for a tentative contract reached on
Wednesday for the city's school principals. That one-of-a-kind deal
awards a 33 percent pay increase in exchange for the principals'
giving up tenure and working longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, public-employee unions have faced
lean times because of city and state budget deficits and been
forced to accept pay freezes or at best modest increases.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union said they
would begin mailing ratification ballots to members this week, with
the outcome announced in the second half of January. But several
leaders of a militant dissident faction said they would campaign
hard for rejection because, in their view, the contract was not
generous enough and contained concessions on work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached at 1 a.m. on Wednesday after five days of
feverish negotiations, includes a 12 percent increase in base wages
over three years _ 5 percent in the first year, 3 percent in the
second and 4 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also provides for a further increase in take-home pay _
amounting to more than 6 percent over three years _ by allowing
workers to greatly reduce their pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference, Giuliani praised the union leaders
for deciding not to strike, but he took pains to argue that the
contract agreement would have no influence on the city's labor
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our settlement,'' Giuliani said. ``The Transit
Authority is a state agency, not a city agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that other unions would look to the transit
workers' contract as a model, he warned municipal labor leaders
that he would not accept a similar contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall percentages would be much too high for the city
and it would cause significant deficits that would add to a deficit
the city already has in out years,'' he said. ``Whatever pattern is
set is one for the state to have to deal with. It has nothing to do
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials said on Tuesday that they could afford the wage
increases included in the accord, adding that they had achieved
their chief goal of getting the union to agree to more flexible
work rules that would help hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, union rules that limit certain bus mechanics to
doing engine work will be loosened so that they can also do chassis
or brake repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many commuters rejoiced on Wednesday that there was an agreement
rather than a strike. Robert Jones, a Microsoft-New York general
manager who lives in Fairfield, Conn., said, ``I mostly use cabs to
get around the city and if there had been a strike it would have
been nearly impossible to get one today, so it's a big relief.''

 GROUP OF INSURERS WILL PAY FOR EXPERIMENTAL CANCER THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GINA KOLATA and KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number of insurance companies have decided in recent weeks to
pay for experimental treatments for cancer, but only for
policyholders who participate in clinical trials sanctioned by
federal health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, virtually all insurance companies routinely refused
to pay for the care of patients in clinical research. They argued
that experimental drugs and procedures were not covered by their
policies because they had not been deemed effective.
</P>
<P>
   But with these recent decisions, the insurance industry has
begun to signal a willingness to finance medical research, a change
that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers are acting partly out of frustration. Currently,
many researchers cannot find enough patients to volunteer for
studies that determine whether treatments work. With their new
initiatives, the insurers hope to funnel more patients into
scientifically valid studies so that the effectiveness of a
treatment can be determined more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs are limited in scope, restricted to a single
state or adopted on a test basis. The most prominent effort is
expected to be announced Thursday by Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of leading health insurers _ including Oxford Health
Plans, Cigna HealthCare, Aetna/U S Healthcare and Prudential
HealthCare _ has agreed to pay for New Jersey cancer patients in
all phases of research, from the initial safety tests of a new
procedure or drug to preliminary tests of efficacy to large-scale
studies comparing a promising treatment with the standard one.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers, members of the New Jersey Association of Health
Plans, include most health insurance companies in the state, paying
or administering benefits for 60 percent of New Jersey residents,
or 4.8 million people. The plan would cover all policyholders
directly insured by the companies; employer plans administered by
the companies would be offered the benefit at no additional
premium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Coventry Health Care, a managed care company with
1.4 million members in the Midwest, South and mid-Atlantic regions,
in recent weeks began a pilot program in which it will pay for
patients who enroll in cancer studies testing the efficacy of new
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One big insurer _ United Healthcare _ has tried this approach
with little success for a year, but experts have long argued that
the only way such a system would work would be if a broad swath of
insurance companies adopted similar strategies. This would
guarantee a large enough pool of potential test subjects in
concentrated markets to allowed studies to proceed. The decisions
in recent weeks mark the first time that a large number of
influential companies has committed to reversing these decades-old
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and patient advocates said the new initiatives could
counteract a growing trend of doctors performing experimental
procedures outside the confines of a clinical trial. Patients have
been attracted to those studies because they were guaranteed the
experimental treatment, whereas in a clinical trial they might be
assigned the standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers often rejected claims for such procedures. But often
they would end up paying for them anyway, under orders from the
courts in individual cases, or because state legislatures mandated
that a particular treatment be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, studies that would determine if the treatments were
effective languished for lack of patients. The result, according to
cancer specialists, has been a significant slowing in the search
for cures. Cancer researchers estimate that just 3 to 5 percent of
adults with cancer enroll in clinical trials, while in New Jersey,
only 2 percent enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the new initiatives, advocates for cancer patients and
other groups were delighted, saying they would provide new
incentives for patients to participate in valid research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very good news,'' said Dr. Henry E. Simmons, president
of the National Coalition on Health Care, a group of about 80
organizations. ``It is very gratifying that we've recognized the
need to answer these questions of whether therapies work before the
American people are exposed to experimental therapies of unproven
efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This should be a powerful tool to bring the problem
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition,
said, ``I think it's incredibly great news.'' She added:
``Ultimately, everyone benefits from this kind of policy. I think
it's a recognition that there's a human cry about quality care in
this country. But we don't know what quality is until we do
clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing payments for clinical trials on cancer treatments vary.
For research on drugs, a pharmaceutical company typically pays only
for the drug and not for the accompanying medical care. That often
can include expensive hospital stays, diagnostic tests, antibiotics
and doctors' bills. For procedures, typically the patient is
responsible for all medical costs. There are exceptions for other
medical conditions in which the ancillary costs of research are not
high, but that is rarely found in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   With the new programs, experimental procedures would probably
become more difficult to obtain outside trials, and doctors would
have a harder time offering them in those markets. Some patients
who want an experimental procedure might be assigned instead to a
comparison group that received the best standard care. But studies
have shown that many experimental treatments are actually less
effective than standard treatments. And, advocates for cancer
patients said, patients would benefit from the new policies because
promising treatments could be more quickly assessed and those that
work more quickly adopted.

 &HT;    Qtera lands billion-dollar deal with Norter
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ One huge local deal, about 70 freshly minted
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest deal ever made for a Palm Beach County company,
Nortel Networks said it will pay $3.25 billion in stock for Boca
Raton-based Qtera Corp., founded just last year with not 1 cent in
sales _ but with light transmission technology that's worth
billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half of the company will be millionaires,'' said Qtera
spokesman Jay Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel _ the Ontario-based former Bell Canada and world leader
in the sale of fiber optic equipment _ paid a premium price for
Qtera to grab high-speed data transmission technology that would
give it an edge over networking rivals Lucent Technologies, Cisco
Systems and Ciena Corp. The four are locked in a battle over which
can build the fastest fiber optic transmission ``pipeline'' at the
lowest cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and speed are really of the essence here, and that's what
Qtera brings,'' Nortel Vice President Clarence Chandran said in a
teleconference with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel and Qtera plan to complete the deal in the first quarter
of next year. It needs approval of Qtera shareholders and
government antitrust regulators. Nortel expects to incorporate
Qtera's devices into its networks by mid- to late-2000, Qtera
co-founder and Vice President Bob Ade said.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera's technology is worth the billions that Nortel is paying,
analysts said. Qtera's equipment will speed light signals over
fiber-optic lines farther than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   A light signal fades after 250 to 375 miles. Then it must be
converted to electrical signals, amplified and reconverted to light
before it's sent on its way. Qtera's equipment sends the light
racing 1,500 miles before it needs amplification. The company says
it can transmit light 2,500 miles, although it hasn't yet tested
its equipment for that distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are with optical networks today is at art form
level,'' Nortel's Chandran said. ``This is a combination of art and
science. This, in effect, allows us to push the outside of the
envelope for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending light a greater distance without amplification
translates to lower costs to operate fiber optic networks because
less equipment is needed to boost the signal. That also means lower
costs for every network user, including Internet access providers
and cable TV and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carriers spend in the billions each year on their transfer
equipment,'' Qtera's Ade said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Nortel means not only wealth for Qtera's founders
and employees, but an expansion of its workforce in Boca Raton.
Qtera employs more than 140 people in Boca and 30 in Richardson,
Texas, a suburb of Dallas where Nortel and other telecommunications
companies have plants.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, Nortel plans to house up to 250 in Qtera's
32,000 square feet of offices at 6100 Broken Sound Parkway in Boca
Raton, which it moved into just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Fahri Diner will continue to run Qtera, although
the company will lose its name when it becomes part of Nortel's
Optical Networks Division. Qtera is a combination of the letter
``Q,'' the designation for high-quality transmission lines, and
``tera,'' for terabit, or 1 trillion bits a second, the industry
goal for sending data over fiber optic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Four venture capital firms pumped $43 million into Qtera for 68
percent of the company and three of its six board seats. If those
investors get 68 percent of the Nortel stock in the deal, they'll
walk away with $2.21 billion. Qtera executives and employees would
get $1.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much will go to venture capitalists, Qtera CEO Diner
said: ``Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nortel will issue 30 million to 48 million shares to pay for
Qtera. The final amount will be determined by Nortel's stock price
at a given time before the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel (NYSE: NT) closed Wednesday at $88.63, up 56 cents a
share. Based on that stock price, Nortel would issue 37 million
shares for Qtera.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera executives and venture capitalists won't be able to sell
all their stock immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a (stock) vesting schedule,'' Qtera's Ade said. ``You
have to stick around to reap all the benefits of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 months ago, Diner and four people he recruited founded
Qtera. His goal: to fill the data transmission market's need for
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Diner, who worked at Siemens Information and Communication
Networks in Boca Raton, believed it would be easier to develop
leading-edge technology in a small, fast-moving start-up than in a
big, bureaucratic corporation. He wanted Boca Raton to be called
Photon Beach for the particles that make up light.
</P>
<P>
   His Qtera recruits:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ade, 38, from JDS Uniphase, a telecommunications component
manufacturer in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chief Engineer Ian Haskell, 40, from Alcatel in France.
Haskell and Diner had been customers of Ade's at Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vice President of Business Development Rick Aversano, 45, from
SkyDirect, a satellite service. Aversano and Diner had worked
together at Italian cable installer Pirelli Cables &AMP; Systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chief Scientist Xiang-Dong Cao, 36, from Siemens, where he met
Diner.
</P>
<P>
   The Qtera lineup: Diner as the visionary, Cao as the technical
wizard, Haskell as the specialist in long-haul data transmission,
Ade as the product development leader and Aversano as the venture
capital liaison. All soon will be very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Aversano also led in brokering the Nortel deal, but the others
became involved when Nortel wanted to see the technology work, Ade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Diner and Ade declined to say how long it took to make the deal,
but Ade said it began when Qtera started talking with several
companies, including Nortel, on a strategic partnership to develop
and use the technology. Cisco Systems is believed to be among the
companies Qtera talked to.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications, a buyer of Nortel equipment, last month
completed successful data transmission tests in Colorado of Qtera's
equipment. Qwest, a fiber optic network company, sent the light
data 1,440 miles. That changed the complexion of the talks with
Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sure heightened their interest,'' Ade said. ``The tests
were a stamp of validation, and they got a stamp of approval from a
very interested third party,'' Ade said, referring to Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's Chadran said Qtera would begin adding to Nortel's sales
next year, but the deal isn't expected to add to earnings until
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel had $17.5 billion in sales last year and employs 71,300
people worldwide. It has spent the past year gobbling other
companies. It bought Santa Clara, Calif.-based Bay Networks last
year for almost $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortel-Qtera deal dwarfs the second-richest local
transaction: NBC's payment of $415 million in September for a 32
percent stake in West Palm Beach-based Paxson Communications.

 UNDATED: quickly adopted. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insurance companies said their recent decisions to pay for
clinical trials were spurred by the lessons of a recent medical
fiasco _ the efforts to determine whether one expensive and painful
experimental treatment, commonly known as bone marrow transplants,
was any better than standard chemotherapy for advanced breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In October, an article in The New York Times reported on this
decadelong struggle, describing how bone marrow transplants became
widely offered by medical centers and private hospitals even as
studies that could establish whether they were effective foundered
for lack of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, head of the division of solid tumor oncology
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said in
interviews for the article that when he tried to enroll patients in
a study to see whether bone marrow transplants were effective,
insurers would refuse to pay because the treatment was considered
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   But often health insurers would pay for bone marrow transplants
given to women outside the studies because courts or state laws had
deemed the procedure, when offered outside clinical trials, to be
standard care.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when results from the studies of the procedure were
finally announced, they failed to provide solid evidence that it
was helping patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard J. Mansheim, chief medical officer at Coventry
Health Care, said his company had been considering paying for
experimental cancer therapies but the decision was ``hardened'' by
The Times' article on bone marrow transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey initiative began nearly a year ago when a group
of cancer researchers, patient advocates, drug companies, ethicists
and health insurers began asking how to increase the number of
cancer patients in clinical trials. They agreed earlier this year
to pay for the large studies to determine efficacy but only now
have agreed to pay for all phases of clinical research.
</P>
<P>
   As the group negotiated, said Ann Marie Hill, a group member who
is the executive director of the New Jersey Commission on Cancer
Research, the bone marrow transplant experience was foremost in the
group's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very valuable example of why clinical trials need
to be supported by everyone: patients, physicians and insurers,''
she said. ``If we had to give one example that made it clear to
everyone why it's important, this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both that New Jersey group and Coventry had a serious concern
about paying for clinical trials. They wanted to be sure that
coverage advanced medical science and did not just enrich medical
entrepreneurs. The problem is that once insurance coverage is
guaranteed, doctors can set up what are actually pseudo-studies,
ones that provide patients with experimental treatments for what is
often a hefty fee but that contribute nothing to the quest to learn
whether the treatments actually work.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent such abuses, the New Jersey group stipulated that it
would pay only for studies approved or authorized by the National
Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the
Department of Defense, or the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Coventry said it would pay only for studies sanctioned by the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides access for people to be in clinical trials that
are real trials and not just someone deciding to take advantage of
an economic opportunity,'' said Dr. Joseph Carver, senior medical
director at Aetna/ U S Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurance companies say that theirs is only the first
step. Doctors have to start suggesting that patients enroll in
clinical trials and patients have to start signing up. The New
Jersey group hopes to facilitate patient enrollment by educating
doctors and patients about the importance of clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   One small sector of cancer research has already proven that the
approach being adopted by the insurance companies can work.
Pediatric cancer specialists organized themselves into two major
consortiums that have effectively served as seals of approval for
valid medical studies. With such quality controls in place, the
pediatricians have been able to successfully lobby health insurance
companies to pay for medical care in clinical trials for children.
In essence, the pediatricians' efforts reassured the companies that
they would not be picking up the costs for research of little
scientific value.

ALLIANCE HOLDS RISKS FOR BRADLEY AND MCCAIN

   WASHINGTON _ Sen John McCain is a Goldwater conservative from
Arizona. Former Sen. Bill Bradley is more of a Kennedy liberal from
New Jersey. McCain is carefree (for a politician) and combative.
Bradley is calm and contemplative.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their designs on the White House, the two politicians
have virtually nothing in common. If anything, McCain and Bradley
should be eyeing each other warily as they compete for the
allegiance of independent voters in the crucial first primary state
of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two will appear side by side in Claremont, N.H., on
Thursday, holding forth on the one fundamental issue upon which
they agree: campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for their curious alliance is that Bradley and
McCain do share common ground in that they both present themselves
as reformers who want to transform how campaigns are financed. And
they are each trying to catch the front-runners in their parties.
To do that, they need every assist they can muster, including _
remarkably to many politicians _ each other's help.
</P>
<P>
   By standing together, McCain and Bradley hope to draw far more
attention than if either staged yet another
campaign-finance-related event (or, in the less charitable
description, publicity stunt.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get us that cherished national coverage,'' said Mike
Murphy, a strategist for McCain. ``We're trying to move this to the
front pages.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is not without risks. There is the chance that
one politician will outshine the other.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, the event will cause consternation in their own
parties. Already Wednesday, aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican front-runner, questioned McCain's party loyalty by
consorting with the enemy. And aides to Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner, accused Bradley of resorting to a stunt
because he is feeling heat from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting a deal with the enemy for political advantage is not a
way to endear yourself to Republican or Democratic primary
voters,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant.
``The most partisan voters are the ones they need first in the
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic strategist, said: ``They run the
risk that they'll be seen as holier-than-thou or that people will
see it as a stunt. And there's always a goody-two-shoes aspect to
anything having to do with ethics: You'd better be sure that you're
cleaner than clean _ past, present and future.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the brickbats, McCain, in a speech Wednesday in
Spartanburg, S.C., drew a distinction between himself and Bradley.
``Bill Bradley is a liberal Democrat,'' he said. ``I am a proud
conservative. We disagree on almost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But they agree, he said _ echoing Bradley's line when he retired
from the Senate in 1996 _ ``that politics is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also disputed allegations from the Bush camp that his
support for overhauling the campaign finance system would endanger
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this assault on the taxpayer by breaking Washington's
iron triangle of money, lobbying and special interests is the
mission of this campaign,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean taking on
the Republican Party, it means a grass-roots movement to lead our
party back from a leadership that has too often forgotten our
conservative purpose and too often surrendered to Washington's
big-money-driven status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perils, the two candidates with starkly different
goals, ideologies and personalities decided that for practical
political reasons they were better off uniting.
</P>
<P>
   It would be rash to dismiss the political instincts of both men,
each of whom has emerged from dark-horse status to having at least
a shot at toppling a front-runner. McCain and Bradley are running
neck and neck to Bush and Gore in New Hampshire. And both have
nimbly capitalized on their compelling personal stories (McCain's
service in Vietnam and Bradley's basketball days.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there trying to ding each other,'' said Murphy,
the McCain strategist. ``We'll show that McCain has the courage to
tell the truth about what special-interest, big-monied interests
have done to our conservative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering some gratis spin for Bradley, Murphy added: ``It allows
Bradley to put a hot foot on Al Gore for his participation in the
shameless Clinton-Gore campaign scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's communications director, Anita Dunn, sounding like her
candidate, was understated in describing the two politicians'
mutual benefit. ``It's the opportunity to demonstrate to voters
that there is the potential to actually get this done,'' she said,
``that leaders can reach across party lines _ even people who
disagree with each other on almost every other issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was first broached by the McCain camp, which may have
the most to gain. McCain has fewer resources and a smaller
political operation than Bradley, so he is especially dependent on
free attention in the press. And McCain is even more identified
with campaign finance than Bradley, so he could come off as a more
dominant figure at the event. In addition, with an important
Democratic debate in New Hampshire on Friday, any ground Bradley
gains on Thursday could quickly be overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich shook
hands in Claremont in 1995 and promised a commission on campaign
finance, the idea never materialized. And both men were skewered in
the press as not being duly committed to changing the system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley could benefit from the event, though, because after
weeks of attacks from Gore, he has been on the defensive. So
sharing the stage with McCain, whose campaign has hit its stride in
recent weeks, could add some luster to Bradley. It would also
reinforce the message pushed by his image-makers that he is not a
business-as-usual Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dunn said the campaign immediately took up the McCain
campaign's offer, though there was some discussion about how it
would play before the debate on Friday with Gore, and another one
on Sunday. ``We discussed whether it would fit into what were were
talking about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster who is not aligned with any
campaign, said McCain was viewed more as a genuine reformer than
Bradley because of his engaging personal style and because he has
pounded away for so long on campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's maverick status is more esoteric,'' she said. ``What
he's still banking on is a significant anti-Gore block of voters
that is out there.'' Because McCain is still in the Senate making
waves, she added, ``He's got more significant current battles he
can talk about where he's planted the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is determined to depict McCain not as
crusading for the people but as disloyal. ``Any time a Democrat
splits from the Democrats or a Republican splits from the
Republicans,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, ``it's
good for copy _ but it's bad for principle.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how cordial they are to each other on Thursday,
McCain, who is 63, and Bradley, who is 56, are not likely to appear
too chummy. After all, there is the chance _ outlandish as it might
seem _ that the two will face each other next November.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent forum in Florida, Bradley was asked about McCain's
prospects, and replied that he had a chance to grab the Republican
nomination despite Bush's daunting financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John McCain has a chance,'' Bradley said. ``I think
it's possible to raise too much money in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But mindful, perhaps, that he not come off as a McCain devotee,
Bradley added, ``I'm not endorsing him, by the way.''

LAPD SCANDAL COULD LEAD TO REVERSALS IN HUNDREDS OF CONVICTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A widening investigation into accusations of
corruption, brutality and false testimony by police officers in a
gritty, drug-plagued precinct here has forced the review of
hundreds of potentially tainted criminal cases in which suspects
may have been wrongly convicted. The inquiry could involve many
more than that, prosecutors and defense lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said that in his 31 years in the
prosecutor's office, ``there has never been a more important
case,'' because the accusations of false testimony go ``to the
heart of the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said his deputies were already offering anecdotal
reports that the scandal in the precinct, the Rampart Division, was
hurting their conviction rates in other, unrelated cases. He said
he did not have statistics to buttress that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the investigation surfaced in September, when
prosecutors won the release of a gang member serving a 23-year
sentence for assault on the police after a former rogue officer
told investigators that he and a partner had handcuffed and shot
the man, who was unarmed, then framed him by planting a gun near
his paralyzed body three years ago. Since then, nine other verdicts
have been reversed, and 13 officers have been dismissed or relieved
of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney said Wednesday that he did not know
whether a handful, or 20 or 30, or 100 officers might ultimately be
involved, in a department of some 10,000, but he vowed to ``go
wherever the investigation leads us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had seven lawyers working on the case full time, and
was prepared to add another 20 if needed. The public defender's
office said it might have to request additional money or lawyers to
handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said at a brief news conference Wednesday morning that
hundreds of other cases were being reviewed as possibly tainted,
and said the inquiry would take many months. But he scoffed at an
estimate by public defenders that as many as 3,000 cases might have
to be reconsidered, a figure first reported in Wednesday's editions
of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have been looking at hundreds of cases,''
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kalunian, the county's assistant public defender, said
3,000 was the number of cases, provided by the district attorney's
office, in which about 10 of the suspected officers had played any
role over the past 10 years, from transporting arrested people to
jail, to offering substantive testimony at trial. Kalunian said it
was not yet clear in how many cases the officers had even played a
substantive part, much less given deceptive testimony, and that a
review was under way, beginning with the cases of people currently
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly all 3,000 cases are not going to be reopened, but I
can't tell you how many will be,'' Kalunian said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of police agencies around the nation
have grappled with scandals over false testimony by corrupt
officers, a practice known in police lingo as ``testilying.'' But
Edwin H. Delattre, the dean of the school of education at Boston
University and a national expert on police ethics, said that the
Los Angeles situation was ``the worst case of a poisoned well in a
police department that I've seen in 25 years, and the work that has
to be done will be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Delattre helped the New York State Police in an inquiry into
evidence-tampering in the early 1990s that ultimately involved
about eight troopers required about 120,000 hours of investigation
of potentially tainted cases.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the allegations here are shocking, an ``L.A.
Confidential'' come to lurid life.
</P>
<P>
   The former officer, Rafael A. Perez, who was convicted of
stealing cocaine from an evidence locker and seeking to lighten his
sentence, told investigators that he and a former partner, Nino
Durden, intentionally shot a known drug-gang member, Javier
Francisco Ovando, at point-blank range in a 1996 raid, then planted
a .22 caliber rifle to make it seem he had attacked them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the authorities have been forced to review not only
cases handled by those two officers, but by other partners and
associates in a widening circle in an anti-gang street crime unit
known as CRASH at the Rampart station just west of downtown. The
Los Angeles Police Department has commissioned a sweeping internal
review, due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have for weeks declined to predict just where
the investigation will lead. The review has already forced
suspension of an injunction intended to bar gang members from
congregating, because of fears that statements by officers in
support of the measure may have been false.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, no criminal charges have been filed against the
suspended officers, and Garcetti said Wednesday that his first
priority remained to free anyone wrongly imprisoned, then to help
the police in finding officers who should be fired and finally
developing evidence sufficient to prosecute any officers guilty of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick J. Bobb, a special counsel to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors who served as a deputy counsel to the
Christopher Commission, which recommended a raft of procedural
changes to the police here in 1991, after the Rodney King beating,
said the Rampart case had put big burdens on the city's trust in
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire justice system, both the criminal justice system
and the civil justice system, will be put under extraordinary
strain now and into the indefinite future by virtue of the sheer
numbers of cases that will have to be reviewed, and the sheer
numbers of lawsuits that can be anticipated,'' he said. ``I think
that one of the most tragic and disheartening things about the
Rampart scandal is that the LAPD had begun to emerge from the
shadows of Rodney King and the civil disturbances, and the O.J.
Simpson case, and was beginning to resurrect its reputation. This
scandal, I'm afraid, necessarily will set the LAPD back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union has called for appointment of a special prosecutor to take
over the investigation, arguing that the district attorney's
office, which relies on police testimony in most of its cases,
cannot adequately investigate police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's ultimately 300 cases or 3,000 but it's
going to be a whole lot,'' said the group's executive director,
Ramona Ripston. ``We absolutely cannot go on like this.''

GORE TO PROPOSE $115 BILLION PLAN TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asserting that public education may be a local
responsibility but that it should be a national priority, Vice
President Al Gore will propose setting aside $115 billion over the
next 10 years for the nation's public schools as an incentive to
improve teacher quality and student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is scheduled to discuss his proposals at a school in
Nashville on Thursday, wants to establish an education reform trust
fund that would set aside about 10 cents of every dollar of the
budget surplus that is not already dedicated to Social Security or
reduction of the national debt. The surplus is now projected at
$1.084 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Gore's $115 billion proposal, or about $50
billion, would go toward providing universally available preschool
for 3- and 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Another chief element of his plan would provide salary increases
of up to $10,000 to all teachers in high-poverty school districts
if the districts adopted an aggressive plan to improve teacher
quality and get rid of low-performing instructors. Most teachers
would receive a $5,000 increase, paid for by the federal
government, though master teachers who met advanced professional
standards would receive $10,000 increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's lone rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has rarely mentioned education when talking about his
priorities. He has said that while there are things the federal
government can do, education is basically a local issue and big
initiatives should come from the states and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan thus offers Democratic voters a choice between his
proposal for a major federal commitment to education and Bradley's
centerpiece proposal of a large infusion of federal dollars to
improve health care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who says he would not have to raise taxes to pay for his
education plan, has been pounding Bradley for his $65
billion-a-year health plan, which the former senator says he could
pay for out of the projected budget surplus. Gore, whose education
proposal would cost about a fifth of Bradley's health plan,
contends that his rival would probably have to rely on a tax
increase to pay for his initiative.
</P>
<P>
   As for education, Bradley has called for placing 400,000 more
children in Head Start programs and putting 60,000 new teachers in
rural and urban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sketched the broad themes of his education
policy in a speech in May, and on Thursday he will fill in some
blanks about the costs, which his aides say can be met with a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is the first by a presidential candidate that
involves the federal government in paying teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking elements of the proposal is Gore's
willingness to use vast amounts of federal money and federal
control to help influence what many say is a matter that should be
determined by local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government provides 7 percent to 8 percent of
the money for the nation's public schools, education ranks at the
top of most lists of voter priorities. Presidential candidates face
the dilemma of responding to the electorate's plea for better
schools without intruding on local control.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of Gore's proposal include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Signing bonuses to recruit people who come to teaching from
other careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incentives to reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incentives for statewide exams for high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore first outlined his goals in May, Lamar Alexander, a
former education secretary and erstwhile Republican candidate for
president, said the Gore plan amounted to creating ``a national
school board.'' But it was hailed by the nation's big teachers
unions, which have since endorsed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican candidate
for president, has also proposed a fairly substantial role for the
federal government in education. He has said he would move Headto the Department of Education and increase Title I money for
poor schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One big difference between Gore's proposal and Bush's is their
response to failing schools, a major issue on the horizon for many
urban and rural areas. Bush has proposed that after three years of
not meeting certain standards, a public school lose federal funding
and that money be given to students for vouchers to attend private
schools. Republicans generally support vouchers as a way of
expanding educational choice and instilling competition in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has adamantly opposed vouchers, saying they would drain the
public education system. He would respond to failing schools by
requiring them to adopt aggressive plans to overhaul themselves and
would devote extra money to providing after-school instruction to
students.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what standards Gore would use to determine
whether a school was failing or if it had sufficiently improved.
But under the Gore plan, if it had not improved enough it would be
shut down and reopened under a new principal with a full peer
evaluation of every teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, the education trust fund would also
provide signing bonuses of up to $10,000 each to help recruit
75,000 new teachers a year _ 60,000 from among the nation's annual
crop of college graduates and 15,000 from the ranks of mid-life
professionals who want to change careers. The teachers would be
selected by local schools, businesses and teachers, and the bonuses
would go to those who commit to teaching for four years in
high-poverty urban and rural schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would provide incentives to school districts that reduce
the size of classes, with a goal of creating high schools with less
than 600 students. He wants a national average of 18 students per
class in early grades and no more than 20 students in all grades.
</P>
<P>
   He would also give money to states that adopt statewide exams
that students must pass to graduate. At the moment, 26 states have
such exams.

ADVERTISING: GROUP FAVORING ABORTION RIGHTS TO RESUME TV CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pro-Choice Public Education Project, a consortium of
abortion rights groups nationwide, will resume television
advertising for the first time in several years to expand its
efforts to reach young people.
</P>
<P>
   The group will begin broadcasting a 30-second commercial at the
end of December aimed at female viewers 16 to 25 years old. The
commercial will appear in New York and California markets and will
also be released to the project's 50 member organizations for use
in their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Sullivan, the project's director, said that the group
began print and outdoor advertising a year ago and is returning to
TV because of its broader reach and its ability to focus on young
people in the many new shows devoted to young viewers. While
advertising was perhaps unnecessary a generation ago, it is
increasingly required to reach young people today who are not
necessarily moved by any major issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a major battle or there's a shooting, then people
do get up in arms,'' Ms. Sullivan said. Otherwise ``it's hard to
get the emotional response; we know we need to get out positive
messages, and TV advertising is a great way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion rights campaign underscores the growth of
issue-oriented advertising on television. TV has become a
battleground of disparate voices because groups realize the need to
appeal to the public to effect change, said Victor Kamber,
president of the Kamber Group, a Washington communications agency
that creates many issue-oriented ads but has not been involved in
the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollarwise, clearly there's more advocacy advertising because
special interest groups are making decisions to reach out to the
public by getting public attention to motivate legislators,''
Kamber said. ``The more you raise visibility of an issue, the
easier it is to motivate people and get them involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The television spot, created by DeVito/Verdi in New York,
features a shadowy unidentified politician who follows a girl
around and changes all her choices, from her selection of a soda in
a vending machine to her pick of television channels. A narrator
says: ``You wouldn't want some guy in Washington to make choices
for you. Why let them make the most important choice of all. Fight
for your right to a safe and legal abortion while you still have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The message continues its year-old theme, ``It's pro-choice or
no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The group did not disclose its ad budget but said it would spend
more than $1 million, using foundation and individual
contributions. The effort will also finance print and outdoor
advertising and will include a Spanish-language ad for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The existing print and outdoor advertising includes ads with
headlines like ``77 percent of anti-abortion leaders are men. 100
percent of them will never be pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shows platform shoes, a Volkswagen Beetle and a wire
coat hanger under the headline: ``Of all the things from the '70s
to make a comeback, there's one we'd really hate to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is intended to encourage young people to talk about
a highly personal issue that is often not discussed publicly, Ms.
Sullivan said. The project started its campaign, she said, because
it regards various state actions like parental-notification and
consent laws as slowly eroding abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make the link for them that if they believe in
personal choice and having access, that means they are pro-choice
and that that is OK,'' Ms. Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups, like the Right to Life Committee, said
they might run advertising, too, but did not give details. David
O'Steen, the Right to Life Committee's executive director in
Washington, said the group had advertised from time to time, but
that some of its advertising that focused on the process of
abortion had been rejected by media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have run television advertising on the issue.
Pro-Choice Inc. spent $2 million in commercials through August,
according to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks media
spending. And in 1996, the Arthur S. De Moss Foundation, a private
group, spent $18 million on anti-abortion messages, including a
well-known campaign called ``Life _ What a Beautiful Choice.'' The
foundation said it was no longer running those ads, but did not say
when they stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro-Choice Public Education Project has had some difficulty
placing its advertising, but is not expecting much trouble with
this message, said Ellis Verdi, president of DeVito/Verdi. Still,
creating the message was not a simple process, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of choice is a more complicated thought than the idea
that babies are wonderful,'' Verdi said. ``The argument the
anti-choice people have is so much simpler for advertising purposes
_ who is going to argue that children aren't great? The more
complex thought is that perhaps having a child isn't necessarily
the best decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Research showed that young people especially do not like preachy
or overtly political messages, Verdi said. That is why some ads try
to get the message across in an almost lighthearted way. A print ad
that will run heavily next year, for instance, features a page from
a yearbook in which all the pictures show the same nerdy guy. The
copy reads ``Pick a boyfriend'' and goes on to discuss the problems
related to lack of choice.
</P>
<P>
   O'Steen criticized the abortion rights message as distorting the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pro-abortion movement will always seek to obfuscate the
issue,'' he said. ``The ads aren't about abortion or how it's
performed. The advertising is all geared at trying to move the
discussion away from abortion itself. Even by calling themselves
pro-choice, they don't want to talk about what's being chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamber said that while it was ``extremely difficult'' to change
someone's opinion in a 30-second spot, advertising can serve to
reach the many people who have perhaps never considered an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably a whole group of people who haven't thought
about this issue; it's not crossed their thinking process,'' he
said. ``Secondly, it's important for either side's activist groups
to see that they are fighting, not to change opinions but to
motivate the people they already have.''

BARRING OF URANIUM INSPECTORS RAISES NEW CONCERN OVER IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq's refusal to admit inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency who are required to check the
country's uranium stockpile once a year raises questions about what
President Saddam Hussein may be trying to hide and what the
Security Council will do about the rebuff, arms control experts
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A deadline passed on Wednesday for the agency, which had planned
to send a team of four inspectors and a technical-support expert to
Iraq this week, exactly a year after the agency's last inspectors
left before American and British air strikes. Because Iraq did not
issue visas to the team, the trip will be canceled, and Iraq will
be in violation of the 1968 treaty to halt the spread of nuclear
weapons. The treaty requires annual checks on materials that could
be transformed into bomb-grade elements.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection of Iraqi uranium stockpiles is unrelated to
broader arms inspections in Iraq that are a condition of lifting
economic sanctions imposed with the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Those
are the subject of a Security Council resolution now stalled by a
French request for more discussion by foreign ministers of major
industrial nations meeting in Berlin later this week.
</P>
<P>
   David Kyd, spokesman for the atomic energy agency, said on
Wednesday that the agency's director general, Mohammed el-Baradei
of Egypt, is expected to decide on a course of action by Thursday.
He had informed both the council and Secretary General Kofi Annan
of his intention to conduct an annual check in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's history of secret nuclear research and work on nuclear
weapons ``is something that has always been preying on the minds of
the inspectors,'' said Paul L. Leventhal, president of the
independent Nuclear Control Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to the atomic energy agency, Iraq has 1.8 tons of
low-enriched uranium and 13 tons of natural uranium that it could
use to create bomb-grade uranium if it had a hidden centrifuge,
which no one so far is sure that Iraq possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency has no way of determining now whether this material
is still where it is supposed to be,'' Leventhal said. He estimates
Iraq could make four or more bombs with its uranium, if it had all
other parts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the former head of the United Nations Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, which had been responsible for monitoring
Iraq's biological, chemical and missile systems in cooperation with
the atomic agency, said on Wednesday that beyond the question of
what Iraq may have been doing with the uranium, there is the
question of whether it intends to withdraw from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a firm refusal to allow inspections, Iraq's action
raises most serious concern about what its intentions now are with
respect to its adherence to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty,''
Butler said.

CITING FIRE RISKS, NTSB URGES IMPROVEMENTS TO MD-11 JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday
urged mandatory improvements to Boeing's MD-11 widebody jets to
prevent possible electrical fires.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same type of plane that apparently had an in-flight
electrical fire and crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia in
September 1998. All 229 people aboard that Swissair jet died.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Jim Hall said there have been three incidents
since last year in which the forward cargo control unit, or CCU, of
an MD-11 either caused a fire or showed signs of melting.
</P>
<P>
   In one case in November 1998, a fire erupted in the forward
cargo hold of a Delta Air Lines MD-11 while the plane was parked at
a gate at Atlanta's Hatsfield International Airport. There were no
passengers or crew on the plane at the time and damage was minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety board is ... concerned about the risks of a
CCU-related fire during passenger loading and unloading, and that a
ground fire could propagate without detection until an airplane is
airborne,'' Hall wrote FAA Administrator Jane Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   He urged that the FAA issue three airworthiness directives that
would require airlines to modify the cargo control units, and also
require Boeing to improve the system's circuit protection. A Boeing
spokesman said the company is preparing two service bulletins for
MD-11 operators that will address the concerns raised by Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Only the FAA can order airlines and Boeing to take corrective
action. The safety board can only make recommendations, and a
service bulletin issued by Boeing is not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause of the Swissair crash has not been determined,
the FAA has issued several airworthiness directives since the crash
aimed at making the jet less vulnerable to fires.
</P>
<P>
   The jet plunged into coastal waters 16 minutes after the crew
reported smoke in the cockpit and declared an emergency. Canadian
investigators found charred wires in the ceiling of the cockpit in
the Swissair wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 is built by McDonnell Douglas, which was acquired by
Boeing in 1997. Boeing is ending production of the plane in mid
2000. Only freighter versions are now being built in Long Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the FAA in August ordered the replacement of
insulation material in 699 of the McDonnell Douglas planes in the
U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The fiberglass insulation is covered with metallized Mylar,
which not only can ignite much more easily than other aircraft
insulation, but can help spread a fire, the FAA said. It was a
Mylar insulation blanket that caught fire on the Delta plane at the
Atlanta airport.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket is located directly behind the forward cargo control
unit, Hall said. NTSB investigators found that wiring damage led to
excessive electrical current when power was applied to the
cargo-loading unit. Several electrical pins in the unit were
``vaporized,'' releasing hot gases that ignited the nearby Mylar
insulation blanket, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Aerospace Cargo Industries manufactures the cargo control
unit, and has received reports of 48 unit failures since 1993, Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Hall said, Lucas advised MD-11 operators to
upgrade the unit with pins that are able to endure higher spikes in
electrical current. The Delta aircraft that caught fire hadn't been
modified to comply with the Lucas service bulletin, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Safety Board believes that the FAA should issue an
airworthiness directive requiring MD-11 operators to modify their
cargo control units in accordance with the Lucas service
bulletin,'' Hall said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   He said the board also is recommending that the FAA make
mandatory a service bulletin being prepared by Boeing that would
require airlines to install a thermal barrier between the cargo
control unit and nearby insulation.
</P>
<P>
   And Hall urged the FAA to issue a third directive that would
require Boeing make improvements in the MD-11 cargo control system
circuit protection to decrease the likelihood of an electrical
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the three incidents the board investigated, Hall said, the
circuit breaker for the cargo control unit did not trip, indicating
the unit's circuit protection ``is inadequate in MD-11 airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing safety spokesman John Dern said the company is preparing
two service bulletins. One will recommend MD-11 operators make
changes to the circuit breaker in question. The other will
recommend the installation of a nonflammable barrier between the
cargo control unit and the Mylar-covered insulation blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The other two incidents mentioned by Hall in his latter involved
a World Airways MD-11 and a Varig Airlines MD-11. In September
1998, the control unit in the Varig Airlines plane was damaged
while it was parked. According to Lucas, there was evidence of
melting in upgraded electrical pins that had been installed by
Lucas during a prior modification, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent incident occurred in March of this year.
Maintenance workers in San Bernardino, Calif, found evidence of a
fire after they pulled up floorboards on a World Airways MD-11,
Hall said. Although the fire was blamed on chafing caused after a
wire bundle was not properly restrained, investigators determined
the cargo control unit's electrical pins, which had not been
modified, had failed.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Les Dorr said Wednesday the agency will consider
the NTSB's recommendations. He noted the FAA has for some time been
taking a close look at the MD-11's electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   In January, FAA ordered inspections of wiring and insulation in
the cockpit and cabin of all MD-11 jets in the U.S. fleet. That
came on the heels of a similar recommendation by the NTSB.

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Every time you turn around, a new company is finding a new way to
bring information to investors on the Internet.
<P>
   In the James Bong Building on San Francisco's Market Street,
where the halls look like a scene from a Sam Spade movie, On24 has
created a small newsroom and television-style studio, and is
posting more than 100 video and audio stories each day on its Web
site (www.on24.com).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the content is staff-produced radio and TV-style
reports. It also includes raw footage from investment conferences
and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than forcing people to sit through a half-hour financial
news show on television for the item they want, investors can
search through hours of archived video and audio footage for
tidbits on the companies they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are watching investment conferences on the Web that
they couldn't get into in person,'' said Mitch Ratcliffe, vice
president of programming. ``The ability to see (corporate
executives) so they can judge whether they believe them is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich media is the theme for next year on the Internet, no
question,'' said Larry Marcus, an Internet analyst at Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``You have the technologies in place.
You have the content there. You have lots of companies focused on
solving bandwidth issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus likes On24 because of its content creation. ``The key,
long term, is really going to be owning the content,'' he said. He
sees On24 as a scrappy underdog, while ``in terms of getting
real-time up-to-the-minute commentary, MarketWatch.com is the
richest, deepest site.''
</P>
<P>
   MarketWatch has a video component too, an enviable slot on the
CBS network television. But On24 claims to be trying something
different, by making its video feeds tailored directly for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the startup's success so far is its affiliation with
Internet powerhouse Yahoo, which steers online investors to On24's
video feeds.
</P>
<P>
   On24 chief executive Sharat Sharan joined the company last year
from Hearst New Media, where he worked on such sites as Women.com.
On24 boasts $7million in funding from Canaan Partners, Rho
Management, former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and Jim Bidzos of RSA
Data Security. Sharan plans to raise a ``substantial amount'' of
money in the next few months and bring the site up to 300 stories
posted each day.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting volume is something Web investors demand. They can
sift through the content to find what they want, without having to
rely on editors to winnow out information they might find useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age of the sound bite is over,'' Ratcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a pretty good sound bite to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CRAIG'S MIFFED &QL; 
It looks like mediation _ if not litigation _ will be the way that
San Francisco's popular Craig's List will settle a dispute with a
former employee. Craig's List (www.craigslist.com) is a Web site
and mailing list that helps people in the Bay Area find jobs and
apartments and buy and sell items online. It's a nonprofit
enterprise run by Craig Newmark, 47, out of his Cole Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   Former employee Nancy Melone left Craig's List last year and
launched her own not-for-profit enterprise, MetroVox, in Orinda.
MetroVox (www.metrovox.com) bears a striking similarity to Craig's
List. It, too, offers job and event listings, but it covers more
cities, including Washington and Los Angeles. Also like Craig's
List, MetroVox gives some of its revenues to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark launched the site as a hobby in 1995, but a couple of
years later, he brought in Melone and two other women to run it
more professionally. She called herself the CEO, but Newmark said
she never had that title.
</P>
<P>
   When Melone left, she took with her three domain names Craig's
List had purchased _ listfoundation.com, listfoundation.org and
listfoundation.net. All three Web addresses take you to Melone's
site.
</P>
<P>
   Melone said she has a signed contract proving that Newmark
agreed to let her take the names.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark said she was not supposed to keep them for herself but
was to turn them over to the Albert A. List foundation, an
unrelated nonprofit that fosters citizen participation in the
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark is encouraging his 8,500 subscribers to pressure Melone
to at least agree to mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not an issue in the dispute. Personality and principle
are more like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ugly episode,'' said Newmark.
</P>
<P>
   Melone said she would consider mediation. ``You never close the
door on finding an equitable solution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 Macy's West CEO Stepping Down  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Michael Steinberg, chairman and chief executive of Macy's West
department stores, will step down at the end of this year.
<P>
   Steinberg, 71, will be replaced by Macy's West's president,
Jeremiah Sullivan, 60. Robert Mettler, 59, will succeed Sullivan as
president and chief operating officer. Mettler was president of
merchandising for Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Rudolph Borneo, 58, will
remain vice chairman and director of stores.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments are effective Jan. 3, 2000, according to
Federated Department Stores, Macy's Cincinnati-based parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, a respected merchandiser, was lured out of retirement
to run Macy's West in 1993, when R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. was in bankruptcy
proceedings and had not yet been acquired by Federated. Steinberg
had been chairman of Foley's department stores in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A native of South Africa, Steinberg saw the division through
R.H. Macy's merger with Federated in 1994 and the integration of
Broadway Stores Inc., a Los Angeles company that Federated acquired
in 1995. Broadway Stores included the Broadway, Emporium and
Weinstock's chains.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's West operated about 40 stores when Steinberg joined the
company and now runs 100 in six states. The division's sales are
expected to exceed $4 billion this year, up from $3.8 billion in
1998 and $255 million in 1994, Steinberg's first full year with the
company. The division employs more than 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and Steinberg have run Macy's West jointly for five
years, with Sullivan handling operations and Steinberg overseeing
the selection and presentation of merchandise. Sullivan said he is
not planning any major changes for the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profits are two and a half times what they were five years ago
so ... our strategy is one we don't want to tinker with, we want to
keep it going,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``this is a big transition for the company,'' said Kent
Anderson, former chief financial officer of Macy's West and now the
chief executive of Macys.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinberg could go all the way from couture down to the
bargain basement notions department, and he understood the business
and how to present it to the consumer,'' Anderson said. Steinberg
``worked a lot of Saturdays,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's West will continue opening about three stores annually
for the next three to five years, Sullivan said. The division also
has ``an aggressive program we are rolling out to all of our stores
to be 100 percent compliant with disability-access laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in October that Macy's Union Square store
violated regulations on issues such as aisle widths and counter
heights. A second suit involving other Macy's stores is pending.
Macy's says its Union Square location has been remodeled since the
suit was filed and now complies with all applicable rules.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who began his career in 1965 as a trainee at
Federated's Abraham &AMP; Straus chain, said he plans to travel and
then do part-time consulting for Federated. Macy's West ``is in
good shape,'' he said. ``We've got a very, very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's has had a presence on the West Coast since 1945, when
R.H. Macy bought San Francisco's O'Connor Moffat &AMP; Co. O'Connor
Moffat's Union Square store, now a Macy's flagship and the
third-largest department store in the country, opened in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   Federated, whose sales hit $15.8 billion last year, is the
largest upscale department store company in the United States. It
operates more than 400 locations, including Bloomingdale's,
Burdines, Lazarus and the Bon Marche.

EXXON MOBIL EXPANDS PLAN TO CUT PAYROLL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil Corp. said Wednesday that it would cut 16,000 jobs,
or about 13 percent of its work force, in an effort to increase its
cost savings to $3.8 billion a year by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The figure substantially raises the estimates given a year ago
by Exxon and Mobil when they first announced their plan to combine.
At that time, the companies said the merged entity would cut 9,000
jobs and save $2.8 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a much better understanding of what we can achieve
and how to achieve it,'' Lee Raymond, the chairman told analysts
and reporters at a meeting in New York. ``I am confident that we
can achieve at least the $3.8 billion and we can do it faster than
we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   That amount, officials said, was separate from savings and
margin-improvement actions that the two companies had already
undertaken _ amounting to $1.2 billion this year _ or any savings
from the divestiture of service stations and refineries that
regulators required.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were impressed by the company's presentation,
which they considered more forthcoming than had been typical of
Exxon. But they were not surprised by how much the merger's
expected benefits had grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, people have been thinking that the ultimate savings
would exceed the original estimates,'' said Jay Wilson, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan Securities, especially since the company said Dec.
2 that the $2.8 billion forecast was too low. Exxon and Mobil both
had track records of ``underpromising and overdelivering,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Knuettel, an analyst with PaineWebber, said that Exxon
Mobil's $3.8 billion of pretax savings was only slightly more than
the $3.6 billion he had been assuming.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon and Mobil had a combined work force last year of 123,000.
Of the 16,000 jobs Raymond said would be shed by the end of 2002,
some 2,000 came before Nov. 30, when the merger was completed. Of
the remaining cuts, 10,000 are to take place next year _ 4,000 in
the United States and 6,000 abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil shares rose 68.75 cents, to $83.0625, Wednesday in
New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its heritage _ Exxon was the successor of the Standard
Oil Co. (New Jersey) and Mobil was originally the Standard Oil Co.
of New York _ Exxon Mobil has no significant presence in the New
York metropolitan area. Tom Cirigliano, an Exxon Mobil spokesman,
said that any job losses in the region would be trivial.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 60 percent of the shrinkage is to come from the former
Exxon and 40 percent from the former Mobil. Some 10,000 employees
are to be discharged while 6,000 are expected to take ``normal or
accelerated'' retirements, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the expected casualties are about 1,000 executives, or a
third of the pre-merger Exxon and Mobil contingents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the most difficult aspect of implementing a
merger as large as this one,'' Raymond said of the loss of jobs.
``We have plans in place to help cushion the impact on those who
must separate.''
</P>
<P>
   To win regulatory approval of the merger, the company agreed to
sell 2,431 gas stations, a California refinery and various
marketing and refining stakes in Europe. Proceeds from these sales
are expected to be $4 billion to $5 billion, Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, he added, should generate a one-time net addition of
$3.5 billion to cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Wednesday that it planned to raise
production by 4 percent next year, twice what Knuettel, the
PaineWebber analyst, said he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The session generally seemed to reinforce analysts' view of
ExxonMobil as a blockbuster company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hit home with a lot of investors there was the incredible
position this company is in now,'' said Wilson of J.P. Morgan.
``Both functionally and geographically, it is really awesome.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weather pattern that has brought frequent surges of very
mild air from the Plains to the Northeast over the last few weeks
has begun to shift. Arctic air that has been locked in northern
Canada will be drawn toward the northern Mississippi Valley as jet
stream winds from the northwest become established over the center
of the continent. As a result, the coldest air of the season will
cover parts of the upper Middle West on Wednesday and Thursday
while the temperatures in the Northeast gradually fall to seasonal
values.
</P>
<P>
   Mild air will linger near the Northeast Coast for one more day.
A front marking the leading edge of colder air will sweep off the
Atlantic seaboard Wednesday. Variable clouds and a few rain showers
will accompany the front. In the wake of the front, progressively
colder air will sweep over the Great Lakes. As the chill deepens
later Wednesday, locally heavy snow squalls will occur near the
southern and eastern shores of the lakes from Michigan to western
New York. Snow showers will also whiten portions of the northern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be mainly dry and cooler. Sunshine will be
plentiful in the interior. But high, thin clouds will streak across
the sky near the Gulf Coast. Thicker clouds and a few showers will
occur in extreme southern parts Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will occur near the path of low pressure streaking
southeast from the Dakotas to the northern Missouri River Valley.
Farther west, gusty winds from the west will deliver milder air
across the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dust Storm
</P>
<P>
   Visibility usually increases following the passage of a cold
front, but, on Wednesday, dust darkened the skies for several hours
in the wake of a front crossing southern Texas. Winds from the west
gusting over 40 mph combined with dry soil conditions from recent
drought to raise palls of dust that dropped visibility below one
mile in some areas near Austin, Texas, and San Antonio. After a few
hours, the winds subsided allowing the dust to settle. While
Wednesday's dust storm was relatively small, severe dust storms can
be reminiscent of a blizzard leaving drifts of dust several feet
high.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Visa Exec Taking Job With Biotech Web Site  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A San Francisco Web site that caters to the biotech industry
scored the latest in a series of minor coups todaycq &LR;  by luring a
Visa executive to direct its efforts to sell experimental supplies
to laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Les Mann, who helped Visa USA push credit cards into doctor's
offices, will become senior vice president of sales for
BioSpace.com. In his new post, Mann will direct an e-commerce
effort aimed at selling everything from test tubes to rare DNA
samples to a scientific market that spends $15 billion a year on
such supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Mann joins an executive team recently bolstered by the addition
of Scott Clarke, former chief information officer at Incyte
Pharmaceuticals. Clarke came to BioSpace last month to help build
the site into a full-service portal, offering product news and job
listings as well as direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   This spate of executive recruiting was fueled by a $14 million
venture capital round, as Sanderling Biomedical, Alloy Ventures and
Brentwood Capital pumped money into BioSpace and enabled its
50-person  &LR; staff of 50 to move into new offices in San Francisco's
busy South of Market neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The venture financing also puts the company on a trajectory
toward an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   BioSpace Chairwoman Jennifer King founded the company in 1985 to
sell maps and directories to the nascent biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, King moved her business onto the Internet,
working with chief executive Timothy Fredel to make BioSpace a
niche portal for 100,000 biomedical scientists in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As BioSpace's newest hire, Mann will sell experimental supplies,
including rare DNA samples that cost $2,000 a drop and patented
enzymes that can easily run as high as $200 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to crack this lucrative, complex market _ BioSpace
already lists 700,000 products for sale _ the San Francisco firm
will face publicly traded competitors like Palo Alto's Chemdex and
North Carolina's SciQuest, which already sell scientific supplies
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's departure from Visa marks the third time in recent months
that an executive has jumped from the staid credit card association
to the technology world and its stock options.
</P>
<P>
   In September, former Visa advertising executive Michael
Beindorff took a job as chief operating officer for PlanetRX.com,
the South San Francisco online pharmacy. Last month, former Visa
marketing executive Jan Soderstrom took over a top branding post at
Santa Clara's 3Com Corp., a network equipment vendor.

COMMON CAUSES BRING TOGETHER LABOR, ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a downtown church here, steelworkers shared the
pews with schoolgirls in sea-turtle costumes, teenagers in baggy
jeans, elderly women in comfortable shoes and bearded
forty-somethings with graying long hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for giving me a chance to speak here today for sea
turtles that don't have a voice,'' Todd Steiner of the Sea Turtle
Restoration Project recently told the hundreds assembled to protest
the World Trade Organization. ``Today, it is the shy and gentle sea
turtles. Tomorrow it will be our forests, our ability to prevent
child labor and prison labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd clapped enthusiastically. They carried signs saying,
``Free Trade  &QC;  Dead Sea Turtles'' and ``Stop exploiting workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., exhorted the group: ``Trade
unionists are some of the most dedicated environmentalists in this
country today.'' The crowd roared again.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, organized labor and the environmental movement stood
side by side in the most visible symbol to date of a growing
confederation.
</P>
<P>
   It may prove to be a lasting effect of the WTO's visit _ if the
groups can get past some longstanding conflicts commonly boiled
down into the shorthand ``jobs vs. the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to happen,'' said David Brower, the 87-year-old dean
of the modern American environmental movement. ``We will say
`Remember Seattle' like we say `Remember the Alamo' or `Remember
the Maine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If cemented, this alliance could prove a politically potent
combination, particularly if church and consumer groups that joined
the Seattle protests come along. It's a team that would have been
hard to imagine even a dozen years ago, but that seems increasingly
likely now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turtles and Teamsters united,'' says Ron Judd, president of
the King County Labor Council AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the partnership is tentative, limited largely to issues
in which both sides perceive they have a stake: The same
corporation that locks out steelworkers also clearcuts redwoods;
displaced timber workers land jobs restoring streams; a powerful
World Trade Organization simultaneously harms sea turtles and
workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has had some success, and has already blocked some
major U.S. international-trade and -investment initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side pretends they will always agree. It seems certain,
for example, that tree-huggers will clash with dock workers who
ship raw logs to Japan. Still, as in most marriages, the partners
are willing to overlook some discord.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who philosophically oppose unions and
environmentalists acknowledge the possibilities raised by the
pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable phenomenon,'' said Brink Lindsey of The Cato
Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based libertarian-leaning think tank.
</P>
<P>
   THE COALITION had been building well before tens of thousands of
union members _ longshoremen, steelworkers, even airline pilots in
dress blue _ joined environmentalists for a non-violent rally and
show of strength during the Seattle WTO meetings.
</P>
<P>
   While the coalition might not have forced the collapse of the
Seattle talks, Lindsey said, ``It was standing there at the scene
of the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? How could the beefy union man be locking arms
with the latte liberal whose VW sports a Greenpeace bumper sticker?
</P>
<P>
   Much of it can be explained by the changing _ and shrinking _
union movement. Factor in environmentalists' perceived lack of
political firepower and a growing fear that global trade is leaving
behind a wide range of Americans _ including union rank-and-file
and people who like to hike. Sometimes, these are the same people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last decade, labor came out of this shell,'' said Tom
Juravich, director of The Labor Center at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst. ``Even rank-and-file members are ...
realizing that tree-huggers are not their enemies any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement was born in the latter half of the 1800s of a
concern for working people. With those populist beginnings, unions
would seem a natural ally of the environmental movement that sprang
from an outpouring of anti-government sentiment in the late 1960s
and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But as the green movement was getting underway, so, too, were
protests against the Vietnam war. The Left found itself opposed
more often than not by a union movement whose titular head was the
anti-communist, pro-war George Meaney, leader of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, environmentalists have clashed with unionists on a
number of issues: nuclear power plant construction, efforts to
reduce the timber cut, road construction, steel mill emissions _
just about any time jobs were pitted against the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the debate over the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993, when unions feared losing jobs to Mexico and
environmentalists braced for pesticide-laden produce to start
coming in the other direction. They lost that fight, but discovered
that they could work together.
</P>
<P>
   `It was a new and uneasy coalition,'' recalls Thea Lee, an
AFL-CIO trade policy analyst. ``We were not altogether comfortable
(together).''
</P>
<P>
   THE GROUPS KEPT lobbying together, though, and twice shut down
President Clinton in his quest to quickly and easily expand NAFTA
membership. In various spots around the country, this partnership
trickled down to the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Before Seattle, this comfort level was perhaps best illustrated
by the Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and the Environment, which
formed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Eureka, Calif.-based coalition include Earth
Island Institute, Seattle/King County Building and Construction
Trades Council, Rainforest Action Network and the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   Its first target was the Houston-based Maxxam Corporation, which
owns a majority of Kaiser Aluminum and is viewed as the force
behind the lockout of some 3,000 steelworkers in Washington, Ohio
and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Maxxam subsidiary Pacific Lumber Co., planned to
cut old-growth redwoods in Northern California if the government
didn't buy the forest for $480 million. That's extortion,
environmentalists said, even as they urged the government to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxxam is a poster child for corporate power out of control,''
said Karen Pickett, a California forest activist who helped found
the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's co-chairmen are David Foster, Northwest director
for the United Steelworkers of America, and Brower, former Sierra
Club president and founder of Earth Island Institute and Friends of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Brower likes to quote Foster on the partnership: ``If you'll
promise to make sustainable jobs a part of environmental
protection, we will promise to make environmental protection our
most important job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trans-national corporations are trying to run the world,''
Brower says of the coalition. ``There has to be something to
balance that out ...''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett said union allies help get past the ``tremendously huge
barrier'' she faces when opponents accuse environmentalists of
sacrificing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When environmentalists and unionists talk to each other, ``we
find out that we really do want the same things,'' Pickett said.
``That doesn't mean that it's an easy route, but in my view, this
alliance is the best chance we've had so far to smash that
jobs-vs.-the-environment myth.''
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL FACTORS are making the labor movement more open to
environmental causes, said Margaret Levi, director of the Center
for Labor Studies at the University of Washington. It starts with a
new generation of leadership. Judd, for example, is 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening with the new generation both of leaders and
workers is a recognition of quality-of-life issues,'' she said.
``We are seeing the rise of a kind of social unionism ... instead
of a narrow focus on the hours, wages and the health and safety of
the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the labor movement is looking for friends because
it has shrunk so much, she said. While about one in three American
workers was in a union in the late 1950s, today it's about one in
10. And the face of the workplace is changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   The caricature of ``a big white guy in a hard hat hating and
being hated by young long-haired hippie ... is being overcome
around issues like the WTO and environment and welfare and old age
pensions and health insurance,'' Levi said. ``These are issues that
really need large political coalitions to make a dent against very
well-organized, very well-financed business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this coalition has yet to launch an offensive on those
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on a roll, but thus far their power has been purely
obstructionist,'' said Lindsey of the Cato Institute. ``Right now
they've got a blocking coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   And down the road, this coalition could actually haunt the
centrist ``new Democrats,'' says Alan Gottlieb, president of the
Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unholy alliance to some extent and it's not that
solid,'' Gottlieb said. ``They can come together against the WTO,
but if the environmentalists are pushing the Clinton-Gore
administration for something that costs jobs, that coalition comes
apart like crazy. It's going to cause a lot of problems inside the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and unions will have two more chances to see
if they can work together before the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the Congress will have the opportunity to back
out of the WTO. Both the House and Senate would have to pass a
resolution, which Clinton would undoubtedly veto. Then both houses
would have to override the veto, Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill. and chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Trade, recently said he expects Congress to favor continued WTO
membership, ``But I think we've got to work, and you can't take
anything for granted in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the AFL-CIO and its allies are unsure whether they will
mount a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But they are virtually certain to go after China. With China
joining the WTO, there is a movement in Congress to grant China a
normal trade relations status, which it lost after the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that loom issues bound to divide the coalition. For
example, environmentalists are pressing Congress to accept the
Kyoto Protocol, a treaty committing the world to reducing emissions
of carbon dioxide and other industrial gasses believed to be
unnaturally overheating the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, at least, that could cost U.S. jobs _
something unions oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not completely in sync with environmentalists on climate
change,'' acknowledges Lee, of the AFL-CIO. Even so, both partners
agree poor nations should not be let off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled to find common ground,'' Lee said. ``We have a
respectful relationship ... We try to understand each other's
constituencies and each other's positions and work together on the
parts we can.''

RED SOX BRING ABOARD A TRUE TRIPLE THREAT IN EVERETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think about this while weighing the significance of Wednesday's
trade that brought switch-hitting outfielder Carl Everett to the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In the past century, they've never had a center-fielder who in
one season produced with the combination of average, power and
speed that the 28-year-old Everett did with the Houston Astros last
season, when he hit .325, hit 25 home runs, drove in 108 runs and
stole 27 bases.
</P>
<P>
   And he's 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go back to Tony Armas in 1984, when he hit 43 home
runs with 123 RBIs, to find a Sox center-fielder who had more home
runs and RBIs than Everett, and Armas hit .268 with one stolen base
that season.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lynn had only one season, 1979, in which he hit more home
runs (39) and drove in more runs (122) than Everett. He ated
.333, one of only two seasons with the Sox in which Lynn outhit
Everett. And Lynn wasn't a base-stealer.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Smith? He hit 30 home runs in 1971, 25 homers two years
earlier, but stole more than 20 bases just once in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who came out of the same Tampa high school
(Hillsborough) as two other former first-rounders, pitcher Doc
Gooden and outfielder Gary Sheffield, has had just one big-league
season like he put together in Houston this past year, and in the
Red Sox is joining his fifth big-league organization, the Yankees,
Marlins, Mets and Astros all preceding them.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the numbers alone, he gives the Sox a
middle-of-the-lineup presence exceeded by only two American League
center-fielders in 1999: Ken Griffey Jr. of the Mariners and Bernie
Williams of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, then, why Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette was
willing to risk trading highly touted shortstop prospect Adam
Everett, the team's No. 1 draft choice in 1998, and promising Class
A lefthander Greg Wilson for a player who could walk away from the
Red Sox after next season and declare himself a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you break down his skills,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
said from his home in Florida, ``there looks like there's an awful
lot of talent all the way around. To me, it looks like he's
developed into an outstanding player.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand, too, why the incumbent Sox center-fielder, Darren
Lewis, is looking at either a new role with the club next season or
a new address. Lewis has given the team Gold Glove-caliber defense
and brought a winner's approach to the Sox clubhouse, but his lack
of offensive punch led Duquette to pursue the Yankees' Williams
unsuccessfully a year ago before landing Everett Wednesday. And
while Everett may not be Lewis' equal defensively, he runs better
and has a stronger arm, recording 10 outfield assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose agent, Jim Bronner, said he believed the player was
in Argentina on a fishing trip, is due to be paid $5.1 million over
the next two seasons by the Sox, a payout that in all likelihood
will lead Duquette to shop Lewis' services between now and the
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the 32-year-old Lewis rates as an outstanding
extra outfielder on a good ballclub, one who could still amass 350
at-bats while platooning with Trot Nixon in right and spelling
Everett and left-fielder Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have enough good players,'' Williams said.
``What Darren brings to the table in a lot of cases does not show
up in the stats. As far as I'm concerned, he's an integral part of
the ballclub. He's an important person, first and foremost. He
understands how to win. He knows how to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you talk about the kind of player you have in Carl
Everett, whom you traded for primarily as a center fielder, if
that's the situation when the season begins, you expand Darren
Lewis' skills. You can only play three guys at a time, but that's a
pretty good guy to be coming off the bench. But over the lonbg
scheme of things, players here get the opportunity to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronner declined to comment when asked how he thought the
Everett deal impacted on his client.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who said he finalized the deal with the Astros
Wedneday morning, said he had spoken only briefly with Everett, and
that was just to congratulate him on the deal. Everett was not
present on the conference call announcing the trade. His agent,
Larry Reynolds, said Everett did not take part because his fifth
child, a boy, had just been born two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said he has yet to gauge Everett's willingness to make
a long-term commitment to the Sox. The player, who was paid $2.4
million by the Astros this year, is eligible for salary arbitration
this winter, and would almost certainly double his salary if he
goes that route. Just as in the case of Pedro Martinez, who like
Everett was a year away from free agency when the Sox traded for
him two years ago, Duquette would like to lock up Everett in a
multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a chance to have a lot of discussion about the
long-term thing,'' said Reynolds, who also represents Lynn's Ken
Hill. ``His reaction is that he's a professional. He really enjoyed
himself in Houston. He's a very personable guy, very respected in
the clubhouse, he got close to a lot of players. This was a little
bit of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros were in a salary crunch after signing All-Star
second baseman Craig Biggio to a long-term and facing big-money
tickets for pitchers Jose Lima and Mike Hampton and slugger Jeff
Bagwell looking at free agency after the 2001 season. The Astros
would have preferred to deal Moises Alou, but he has a no-trade
clause, and there was little interest in Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to Everett. ``This was a big surprise to Carl,''
Reynolds said. ``But he's going to be fine. A few weeks from now,
in a few days, we'll talk to Carl about a (long-term deal).''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette moved swiftly with Martinez, signing him to a six-year
deal three weeks after trading for him. Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker
would not give Duquette permission to negotiate with Everett in
advance. ``That's because the Astros had other teams willing to
take his contract,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have reason to give up prospects to the Astros. The last
trade between Boston and Houston, the Sox sent Bagwell to the
Astros for reliever Larry Andersen, still lamented as one of the
worst deals in club history.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett, rated the top defensive college player in the
draft when he was picked by the Sox in '98, rose rapidly through
the team's system, finishing last season in Double-A Trenton. But
Duquette felt there were a couple of reasons the club could deal
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Nomar Garciaparra will be our shortstop for a long
time,'' he said, ``and we have another kid at shortstop, Cesar
Siba, who played in the New York-Penn League, that we like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drafted Everett No. 10 overall in the country in
1990, then lost him a couple of years later to the Florida Marlins
in the expansion draft. The Marlins, discouraged at his slow
progress, traded him in 1994 to the Mets for Quilvio Veras, who
became their second baseman. Everett played parts of three
undistinguished seasons with the Mets before being traded to
Houston in the aftermath of an ugly off-field situation, in which
child-abuse charges were brought against the player and his wife,
Linda.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 1997, Everett's two children were taken into custody
by New York City officials after a Shea Stadium child-care worker
noticed bruises on his 6-year-old daughter, Shawna. Charges of
child abuse were subsequently dropped by a Family Court judge, who
ruled that Everett's wife, Linda, inflicted ``excessive corporal
punishment'' on their two children and the player did little to
stop her.
</P>
<P>
   In a later court ruling, the couple, who underwent counseling,
regained custody of their son but lost custody of their daughter
(Linda Everett's stepdaughter), who was placed with other
relatives. The couple have had two children since.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sox and Everett's agent addressed questions about the
New York incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl addressed the issues,'' Duquette said. ``They've been
resolved. He's performed very well, he has been a very good
teammate in Houston. The Red Sox looked into the concerns and
problems he had in New York. That was in 1997. We believe he has
matured from his experience in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reynolds: ``The matter is an old issue. It came up two
years ago. It was handled, and taken care of to the satisfaction of
the people of New York. It's a nonissue as far as we're concerned.
This guy's a real special person.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he remained hopeful of signing a free-agent
pitcher before the end of the week. Asked why he didn't use Adam
Everett in a trade for as pitcher, he said: ``Because Adam Everett
alone wasn't going to bring a pitcher.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Notebooks to Fill Anyone's Holiday List  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Notebook PCs still cost a lot more than full-size models, but
little by little, prices are coming down, and processing speed,
storage capacity, screen size and quality keep improving.
<P>
   Today you can get a clunky but capable Windows 98 notebook for
as little as $1,100, and for $1,500 to $2,500, you can choose from
an enormous array of models, including some that weigh only a few
pounds, some with amazing multimedia capabilities and some that
sport ultrafast processors. Communications capabilities have
improved, too: Almost every new notebook has a 56K modem built in,
and a few also come with high-speed network ports.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the right laptop, though, is still a challenge. It's a
game of trade-offs and compromises. The roomier the screen and
keyboard, the more the machine will weigh. If you want floppy and
CD-ROM (or even DVD) drives built in, your machine won't be
ultrathin. And the more processing power and features you get, the
faster your battery is apt to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   I've recently checked out five PC notebooks, each offering
something special in the way of price, design or features. This
survey is by no means comprehensive: Each of the companies
represented here also offers many other mobile models, and there
are dozens of manufacturers I didn't include, including Compaq,
Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   I also left out Apple's notebooks, because I reviewed the
PowerBook G3 and iBook earlier this year (July 15 and October 21,
respectively). Both are worth considering if you're not wedded to
Windows, as long as you're not looking for a featherweight model.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the low-down on the PC models.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Acer TravelMate 340 and NEC Versa FX. Acer's latest TravelMate 340
and NEC's new Versa FX are both part of a new class of notebooks
that combine light weight with high performance and rich feature
sets. Both include the latest generation (code-named
``Coppermine'') of Intel's Pentium III processor _ the Versa FX's
runs at 400 megahertz, the TravelMate's runs 50 megahertz faster.
Both have 64 megabytes of RAM, 6-gigabyte hard drives and bright,
clear 12.1-inch active-matrix displays. The TravelMate weighs 4.1
pounds, the Versa FX 3.5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Both come not only with an external floppy drive, but also with
an external CD-ROM drive _ an essential item, if only for
installing software, and one that's not included in the base price
of most other ultraportables. The NEC drives, even if you carry
both, are smaller and lighter than Acer's chunky combo unit. And
while the TravelMate is mostly a ho-hum gray, the Versa FX has a
trendy polished-silver exterior with subtle purple accents.
</P>
<P>
   But at $1,999, the TravelMate costs $500 less than the Versa FX.
While both have 56K modems built in, Acer also includes a 10-or
100-megabit networking port _ a terrific convenience if you take
your notebook to the office or to connect it to a cable or DSL
modem. If you want to do that with the NEC model, you'll have to
buy an Ethernet PC Card adapter for around $100.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the battery issue. Like most other ultralight
models, the Versa FX achieves its low weight in part by skimping on
battery size _ in my tests, the prototype NEC provided consistently
ran out of juice after less than 75 minutes. Acer's battery lasted
more than twice as long; still not enough, but a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Between these two models, I'd call the TravelMate the hands-down
winner. Overall, I don't know of a better value.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_IBM ThinkPad i Series 1480. Trying to transfer its prestige in the
world of corporate computing to the mass market, IBM last year
introduced a family of notebooks called the ThinkPad i Series,
which includes machines for consumers (the 1400 series) and
small-businesses (1500 series).
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried out, the i Series 1480, is a great multimedia
machine, but it has a price and girth to match: It lists for
$2,299, weighs 7.7 pounds, and measures 12.9 inches wide, 10.6
inches deep and 1.7 inches high when closed _ by far the largest
model covered in this review.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a sleek, jet-black case, you'll find a gorgeous 14.1-inch
active-matrix scene, backed by a 466-megahertz Mobile Celeron
processor, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive. The
1480 also has a DVD-ROM drive, so you can watch movies with it, and
an S-video jack, so you can watch them on your TV or video monitor.
(The i Series 1460, with CD-ROM instead of DVD and a slightly
slower processor and smaller hard drive, is $2,099.)
</P>
<P>
   IBM also provides several nice touches, including extra,
color-coded buttons above the keyboard you can customize to launch
your favorite applications, and a small light that can illuminate
the keyboard when you're working in the dark. You can play music
CDs in the DVD drive even when the system is off; the volume dial
and other controls are located on a readily accessible panel at the
front of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this justify the cost and size of the 1480? Not for me,
since I don't see much point in a portable this big and heavy. You
can get a comparably equipped desktop PC for half the price or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I can see why some people might prefer it to a desktop
model: It takes up less space, it looks more elegant, it's light
enough to move from room to room and of course you can run it on
battery power, for about 2 hours, 20 minutes in my test.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Sony PictureBook. In the past 18 months,  &LR; ago  &LR; Sony has shaken
 &LR; shook  &LR; up the notebook world _ and more than doubled its share of
the U.S. market _ with a series of machines that combine good
looks, light weight and strong support for digital multimedia. The
best-known example is the superslim VAIO 505. But the most unusual
is the PictureBook (officially, the VAIO PCG-C1X), a 2.5-pound
minimodel that sells for $1,799.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, the PictureBook's hardware is
unremarkable. Its main chip is a relatively ancient 266-MHz Pentium
with MMX, though that's backed by an ample 64 megabytes of RAM and
a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive. The active-matrix screen is bright and
crisp, but it's only about 8 inches wide and 4 inches high _ an
unusual shape that delivers a resolution of 1,024 by 480 pixels.
</P>
<P>
   There's a 56K modem built in, and it comes with a tiny external
floppy drive, but a CD-ROM drive will cost you an extra $200 to
$300. What's unique about the PictureBook is a digital camera built
right into the top of the screen. It's housed in a cylindrical part
that rotates 180 degrees, so you can point it at anything,
including yourself (a feature my daughters loved when we took a
PictureBook along on a family vacation). One press of a special
button snaps a still image or up to 60 seconds of video.
</P>
<P>
   Because the camera captures only 270,000 pixels per shot _ only
a quarter to an eighth the resolution typical of today's
stand-alone digital cameras _ image quality falls far short of what
you'd expect from even a cheap point-and-shoot film camera. Still,
for small, informal shots, especially ones you plan to use only in
e-mail or on your Web page, the pictures looked surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   The PictureBook comes with a slew of programs to help you take
maximum advantage of the camera. Sony's Smart Write and Smart
Publisher, for example, let you combine words and pictures and
convert them to Web pages; Adobe's PhotoDeluxe Business Edition
lets you edit and manipulate your digital images; and Sony's
PictureGear can stitch a sequence of individual shots into a
360-degree panorama.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done shooting, you can e-mail your shots immediately
with the built-in modem or upload offload  &LR; them to an external hard
drive via a speedy, hassle-free i.Link (also known as FireWire or
IEEE 1394) port.
</P>
<P>
   Unless photography is a major part of what you do, you'd
probably be happier with a machine with a bigger screen and
keyboard. And if you're serious enough about photography, you'll
probably want a higher-resolution camera.
</P>
<P>
   But if you do lots of photography and being able to upload your
shots easily and quickly is more important to you than high
resolution, the PictureBook's convenience can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Toshiba Satellite 1555CDS. Toshiba has long been a market leader
in mobile computing. Among its many models, I asked to borrow its
least expensive, the $1,099 Satellite 1555CDS, because that's about
as cheap and as up-to-date as name-brand notebooks come, and I
wanted to see what you get, and give up, at that price. (A few
lowball competitors, including Emachines and WinBook, have new
models at $999.)
</P>
<P>
   The Satellite 1555 has decent features: a 380-megahertz Mobile
K6-2, a Pentium clone made by Advanced Micro Devices, plus 32
megabytes of RAM, a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive and a 12.1-inch screen.
A floppy drive, CD-ROM drive and 56K modem are built in. The whole
package weighs about 6.9 pounds, and the battery lasted just over
two hours in my tests.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough horsepower for basic applications, e-mail and Web
surfing. With only 32 megabytes of RAM, the machine has to spend a
lot of time reading and writing data on the hard drive, but you
could speed things up by boosting memory to 64 megabytes for
another $100 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem for me was the screen. It's a dual-scan or
passive-matrix display, as opposed to the TFT or active-matrix
technology used in most notebooks, including all the others in this
review. Dual-scan displays aren't as bright or sharp, and objects
on the screen cast grayish shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Those are only aesthetic problems and you might be willing to
tolerate them for the money you save. But there's another issue
that seriously reduces the usability of this machine and others in
its class: Dual-scan displays are slow at redrawing the screen when
something changes; they can't even keep up with cursor movements.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Almost every time you move the arrow pointer, it
disappears _ a phenomenon known as ``submarining.'' If I had to use
this machine regularly, I suppose I'd adjust my cursor-moving
habits. I'd also get more adept with the pointing stick that
Toshiba provides instead of a mouse. But I'm afraid this
submarining problem would remain an annoyance _ and probably a real
drag on my productivity.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I like a bargain, I find this one a false one. My
strong suggestion, if you want a Toshiba, is to save up until you
can afford the Satellite 2100CDT, a $1,699 model that's similar to
the one I tested. Itcomes with 64 megabytes of memory and an
active-matrix screen.

 Chevron Sells S.F. Offices For $189 Million  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Taking advantage of the red-hot Bay Area property market, Chevron
Corp. said yesterday that it pocketed $189.1 million from the sale
of its headquarters buildings in downtown San Francisco.
<P>
   The winning bid was submitted by New York's Tishman
Speyer/Travelers Real Estate Venture, which also owns the Chrysler
Building in New York City, among other commercial properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Yemma, manager of transactions for Chevron Real Estate
Management Co., a subsidiary of the oil company, said San
Francisco's sky-high property prices were a factor in the company's
decision to sell its buildings. ``We're at the top of the property
market,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   But Yemma also said Chevron is eager to focus on its oil and gas
operations, rather than on real estate assets. ``We think we can
get better future returns on oil and gas than we can on real
estate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the company's San Francisco headquarters, he said
Chevron buildings in Southern California and Texas are also for
sale, with the deals expected to close within the next couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said in May that it was looking to cut costs by selling
off its two San Francisco towers at 555 and 575 Market St. The
company said it would move two-thirds of its approximately 1,400
employees in the city to facilities in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron said yesterday that it will lease back 11 floors in 575
Market, which will remain the company's headquarters. The company's
senior executives, financial operations and investor relations unit
will remain in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of other workers to the East Bay already is under way
and will be completed by the end of 2000, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Yemma declined to say how many competing bids were received for
the San Francisco buildings. He said, however, that the winning
$189.1 million offer was ``within our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   At this price, Tishman Speyer paid about $255 a foot for each &LR; 
of the  &LR; 740,000 square feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the buildings were in good shape, I'd say it's a good
price,'' said Barry Bram, vice president of TRI Commercial/Oncor
International, one of the largest commercial real estate firms in
Northern California. ``But my sense is that there's a lot of work
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Such work, he speculated, might include bringing the buildings
up to code for asbestos and electrical wiring or renovating whole
floors to attract tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Wechsler, senior managing director of Tishman Speyer
Properties, acknowledged that asbestos exists on ``several floors''
of 555 Market but said it won't be difficult to clean up. He also
said both buildings will need to be tinkered with to meet today's
power and technology needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand for this space from Internet companies
and other technology companies,'' he said, adding that prospective
tenants have been touring the premises since last month.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings were officially listed on the market yesterday,
with rents termed negotiable. Wechsler said he hopes to have them
up to full occupancy within a year and half.

2 ACCUSED OF FRAUDULENTLY INFLATING A STOCK VIA INTERNET MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case that shows both how easy it is to artificially inflate
the price of stocks on the Internet and how quickly prosecutors can
identify the culprits, two California men were charged Wednesday
with sending bogus messages over the Internet to pump up the price
of a bankrupt company.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles and the Securities and Exchange
Commission contend that the men, both 23 and recent college
graduates, used the Internet to artificially propel the price of an
obscure stock from 15 cents a share to more than $15 in less than
two trading days in November, reaping $364,000 in profits for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nov. 12, according to prosecutors, Arash
Aziz-Golshani, Hootan Melamed _ the two men charged _ and a third
man, Allen Derzakharian, 26, sat down at public computers in the
University of California at Los Angeles biomedical library and
tapped into the Internet. Using 50 different Web identities, the
three men sent more than 500 messages to three hot investment Web
sites during the course of the weekend, all touting shares of NEI
Webworld Inc., a bankrupt commercial printing company based in
Dallas, calling it an imminent takeover candidate even though they
knew it was not.
</P>
<P>
   The case is among the first to illustrate how easy it is to send
stocks soaring by utilizing the Internet. But prosecutors said the
case also sends an important message to people who think the
anonymity of the Internet allows them to manipulate stocks by
posting false statements about a company. Although securities
regulators say that many people who violate securities laws have
migrated to the Internet, this case shows how quickly investigators
can track down anyone who electronically posts bogus messages about
companies or stocks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is no longer the Wild Wild Web,'' said
Christopher Painter, assistant U.S. attorney for the Central
District of California and that office's computer crime
coordinator. ``It's a new territory that law enforcement is trying
to tame. We will go after these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that the men began promoting NEI Webworld
electronically after they had purchased 97 percent of the company's
available stock for themselves at prices ranging from 5 cents to 17
cents a share. In October, there was virtually no market activity
in shares of NEI, which traded on only three of 21 trading days. On
Friday, Nov. 12, the stock closed at 13 cents a share. But
rhapsodic messages sent by the men over the weekend whipped up
investor interest in the shares and the stock opened for trading
the following Monday at $8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors eagerly bought the shares, pushing them to $15.50 in
approximately half an hour, prosecutors say. Meanwhile,
Aziz-Golshani, Melamed and Derzakharian sold their shares into the
buying frenzy at prices between 25 cents and $15.1875.
Aziz-Golshani made $152,742 in profits and Melamed and Derzakharian
realized $211,250 in gains.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz-Golshani and Melamed were arrested in Los Angeles on
Wednesday afternoon on the criminal charge. The SEC filed civil
fraud charges against them and Derzakharian, accusing them of
sending false messages. Aziz-Golshani and Melamed were charged by
the U.S. attorney's office with a single count of criminal
conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Derzakarian was not
criminally charged by the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said: ``Let
this serve as a warning to con men: if you use the Internet to
manipulate our securities markets, we can and will find you. Though
the perpetrators in the case went to great lengths to hide from us,
we discovered them within a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Under securities laws, it is illegal to engage in false
representations or manipulative practices when buying or selling a
security. This is just what Golshani and Melamed did, say
prosecutors. The court froze the assets of all three men.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Aziz-Golshani is Randall Sunshine, of
Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine Weinhart &AMP; Regenstreif LLP in Santa
Monica. Sunshine said he could not comment on the complaint because
he had not yet read it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Werksman, the lawyer representing Melamed, said: ``My
client denies manipulating the market in the way that the
government alleges. Until we know more about exactly what they
claim my client did and how the market was affected, it's too early
to tell how this case will turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, one of the men posted 10 identical
messages on various Yahoo finance message boards predicting a
buyout of NEI, whose stock trades under the symbol NEIP, by a
private company called LGC Wireless. Using the web name
`ticlopidinel,' the messages said: ``Buying NEIP early would
entitle you to a share of LGC Wireless when it goes public next
week. Look for a massive move to $5-$10 as wireless stocks are very
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe that Aziz-Golshani and Melamed penned the
message and based their Web name on ticlopidine, the name of a
stroke-prevention drug that had been discussed in classes that
Melamed had recently attended as a pharmacy student at Western
University of Health Sciences in Pomona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When a skeptic in the chat room questioned the viability of a
NEI buyout, prosecutors say, Aziz-Golshani posted this answer: ``I
called on Saturday and no officers were in to answer my call, just
a receptionist who are always the last to know.'' Then, he added:
``People who know of the deal are buying in given the large volume
the last few days. ...''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But no buyout came. After peaking above $15 on Monday, Nov. 15,
NEI shares closed at 75 cents. The stock closed Wednesday at 18.75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that securities fraud has migrated to the
Internet because stocks can be propelled there with little more
than effusive talk and rosy predictions. Before the Web became
stock-tip central, someone who wanted to manipulate a company's
shares had to employ rooms full of stockbrokers flogging stocks to
unsuspecting investors by telephone. Now an electronic message does
the trick instantly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the criminal case against Aziz-Golshani and
Melamed contend that the Internet touting of NEI was not the first
for the two men. Although Aziz-Golshani, who lives in Beverly
Hills, told prosecutors that he operates a business from his home
selling leather jackets online, messages emanating from computers
at the UCLA biomedical library last September touted shares in a
company called Justwebit.com Inc. A review of brokerage firm
account statements belonging to Aziz-Golshani and Hooshang Melamed,
Hootan Melamed's father, indicate that trades in the company were
made that resulted in profits to both. Aziz-Golshani graduated from
UCLA last spring.

<P>
   For years, professors at the University of Iowa have provided
political junkies a financial outlet for their wild speculation.
The Iowa Electronic Markets is an online system that enables people
to bid on the presidential or congressional candidates they think
are most likely to win. Anyone could jump in _ as long as he was
willing to spend at least $5 and had a Telnet connection to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the markets are available on the Web
(www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem), and an increasing number of
prognosticators are putting their money where their mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Forsythe, an economics professor, and several other
Iowa professors started the project in 1988, fewer than 200 traders
got involved. This year about 3,900 people have signed up. The
total investment is more than $86,000. Anyone online can place
bids, worth up to $500, on the outcomes of the Republican and
Democratic presidential nominations, the makeup of the Senate and
House of Representatives, and the outcome in the U.S. Senate race
in New York between Hillary Clinton and, presumably, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   If a selected candidate wins, the trader who bid on that
candidate receives $1 for every share purchased. For example, if
Mrs. Clinton wins the New York race, those who bid for her at 30
cents a share (her going price on Wednesday) will make a 70 cent
profit on each share.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the going price for President Clinton was only one
percentage point away from the percentage of people who actually
voted for him, a prediction that many pollsters would envy.

   Putting It All Together: Help for Toy Assembly
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, there is one phrase that can strike terror
into the hearts of parents: Some assembly required. Netoy.com, a
Web-based toy retailer, isn't promising to stick toys together
before shipment. However, this month it will introduce a series of
animated drawings and assembly directions on its site,
www.netoy.com, that may make the job a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came from an observation that most tasks are easier to do
if someone demonstrates them,'' said Steve Arend, Netoy.com's vice
president for product development. The instruction sheets show
assembly step by step. Virtual tubes of plastic cement even show
where the glue should go.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions do not offer advice on how to remove the
plastic cement that strayed onto a user's keyboard.

   A Virtual Mood Ring Tracks Nation's Emotions
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is two kinds of ice cream, catching a firefly and,
possibly, living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Dailyrating.com, a site that started up in June, tracks the
nation's emotional state based on daily messages from more than
4,000 e-mail correspondents. Dailyrating.com then maps relative
degrees of happiness three ways: state by state on a USA
Today-style weather map, on a nationwide graph and on a chart that
compares the moods of men and women. Recent results indicate that
people in Minnesota are not happy, nationally the mood appears to
mirror the Dow Jones industrial average and men have rallied to
have better days than women.
</P>
<P>
   The site, created by two North Carolina State graduates, Calvin
Tarlton and Lance Lovette, is intended to help its e-mail
correspondents (who can register free at www.dailyrating.com) to
maintain online diaries. ``We were always complaining about one
thing or another,'' Tarlton said. ``We thought it would be a good
idea to track it.''

   Linking Wall Street To the Ski Slopes
</P>
<P>
   First, laptop computers were dragged along on vacations. Then
came the cell phones, small enough to go anywhere and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's the stock market that is available to anyone skiing at
four different Colorado resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Vail Resorts has a three-year deal with DLJDirect, the online
subsidiary of the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, to
provide slopeside Internet stock trading. The agreement includes
nine free computer terminals to be located at four different
midmountain lodges at Keystone, Breckenridge, Beaver Creek and
Vail, all of which are owned by Vail Resorts. Skiers will be able
to get up-to-the-minute stock quotes, as well as open new accounts
and purchase stock once they have been approved online. Day trading
will be discouraged, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of customer that typically uses online trading is
very similar to our customers,'' said Paul Witt, a spokesman for
Vail Resorts. ``The demographics match up pretty nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is one computer terminal up and running for stock
trading, and the others will be installed by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vail Resorts is a publicly traded company, and
theoretically an investor could be trading Vail stock while on the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the snow's looking really good, then you might be thinking,
`Buy, buy, buy,''' Witt said, jokingly.

   Cell Phones Designed to Call Only a Single Number: 911
</P>
<P>
   While it may resemble a sleek cell phone, the Magnavox Mobile911
can't call home or even the office. As its name suggests, it is
designed to dial only one number: 911.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath its flip-back keypad cover, the familiar set of
telephone keys has been replaced with one large, red button. When
it is pressed, the device calls a local 911 operator, linking a
user, in a toll-free call, with emergency help.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which costs $199, does not require cellular phone
service or additional fees. It also has a built-in 95-decibel
siren, which is about as loud as a car alarm. The siren is turned
on and off by pressing two buttons on the sides of the device. (The
alarm will also shut off when the device completes a 911 call.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It can make a lot of noise and call for help,'' said Mike
Bernstein, co-founder of SecureAlert, which developed the
telephone. ``These are the first two rules of self-defense.'' The
Magnavox Mobile911 is sold only online at www.mobile911.com and
through a toll-free number, (800) 584-4176.

   Eudora Takes the Plunge Into Advertising Sponsorship
</P>
<P>
   Eudora, one of the leading e-mail programs on the market, is
going to introduce a version that contains advertising but is free
to users. Until now, Eudora came in two flavors: a free but
scaled-down version called Eudora Light and the much more powerful
Eudora Pro that sells for $49.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we've turned the traditional Internet ad model
on its head,'' said Jeffery K. Belk, vice president of Qualcomm and
general manager of the Eudora division. ``Of course, using the word
traditional about something so new as Web advertisement is kind of
ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Miller, senior analyst at the Cahners In-Stat Group, a
research firm in Cambridge, Mass., thinks that Qualcomm may be on
to something. ``Users can choose the level of intrusion the ads
cause,'' he said. Miller noted that e-mail is the top application
on the Internet _ 97 percent of all Internet users use it.
</P>
<P>
   A beta version of the software is available at the Eudora Web
site (www.eudora.com). Belk insists that the advertisements will be
less intrusive than banner ads at most Web sites. ``First of all,
the ads are static, no animation will be allowed,'' he said.
``Secondly, the ads are placed in the lower left-hand corner so as
to not interfere with handling your e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the ads may be static, a series of them rotates in the ad
space (one every 75 seconds) while one is using the program. The
program caches (stores) about 20 ads, and when a cycle is complete,
the next time a user checks e-mail, a new group of ads is
downloaded. &QL;

<P>
   One of Superman's most compelling talents was X-ray vision. The
Man of Steel could see right through objects to the substance
underneath. Now any of his fans who buy Cadillac's new DeVille can
experience something similar.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can purchase a new DeVille equipped with Night Vision,
the first system that allows drivers to see five times as far as
they can usually see with headlights _ and even lets them see
objects hidden by darkness or obscured by trees. It works by
projecting small images of heat-generating objects in a display
across the lower part of the windshield, in front of the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is a $2,000 option for the DeVille. It was
developed by Raytheon for General Motors and is based on
declassified military technology widely used in the Persian Gulf
war. It is one of several approaches being worked on by car
manufacturers worldwide, who are looking for ways to improve
drivers' vision at night without increasing the brightness or range
of standard headlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A driver's inability to see at night is independent of age,''
said Ed Zellner, chief engineer for the luxury car division at
General Motors. ``Twenty-eight percent of driving is done at night,
but 55 percent of fatalities happen then.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon approached Cadillac about 10 years ago with its night
vision technology because it was looking for ways to expand its
business beyond the military. The system was not close to being
ready; it was cooled by liquid nitrogen and took up so much room it
would have been too big for even the DeVille's gargantuan trunk.
</P>
<P>
   While Raytheon worked on shrinking the system's size, Cadillac
developed an easy-to-use interface. Engineers quickly decided not
to put a display on the instrument panel because drivers would have
had to take their eyes off the road to see what was ahead. Instead,
they chose a virtual display that would make a deer, a pedestrian
or a car in the road ahead appear to be in front of the car's hood.
That eliminates the need to refocus one's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the image is the same size it would be
and in the same relative position it would be in if you could see
it unaided. Night scenes look like photographic negatives; the more
heat an object gives off, the whiter it appears. Drivers can select
the level of image brightness to accommodate their eyes' adaptation
to darkness (think of what happens when you turn on a light inside
the car).
</P>
<P>
   The system works by using a small infrared camera, mounted
behind the car's grille. Infrared radiation given off by humans,
animals cars or any other object that produces heat is absorbed by
one of 76,800 detectors in the camera. Each detector element
responds electrically based on how much infrared radiation it
receives. The changes are processed to create a visual image, which
is projected onto the display.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first reaction drivers have when they use Night Vision is
`Wow,' '' Zellner said. ``They can't believe the stuff that's out
there in the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for some is whether it's important to see
everything that's there. ``Sure, you can see deer, but they appear
so quickly, an infrared system may not help you avoid them,'' said
Jeff Erion, lighting manager for Ford's Visteon Automotive Systems,
in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Erion says there is a cheaper way to help drivers see some
objects beyond their headlamps: road signs could be coated with
ultraviolet chemicals that would show up when illuminated by new
headlamp bulbs that emitted ultraviolet as well as regular light.
The company is now testing ultraviolet systems and conducting
studies to determine the costs and benefits. Ultraviolet
brighteners are in almost all laundry detergents, Erion added, so
clothing would appear brighter as well with such a system ``We can
get a 15 percent improvement in visibility for almost no cost,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Visteon's center in Basildon, England, the company is
perfecting a ``near infrared'' system that unlike Cadillac's
enhances the perception of the area covered by normal headlights,
rather than reaching far beyond that zone. An infrared transmitter
sends out a beam that bounces off surrounding objects. A camera,
similar to a video camera, detects infrared reflections from
objects in the car's path and, through digital signal processing,
turns them into an image that is projected directly across the
entire windshield. That provides increased detail to the area
already illuminated by headlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've driven around a car park with this system and my
headlamps off,'' said Andy Gill, Visteon's European director for
interior electronics, ``and I could see lampposts, pavement and the
roadway as if it was twilight.'' The system is ready for production
and will appear on some vehicles by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has also taken the ``active illumination''
approach, building an infrared system that, like Visteon's, sends
out an infrared beam, rather than just detecting infrared radiation
from heat-emitting objects. ``With our system, you can see objects,
such as road markers and the road surface, that are the same
temperature as the environment,'' said Peter Narozny, head of the
company's high-frequency technology laboratory in Stuttgart,
Germany. The company expects to put the system into production by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Next for DaimlerChrysler is car radar. Within five years, the
company will offer a system that will transform the blips on a
radar screen into actual pictures, helping drivers see through fog.
``With our radar system, drivers will even be able to see through a
truck, to the car in front of that,'' Narozny said. With the
proliferation of yacht-size sport-utility vehicles that block
everyone else's view of the road, that technology could not come a
moment too soon.

LAPD SCANDAL COULD LEAD TO REVERSALS IN HUNDREDS OF CONVICTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A widening investigation into accusations of
corruption, brutality and false testimony by police officers in a
gritty, drug-plagued precinct here has forced the review of
hundreds of potentially tainted criminal cases in which suspects
may have been wrongly convicted. The inquiry could involve many
more than that, prosecutors and defense lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said that in his 31 years in the
prosecutor's office, ``there has never been a more important
case,'' because the accusations of false testimony go ``to the
heart of the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said his deputies were already offering anecdotal
reports that the scandal in the precinct, the Rampart Division, was
hurting their conviction rates in other, unrelated cases. He said
he did not have statistics to buttress that belief.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the investigation surfaced in September, when
prosecutors won the release of a gang member serving a 23-year
sentence for assault on the police after a former rogue officer
told investigators that he and a partner had handcuffed and shot
the man, who was unarmed, then framed him by planting a gun near
his paralyzed body three years ago. Since then, nine other verdicts
have been reversed, and 13 officers have been dismissed or relieved
of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney said Wednesday that he did not know
whether a handful, or 20 or 30, or 100 officers might ultimately be
involved, in a department of some 10,000, but he vowed to ``go
wherever the investigation leads us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had seven lawyers working on the case full time, and
was prepared to add another 20 if needed. The public defender's
office said it might have to request additional money or lawyers to
handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said at a brief news conference Wednesday morning that
hundreds of other cases were being reviewed as possibly tainted,
and said the inquiry would take many months. But he scoffed at an
estimate by public defenders that as many as 3,000 cases might have
to be reconsidered, a figure first reported in Wednesday's editions
of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have been looking at hundreds of cases,''
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kalunian, the county's assistant public defender, said
3,000 was the number of cases, provided by the district attorney's
office, in which about 10 of the suspected officers had played any
role over the past 10 years, from transporting arrested people to
jail, to offering substantive testimony at trial. Kalunian said it
was not yet clear in how many cases the officers had even played a
substantive part, much less given deceptive testimony, and that a
review was under way, beginning with the cases of people currently
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly all 3,000 cases are not going to be reopened, but I
can't tell you how many will be,'' Kalunian said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of police agencies around the nation
have grappled with scandals over false testimony by corrupt
officers, a practice known in police lingo as ``testilying.'' But
Edwin H. Delattre, the dean of the school of education at Boston
University and a national expert on police ethics, said that the
Los Angeles situation was ``the worst case of a poisoned well in a
police department that I've seen in 25 years, and the work that has
to be done will be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Delattre helped the New York State Police in an inquiry into
evidence-tampering in the early 1990s that ultimately involved
about eight troopers required about 120,000 hours of investigation
of potentially tainted cases.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the allegations here are shocking, an ``L.A.
Confidential'' come to lurid life.
</P>
<P>
   The former officer, Rafael A. Perez, who was convicted of
stealing cocaine from an evidence locker and seeking to lighten his
sentence, told investigators that he and a former partner, Nino
Durden, intentionally shot a known drug-gang member, Javier
Francisco Ovando, at point-blank range in a 1996 raid, then planted
a .22 caliber rifle to make it seem he had attacked them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the authorities have been forced to review not only
cases handled by those two officers, but by other partners and
associates in a widening circle in an anti-gang street crime unit
known as CRASH at the Rampart station just west of downtown. The
Los Angeles Police Department has commissioned a sweeping internal
review, due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have for weeks declined to predict just where
the investigation will lead. The review has already forced
suspension of an injunction intended to bar gang members from
congregating, because of fears that statements by officers in
support of the measure may have been false.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, no criminal charges have been filed against the
suspended officers, and Garcetti said Wednesday that his first
priority remained to free anyone wrongly imprisoned, then to help
the police in finding officers who should be fired and finally
developing evidence sufficient to prosecute any officers guilty of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick J. Bobb, a special counsel to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors who served as a deputy counsel to the
Christopher Commission, which recommended a raft of procedural
changes to the police here in 1991, after the Rodney King beating,
said the Rampart case had put big burdens on the city's trust in
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire justice system, both the criminal justice system
and the civil justice system, will be put under extraordinary
strain now and into the indefinite future by virtue of the sheer
numbers of cases that will have to be reviewed, and the sheer
numbers of lawsuits that can be anticipated,'' he said. ``I think
that one of the most tragic and disheartening things about the
Rampart scandal is that the LAPD had begun to emerge from the
shadows of Rodney King and the civil disturbances, and the O.J.
Simpson case, and was beginning to resurrect its reputation. This
scandal, I'm afraid, necessarily will set the LAPD back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union has called for appointment of a special prosecutor to take
over the investigation, arguing that the district attorney's
office, which relies on police testimony in most of its cases,
cannot adequately investigate police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's ultimately 300 cases or 3,000 but it's
going to be a whole lot,'' said the group's executive director,
Ramona Ripston. ``We absolutely cannot go on like this.''

MEDICAL REPORT ON GORE FINDS HIM IN `OUTSTANDING' CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is in top physical condition with
excellent heart function, although his blood lipids are mildly
elevated, according to a three-page medical summary that was
prepared by the White House physician and released Wednesday by
Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``is in outstanding health'' and does not routinely use
prescription medications, Dr. Richard Tubb, the White House
physician who provides health care for the vice president and his
family, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A routine checkup performed last May 7 at the National Naval
Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., by a panel of military and
civilian doctors showed that the 51-year-old Gore had only minor
medical problems. He had a mild high-frequency hearing loss. It
does not interfere with normal conversation and has not changed
since his last previous hearing test, in 1995. Because the hearing
loss is possibly related to exposure to loud noises from aircraft,
doctors have advised Gore to wear ear plugs at airports and
helipads. The vice president uses them periodically, Tubb said.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the medical information came less than a week after
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, canceled an afternoon of
campaigning because of an irregular heartbeat that he said caused
him no symptoms of heart problems. Bradley takes a drug, Procanbid,
twice a day to control the condition, which is known as paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, a Gore spokeswoman, said the findings
of the May checkup were issued only now because news organizations
had not requested them until recently. Results of the vice
president's periodic medical examinations are not routinely made
public.
</P>
<P>
   The results of a standard group of blood and urine laboratory
tests were normal except for his cholesterol and another lipid
measurement. Gore's total cholesterol of 231 was higher than the
ideal of less than 200, and his LDL (low density lipoprotein, or
bad cholesterol) was 157, higher than the ideal of 130 or less. His
HDL, (high density lipoprotein, or good cholesterol), was 55, above
the ideal of 35.
</P>
<P>
   Tubb said a cholesterol-lowering drug was not prescribed for
Gore because he did not have any other risk factors for heart
disease and did not meet criteria in national guidelines for such
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Use of a cholesterol-lowering drug in someone like Gore is
debatable, many doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Tubb said that he treated the vice president as he would any
other patient and that ``the lifestyle desires of the patient are
as or more important than the actual numbers'' from laboratory
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tubb said he would check Gore's lipid values again in a few
months to determine how they responded to his diet. The doctors
have recommended that Gore eat a diet of high complex
carbohydrates, low saturated fats and high fiber to control his
cholesterol.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Malakoff, the director of the division of general
internal medicine at George Washington University Hospital, and Dr.
M. Anthony Casolaro, the chief of medicine at Arlington Hospital in
Virginia, said they agreed with Tubb's decision not to prescribe a
cholesterol-lowering drug for Gore. Tubb sent the medical summary
to the two doctors for comments to reporters. Both doctors said
they were not part of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Antonio Gotto, dean of Cornell Medical College in New York
City and a leader in conducting trials of lipid-lowering drugs to
prevent heart disease, said he favored an aggressive approach and
would prescribe such a drug for Gore, even though he did not meet
the criteria for it in national guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's treadmill test results were excellent as he ran for a
total of 19 minutes, reaching Stage 7, and achieving 105 percent of
maximum predicted heart performance. ``He's at the level of a
trained athlete,'' said Consolaro, who is a team physician for the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Gore completed his first marathon in October 1997 and recently
climbed Mount Rainier in Washington State, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's blood pressure was a normal 110/68, his pulse 58 and
regular. He weighed 195 pounds and was 6 feet 1 inch tall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not used tobacco since 1973, when he stopped a
pack-a-day use of cigarettes that began in 1968. He has an
occasional beer but has no history of heavy alcohol use.
</P>
<P>
   No polyps were found at his last colon examination, in 1995.
Gore is due for another colon examination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore routinely uses sunscreen and has had no evidence of
recurrence of a basal cell skin cancer that was removed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He had no evidence of limitations from sports-related injuries
in the past. In a pickup basketball game in August 1994, Gore had
surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon, which anchors the calf
muscles to the heel. But he has not had any limitations in walking
from that injury or from others, Tubb said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dislocated his left shoulder in 1958, broke his ankle in
1980 and strained his right shoulder while skiing last February. An
exercise and stretching program has relieved the low back pain that
Gore had experienced in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had surgery to repair an inguinal hernia in 1989. He wears
glasses to correct his vision to 20/20.
</P>
<P>
   Tubb said that he expected Gore to have another checkup some
time next year, but that the date was ``up in the air.''

E-MAIL ON THE SCREEN REPLACES LETTERS TO SANTA ON THE FRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By ELIZABETH STONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If my sons are organized about anything, it is Christmas, or at
least their Christmas wish lists. So I wasn't surprised during a
snack break in early December that they were writing their annual
letters to Santa. Or more precisely to Mrs. Santa, which is how I
think of myself at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, these scrawled lists would appear, without much
comment, posted by magnet on the refrigerator. Ah, sweet tradition.
Ah, tender little scrawls.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget it. This year, we're talking e-mail. On a recent
morning when I sat down at my desk, a missive from each of my sons
awaited me, although I was immediately grateful that at least they
both had bypassed this year's profusion of online
fill-in-the-blanks Christmas wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   Son No. 1, Paul, had sent his list across the vast tundra
separating his attic warren from the rest of the household. A
basically reasonable person, he wanted a few T-shirts, quite a few
CDs and a variety of videos (and a car stereo, but for that one he
decided to solicit more directly). The e-mail in front of me left
nothing to chance. After his salutation ``Yo Yo, Ma,'' in red and
green letters, a sea of blue followed. Not Hanukkah blue, but
hypertext blue, which would whisk me to the precise objects of his
desire.
</P>
<P>
   All I had to do was choose among his choices. And pay. Since
none of the presents he wanted were items that had to be checked
for itchiness or smell, I can't say I minded.
</P>
<P>
   Son No. 2, Gabe, a newer teenager, was both more high-tech and
more old-fashioned. Wanting to cover all bases, he had sent his
e-mail to my primary screen name, but he had also sent copies to my
other screen name, and his father's, and his brother's. Just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   He was less pointed in a few of his choices. He, too, wanted
clothes (``make sure they're baggy'') but unlike his brother, he
had left me no hypertext trail. He wanted me to put on my coat and
go out of the house. According to his instructions, his brother was
to join me (``let Paul pick out some cool clothes'') and then I was
to pay. For the rest of his list, he named video games and
equipment, each followed by clumps of asterisks to let me know his
priorities (``the more (STAR)s, the more I like it'').
</P>
<P>
   That was how it began. The next day, he sent a second e-mail,
again with copies to all of us, including himself, in case the need
for proof in court arose. He had attached a picture of a wristwatch
he had found while surfing, one with so many luminous digits and
buttons and dials on its face it could have passed for a 747
control panel: ``i like this,'' he had written in neon chartreuse
against a black background, ``do you?''
</P>
<P>
   I was touched. These days, he generally doesn't want to know my
opinion. About anything, much less items that are proximate to his
body. It was also the kind of exchange that we never could have had
in the old days of notes posted on the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote back that I did like the watch but that I didn't know
which Web site it had come from.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked my e-mail the next morning, his third message had
arrived, this time including the necessary hyperlink. Underneath,
he had written, ``it's in the last row, second from the right _ the
analog watch with the gold and silver band and the black
background. It's $85'' and signed himself as ``gabe $.'' His last
name begins with S, so I took the dollar sign to be his recognition
that $85 was pricey.
</P>
<P>
   In a P.S., he added a final Web page with directions to a watch
that he thought I might like for myself. I did, and I told him so.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week as we window-shopped via e-mail, my younger son
and I developed the makings of a small epistolary novel. Within the
messages was a profusion of new hyperlinks, each one annotated with
a question, a comment, a retraction or a reaffirmation. Which one
to choose? As for the watch, he had picked for me, he was
encouraging. ``Go for it, Mom,'' he wrote, ``get it for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the week brought the denouement. ``Hey hey hey, the
final decision,'' read the subject heading. His final choice was
analog, black background, silver band.
</P>
<P>
   Then, silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the following day came a new message, one I opened with some
hesitancy, given that the subject line read, ``A Message from
Amazon.com about my new Wish List.'' Was this a hoax? The use of
capital letters in e-mail violated my son's cyberliterary
conventions. I opened it. Inside was a message allegedly from my
son. ``Howdy, I've set up my holiday Wish List.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. My son would sooner eat worms than write the word
``Howdy.'' The only sign of his presence in the whole message was a
check mark next to the portable CD player in the ``I want'' box.
But I did write him back to say that I had received the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that has turned out to be the end of the series. With a
little more than a week to go before Christmas, my fingers have
done all the shopping they are going to do. Now they're on to the
wrapping. But I'm still waiting.

A TOOL FOR ANONYMITY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last few years, the online world has been getting more
and more like a small town as advertisers and marketers have
developed smoother, faster and subtler ways of tracking sites
visited and purchases made.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Canadian company, Zero Knowledge, announced a new
product that it said could help people avoid this scrutiny and live
anonymously online.
</P>
<P>
   The new software tool, named Freedom, promises to shift the
balance of knowledge and information back to the individual. Austin
Hill, the chief executive of Zero Knowledge, says the company ``is
about individuals owning their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The system allows a user to set up pseudonyms that become their
identity. When a user sends e-mail, browses the Web, participates
in a chat session or posts a message to a newsgroup, the activity
is filtered through the company's network of servers. When it flows
out into the general Internet, a person becomes known by the
pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is available at www.freedom.net, costs
$49.95 for up to five pseudonyms for one year. The company's server
network works like an anonymous pony express. Internet activity is
encoded in a nested set of envelopes and each link in the chain
opens up an envelope, pulls out another envelope and then delivers
it to the address on that envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the nesting ends and the information arrives at its
destination. Anyone who wants to trace information would have to
determine from each server in the chain where it got the
information. And the servers in the Freedom network keep no
records, imitating a common solution adopted by many companies
after the embarrassing e-mail that emerged in the antitrust case
against Microsoft. Zero Knowledge says it does not know the true
identity of the people using its software.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects that many parents will buy the service for
their children who may not be schooled in the potential dangers of
speaking freely where all can hear and messages can be stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk about archived speech and say that message is
going to be there forever, every parent in the room comes to me and
says, `Where do I get this?''' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   As to concerns that fraud, libel, spam, hate speech or verbal
abuse could spiral out of control on the Internet, the company says
it hopes to avoid such problems by shutting down the pseudonyms of
troublemakers. And only a limited amount of mail is allowed to be
sent under each pseudonym each day.

INDIANA COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD CARVES ITS OWN CODE OF BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: optional sidebar, listing the precepts, is at end of
article)  
 (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSBURG, Ind. _ Given its druthers, the school board in this
southern Indiana town would post the Ten Commandments in
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But because that would be a clear violation of the First
Amendment, the board decided to carve its own tablet of moral
behavior: the 11 ``Common Precepts.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with ``Trust in God,'' the code urges students to
respect others, save sex for marriage and avoid drugs and alcohol,
as well as tell the truth and honor their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to teach religion,'' said Robert Hooker, the
school superintendent, noting that the edict about trusting God,
taken from the words on U.S. currency, makes no reference to a
specific religion. ``With kids killing kids, and so many negative
images out there, we're just trying to put forth a positive
message.''
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy was intended to appease civil libertarians, it
has not worked. Kenneth Falk, a lawyer for the American Civil
Liberties Union in Indianapolis, said he would file suit against
the Scott County school district if it posted the behavior code.
</P>
<P>
   To Falk, the Common Precepts sound a lot like Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suspiciously tracks the Ten Commandments,'' Falk said.
``The edict to trust in God is clearly a religious notion.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the school board excised the reference to God, Falk
said, the code might still violate the Constitution. ``It would be
a much closer call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism by the ACLU has not been warmly received here in Scott
County, where corn and tobacco fields surround this little
courthouse town about 30 miles north of Louisville, Ky. Nearly all
of the 2,700 students in the schools here are Christian, and some
families have roots in Scottsburg that go back six generations.
</P>
<P>
   Long reliant on farming and factory work, people in Scottsburg
now more often commute to office jobs in Louisville, Ky., and its
suburbs. Old clapboard houses stand on the side streets, with
firewood piled high on porches. But the downtown has been gleaming
with new investments. A trendy cafe along a cobbled sidewalk serves
berry tarts and raspberry chambord. And the influx of newcomers has
boosted the population about 20 percent since 1990, to about 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   But a central force in Scottsburg is still the First Church of
Christ, which teaches the truth of the literal word of the Bible.
And some townspeople say children need training in the
old-fashioned virtues now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to instill values in our children,'' Mayor Bill Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   When two residents asked the school board to post the Ten
Commandments, the board members expressed agreement. But the school
superintendent, Hooker, said posting the Commandments would mean a
costly lawsuit and almost certain defeat. Instead, he urged the
board to approve a more secular set of common precepts, and it
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a letter from the state ACLU warning of a lawsuit,
Hooker said the school district planned to have the Common Precepts
on the school walls when students returned for the second semester
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that posting the Ten
Commandments in schools violated the First Amendment ban on state
promotion of religion. The U.S. House of Representatives last year
passed a resolution calling for the posting of the Ten Commandments
in every public school room and courtroom in the nation. The
resolution did not address the constitutional ban.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now in the Indiana state Legislature would allow schools
and governments to display the Ten Commandments when it was part of
a larger display of historical records. Scott County school
officials say they intend to post such a display.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Scottsburg, named for the 19th-century railroad
founder Thomas Scott, say they do not understand how anyone could
take offense at the message of the precepts, even if it is inspired
by the Bible. Dave Davis, who runs an antiques store here, shook
his head with dismay over concerns that the code might violation
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the governor takes the oath of office, he puts his hand
on the Bible, doesn't he?'' Davis asked. ``It's just a darned shame
that we can't teach our kids values without somebody complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Colson, the manager of an automobile dealership and
president of the school board, said people of faith should make no
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of us on the school board believe in that God,''
Colson said. ``We're not going to turn our backs on him. You've got
to draw a line in the sand somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in Scott County believes that posting the
Common Precepts is a good idea. Falk, of the state ACLU, said it
was a Scottsburg resident who called him to complain about the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Jonathan Wakeman, a pilot who lives in
Scottsburg, nothing is wrong with religious tenets _ at home and at
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the school's job to tell students to believe in
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this won't work,'' Colson said. ``But with all the
things going on in the world, it seems to me you've got to try to
help steer kids right. You've got to stand for something.''

SENATE LEGISLATION PROPOSED ON CLOSING PUERTO RICO BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate will hold hearings next month on a bill
to close the $3 billion naval station in Puerto Rico, a move that
would clearly hurt the Puerto Rican economy, if the commonwealth
refuses to allow live-fire exercises to resume on the island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Puerto Rico Wednesday called the legislation a
``petty political move'' that would cause major economic damage to
the commonwealth, his spokesman said. But the bill's sponsor, Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that naval operations in Puerto Rico
would not make sense without the use of the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of the administration's concern over the
diminishing prospects for a settlement, John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, will meet a top official in the
administration of Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico on Thursday to
prepare for a meeting next week between the governor and President
Clinton, Puerto Rican officials said. The Clinton administration
declined to answer questions about the base closing proposal or the
upcoming meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., and chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said in an interview Wednesday that it made sense to
close the Roosevelt Roads naval station on the main island of
Puerto Rico if the commonwealth refused to allow training on the
smaller island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly of the view that if the range is lost, it is
highly likely that we would close Roosevelt Roads,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   That naval station serves the Navy battle groups and Marines
that train in Vieques and open waters around Puerto Rico. Roosevelt
Roads provides $300 million to Puerto Rico's economy each year and
employs 2,500 civilians and 2,400 military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Clinton ordered a halt to live-fire military
training on Vieques to help resolve an eight-month dispute between
the Navy and Puerto Rico. In April, a Puerto Rican civilian guard
was killed in a bombing accident, triggering political protests
that have united Puerto Rico as no other issue has.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Navy and Marines have been prevented for the
first time since 1941 from using the range for exercises they
consider essential training for combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello rejected Clinton's compromise offer, which included
restricting exercises on Vieques to non-explosive, or inert,
ordinances, reducing by half the number of days exercises are held
and ending all exercises there within five years unless the local
residents agreed to an extension. Clinton also offered Vieques a
$40 million economic revival package to demonstrate that the Navy
understood it must ``repair relations'' with the people of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Morey, the secretary of state for Puerto Rico, will meet
with Podesta on Thursday to arrange a meeting as early as next week
among the governor, Clinton, and Secretary of Defense William
Cohen, said Alfonso Aguilar, press secretary for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that the White House is receiving Morey, and
eventually the governor, shows the president is making a great
effort to look out for the welfare of the people of Vieques,''
Aguilar said. ``This is a positive first step showing the president
and the White House are still in the dialogue and willing to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   But a settlement has to be reached in the next several weeks to
allow the Navy to plan for alternatives if the battle groups can no
longer train on Vieques, senior administration and military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the pending legislation in the Senate, the Navy
would automatically examine closing Roosevelt Roads station if
Vieques was lost, a senior Naval official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between Roosevelt Roads and the mission of
Vieques range is very close,'' the official said. ``If we lose
Vieques, it would be cause for a review of the value of keeping
Roosevelt Roads.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year the Pentagon failed to persuade Congress to approve a
new round of base closings at installations around the country that
have lost their use in the post-Cold War era but continue to cost
billions of dollars to maintain. Now several senators are proposing
to close Roosevelt Roads if there are no more exercises at Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in the position of a senator or representative
who closed a military installation,'' Inhofe said. ``Politically,
you can't resist closing down Roosevelt Roads. It's a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello was not surprised that the Senate is threatening to
close Roosevelt Roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has known for some time that this argument would
be used against him,'' said Aguilar, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican officials said that Roosevelt Roads is important
even without Vieques, and is used in the war against drugs as well
as other military training.
</P>
<P>
   Since this summer, the Navy has been searching for alternatives
to Vieques for their training exercises. But military officials say
they have yet to find anything to duplicate the ``unique
qualities'' of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Navy and Marines put together a
``patchwork'' of training for the aircraft carrier Eisenhower and
its battle group, including a Marine detachment, which leaves for
its next assignment to the Mediterranean in February without
training at Vieques. Instead they used bases in Florida and North
Carolina for pilots to drop bombs and Marines to storm the beach,
as well as temporary naval artillery training on Cape Wrath in
Scotland.

BOEING DISCLOSES 163 ORDERS AND A NEW 20-JET DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ After lagging behind in this year's airplane
order race, Boeing took an $11.6 billion leap forward Wednesday,
disclosing 163 previously unannounced orders and a new deal for 20
widebody jets.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior executive said more deals are in the works and
could be finalized before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A beaming Alan Mulally, president of Boeing's Commercial
Aircraft Group, announced a new, $2.6 billion order from GE Capital
Aviation Services for 15 extended-range 767-300 jets and five
747-400 cargo airplanes. Deliveries are expected to begin in the
fourth quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Boeing significantly narrowed the lead of its
rival Airbus Industrie by changing the way it reports airplane
orders. In the past, Boeing didn't disclose orders from airlines
that didn't want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The change was a $9 billion boost to Boeing's order book,
bringing total orders so far this year to 368 versus Airbus' 430.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also had some good news Wednesday too, receiving a $1.2
billion order for 10 A330 passenger jets from Scandinavian Airlines
System.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally said Boeing's order-reporting change was made to reflect
industry practice, giving investors more company information _ and
was not an attempt to gain ground on Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, which already counts orders from unidentified
customers, viewed Boeing's move as ``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual that all of these orders come out all in one day,
in the eleventh hour,'' said Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn,
noting that her company has only a handful of undisclosed orders.
``We can both live happily in this industry. We don't have to throw
snowballs at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts said Boeing's order-reporting change was a
clear public relations move to ``one-up'' Airbus, others said it
was just following industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business about counting the airplanes is silliness,''
said Joseph Campbell, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``The real
question is who is gaining market share in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he said, that appears to be Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, investors took the news in stride, as Boeing's stock
rose 25 cents to close at $38.75 Wednesday, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 65.15 to close at 11225.32.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing wouldn't give details on its previously unannounced
orders, declining to reveal customer names or aircraft models. Many
airlines prefer to withhold order announcements for competitive or
financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally shrugged off the fact that Airbus will most likely win
this year's order race and stressed that ``at the end of the day''
airplane deliveries are really what matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year is not an indication of a longterm leadership
position,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the company has delivered 582 commercial jets so far,
with 38 more expected by the end of the month. He reiterated that
the company is on schedule to deliver 620 jetliners this year. It
already has surpassed last year's record of 563 deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing is only concerned about deliveries then why do it,''
the Airbus spokesman said of Boeing's change in the way it reports
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, a four-nation European consortium, has delivered 266
airplanes as of Nov. 30. The Toulouse, France-based company plans
to deliver 290 to 295 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Airbus plans to increase its deliveries to 310, while
Boeing will decrease deliveries to 480.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally hinted, however, that an improving Asian market could
boost total deliveries next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a soft landing in Asia,'' he said, adding
that Wednesday's order from General Electric's leasing company is a
good indication that orders from Asia are on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference to tout Boeing's ``year-end''
accomplishments, Mulally hinted that more orders will be announced
in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some very good negotiations going on with customers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally also said Boeing was on track ``to meet or exceed'' the
company's goal of a 5-percent operating margin for commercial jets
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Boeing veteran added the company plans to launch a
new version of the 777, which is expected to have a longer range,
in the first or second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done many times in the past, Mulally spent much of
Wednesday morning walking through Boeing's factory here
congratulating workers on a job well done. Boeing produces the 747,
767 and 777 airplanes in its Everett factory and the 737 and 757
models in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   He said the recently announced orders will go a long way in
improving job security for the company's employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a very good future for Everett,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   The widebody order from GE's leasing unit will allow Boeing to
keep the production rate of its slow-selling 747 at two airplanes
per month through next year, Mulally said. Boeing had considered
reducing the 747 production rate to 1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Airbus acknowledged Wednesday it is having production
problems on its A320 assembly lines and will delay delivery of
those models by a couple of weeks next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have been given notice,'' Greczyn said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a data entry problem at Britain's BAE Systems Plc, an
Airbus partner, caused the delay of the A320 wing production, which
in turn pushed back the delivery dates for the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has already been solved,'' she said, noting,
``this is a minor delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie's backlog of orders not yet delivered was 1,436
as of Nov. 30, compared with Boeing's 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to put Boeing out of business, we just want
50 percent of the market,'' the Airbus spokeswoman said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel and Syria Wednesday resumed peace
negotiations that stalled nearly four years ago, with the modest
goal of surviving two days of breaking the ice in a relationship
long frozen by mutual mistrust. That goal appeared likely to be
met.
</P>
<P>
   As the day kicked off in a small ceremony in the Rose Garden, it
carried the makings of a historic moment, with Israel and Syria
standing resolutely on the brink of a new dialogue that could spell
the end of a decades-long conflict. The mood quickly soured when
the Syrians publicly reiterated well-worn grievances against the
Israelis, signaling just how rocky the road ahead may be, but
later, behind closed doors, the mood apparently sweetened once
more.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday did begin the highest-level Israeli-Syrian talks to
date, what President Clinton called ``a big step along the path''
to peace. First at the White House, then at the Blair House, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel met with Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa of Syria under the auspices of Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The face-to-face encounter sent a clear signal of intentions as
both sides approached the negotiating table with a determination to
see things through to an eventual agreement. A firm desire to make
peace was voiced by both sides, and Clinton urged them to seize the
moment and by Thursday present him with an itinerary for their
peacemaking, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday night, an Israeli official reported, Barak was
in good spirits, indicating that the atmosphere at the negotiations
had been positive and productive, and that both sides seemed
willing to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not underestimate the importance of the simple fact
that the two parties are here,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was almost startling to see the Israeli and Syrian
officials file out and take their places side by side in the wet
grass behind the White House Wednesday morning. A skullcap on his
head, the Israeli attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, chatted
amiably with a Syrian official, as if small talk between the two
sides were an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barak, al-Sharaa and Clinton marched out in their somber
suits and did a little shuffle. Barak and al-Sharaa stood on the
wrong sides of Clinton, until Barak said, with a fleeting smile,
``I think we have to change,'' and they did.
</P>
<P>
   From there on, it was downhill, an inauspicious start. Clinton
and Barak did as planned, giving short, idealistic speeches about
the desire for peace and the difficulty of securing it. Al-Sharaa,
on the other hand, cleared his throat, placed his glasses at the
tip of his nose and took advantage of a rare platform.
</P>
<P>
   Making excuses for speaking at relative length on such a cold
day, he nonetheless launched into a substantial summary of Syria's
grievances. The Israeli occupation, in sum, is the root of all
misery, not just Syrian misery but Israeli misery as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return
of all its occupied land,'' he said, ``while for Israel, peace will
mean the end of the psychological fear that the Israelis have been
living in as a result of the existence of occupation, which is
undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   As al-Sharaa spoke those words, Barak clasped his hands, pursed
his lips and stared forward without expression. American officials
shifted uneasily from foot to foot. A senior official later said
the Israelis were upset by al-Sharaa's nonconciliatory tone, which
quickly and jarringly broke the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had talked broadly and hopefully, pronouncing this a
juncture unlike any other in the long Israeli-Arab peacemaking
effort. ``For the first time in history, there is a chance of a
comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and, indeed, all its
neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the resolve of both Barak, whom he called ``an
exceptional hero in war'' who is now ``a determined soldier for
peace,'' and President Hafez Assad of Syria, who also ``has known
the cost of war.'' Without such adornments, he referred to
al-Sharaa as ``an able representative'' of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Then, very succinctly, Barak reiterated his broad intentions in
pursuing peace, making a point to refer to the Syrians as ``our
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step
forward toward peace,'' he said in a three-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa, though, refused to be stage-managed. He spoke with
apparent awareness of his audience at home and throughout the Arab
world. He gave the impression that he could not let himself be
manipulated by the Israeli and the Americans into performing on
cue, not as he was entering negotiations in which Syria would take
the exceptional step of accepting the permanence of the Jewish
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He proclaimed that now as ever before, all Syria wanted was to
reclaim ``all its occupied land,'' that is, the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau that Israel seized during the 1967 war. He
criticized the media at large for portraying Syria as ``the
aggressor,'' the one ``who shelled settlements from the Golan prior
to the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These claims carry no grain of truth,'' he said, taking the
inflammatory step of citing the memoirs of Moshe Dayan, the
legendary Israeli general, as proof: ``As Moshe Dayan himself
explained in his memoirs, it was the other side who insisted on
provoking the Syrians until they clashed together and then they
claimed that the Syrians are the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa also made it clear that the Syrians still wanted to
pick up negotiations where they felt they had been broken off in
1996. The Syrians maintain that Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli
prime minister, had promised that Israel would withdraw from the
full Golan Heights, down to the border of June 4, 1967. That, in
the Syrians' interpretation, extended to the shoreline of the Sea
of Galilee. The Israelis deny that this promise was ever made, and
dispute the interpretation of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these talks are to succeed as rapidly as we all desire, no
one should ignore what has been achieved until now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, al-Sharaa did embrace the idealism of peace,
which he said could not only end violence in the region but also
``usher in a dialogue of civilization and honorable competition in
various domains _ the political, cultural, scientific and
economic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And he also posed an intellectual question, as if he were
already reflecting backward from the vantage point of a resolved
conflict: Would the Israeli-Arab conflict be that which ``defined''
or ``frustrated'' Arab unity?
</P>
<P>
   In Israeli-Arab peace negotiations, there is often a good deal
of public posturing aimed at the audiences back home. Sometimes,
belligerent words mask real progress at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Al-Sharaa met for a total of just under two hours, but
never, as had been expected, without the Americans present. They
started in a trilateral meeting with Clinton in the Oval Office and
picked up again in a three-way meeting with Albright. The Israelis
and the Syrians agreed to let the White House speak publicly about
the very sensitive talks so as not to harm whatever progress was
made with public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, the presidential spokesman, said that in the meeting
with Clinton, both sides ``raised their positions and concerns
while acknowledging that the other side's concerns needed to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides made clear their desire for peace,'' he said. ``We
believe that this is an historic start. No one expected this to be
easy. The issues are complicated. It's not surprising that there
are real differences at this point, but both parties displayed a
serious intent. ''

JACK D. FONER, 88, HISTORIAN AND PIONEER IN BLACK STUDIES, DIES AT
88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, N.Y.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack D. Foner, a professor of American history who
established one of the country's first programs in black studies
and later became a victim of political blacklisting, died on Friday
at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Foner was caught up in an early, pre-McCarthy Red scare through
a chain of events that began in 1935 when he started teaching
history at the downtown branch of the City College of New York, now
called Baruch College. It was there that he became involved in
causes like support for the anti-fascist forces in Spain, the trade
union movement and the campaign for civil rights for
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these associations, Foner was called in 1941 before
the Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational
System of the State of New York, named the Rapp-Coudert Committee
after its two sponsors. Failing to answer the committee's
questions, he was branded a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether he actually joined the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was a member of the Communist Party, he wasn't trying to
overthrow the United States government,'' said Ellen Schrecker, a
professor of history at Yeshiva University, who knew Foner. She
described him as a sincere idealist.''
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint against Foner was that he devoted excessive
attention to the role of blacks in American history.
</P>
<P>
   He was among 60 faculty and staff members at City College who
were dismissed for their unwillingness to testify before the
committee. He was then unable to find a teaching job for almost
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 the New York City Board of Higher Education apologized
to Foner and his fellow victims, terming the events of 1941 an
``egregious violation of academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Foner served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945 and was assigned
mainly to menial chores like caring for horses at a barracks in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Foner supported himself and his family as a
free &UR; - &LR; lance lecturer on current events. He also joined his three
brothers, all of whom were blacklisted, to form the Foner
Orchestra, which played swing music at Catskill resorts. Foner
played the drums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he was hired by Colby College in Waterville, Maine,
where he established a black studies program. Foner retired from
Colby in 1976 and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the college
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Donald Foner was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 14, 1910. He
attended Eastern District High School and graduated from City
College in 1929. He then earned a master's degree in 1933 and a
doctorate in 1967 in American history, both from Columbia
University. His best-known book is ``Blacks in the Military in
American History'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Liza; a son, Eric, a professor of
history at Columbia University, of Manhattan; two brothers, Moe, of
Manhattan, and Henry, of Brooklyn; and a grandaughter.

2 ACCUSED OF FRAUDULENTLY INFLATING A STOCK VIA INTERNET MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (subs 8th graf to change Derzakarian to Derzakharian) 
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a case that shows both how easy it is to artificially inflate
the price of stocks on the Internet and how quickly prosecutors can
identify the culprits, two California men were charged Wednesday
with sending bogus messages over the Internet to pump up the price
of a bankrupt company.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles and the Securities and Exchange
Commission contend that the men, both 23 and recent college
graduates, used the Internet to artificially propel the price of an
obscure stock from 15 cents a share to more than $15 in less than
two trading days in November, reaping $364,000 in profits for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nov. 12, according to prosecutors, Arash
Aziz-Golshani, Hootan Melamed _ the two men charged _ and a third
man, Allen Derzakharian, 26, sat down at public computers in the
University of California at Los Angeles biomedical library and
tapped into the Internet. Using 50 different Web identities, the
three men sent more than 500 messages to three hot investment Web
sites during the course of the weekend, all touting shares of NEI
Webworld Inc., a bankrupt commercial printing company based in
Dallas, calling it an imminent takeover candidate even though they
knew it was not.
</P>
<P>
   The case is among the first to illustrate how easy it is to send
stocks soaring by utilizing the Internet. But prosecutors said the
case also sends an important message to people who think the
anonymity of the Internet allows them to manipulate stocks by
posting false statements about a company. Although securities
regulators say that many people who violate securities laws have
migrated to the Internet, this case shows how quickly investigators
can track down anyone who electronically posts bogus messages about
companies or stocks.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is no longer the Wild Wild Web,'' said
Christopher Painter, assistant U.S. attorney for the Central
District of California and that office's computer crime
coordinator. ``It's a new territory that law enforcement is trying
to tame. We will go after these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that the men began promoting NEI Webworld
electronically after they had purchased 97 percent of the company's
available stock for themselves at prices ranging from 5 cents to 17
cents a share. In October, there was virtually no market activity
in shares of NEI, which traded on only three of 21 trading days. On
Friday, Nov. 12, the stock closed at 13 cents a share. But
rhapsodic messages sent by the men over the weekend whipped up
investor interest in the shares and the stock opened for trading
the following Monday at $8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors eagerly bought the shares, pushing them to $15.50 in
approximately half an hour, prosecutors say. Meanwhile,
Aziz-Golshani, Melamed and Derzakharian sold their shares into the
buying frenzy at prices between 25 cents and $15.1875.
Aziz-Golshani made $152,742 in profits and Melamed and Derzakharian
realized $211,250 in gains.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz-Golshani and Melamed were arrested in Los Angeles on
Wednesday afternoon on the criminal charge. The SEC filed civil
fraud charges against them and Derzakharian, accusing them of
sending false messages. Aziz-Golshani and Melamed were charged by
the U.S. attorney's office with a single count of criminal
conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Derzakharian was not
criminally charged by the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said: ``Let
this serve as a warning to con men: if you use the Internet to
manipulate our securities markets, we can and will find you. Though
the perpetrators in the case went to great lengths to hide from us,
we discovered them within a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Under securities laws, it is illegal to engage in false
representations or manipulative practices when buying or selling a
security. This is just what Golshani and Melamed did, say
prosecutors. The court froze the assets of all three men.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Aziz-Golshani is Randall Sunshine, of
Liner Yankelevitz Sunshine Weinhart &AMP; Regenstreif LLP in Santa
Monica. Sunshine said he could not comment on the complaint because
he had not yet read it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Werksman, the lawyer representing Melamed, said: ``My
client denies manipulating the market in the way that the
government alleges. Until we know more about exactly what they
claim my client did and how the market was affected, it's too early
to tell how this case will turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, one of the men posted 10 identical
messages on various Yahoo finance message boards predicting a
buyout of NEI, whose stock trades under the symbol NEIP, by a
private company called LGC Wireless. Using the web name
`ticlopidinel,' the messages said: ``Buying NEIP early would
entitle you to a share of LGC Wireless when it goes public next
week. Look for a massive move to $5-$10 as wireless stocks are very
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe that Aziz-Golshani and Melamed penned the
message and based their Web name on ticlopidine, the name of a
stroke-prevention drug that had been discussed in classes that
Melamed had recently attended as a pharmacy student at Western
University of Health Sciences in Pomona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When a skeptic in the chat room questioned the viability of a
NEI buyout, prosecutors say, Aziz-Golshani posted this answer: ``I
called on Saturday and no officers were in to answer my call, just
a receptionist who are always the last to know.'' Then, he added:
``People who know of the deal are buying in given the large volume
the last few days. ...''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But no buyout came. After peaking above $15 on Monday, Nov. 15,
NEI shares closed at 75 cents. The stock closed Wednesday at 18.75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say that securities fraud has migrated to the
Internet because stocks can be propelled there with little more
than effusive talk and rosy predictions. Before the Web became
stock-tip central, someone who wanted to manipulate a company's
shares had to employ rooms full of stockbrokers flogging stocks to
unsuspecting investors by telephone. Now an electronic message does
the trick instantly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the criminal case against Aziz-Golshani and
Melamed contend that the Internet touting of NEI was not the first
for the two men. Although Aziz-Golshani, who lives in Beverly
Hills, told prosecutors that he operates a business from his home
selling leather jackets online, messages emanating from computers
at the UCLA biomedical library last September touted shares in a
company called Justwebit.com Inc. A review of brokerage firm
account statements belonging to Aziz-Golshani and Hooshang Melamed,
Hootan Melamed's father, indicate that trades in the company were
made that resulted in profits to both. Aziz-Golshani graduated from
UCLA last spring.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Upon arriving in the big Amazon port of
Belem several months ago, Patricia Moles, the manager of a
venture-capital fund, was faced with an unusual investment-related
decision: whether to continue by boat to the hearts-of-palm
plantation in which her fund was hoping to acquire a minority
stake, a trip that would take 12 hours, or to rent a propeller
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time was a must so I chose the plane,'' said Ms. Moles, 33, a
native of Mexico, whose Brazil-based employer, Banco Axial, looks
for investments in environmentally friendly companies. Although her
trip was off the beaten track of the briefcase bankers who stick to
financial centers like Sao Paulo, it was indicative of a new
investment trend that is sweeping Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are searching the region for opportunities
in young companies, much as they have been doing in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these financiers like the challenge of nontraditional
investments _ organically produced hearts of palm, for example,
grown from custom-selected and germinated seeds that generate a
continuing supply of palm stems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most venture capitalists investing in companies with a Latin
American focus, like those providing seed money to ventures in the
United States, are seeking out high technology _ particularly
Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   The quest is complicated by the often precarious nature of Latin
American economies as well as the relative lack of advanced
technology, along with the generally frenetic nature of the young
Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of venture-capital investing is part of the wider
trend of private equity investors focusing on Latin America, a huge
market. Though the region has quickly embraced the Internet, it
still has a long way to go in terms of wealth and technology to
catch up with the richest industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier waves of investment, most of which came from
abroad or were state-sponsored, the venture-capital investments of
the last few years have pitted some of Latin America's richest
people against foreigners, particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Latin Americans are Juan Navarro, president of the
Exxel Group, one of Argentina's largest privately owned companies;
Jorge Paulo Lemann, founder of Garantia, a big Brazilian investment
bank now owned by the Credit Suisse Group, and Carlos Slim Helu,
chairman of Telefonos de Mexico. Then there are the people who work
for, or are partners in the venture-capital funds controlled by
these investors.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Bonchristiano is an example of this new breed. Six
months ago, Bonchristiano, 32, was a partner in a fund that is part
of GP Investimentos, an investment group based here, whose owners
include Lemann. His task was to seek out an appealing Brazilian
Internet company and buy it.
</P>
<P>
   What he came up with was BookNet, an online bookseller similar
to Amazon.com, and GP acquired a controlling stake. In something of
an unusual twist, Bonchristiano became the company's chief
executive, switching roles from venture capitalist to entrepreneur.
Using his knowledge of the game, he then went to New York to drum
up additional money, and returned with $14.3 million from firms
like Warburg Pincus and individual investors like Henry Kravis of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   BookNet was renamed Submarino, and now the company's
headquarters in Sao Paulo is brimming with 50 employees working
14-hour days and relieving stress at a couple of pinball and
foosball machines. The company has opened offices in Spain,
Argentina and Mexico, and aims to become the leading online
shopping destination in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dreamlike for me as a Brazilian,'' Bonchristiano said
in English polished during his undergraduate years at Oxford.
``Brazil was colonized for so long, either economically,
intellectually or technologically, and the Internet is changing
that. With new access to investment and technology, the playing
field is leveled.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's capitalist structures are still considered
relatively backward, though. Domestic stock markets are riddled
with labyrinthine regulations that make it hard to buy or sell
securities. And some investors, including Dennis Rodrigues, a
partner in the Sao Paulo-based firm FIR Capital, see the evolution
of domestic capital markets as the key to the success of
venture-capital investing in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But other investors, as well as many entrepreneurs, are drawn by
the possibility of leapfrogging local exchanges and listing their
companies on markets in the United States, nearly always Nasdaq,
hoping for some of the paper wealth made possible by a market
fascinated with dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Going public on Nasdaq is a lot easier with help from people who
have generous sources of capital and who also know the U.S.
regulatory environment. That is where venture capitalists from the
United States come in. Among the most active of these is Chase
Capital Partners, part of Chase Manhattan Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Flatiron Partners of New York, Chase Capital
Partners has invested in five Internet companies that focus on
Latin America. The largest, StarMedia Network, a New York-based
portal company for Spanish and Portuguese speakers worldwide that
also provides Internet access in some Latin American countries, has
been its biggest success so far. After StarMedia went public
earlier this year, the initial investment by Chase and Flatiron of
$29 million grew to well over $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   While some venture operations, like GP Investimentos, often seek
to acquire control of companies, others, including Chase, have
invested in Latin America in a way that is closer to the
traditional Silicon Valley model of providing seed capital to small
companies that then proceed through several rounds of financing
before going public. Usually, this model involves the purchase of a
minority stake in the company, through which management direction
is provided but not dictated.

 &HT;    Southwestern Bell seeks PUC blessing
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Public Utility Commission today will try
again to decide whether to bless _ as Chairman Pat Wood has put it
_ Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s application to start selling
long-distance service in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the long-distance business is a major goal for
Southwestern Bell. The company sees it as the last big piece it
needs if it is to sell a complete telecommunications package:
long-distance calling, local service, Internet connections,
wireless and even video.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance is also critical to the company if it is to
compete effectively in the burgeoning field of transmitting
computer data across the country.
</P>
<P>
   It had appeared that Southwestern Bell might get at least a 2-1
vote from the PUC at its Nov. 4 meeting, but the commissioners were
too badly divided to even vote.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval lies with the Federal Communications Commission,
but the FCC must consider the recommendations of the state
regulatory agency and the U.S. Department of Justice. To date, no
Bell company has won FCC approval to sell long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   What the PUC continues to hear from Southwestern Bell's critics
is that the telephone giant still has not fully opened its local
network to competitors, which federal law says it must do before it
can sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   That dual role for Southwestern Bell _ providing wholesale
network services to competitors even as its retail teams battle
them over customers _ has generated considerable disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And today's meeting comes shortly after two PUC arbitrators, in
a separate proceeding, issued findings that critics are expected to
say show that Southwestern Bell still discriminates against
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration pitted Southwestern Bell against two companies
wanting to sell new ``digital subscriber loop,'' or DSL service, in
Texas: Covad Communications Co., based in Santa Clara, Calif.; and
Rhythms Links Inc., a subsidiary of Rhythms NetConnections Inc. of
Englewood, Colo. DSL provides high-speed connections for the
Internet. Southwestern Bell considers DSL so important it has
launched a $6 billion project to upgrade its network so that
virtually all its customers can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Covad and Rhythms also sell DSL, but they rely on Southwestern
Bell's network to reach their customers.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the two arbitrators, Katherine Farroba and
Rowland Curry, criticized Southwestern Bell for not keeping its
wholesale and retail DSL operations separate enough.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has asked the PUC for a new hearing in the
case, saying that DSL technology and its own procedures have
changed so much in just the past few months ``that much of the
evidentiary record is incorrect and/or incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   Dineen Majcher, an attorney for Rhythms, objected, saying that
any more delay would ``substantially harm'' its efforts to compete
with Southwestern Bell in DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   Majcher also reminded the commission that Southwestern Bell
already had paid $850,000 in sanctions in this case for its earlier
failure to provide all the required witnesses and internal
documents.

<P>
   ``Being a venture capitalist in Latin America largely involves
adapting what has worked in the United States to what is realistic
in countries like Mexico and Brazil,'' said Susan Segal, head of
Latin American operations for Chase Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce, for instance, is as strong a lure in the region as
it is in the United States, and has accounted for some of Chase's
bets _ like its recent investment in Mercado Livre, an Internet
company hoping to reproduce online some of the fervor of a
boisterous open-air market. The Boston Consulting Group estimates
that revenue from electronic commerce in Latin America will grow to
$3.8 billion in 2003 from $167 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while most signs point to the growth of purchases over the
Internet, and of Latin American Internet use in general, obstacles
to such rosy outcomes remain. According to a report by
International Data Corp., weak credit card processing operations,
the high cost of basic Internet service and precarious and costly
shipping networks will inhibit the spread of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And the use of computers and even telephones in the region is
still relatively low, a limiting factor for all Internet
businesses. For instance, in Brazil, Latin America's largest
country, there are an estimated 12 telephone lines for each 100
people, compared with more than 50 lines for every 100 people in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the entrepreneurial culture that speeds the creation of
start-ups in the United States is different in Latin America.
``Some entrepreneurs that are used to sealing deals with a
handshake don't realize that a lot of rigorous detail is needed to
put together a venture-capital deal,'' said Lisa Krochmal, a lawyer
in the Buenos Aires office of Morrison &AMP; Foerster, an American firm
active in new technology deals.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the erratic nature of the Internet industry
itself. As in the United States, most young Internet companies in
Latin America lose money. This, coupled with the boom-and-bust
cycles of Latin American economies, makes some investors wary of
betting on the region's young companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to get burned when they realize that
transforming an interesting idea in Brazil into a stock appealing
to retail investors in the U.S. is no piece of cake,'' Rodrigues of
FIR Capital said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, where some people see obstacles, others see opportunities
_ opportunities that require capital to realize.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to bring Internet access to people without a phone or a
computer, an American, Terrence Danial, helped found NetKiosk, a
Buenos Aires-based company that sells stand-alone units equipped
with a PC that allows users to surf the Net for a fee. In addition
to sales of the units, which are put in places like hotel lobbies,
NetKiosk hopes to gain revenue from selling advertising that
appears on the units as well as on the company's portal page. But
NetKiosk has had trouble attracting seed money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, venture capital in Latin America still has a long
way to go,'' said Danial, adding that the seed-money industry is
not as well developed in the region as it is in the United States
and that potential backers are often warier of taking risks. ``A
lot of investors are still seeing things from traditional business
mind-sets,'' he said.

AMAZON.COM SAYS IT CAN MAKE THOSE HOLIDAY DEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Amazon.com, the world's largest Internet retailer, is
distinguishing itself among e-tailers by meeting its customers'
delivery requests in a timely manner, and it expects to keep doing
so through Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bill Curry said Amazon can still guarantee Dec. 24
delivery on in-stock items ordered by Dec. 22 and shipped priority.
The same can't be said of some other e-tailers surveyed this week
by the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last Thursday posted a note on its Web site
warning it can't guarantee delivery by Christmas, the Journal said.
EToys still guarantees Christmas delivery of orders placed through
Dec. 17 with priority delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 million people may shop online this holiday season,
placing 37 million orders worth as much as $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Few e-shoppers will realize that though the Internet is a better
way to place orders, it no more ensures the timely delivery of
those orders than do toll-free phone numbers, faxes or even the
U.S. Postal Service. No matter how they're placed, all merchandise
orders end up in the same `In' tray to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   So what will really distinguish an e-tailer this season is how
well its back-end order-fulfillment works.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com reports its system is working smoothly. Seven U.S.
distribution centers are operating to fill a flow of orders that
chief operating officer Joseph Galli, working his first Christmas
at the company, described Wednesday as ``record-breaking ...
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people, nearly twice the normal number, are working
five 11-hour shifts a week in the south Seattle distribution
center. The workers _ many of them young, tattooed,
multiple-pierced, and sporting hair in colors not found in nature _
earn betwen $8.50 and $14 an hour. Working right beside them are a
smattering of company executives.
</P>
<P>
   A full inventory of books, CDs and videos is warehoused in each
of the seven centers, cutting delivery times on those items. Galli
said Amazon ordered extremely popular items, like Pokemon
characters and Sega Dreamcast video game systems, in such large
quantities that they're still in stock.

SENATE ATOMIC-SPYING PANEL CANCELS HEARINGS AT FREEH'S URGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate Judiciary subcommittee investigating the
government's handling of evidence of Chinese nuclear spying has
canceled two closed hearings scheduled for this week because the
FBI director, Louis Freeh, feared that testimony there might harm
the prosecution of Dr. Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The review by the Senate panel involves the way investigators
approached evidence that the Chinese had stolen data concerning
America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88, and is not
directly related to the case against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh feared that hearings on the W-88 case would include
testimony by officials also involved in the Lee case and so would
create documents to which Lee's lawyers might gain access in the
pretrial discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the subcommittee, headed by Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., agreed to cancel a hearing scheduled for Tuesday and a
follow-up session set for Thursday. It will continue its
investigation and has not agreed with the FBI never to hold
hearings on the matter, but at present it has no other hearings
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Director Freeh made a reasonable request based on national
security issues, and so Senator Specter and I agreed to defer to
those needs,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the
panel's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a nuclear engineer who formerly worked at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, was indicted and arrested last Friday, charged
with downloading nuclear secrets from a classified computer at Los
Alamos and copying the data onto portable computer tapes, some of
which have not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded not guilty on Monday, when a federal magistrate in
Albuquerque, N.M., ordered him held without bail until trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged with passing the downloaded information
to China or any other country. But the downloads were discovered
only after he had drawn attention from federal agents exploring
evidence that China might have stolen data related to the W-88
warhead, which was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Now many officials say the government's initial inquiry into the
possible theft of W-88 data focused prematurely on Lee as a prime
suspect, inasmuch as the information might have been available from
other government agencies and from military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno ordered that
federal agents broaden the espionage investigation, which is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The closed hearing on Tuesday that had been planned by the
Senate subcommittee would have involved officials from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the Energy
Department, which runs Los Alamos and other national weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   One issue of interest to Lee's lawyers is the degree to which
government officials dissented from the way the W-88 investigation
was handled. Officials now say that a scientist dissented from an
initial administrative inquiry conducted by the Energy Department
and the FBI into the possibility of W-88 data theft.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry, conducted in 1995, came up with a list of 12
potential suspects at Los Alamos, but pointed to Lee as the most
likely suspect, officials say.

A CHAMPION OF CAPITALISM IN INDIA HOLDS OUT HOPE FOR THE
DOWNTRODDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS first 2 grafs to change description from apartment to
house, change `government clerk' to civil servant.) 
 (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGALORE, India _ The slight, bespectacled computer engineer
who starts each day by cleaning the toilet in his family's small,
spartan house hardly seems to be the new archetype of a wildly
successful Indian entrepreneur, boldly steering his country away
from decades of state-dominated, bureaucratic socialism and into a
new era of capitalist growth.
</P>
<P>
   But in India, where a long line of Hindu ascetics have captured
the popular imagination _ most famously, the independence leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi _ it is fitting that one of the country's most
influential champions of capitalism and hottest software tycoons
should be a man who lives as if he were a humble civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The man, N.R. Narayana Murthy (pronounced MOOR-tee), was making
$25,000 a year as a software engineer in a Bombay company when he
founded Infosys Technologies Ltd. in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He sheepishly estimated his net worth at $600 million in stock
recently as he sat on a plain, angular couch in his living room,
harshly lighted by a bare fluorescent bulb.
</P>
<P>
   As the gap between the richest and poorest widens in booming
cities like this one, Murthy, 53, the son of a high-caste Brahmin
math teacher, says the new rich must live simply, even austerely,
if capitalism is to become an accepted model for social betterment
in a country where 300 million poor people still struggle just to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary rise of Murthy, his company and the software
services industry in India has come to represent the hope that what
he calls ``compassionate capitalism'' can provide decent,
desperately needed jobs and the national wealth to improve health
and literacy levels in a country whose population has more than
tripled since it won independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to sell capitalism to the people, we have to
practice a lifestyle that does not seem unattainable,'' he said.
``We want more and more people to become entrepreneurs. If the tea
stall owner in a small village can say, `Hey, these guys can do it;
so can I,' and get his business into the next orbit, then our job
is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Murthy, a former leftist who is the first member of his family
to go into business, saw the potential of the software services
industry earlier than most.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that Indian companies could employ Indian computer
engineers _ who speak English and are willing to work for a
fraction of what their American counterparts earn _ to make healthy
profits selling software services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   The first decade was hard. The country still had a centrally
planned, government-dominated economy. It took Murthy nine months
to get the company's first telephone line and three years to
persuade the bureaucracy to allow Infosys to import its first
computers. Whenever people in the company needed to travel abroad,
they had to get permission from a government official.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, facing a severe balance of payments crisis, the
Indian government began loosening its hold on the economy. Murthy's
staff no longer needed permission to travel, and barriers to
importing the latest technology were removed. The government office
that had set the prices on stock offerings at below-market levels
was abolished. In 1993, Infosys went public with a $10 million
valuation, generating the capital for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies like Infosys have been less hobbled by
India's chronically poor roads, unreliable phone lines and frequent
power outages than other industries. Infosys can ship its products
over private satellite lines. And it has built its own power
generators to guarantee a steady supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken off in the 1990s, growing at rates that
have ranged from 27 percent to 106 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   This year its stock seems to scale dizzying new heights daily.
It has climbed past more established companies to become the second
or third most highly valued company on the Bombay stock exchange,
depending on the day, with a market capitalization of more than $7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In March it became the first Indian company listed on an
American stock exchange, Nasdaq, where its share price then
rocketed from $34 to more than $250, with a market capitalization
above $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has pioneered changes in the business culture of
India, offering stock options to workers, opening its books to
independent auditors and starting a foundation to help the
underprivileged, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves have built investor confidence and employee loyalty,
enabling Infosys to hang on to talent that has been assiduously
courted by the multinationals that have moved to India. Other
companies in the south Indian triangle of high technology _
Bangalore, Madras and Hyderabad _ have adopted similar strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of the newly minted yuppie wealth in Bangalore, with a
population of over 5 million, are visible in bustling streets lined
with brand-name stores, a profusion of pubs where twentysomething
programmers go to party, and large new apartment complexes decked
out with health clubs, bowling alleys, swimming pools and tennis
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in India, where the biggest industrial houses have
traditionally been handed down through families like feudal
empires, Murthy founded Infosys with six men who had each been
earning about $5,000 a year while they worked under him in a Bombay
company's software unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infosys shows that it is possible for middle-class people with
no family heritage of being in business to build a lot of wealth
from scratch in one generation,'' said Nandan M. Nilekani, who
helped found the company in his 20s and who is now its 44-year-old
chief operating officer and president. ``It is creating
opportunities for people who thought the only way to get ahead was
to migrate to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Like young people now thronging the industry, the company's
founders were educated in the huge network of universities and
engineering colleges in India that has produced a pool of
technically skilled, English-speaking workers second only to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While India has neglected primary education, it built first-rate
schools in the 1950s and 1960s like the Indian Institutes of
Technology as part of its striving, as a young nation, for
scientific and industrial achievement. Murthy earned his master's
in electrical engineering at the institute in Kanpur and has since
become a benefactor of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many institute graduates still migrate to Silicon Valley in
search of high-paying jobs, but increasingly there are
opportunities for them at home.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of Infosys' 5,000 employees _ whose average
age is 26, as in the industry as a whole _ hold stock options and
125 of them have become millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 74,000 people, virtually all of them engineers,
applied for 1,500 jobs at the company. Salaries start at about
$4,000 a year in a country where per capita income is less than
$400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Murthy, who makes a salary of $36,000 a year for serving as
chief executive of Infosys, was horrified when asked recently if
his children would inherit the business. ``No, no!'' he exclaimed.
``Absolutely not. I can stand on any platform and say we run our
company in the most professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The software industry is growing up not just in south India, but
also to the north in New Delhi and nearby Gurgaon and to the west
in Bombay and Pune. India's software exports have risen from to
$2.7 billion last year from $150 million in 1991, most of them
bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 600 companies in India that export
software services, employing 280,000 computer engineers, according
to the New Delhi-based industry association, the National
Association of Software and Service Companies.
</P>
<P>
   These young men and women write computer programs for basic
corporate functions: payroll, inventory, billing and sales
commissions. They fix Y2K problems. And they design systems for
electronic commerce ventures, as well as for the myriad other
software applications of computers in business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them will strike out on their own. ``The bug is biting
in Bangalore,'' said Ashwin Hegde, 26, a computer engineer at
Infosys. ``That's what everybody is thinking about all the time _
starting your own company. There's a lot of money to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   While the software industry has provided good jobs, and those
workers in turn have created a demand for housing, restaurants and
other services in Bangalore, the presence of the industry has not
done as much as executives at Infosys would like to broadly improve
the city's schools, roads and health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to form a stronger link between the software boom and
the benefit to society,'' said Nilekani, president of Infosys.
``How does the city get hard cash to improve itself?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is no state income tax in Karnataka. The system for
collecting property taxes in the city is weak, they say. And the
national government levies no income tax on profits from software
exports _ a situation that Murthy says should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country like India, which is starved for resources, I
don't see any justification for tax exemptions for companies which
compete successfully in the global marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Infosys' 42-acre campus in Bangalore, Murthy rushed around
one recent afternoon, overseeing the large-scale expansion of
office space now going up, scribbling his OK on every aspect of the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is a balding man with dark circles under his eyes whose pants
are pulled up a little high on his waist. At Infosys, his word is
law. In the men's room, decorated in malachite green marble, he
said the white cabinets had to go. In the pantry, he decreed there
must be a place for the man who makes the tea to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   On a decorative bracket painted bright yellow, he simply
scribbled, ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For young engineers, this new workplace will offer many perks: a
gymnasium and aerobics studio, a meditation room and pool hall, a
jacuzzi and sauna, not to mention beautifully landscaped grounds
planted with trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed in the details of the building project, Murthy seemed
surprised when asked how he could be so caught up in the aesthetics
of the company's home and so inattentive to his own. Pen raised to
sign off on a soft gray stone tile, he paused to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long we have emphasized matters that are personal and
familial,'' he said. ``I have a fetish. I am extremely fastidious
about anything public. In my personal life, as long as its clean
it's OK. In this country, people have to start putting the public
ahead of the personal good.''

 ANOTHER WASTED SHOT IN THE DARK  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)   c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One warm summer evening last June, for reasons we don't know, a
person we haven't captured pointed a pistol we haven't found into
the night sky and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been a few blocks south of Camelback Road and a few
blocks west of Central Avenue. Perhaps he was standing on the
street or in his back yard, or perhaps he was riding in an automo
bile. Perhaps, even, it was a she.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon was fired and the sharp si lent bullet rose into the
darkness, arching gently about a mile above the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   It hesitated there, the way a diver seems to hang for a moment
above the diving board. Then, down.
</P>
<P>
   The small metal projectile bored through the still air. One
hundred feet per second. Three hundred. Five hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Below, in a house in central Phoenix, 14-year-old Shannon Smith
chatted with a friend on the telephone. She said she heard a noise
outside, something that sounded to her like an automobile acci
dent.
</P>
<P>
   The phone was portable so she carried it with her into the back
yard. Above, the tiny slug plunged furiously toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There are 473 square miles in the city of Phoenix, many of them
empty unpaved desert, uncluttered by office buildings and houses,
unoccupied by men or women or little girls. But that isn't where
the bullet came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's father found her in the yard at 10:40 p.m. &QL; 
MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR &QL; 
A day later, preparing for his daughter's funeral, Otis Smith said,
``No parent should ever go through this.'' And he's correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths live in a nice neighborhood in a nice house with a
9-foot block wall surrounding their back yard. Still, their
daughter was killed. It was more than they could bear. It's more
than any of us could bear.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths got together with a few members of the Arizona State
Legislature and came up with a proposed new law that would increase
penalties for ran domly discharging a firearm from a mis demeanor
to a Class 6 felony.
</P>
<P>
   A version of ``Shannon's Law'' passed the state Senate but
hasn't yet been ap proved by the House. Parents' organiza tions,
politicians, newspapers and even the National Rifle Association are
in fa vor of it. They say the new law will do something good for
all of us. And it will.
</P>
<P>
   It'll make us feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   We already have a law we could use to charge with a felony
anyone who fires a weapon in a populated area.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is reckless endangerment and the statute reads: ``A
person commits endangerment by recklessly endangering another
person with a substantial risk of imminent death or physical
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting off a pistol in a neighborhood more than qualifies. &QL; 
MESSAGE TO THE POLICE &QL; 
But, enforcing an existing law doesn't quite ease the pain. Not
when we've lost a little girl. That takes a new law. Shan non's
Law. One of those trying to get it approved in the state House is
state Sen. Chris Cummiskey.
</P>
<P>
   He told me Wednesday, ``Some neigh borhoods where random gunfire
is a reg ular occurence indicated that even with `reckless
endangerment' out there on the landscape, law enforcement has not
been coming out and pressing for some conclu sion to this in those
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a new law would send a message to the police. Maybe
it will. That would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sending a message to ordinary gun owners is
absolutely vital. A good advertising campaign would do that, though
it won't stop all the gunfire. If caught, the person who killed
Shannon Smith would do time for manslaughter. That won't stop all
the gunfire, either.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Shannon's Law say they, too, would like to see
more public service announcements about the dangers of fir ing
weapons into the air, but they still want their new law.
</P>
<P>
   I can't fault them. The loss of any little girl is unacceptable.
It's more than any of us can bear. But we won't keep it from
happening again by taking our own shot in the dark. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee, had not begun to testify before
Congress on Wednesday when he was asked to resign, setting the tone
for his appearance before a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like you to announce today that you'll resign,'' said Rep.
Joe Barton, R-Texas. ``This is a great venue to be a true statesman
of sport and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else sought Samaranch's resignation, but he was
questioned relentlessly for more than two hours on the major
changes enacted last weekend by the IOC, as well as on the
organization's failure to investigate its members for past abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive handling of Samaranch, 79, by the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demonstrated the
fervor with which Congress has attached itself to Olympic reform.
Before Wednesday, a Senate committee had already held two hearings
and the House subcommittee one without Samaranch, who refused to
appear until the changes had been approved by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the reforms have been adopted, some people think
Congress should step aside,'' Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said.
``I disagree. Congress should make sure the reforms are
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   If the changes enacted last weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland,
are ineffective, Waxman said, sanctions should be imposed on the
IOC, including stripping the committee of its tax-exempt status in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his time before the subcommittee, Samaranch was chastised for
answers that were too long and reminded that he was testifying
under oath. He was mocked for lacking the zeal to attack corruption
until last year's revelation of a scandal involving illicit cash
and gifts provided to IOC members by Salt Lake City's organizing
committee for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., tried to determine
the investigative muscle of a new ethics commission created by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the commission compel members to testify about
wrongdoing?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics commission is totally independent,'' Samaranch
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``So you don't know, as president of the IOC, if the
ethics commission can compel testimony?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``You do know?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``And will they be able to compel testimony?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``They are fully independent and will act as they
find wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``Is that a yes or a no?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``As I say, the ethics commission is independent.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGette: ``If you don't know, I'll ask someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch: ``I do know, and the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ethics commission has not yet adopted a set of
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the ethics commission is a work in progress,''
DeGette said, ``the IOC cannot be considered reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch enjoyed few peaceful moments, he never appeared
ruffled. Speaking through an interpreter, Samaranch, who is
Spanish, praised the ``fundamental package of reform'' that he said
created a ``renovated IOC,'' with flexible term limits, open
meetings and a ban on trips by members to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his right to remain exempt from rules against gifts
to IOC members, because he said he did not influence the selection
of host cities. ``I didn't think it was necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, what if this committee thought it was necessary?'' Barton
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad to listen,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch labeled as a lie a report that his suite at the Palace
Hotel in Lausanne costs the IOC $500,000 a year. He said his suite
is far from luxurious, costing $250 a day when he is in town to
work at IOC headquarters and $70 a day to hold his reservation when
he is traveling.
</P>
<P>
   And he said there was nothing wrong with a $12,000 trip to
Atlanta that his wife took with a friend in 1990; the trip was paid
for by the city's 1996 Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when questioned about whether the Atlanta committee should
have paid for a trip that lacked a discernible Olympic business
goal, Samaranch said: ``You are probably right. This is a problem
with the organizing committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman spent little time on the Olympic scandals that made
headlines late last year and earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he criticized Samaranch for failing to allow bidding
for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney and
the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. NBC paid $1.2 billion for
the rights, and then donated $1 million to the Olympic Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there were no requests for bids,'' Samaranch said. ``We
felt NBC deserved our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports and a member of the IOC
reform commission, said after leaving the hearing that the
network's bid for both Olympic games had been pre-emptive. He also
said that the donation had not been solicited by Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to acknowledge our happiness with being such an
important part of the Olympic movement,'' Ebersol said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sooner or later, just about everybody marches in
front of a Congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of Casey Stengel's jabberwocky performance (``I'm a
baseball man ...'') before Sen. Estes Kefauver nearly half a
century ago still delights baseball fans. Strip miners explain why
it's good for the ecology to blast the coal out of Appalachian
hillsides. Tobacco officials explain why it's good for the lungs to
suck up all that smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in the last scheduled committee hearing of this
century, the very fluent Juan Antonio Samaranch used interpreters
to avoid any misunderstanding between Castilian Spanish and
congressional English.
</P>
<P>
   But the cultural gap between American politics and Olympic
ethics goes much deeper than mere language. Samaranch is trying to
reassure American politicians that the Olympic movement is safe to
continue receiving American corporate dollars because it remains in
his hands, even after a worldwide scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we cleaned the house,'' Samaranch told members of the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. He was
referring to 50 reforms, including an ethics committee that reports
to _ you guessed it _ Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire structure seems based upon personality rather than
rules,'' observed Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., who wanted to know
what would happen when the president was not somebody as honorable
and esteemed as his excellency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The graveyards are full of indispensable people,'' replied the
79-year-old Samaranch, who is not known for his morbid side.
</P>
<P>
   He did suggest that the International Olympic Committee, having
divested itself of 10 bad apples and taken on a similar number of
actual athletes _ if you can imagine that _ was now in a position
to resist temptations.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives, with their own peculiar American campaign
fund raising, do not have the highly personal mandate that his
excellency apparently enjoys. These representatives have voted on
the impeachment of an American president, and a few of them gave
the impression they would not have minded taking part in the
impeachment of the IOC president, if they could figure out how.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, after a grueling year, Samaranch felt compelled to
face American representatives because he knows where his rich and
fluffy croissants are baked. He actually gave a good performance,
standing up to seven members of the subcommittee who made it back
from the hinterlands in murky flying weather while Congress was in
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch comes from across a gap far wider than the Alps and
the Atlantic Ocean. He more or less shrugged off Yank-style
questions about privilege and excess. The lawmakers seemed to find
the new language ambiguous. Are all trips to bid cities banned, or
are they merely ``not necessary?'' His excellency made the rather
Mel Brooksian regal proclamation, ``No trips, no gifts,'' as if
that settled that.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also dismissed talk of his living in a $500,000-a-year
suite in Lausanne, Switzerland, insisting it costs only $250 a day
when he is in town and $70 when he is not. (Those continental
breakfasts must be expensive.)
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers made a big deal about a trip by his wife to the
bid city of Atlanta in 1990, Samaranch was far too polite to
suggest that Maria Teresa Samaranch, who hails from Barcelona and
Lausanne, should have been paid overtime for sampling life in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   His excellency smiled politely while Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas,
disparaged the new ethics committee, ``or what we in Texas would
call a posse.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton said, ``If the sheriff sends the posse in the wrong
direction, you can call out the bloodhounds and the sharpshooters,
but you'll never find anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Samaranch heard himself praised by the former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger and the former Sen. Howard Baker, who
recently took part in the reform process. When the trinity of
elders were dismissed, almost no spectators and only two
representatives remained to hear seven athletes give emotional
personal testimony. Bob Ctvrtlik, an Olympic volleyball player, who
was elected a delegate last week, praised the IOC for the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While the athletes were speaking, Samaranch paused in the lobby
of the Rayburn Building and said he was treated very well, and he
predicted, ``The Games are not touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The very fluent Juan Antonio Samaranch did not need an
interpreter to hear American money still jingling merrily in the
Olympic pipeline.

person with a substantial risk of imminent death or physical
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting off a pistol in a neighborhood more than qualifies. &QL; 
MESSAGE TO THE POLICE &QL; 
But, enforcing an existing law doesn't quite ease the pain. Not
when we've lost a little girl. That takes a new law. Shan non's
Law. One of those trying to get it approved in the state House is
state Sen. Chris Cummiskey.
</P>
<P>
   He told me Wednesday, ``Some neigh borhoods where random gunfire
is a reg ular occurence indicated that even with `reckless
endangerment' out there on the landscape, law enforcement has not
been coming out and pressing for some conclu sion to this in those
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a new law would send a message to the police. Maybe
it will. That would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sending a message to ordinary gun owners is
absolutely vital. A good advertising campaign would do that, though
it won't stop all the gunfire. If caught, the person who killed
Shannon Smith would do time for manslaughter. That won't stop all
the gunfire, either.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Shannon's Law say they, too, would like to see
more public service announcements about the dangers of fir ing
weapons into the air, but they still want their new law.
</P>
<P>
   I can't fault them. The loss of any little girl is unacceptable.
It's more than any of us can bear. But we won't keep it from
happening again by taking our own shot in the dark. &QL;

FAMILY PUTS HUMAN FACE ON AIDS IN AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Mozambicans opened their newspapers one
Saturday morning here recently and gasped. There, amid the paid
death notices, was the photograph of a businessman from this
country's most prominent family.
</P>
<P>
   Under his name, a death notice read simply: ``Victim of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   That notice, which appeared in the newspaper Noticias in late
November, and others for the businessman marked the first time a
prominent family in this country had publicly acknowledged being
touched by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The family that had finally shattered the silence and shame
surrounding the disease was none other than that of Samora Machel,
who led Mozambique to independence from Portugal in 1975 and became
its first president. It was his brother, Boaventura Moises Machel,
who died of complications from AIDS on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before, the prime minister here had begged his nation
to stop hiding from the disease that is ravaging the continent and
the country. The death notices promptly touched off both cheers of
support and howls of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 percent of the population here is believed to be
infected with the virus that causes AIDS. But here, as in many
African countries, people often conceal the disease, fearing
discrimination, rejection from family and friends, even attacks
from outraged neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find an image, a Mozambican face, for AIDS,'' the
prime minister, Pascoal Mocumbi, told reporters in July.
</P>
<P>
   But probably no one could have imagined that the Machel family
would take up the suggestion in such a dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maria Tallarico, the U.N. AIDS representative in Mozambique,
was in her office that morning when she saw the solemn photographs
of Boaventura Machel, dressed in suit and tie, in the newspaper.
She was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Machel's wife, children and sister-in-law, Graca Machel, now
married to Nelson Mandela, paid for the death notices, which
appeared one on top of the other, and prominently noted the cause
of death and listed the names of grieving relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought many, many newspapers that day,'' Tallarico said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really important,'' she continued. ``Until now, we've
never seen anything like this. Now people are talking about it,
talking about the disease. We are close to people who are living
with the disease and some of them are now saying, `Maybe I also
have to speak up about myself, my status.'''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts say that promoting greater openness about AIDS is
critical. Since few speak openly of the disease, many people
dismiss it as something that affects only foreigners or white
people or outsiders, and many refuse to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who go public often pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   Many die alone, abandoned by their families. Last year, a woman
in South Africa who was an advocate for people with AIDS was beaten
to death by her neighbors after she disclosed she was infected with
HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One influential daily newsletter, MediaFax, said several
prominent Mozambicans, including some friends and relatives of
Boaventura Machel, were appalled by the family's decision to
publicize the cause of death. ``In life, as in death, one must
respect the privacy of the citizen,'' the newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS experts see some encouraging signs of change. This
year, the Sowetan, the largest daily newspaper in South Africa,
began publishing a weekly column by a young man, Lucky Mazibuko,
who is infected.
</P>
<P>
   And when Boaventura Machel's death notices appeared here, most
news accounts commended the family's bravery. Samora Machel died in
a mysterious airplane crash in South Africa in 1986, but he is
still revered here along with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Filipe Matusse, who wrote a letter to Noticias, praised the
family's ``titanic courage'' and its much needed warning to
society.
</P>
<P>
   Tallarico said she believed the death notices would help promote
a more tolerant and accepting attitude toward people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not see change immediately, maybe not tomorrow, but it
will come,'' she said. ``The reaction here is encouraging.''

WALL ST. SNARLS AT SEC PROPOSAL ON DISCLOSURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It sounds like something that no one would support:
the selective disclosure of important information by companies.
Such a practice enables those favored with early knowledge to make
money at the expense of traders not so favored.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday
offered a mild proposal on how to deal with the problem, it became
clear that selective disclosure has a constituency, and opposition
immediately appeared on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC proposed a new Regulation FD (for fair disclosure) that
would mandate that companies not divulge material information _
that is, important information that can move the stock price _
except through public disclosure. The regulation added that if such
information was inadvertently disclosed, it should quickly be
released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-too-common practice of selectively disseminating
material information is a disservice to investors and undermines
the fundamental principle of fairness,'' said Arthur Levitt, the
chairman of the SEC ``This practice leads to potential conflicts of
interest for analysts and undermines investor confidence in our
markets. In a time when instantaneous and free- flowing information
is the norm, these sort of whispers are an insult to the principles
of free and open disclosure upon which the success of our capital
markets is based.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Streeters immediately warned that trying to shut off
the selective release of information could shut off any release of
information. ``The more information that comes out, and the faster
it comes out, the better it is for investors,'' said Stuart J.
Kaswell, the general counsel of the Securities Industry
Association, a trade group of investment banking firms.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that analysts should be seen as the proxies for
investors, whose job is to ``ferret out information'' and get it to
investors. ``The risk,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``is
that you will curtail information'' because officials will be
afraid to talk to analysts, for fear that if they said anything
they would then have to issue a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Such dire forecasts probably won't be borne out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophisticated companies know they have to talk to analysts and
institutional investors,'' said Michael Littenberg, a securities
lawyer and partner in Schulte Roth &AMP; Zabel. ``Pretty much all the
SEC is saying is don't selectively disclose material information,''
he said. ``That is something that securities lawyers always advise
their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Levitt has called selective disclosure a ``stain
upon our market,'' but some opponents of the regulation say they
see no evidence that there is a large problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would question the assumption that there is a widespread
practice that gives rise to this stain,'' said Edward H. Fleishman,
a securities lawyer and former member of the SEC He said he was
sure it happened sometimes, and that the SEC was frustrated that it
could not take any action under current rules. ``But that it is
widespread, that I doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule, which includes questions about alternatives
that the SEC might pursue, offers three ways for companies to
disclose information to the public, and says any of them could be
used to rectify an inadvertent disclosure. Those methods are
through a filing with the SEC, by issuing a news release, or by
holding a conference call to which anyone, analyst or not, can
listen. Levitt said that the call could be broadcast on the
Internet, and said he disagreed with those who thought it would
chill the information flow.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it appears that the criticism of the rule _ which
the SEC has heard in recent weeks as it considered what to do _ has
already had an effect. The SEC's proposal endorsed the dubious idea
that disclosing something only in a conference call constitutes
adequate public disclosure if access to the conference call was not
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, most investors will not get in on any such
conference call. Even if they learn about it in advance, they might
not have time to call in. Perhaps they will become interested in
what was said only after the stock starts to move, following the
distribution of the news. It would therefore make sense for the SEC
to require that a way be found to make the information available
for some period of time to investors who missed the call. That is
no problem if it is released in a statement to the press or an SEC
filing, but it could be one for conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also raises the issue of just what role analysts
actually play. To Kaswell, the industry association lawyer,
analysts are independent representatives of investors, doing their
best to learn what is going on at a company. But that independence
is sometimes illusory, all the more so now that analysts often are
compensated in part on their success in getting the companies they
follow to sign up as investment banking clients. There is a
suspicion that selective disclosures often go to the analysts who
are deemed most friendly to a company's management, putting more
pressure on other analysts not to be hostile.
</P>
<P>
   If the opponents succeed in blocking this rule, then the
situation may be worse than it was before Levitt brought up the
subject. Such a defeat by the commission would seem to ratify the
practice of selective disclosure. Then those who argue that
selective disclosure is a rare thing might find that it was no
longer so unusual.

VENEZUELANS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVE NEW CONSTITUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Venezuelans on Wednesday gave President
Hugo Chavez a mandate and a blueprint to carry out sweeping
political reforms by approving a new constitution by a huge margin.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide referendum, 71 percent voted in favor of the
charter, which was drafted by a special assembly dominated by
Chavez supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the president's political vision, the
constitution could concentrate more power in Chavez's hands and
potentially allow him to remain in office for 12 more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the birth certificate of the new Venezuela,'' Chavez
said in a televised address as he held up a copy of the document.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution, the 26th in Venezuela's 189-year history,
contains 350 articles outlining a litany of changes both profound
and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-controlled Congress and governors will be
replaced, and new presidential elections may be held early next
year. The work week will be shortened, and the name of the nation
will be modified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give Chavez and his team the tools to move the
country forward,'' said Marycarmen Moya, 18, after voting in
downtown Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was viewed as a kind of plebiscite on Chavez's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The former army paratrooper, who staged a failed 1992 coup
against the government and served two years in prison, was elected
president one year ago on a platform to carry out a ``peaceful
revolution'' and cast out what he called the corrupt political
oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Just 45 percent of Venezuela's 10.9 million eligible voters cast
ballots Wednesday. Citing the low turnout, some critics questioned
the legitimacy of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, bad weather was partly to blame. Torrential rains and
mudslides killed at least 37 people and left thousands of
Venezuelans homeless. Government officials extended voting by two
hours and declared a state of emergency in eight states and in the
capital city of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Though lamenting the loss of life, Chavez portrayed Wednesday's
electoral result as a huge victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day in which we will define the next 200
years of Venezuela,'' he said. ``We are going to reconstruct the
fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite vast oil wealth, Venezuela is mired in poverty and is
often ranked as one of the world's most corrupt nations. Chavez,
45, has pledged to usher in a new era of responsive government.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in camouflage fatigues, Chavez barnstormed across the
country in the weeks leading up to the vote and compared the
campaign to a war. In keeping with his penchant for outrageous
rhetoric, Chavez called his opponents ``degenerates'' and at one
point compared them to ``squealing pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   The new charter, which was written by a 131-member
Constitutional Assembly in 100 days, will affect nearly all aspects
of government.
</P>
<P>
   It extends the president's term to six years from five years and
allows immediate re-election once. Chavez, who has already served
10 months in office, has indicated that he will run for election
early next year in an effort to win a new, six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The charter abolishes the Senate and requires an election for a
new, unicameral National Assembly within 90 days. Elections for
governorships and local offices must also be held.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, analysts say, could strengthen Chavez's hand. Polls
put the president's popularity at about 70 percent. That could help
pro-Chavez candidates win control of the newly configured
legislature as well as a handful of governorships.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial articles changes the name of the
country from the Republic of Venezuela to the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela. The change honors native son Simon Bolivar, the
19th-century general who liberated much of South America from
Spanish domination and is one of Chavez's heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Urbano voted ``yes'' on the referendum but objects to
the name change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the republic of just one man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions guarantee free health care and education and
shorten the work week from 48 hours to 44 hours. The constitution
extends the right to vote to members of the military; broadens
rights for indigenous groups; and reorganizes the judicial system.
It requires the news media to give ``truthful'' reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most democratic and advanced constitution in the
world,'' said Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   But critics call it a flawed document and say it represents an
attempt by Chavez to assume authoritarian rule. Some news
organizations fear the constitution could usher in press
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Others complain that Chavez ignored pressing problems while
campaigning for the constitution. The country is in its worst
economic slump in decades, and many fear that provisions in the new
charter could hurt business. Several articles, for example, open
the door for increased state intervention in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is in absolute paralysis,'' said Alberto
Franceschi, one of only six opposition members of the
Constitutional Assembly. ``No one will invest even one dollar here,
because you would have to be crazy to invest in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting ``no'' Wednesday, Laura Rojas, 63, said the
government has ignored social problems while spending millions of
dollars on elections. Including Wednesday's referendum, Venezuela
has held five nationwide votes over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   For the political opposition, which campaigned against the
constitution and will have to prepare for yet another round of
national elections, Wednesday's results indicate that it has failed
to gain much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The ``no'' vote totaled just 29 percent of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Fermin, an opposition member of the Constitutional
Assembly, said, ``This is a wake-up call to get organized.''

LASER EXPERT RESIGNS AT LAB IN WAKE OF CREDENTIALS REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   E. Michael Campbell, who led an effort to build the world's most
powerful laser until it was recently disclosed that he did not have
a Ph.D., will be resigning from Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, according to a statement issued Wednesday by the
laboratory's director.
</P>
<P>
   Until early September, when Campbell took a personal leave, he
was the laboratory's associate director for laser programs,
including the $1.2 billion National Ignition Facility, which is
under construction but faces cost overruns and technical
difficulties. Campbell had falsely allowed the laboratory to
believe that he had a Ph.D. from Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a Livermore employee for 23 years, said Susan
Houghton, a spokeswoman for the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell ``has been a very dynamic and creative leader in
developing and leading programs in the laboratory,'' Dr. C. Bruce
Tarter, the laboratory's director, said in a statement. ``I want to
personally thank him for his dedication and loyalty to the
laboratory and its people, and wish him well in his new
endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Ignition Facility is the centerpiece of the
nation's effort to ensure the safety and reliability of its aging
nuclear stockpile in the absence of actually testing the weapons.
Eliminating nuclear tests is mandated by the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which the Senate rejected in October but which the Clinton
administration still supports.
</P>
<P>
   The laser installation is intended to create conditions similar
to those in nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study their
properties without the tests. In early September, Bill Richardson,
the secretary of Energy, said that he was ``deeply disturbed to
learn of projected cost overruns and scheduling delays'' associated
with the project, but that the overall cremained sound.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Campbell could raise further questions about
the project, which has been fiercely opposed by some environmental
and anti-nuclear groups. But Ms. Houghton said his resignation was
``a very personal situation'' that had nothing to do with the
project.

MTV NETWORKS INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating MTV Networks for
possible antitrust violations, executives of MTV and its parent
company, Viacom, confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   MTV executives said that they had been asked to provide
information to the department mainly on issues related to the
acquisition by the company early this year of the cable channel the
Box, which also programs music videos, one of the staple offerings
of both MTV and of its sister channel VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Sumner M. Redstone, the Viacom
chairman, dismissed the inquiry as ``much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view,'' he said, ``there is no antitrust issue and
there is no anticompetitive conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In an official statement, Carole Robinson, the executive vice
president for MTV Newtorks, said, ``We are cooperating fully with
the Department of Justice's review of the Box transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   How much beyond that transaction the investigation may go is
unclear. The Wall Street Journal, which published an article on the
investigation Wednesday, reported that the Justice Department was
examining the plans by the networks to offer videos in digital
format, as well as the requirements for exclusive rights to videos.
</P>
<P>
   One senior MTV executive at first dismissed the notion that the
Justice Department had any interest in MTV's Internet interests or
video rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Robinson later clarified that point, saying, ``There
have been incidental questions about the Internet, but it is by no
means the focus of the review by the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   About the issues surrounding exclusive rights, Ms. Robinson
said, ``We took exclusive rights to only 4 of the more than 1,000
videos used this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Redstone said that MTV pays for rights to use music videos,
which are offered free to other program services.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department declined to address the issue of what
specific practices were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rose, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said, ``We are
looking at the possibility of potentially anticompetitive practices
involving music video networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings of MTV Networks have never been better and the
networks are the most profitable channels in cable television, with
a near-monopoly on introducing new music to a wide television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Music companies and film studios have expressed resentment over
the way MTV exercises its power to reach young consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior MTV executives suggested that record companies
were trying to advance the investigation. ``The record companies
have missed the boat again and again in establishing a direct link
to their customers, and they don't like it,'' one senior MTV
executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Some record companies do not like the move by MTV in recent
years to draw back from reliance solely on videos, and toward
scheduled programs like ``The Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Schwartz, the chairman of RuffNation Records, a hip-hop
label, said: ``MTV wants to be like regular TV networks and use
block progamming. So they rely more on `Real World' and their
stupid game shows. I don't like that programming.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he believed MTV's acquisition of the Box would
provide an outlet for new artists to get their work seen. ``I think
that's a good thing,'' Schwartz said.

PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA PICTURES PROMOTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Sony Pictures Entertainment, whose Columbia Pictures
division has had a string of high-profile flops and no sizable hit
since ``Big Daddy'' in early summer, has promoted Columbia's
president, Amy Pascal, to chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Sony Pictures, John Calley _ Ms. Pascal's boss _
said that the title change, which had been expected and was made
official Wednesday, was done mainly to clarify Ms. Pascal's
position as the key person at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that given the performance of recent Columbia
movies, some in the industry might question the move. But he said
that was only because many people in the business focused on the
success of the initial run of films in the United States, which is
declining in importance in the global film industry.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Pascal also said they had high expectations for the
films planned over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message is, she's done a remarkable job and this
is in recognition of and clarification of the way this place
works,'' Calley said. ``We want it to be made clear that we have
great enthusiasm for her here, and we think she has a big future
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia had a huge hit earlier this summer with ``Big Daddy,''
a comedy starring Adam Sandler, and a modest hit at the end of the
summer with ``Blue Streak,'' a comedy starring Martin Lawrence, but
otherwise the news has been bad. Some of the failures have been
high profile, including ``Random Hearts,'' starring Harrison Ford;
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams; and ``The Messenger:
The Story of Joan of Arc,'' directed by Luc Besson.
</P>
<P>
   Sony reported that for the quarter ended Sept. 30, revenue at
its movie division fell 19 percent compared with results a year
earlier. Sony had a 22 percent dip in the quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop in revenue, the studio remains profitable,
executives said, with net income up 3 percent in the most recent
quarter, driven by the substantial success of ``Big Daddy'' and
money coming in from home video, pay television and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Calley said the move was not intended to foreshadow who might
replace him when his contract expires in two years or to indicate
that rumors that he might retire are true. Ms. Pascal echoed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is staying,'' she said. ``This doesn't mean that John is
leaving. The last thing I would want is for this to make it seem
like that is what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Calley said he did not know who would run the company after he
left, whether it might be Ms. Pascal; Mel Harris, the co-president
and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment; a
combination of them, or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Mel is running it and I hope Amy is the picture person,
but I don't know,'' Calley said. The decision will be up to his
bosses _ Howard Stringer, who runs Sony's American operations out
of New York, and the top executives of Sony in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a business in which executives often have titles that do
not correspond to their actual power or lines of authority, Sony's
structure is widely seen as particularly askew.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Pascal has been in charge of Columbia for more than
two years and has reported directly to Calley, her title of
president made her seem junior to the two vice chairmen of the
Columbia-Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, Lucy Fisher and Gareth
Wigan, who had no chairman to report to.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion resulted when Sony folded its Tri-Star
operation into Columbia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's move was intended partly to clarify the issue and
make it clear that Ms. Pascal runs the studio's movie operations.
It came less than a week after Ms. Fisher announced that she was
leaving to join her husband, Douglas Wick, and produce motion
pictures through Wick's Red Wagon Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Calley said he took responsibility for the recent box-office
failures _ although he pointed out that despite the disappointments
the studio was still turning a profit for the year, buoyed by ``Big
Daddy'' and strong video sales for ``Mask of Zorro'' and other
films.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Pascal was in control of the company's movie
operations, Calley held the ultimate vote on whether any individual
picture would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was responsible for green-lighting, so if anybody has to
take the blame it has to be me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he said, are the high expectations that the
studio has for its Christmas releases _ especially an adaptation of
E.B. White's ``Stuart Little,'' starring a computer-generated
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel immensely optimistic about the next cluster and going
on to the next two years,'' Calley said. ``We expect to do more
Stuart Little pictures. We think this is a character that will
appear on television and that will have a long life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pascal ran down some of the movies in Columbia's pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's big summer pictures are Roland Emmerich's
Revolutionary War epic, ``The Patriot,'' starring Mel Gibson; Paul
Verhoeven's invisible-man thriller, ``The Hollow Man,'' starring
Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue; and Martin Campbell's ``The
Vertical Limit,'' a mountain-rescue adventure starring Chris
O'Donnell. Movies for the fall are Billy Bob Thornton's adaptation
of Cormac McCarthy's ``All the Pretty Horses,'' starring Matt
Damon, and a big-screen version of ``Charlie's Angels'' starring
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In the works beyond that, Ms. Pascal said, are a big-budget
``Spiderman'' that the studio hopes will spawn a series; a
biography of Muhammad Ali, starring Will Smith; sequels to
``Jumanji'' and ``Men in Black;'' and Steven Spielberg's adaptation
of the best-selling ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' by Arthur Golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that even though this wasn't our best year, we
still made money,'' Ms. Pascal said. ``And next year looks great.
This is a company that thinks of the future. It isn't a company
that makes its strategic decisions every six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Calley agreed and said that part of the reason might be the
outlook of Sony's corporate bosses in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in their style that we don't have some maniac
constantly coming over asking why we haven't fired everybody
because a picture failed or a series was canceled,'' he said.

U.S. AGREES TO PAY CHINA $28 MILLION FOR BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The U.S. government has agreed to pay China $28
million in compensation for damage to the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, which was bombed by NATO war planes last May, United
States officials said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   China, in turn, has agreed to pay the United States $2.87
million for damage to the American Embassy and other diplomatic
buildings in China during the week of anti-American demonstrations
that followed the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The two agreements promise to help bring to a close what has
been a particularly tumultuous period in United States-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2:30 a.m., the United States and China completed
negotiations over the tragic mistaken bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade,'' said David Andrews, the lead American
negotiator, said here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the settlement will be conducive to the improvement
in U.S.-China relations,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After five rounds of difficult negotiations, the compensation
agreements were announced on the day that Joseph Prueher, the new
American ambassador to Beijing, was to present his credentials to
the Chinese government. American officials made clear that they
hoped that resolution of the compensation issue would help pave the
way for a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese were less solicitous in their nearly
simultaneous announcement of the agreement, taking the opportunity
to remind the Chinese populace, once again, of what it has
portrayed as a criminal action by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao called
the bombing ``a gross violation of the universally recognized
international law,'' according to the official New China News
Agency, which called the bombing ``a barbarous act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese announcement did not mention that the Chinese had
agreed to pay the United States for damages to American diplomatic
missions in China.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the state-controlled media characterized the
demonstrations as angry but peaceful and never published photos of
the United States Embassy in Beijing, which was left windowless and
paint-splattered after protesters spent three days hurling rocks,
ink bottles and an occasional fire bomb over its gates.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how far the $28 million will go to patch
up relations and calm the remaining Chinese popular anger over the
bombing, in which 3 Chinese were killed and 27 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese and American officials came together last month
to triumphantly announce a new bilateral trade agreement to ease
China's entry to the World Trade Organization, other joint
initiatives have been on hold since the bombing, including military
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has apologized for what it has called a tragic
and unfortunate accident, but neither the Chinese government or its
people have really accepted the American explanation for the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and American officials said the embassy became a
target after a string of errors involving out-of-date maps and an
incomplete computer data bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese announcement of the agreement once again called on
the United States government to ``conduct a comprehensive and
thorough investigation into the bombing, severely punish the
perpetrators and give a satisfactory account of the incident to the
Chinese government and people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear when the money promised under Thursday's
agreements will be paid. The $28 million promised by the United
States requires congressional approval and will be part of the
fiscal year 2001 budget request, embassy officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the United States agreed to pay $4.5 million to the
victims of the bombing and their families.

   I. Antiquity Now &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President!'' ``Mr. President!'' It has come to this. At
Madison Square Garden, people are rising from their seats and
calling out ``Mr. President!'' to Donald J. Trump, the real estate
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the nation of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and
Eleanor Roosevelt reached the point at which magazine editors, talk
show hosts and screaming crowds have lunged at the entertaining
possibility that Donald Trump might run for the highest office in
the land.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to the Garden hoping something like this will happen.
A Ricky Martin concert is the pretext for being here. But the real
draw on this October night is the chance to witness firsthand the
most recent example of the merger of politics and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates have been nominated in the Garden's
several incarnations. Millions have been entertained by musicians,
athletes and clowns. Tonight, the hall's political and theatrical
functions have collapsed into each other in a blaze of limelight.
Off stage as well as on, it's ``viva la vida loca'' time.
</P>
<P>
   Trump and his companion, Melania Knauss, are sitting some
distance away on the Garden floor. I'm chatting with my friend when
we notice a rise in the volume of preconcert racket, a murmur of
voices: ``Who is it?'' From where we're sitting, we can't see the
cause of the commotion at first, but then Trump and Ms. Knauss are
standing up, waving to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Martin fans start packing into the aisles. Bodyguards
materialize. Trump and Ms. Knauss head up the aisle, working the
crowd along the way. We've paid for our own seats, but Trump can't
not be a host, and here he is, holding a fistful of Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Totally Nuts ice cream bars as he stirs up our side of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Trump builds buildings. I write about them. So far, he hasn't
given me an occasion to write glowingly about his architecture
projects. It would be great if this changed. I'm not hopeful. But I
love the color, contentiousness and comedy Trump brings to the
contemporary urban scene. Adrian Stokes, the British art critic,
once wrote, ``Architecture is limited to forms without events.''
</P>
<P>
   I disagree. As a social, public and urban art form, architecture
can't be separated from the events that buildings contain, shape
and provoke.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's persona is one of these events. So is architecture
criticism, whether in written appraisals or in the comments of
sidewalk superintendents. Even when criticism is negative, it is
part of the fabric that holds a great city together. I don't hate
Trump's buildings, but even if that were the case, I would still
see them as a challenge to examine my preferences in relation to
his.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, I've been playing Ascyltos to his
Trimalchio, two characters in Petronius's ``Satyricon,'' the most
celebrated fictional depiction of life in Nero's Rome. According to
Tacitus, Petronius was called elegantiae arbiter because the
emperor consulted him on all matters of taste.
</P>
<P>
   In my version of the novel, set in present day New York, Trump
is the fabulously rich promoter who basks in public attention. I'm
the student of Epicureanism trying to make some sense of
contemporary taste. He's an important figure in my continuing
education. While his buildings may not fulfill the ancient
Epicurean ideal of moderation in all things, they clearly hold
great appeal for those who have made his real estate enterprise a
huge success.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ascyltos was not the ideal Epicurean but rather a
satirical version of one. The poor scholar worried more about his
next meal than about the refinements of beauty. His picaresque
odyssey took him through a cross section of Roman ``taste
cultures'' (to borrow a term from the sociologist Herbert Gans). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Federico Fellini captured some of these in his 1969 movie
version of the novel. The classical villa of the dignified
patrician and his wife. The ancient museum festooned with fragments
of Greek and Egyptian art. The smoky lair of the priestess. The
garish night world of theaters and bordellos.
</P>
<P>
   But the diversity of contemporary New York makes Nero's Rome
seem like a Shaker village by comparison. Here, a daily drama
emerges from the constant border-crossing from one environment to
the next. French bistro. Bauhaus. Roman bathhouse. Petit Trianon.
Latin marqueta. Gothic cathedral. Japanese teahouse. Hospital
hygienic. The eclectic mix of the city's public and private spaces
is more stimulating than any one of its components. That
stimulation is why we live in New york.
</P>
<P>
   But some, confused by this stunning mosaic of esthetic disarray,
have singled out Trump as a supreme example of Bad Taste, whatever
that might be. The shiny marble, bronze and brass, the gilded
building crowns, the gaudy Atlantic City casinos, the spangled
showgirls: it all adds up in their eyes to vulgar excess, an
unsophisticate's delight in meretricious baubles. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He has become a point of orientation in an environment where
cultural bearings are easily lost. Faced with the claims of
competing taste cultures, it is scarcely possible to talk about
Good Taste and keep a straight face. The subject is pure ``Saturday
Night Live.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bad Taste is more useful. In a pluralistic world, lightning
rods are more reliable than compasses. And the wrinkled nose is a
universal symbol of the desire to feel superior to whatever seems
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand years after Petronius wrote his novel, Trimalchio
remains its most familiar character, his feast its central event,
the most colorful contemporary description we have of the excesses
of the ancient classical world. And what will be remembered of New
York, I wonder, two millenniums from now? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Today, we are in the waning hours of the century New York has
ruled. Two thousand years hence, there may be nothing here but
rubble disturbing the surface of a swamp. A tropical breeze blows
around reeds, insects, reptiles, heating up twisted clumps of
metal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A forbidden zone, this place has long beckoned adolescents to
explore its fetid shallows. One day, a group of them stumbles upon
a submerged, rusted object that when polished up is identified by
experts in interstellar life as the letter T in a language once
used on an abandoned planet. Gradually, secrets of yet another lost
civilization are revealed. There are rumors of an ancient city of
gold. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, I wrote a column about Trump International Tower and
Hotel, the 52-story residential high-rise then in construction on
Columbus Circle. The column wasn't a rave, and Trump was irate
about it, because the building was not yet complete. There was a
charade over firing his architect, Philip Johnson, who called to
tell me about it. I suggested that the three of us meet to talk and
proposed a location: in front of Andy Warhol's Gold Marilyn
painting at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   I'd mentioned the painting in my article. There's an obvious
parallel between it and Mr. Trump himself. The man has attained the
status of a popular icon, set against the gold of celebrity.
Johnson, not a stranger to celebrity culture, once owned the
painting, which he later gave to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   I had a personal reason for choosing this meeting place. Warhol
was the first close friend I made in New York (and also the first
one I lost). In 1965, when I was a freshman at the University of
Pennsylvania, the artist had his first museum retrospective, at
Penn's Institute of Contemporary Art. We met soon after the show's
opening. I started going up to New York on weekends to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   One time, I mentioned my interest in architecture. ``Oh,
architecture is really the only thing left,'' Warhol said in that
breathy voice of his. ``We can help. We know Philip Johnson. We can
get you into Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump can't know the meaning this painting holds for me. I
suspect that he cares nothing about its art-historical value,
either. He doesn't strike me as a museumgoing kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   To my eyes, however, his public persona is itself a cultural
artifact of museum quality. I want to study his condition in this
context. I also hope that the context can help persuade him that my
story was not malicious. I don't share Trump's taste, but I love
his style. I far prefer it to the style of those who buy their
ideas off the peg at Ralph Lauren. And I'm curious to know how he
will deal with that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Wednesday morning before the museum is open. Winter, very
cold. Johnson and I are waiting in the lobby. He's wearing his
famous astrakhan fur hat. Limousine pulls up, very black. Trump
gets out with three associates. Gray and blond. Great color
combination. But a terrible expression on his face: pursed mouth,
no smile, I'm going to get this guy.
</P>
<P>
   We head upstairs and clip through the galleries. When we reach
the room where the Marilyn is hanging, I point it out. ``Philip
gave that. Isn't it great?'' There's a large sculpture in the
middle of the room, a brass floor piece by Donald Judd. Evidently
Trump mistakes it for a coffee table, for he uses it as one,
tossing his overcoat and some binders full of pictures on top of it
as we walk over to the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Trump barely glances at the Marilyn, but this doesn't matter. My
goal is to capture them together in the same frame. He's a work of
art himself, as well as a piece of work, a living self-portrait
with a trademark signature sought by foreign banks, condo dwellers,
autograph hounds, advertisers and publishers. Warhol's dream was to
live off putting his signature on soup cans. Trump has more or less
fulfilled it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm the one who should be baring teeth here. I'm a big Art Deco
lover and Trump once tore down a fine example of it: the old Bonwit
Teller building that stood on the site of Trump Tower. Trump had
agreed to preserve the Deco reliefs from the Bonwit Teller facade,
but one day the pieces tumbled to the sidewalk and smashed to bits.
Have you seen the television ad where Trump, playing himself,
accidentally drops a piece of pottery on the floor? I wonder if the
breakage at Bonwit's was similarly scripted. Oops!
</P>
<P>
   Trump did not apologize for his carelessness. Instead, he
invited a New York Times reporter to inspect an example of his
taste in decorative art. As I recall, the specimen turned out to be
a lion's head bathroom fixture selected by his first wife, Ivana,
for the Grand Hyatt Hotel on 42nd Street, the developer's first
Manhattan project. Wise men have said there's no arguing with
taste. Was a reporter about to rush in?
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 I saw Trump in person for the first time. I'd gone
uptown to see my friend Encolpius, who was marching in the Columbus
Day Parade. I happened to hit Fifth Avenue just as Mayor Koch's car
drove by Trump Tower. The developer was standing in front of the
building, with his 8-year-old son at his side, both of them dressed
in Sunday suits. Koch gave them a big smile and a vigorous wave,
the Trumps waved back, and suddenly Fifth Avenue was Main Street in
a small town on the Fourth of July, with Trump the town's main
shopkeeper standing on the porch of his emporium as the parade
passed by.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that these two men despised each other. And
I'm certain that Trump's appearance was motivated more by hunger
for recognition than by selfless civic spirit. But who thinks that
Main Street is innocent of calculation and intrigue? Who cares that
Jacqueline Kennedy stage-managed her son's salute? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trump wants to show me some prize additions to his own real
estate collection: Mar-a-Lago, the Post estate in Palm Beach; the
Meyers estate in Bedford Hills, N.Y.; 40 Wall Street. These are
presented as evidence that Trump's taste deserves the respect of
any honest critic. To me, these buildings don't quite register as
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   They look to me like signs of money, status, power. These signs
are fascinating in their own right, as are diamonds, furs, yachts
and other tokens of the deluxe life enjoyed in Marbella, St. Bart's
and other playgrounds of the rich. To Trump, quality means luxury
details _ fine marble, imported wood, sparkling fixtures _ and
fast-track construction. To me, it means risk-taking ideas,
original perceptions, spirit of place and time and
self-construction _ the same qualities Trump projects in his public
persona, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   I'd prefer to talk about the new buildings Trump might be
contemplating. But I keep my mouth shut. Since I'm here to educate
myself in a taste culture, I'm pleased to look at these trophies
through Trump's eyes. His comments are easily summarized:
everything is the best. With this zest for self-appraisal, why
should he care what critics think?
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the meeting, he senses that I've come to learn,
not to judge. I'm exercising what Keats called negative capability:
suspending judgment is the best way to strengthen the critical
faculty. But I can sense Trump's disappointment that I'm not more
adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   In a panel discussion a few years earlier, . Trump winked at me
from the far end of the table as he told the audience that he
wanted to build the kind of buildings that would earn good reviews
from The Times. The wink was as telling as the words: maybe Trump
would like a good review. But he also relishes a dust-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare he!'' ``How dare he!'' This is Trump on a later
occasion, shaking his fist at the sky, as he acts out his
impression of the Palm Beach neighbors who oppose Trump's plan to
subdivide Mar-a-Lago into smaller parcels of land. Watching him,
you might think he enjoys taking the part of his opponents as much
as he likes playing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, on this occasion, I won't be one. But at least
Trump has found in me a connoisseur of the combative style. I
believe that conflict is the most valuable cultural product a great
city puts out. This is why I organized this momentary convergence
of Warhol, Johnson and Trump. All three gentlemen have put out more
than their share. The city has fed itself on the friction they have
caused. &QL;

Astronomics force questionable deal
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, Derek Bell and Moises Alou must be
considered damaged goods, and brutally expensive ones to boot.
Richard Hidalgo remains largely unproven, as does Daryle Ward.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the Astros do? Naturally, they ship out their other
outfielder, their most valuable outfielder at present, for a
minor-league shortstop and a minor-league pitcher exactly when
excitement over the team reaches a crescendo because of the new
ballpark coming on line next season.
</P>
<P>
   Is this nuts or what?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, it's how baseball works today. Or, I should say, doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we need a salary control system,'' Drayton McLane
Jr. said Wednesday as he attempted to defend a trade that looks to
the future before his ballclub has given the city a fully
satisfactory present. McLane has said this before, of course, and
he is right.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't make an Astros fan feel any better knowing a .325
batting average, 25 home runs and 108 RBIs just got dispatched to
Boston for a kid, shortstop Adam Everett, who figures to spend 2000
in New Orleans and another kid, pitcher Greg Miller, who will be in
Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Worse news perhaps than Everett's exit might have been general
manager Gerry Hunsicker's sad revelation regarding Mike Hampton,
the tenacious lefty who won 22 games in 1999 and finished second in
the Cy Young voting. Hampton's agent has told Hunsicker there will
be no talk of a contract extension for his client. Hampy wants to
sample the fruits of free agency next offseason.
</P>
<P>
   So do you keep Hampton around and hope for the best, such as
another 20-win season and a possible pennant, then risk losing him
for nothing in return? Or do you trade him for quality
compensation?
</P>
<P>
   You be the general manager. You might find it resembles, for a
middle-market franchise such as Houston's, a trip to the roulette
table with a whole city watching. And everybody in said city
believing you're playing with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, the baseball man, didn't want to send Carl Everett to
Boston for a prospect _ although a top-drawer one _ who will make
the exchange make baseball sense only if he becomes another Jeff
Bagwell. Hunsicker, the baseball man, wanted to punch holes in the
wall rather than let go of his slick center fielder, a guy he was
particularly proud of seeing develop into a star after enduring
troubling times personally.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't trade Bell or Alou, and he had to trade somebody
of consequence if the Astros were to keep their payroll close to a
status-quo $55 million, a hold-the-line figure mandated by the
fellow most obsessed by the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, the nerve of him, is tired of losing money after
dropping, he swears, $120 million over the seven years he has owned
the team. His goal for the Astros' residency in Enron Park is to
transform them into what he defines as a viable business, one
capable of showing a profit _ independent of ancillary revenues _
in addition to being an artistic success.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never recoup his purported losses, however huge, without
dramatic changes in how baseball operates. Be that as it may, he's
determined to dam what he calls a torrent of red ink, and who among
us wouldn't be? Winning shouldn't mandate one to squander the
family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But because we haven't seen the books _ nor will we ever short
of a court order _ who can know for certain what the real
consequences of Drayton's naive investment in a troubled industry
has meant to his overall net worth?
</P>
<P>
   At least sacrificing Everett is survivable if Alou and Hildalgo
return healthy and Bell gets his head screwed on straight. Trade
talk put Bell in a funk last offseason, so he decided to spite the
Astros by reporting out of shape and out of sorts mentally. Unless
he's a complete fool, that won't happen again, because now he's
playing for a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, in turn, figures only to build on his successful first
taste of major-league competition, giving the Astros sufficient
outfield depth _ pending the outcome of the aforementioned ``ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Everett had a career year. Maybe Hunsicker, who has
led a charmed existence as a horse trader, timed another one
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett, already a major-league-caliber fielder, and
Miller, 20, a 6-5, 235-pound hunk of potential, stand to patch the
biggest holes the Randy Johnson trade left in the Astros' farm
system. Presumably any deal involving Hampton would provide similar
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   McLane and Hunsicker spoke of keeping the Astros young, of
preventing peaks and valleys, and of the franchise's progression
toward a championship. It's an intellectually defensible approach
to be sure, but it's still castor oil in the mouths of fans who
have yet to taste the nectar of real success after 38 years of
waiting pretty darn patiently.

<P>
   Nature Is Greater Than Art &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump has to be the center of attention. I have to turn
everything into a story. These are character defects, symptoms of
extreme narcissism, perhaps even borderline personality disorders.
But they make for a nice bond between writer and subject. The bond
has survived visits to a boxing match, two gambling casinos, a
condominium sales office and Palm Beach _ all ordeals as far as I
am concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Ricky Martin concert is another matter. Thanks to Martin,
I've been meditating on the concept of duende, a Spanish word for
which there is no exact English equivalent. Literally duende means
imp or dwarf, but it is perhaps closer to what we call soul. It's
often used to describe dancers or musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago Calatrava, the Spanish architect and engineer, says it
can also refer to the spirit of a place. He says that if you're
walking along one day and suddenly feel like singing, that's the
duende. He mentions the time of the year in Seville when orange
trees blossom and scent the air.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the duendes don't feel welcome in our part of the
world. We're all too repressed. Being imps, however, they like to
make a surprise appearance from time to time and drive us out of
our minds, as Ricky Martin has been doing in our part of the world
for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a project: making people feel glad to be alive. The
songs, the voice, the movement and the elaborate packaging have all
contributed to the success of this project. So have his
extraordinary good looks, as attested by countless magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   For the vast majority of his fans, Martin's dreamboat looks are
a fact, a piece of good news to appreciate and fantasize about.
From a critical perspective, the singer's beauty is more
complicated. Criticism is partly an art of complicating simple
things (it's a luxury item in this sense). And beauty,
historically, has topped the list of things critics like to worry
about. It is the pivotal issue in addressing the question of
Trump's taste.
</P>
<P>
   This is something most people won't want to think about: Trump
is a beauty freak. We all like to tee-hee him about the arm candy,
the models, the showgirls. This is easy and fun. It's harder to
accept that the behavior some call womanizing is not a radical
departure from what we call art. The Greeks understood this. Their
concept of beauty derived from nature. The human body is nature's
perfect creation. The gymnasium is where this perfection is
realized. An art studio, so to speak. The old men go to the gym to
admire the young male form.
</P>
<P>
   As a universal point of reference, the body isn't bad. Everybody
has one. The classical temple takes this a step further, merging
anatomical analogies with landscape. The temple adorns a sacred
site of earth. Columns are stylized trees. Figurative sculpture
articulates the connection between architectural form and human
physique. Caryatids, a fusion of animal, vegetable and mineral,
hold up the roof. The erotic origins of art and architecture are
thereby advertised. Duendes welcome here.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Americans seldom experience union with nature outside
erotic relationships and child-bearing. Parks, zoos, wildlife
sanctuaries, adventure tours, wide-screen movies and other virtual
environments have rendered much of the rest of nature into
picturesque attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are working to close off the sexual option as well.
Sex remains dangerous, not just because of infectious disease.
Beauty is always killing the beast. This is the idea of the sublime
developed by art theorists in the 19th century. Beauty and terror
are inseparable. They come from the same place.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason people like to describe some women as bimbos.
It takes the terror out of beauty to treat it as a joke. Bimbos are
in the eye of the beholder, in other words. Melania Knauss is
indeed beautiful, in the style of Jacqueline Bisset, but with a
less faraway look in her eyes. She and Ricky Martin make a sublime
pair. Trump has organized a trip backstage to see the star before
the concert starts. Barbara Walters can't get in. Bette Midler
can't get in. But Trump gets in, with lots of ``Mr. President!''
``Mr. President!'' along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Encolpius and I tag along and wait outside the dressing room.
Trump calls out, ``Get in here and see this guy! He's better
looking than his pictures!'' Trump does have an eye for male
beauty. Once, striding through the lobby on a tour of 40 Wall
Street, he spies an Adonis working on an elevator cab. Trump points
to him: ``What are you doing fixing elevators? You should be a top
movie star.'' Sounds like a pickup line. But in front of 20 working
hard hats?
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pater, the guru of the 19th-century Aesthetic Movement,
said art critics don't need a fixed definition of beauty. They need
only the power to be moved by it. A repressed Romantic, Pater
evidently couldn't distinguish aesthetic response from an erection.
The Greeks would be with him on that. And they understood that not
all bodies are created equal. The Greeks never took democracy that
far. We're counting on technology to level the playing field in the
beauty competition. And on politics to ensure that looks don't
count. But Pascal was right: had Cleopatra's nose been shorter, the
face of the world would have changed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rich people can afford more nature than the rest of us. Then
they usually muck it up. There's no better example of this than
Palm Beach. The climate is extraordinary, the palm trees, flowers
and sunsets are magnificent, and so are many of the houses. But the
way of life is impossible. The jewelry, clothes and hairdos. The
scary gift shop bibelots. The liquor store that's as prominent as a
city hall.
</P>
<P>
   And the bodies, most of them, are far beyond the reach of any
technology we'll live to see. An anthropologist like Margaret Mead
might make sense of this, but I want to hire a sound truck and go
through the streets exclaiming, ``People, you don't want to live
this way!''
</P>
<P>
   I'm disappointed that Trump wants to spend his weekends here.
He's youthful, not stuffy, and doesn't crave isolation. Shirley
Bassey belongs on his sound track, not Rudy Vallee. An essential
part of his taste was formed watching James Bond movies, and I
regret that he hasn't carried this over into his architecture.
Those fantastic Ken Adam sets. The great Fontainebleau Hotel. The
tan young man in white trunks plunging off the high diving board
into the modern blue yonder. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mar-a-Lago is a Citizen Kane's Museum-by-the-Sea. The place is
an encyclopedia of taste cultures, with more period rooms than the
Met. You could spend two months here and pick up a good education
in the history of decorative art, moving from perpendicular Gothic
to American Federal to a child's bedroom with fairy tale scenes
hand-painted by Disney himself. Our time is scarcely represented,
except by the plutocratic desire for pedigree.

 NEW YORK: for pedigree.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What must appeal to Trump is the estate's theatricality. One of
its architects was Joseph Urban, a Vienna-born talent who achieved
his greatest success as Florenz Ziegfeld's favorite stage designer.
This national landmark is a permanent set, where the cereal heiress
Marjorie Merriwether Post could count her profits from Post
Toasties. She, too, had a thing for gold. The fixtures in her
bathroom are made of it.
</P>
<P>
   This domain of high artifice is a good place to see the peculiar
weave of fact and illusion that holds Trump's world together. A
black Lamborghini Diablo sits near the entrance to the house. The
car is real. Encolpius took it out for a spin. But it's not Trump's
car. He says the car company gives him a new one each year,
provided he parks it out front. Is he saying it's much classier to
be lent a fresh Lamborghini than to own one? Of course. He's also
saying rich men's toys are to be played with. Not owning them is
part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we explore the famous tower suite where Michael Jackson
and Lisa Marie Presley spent their honeymoon. The bedroom is small,
but the ceiling must be 12 feet high. A clerestory festooned with
potted plants runs around the room's octagonal circumference. I
assume the plants are fake, and why not? They're too far away to
make any difference to the eye. Encolpius puts a chair on a table
and goes up to check. They're real. Someone must bring a ladder in
to water them, then worry about drips. Did Michael get splashed?
Did his mascara start to run? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best space at Trump Taj Mahal is one the public doesn't get
to see: the crawl area above the dropped ceiling over the slot
machine rooms. This area is accessible only from the white,
fluorescent-lighted high-security chambers where video monitors
flicker and money is counted and packed for transport by trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The dropped ceiling is made of see-through mirror panels framed
by ornate Moghul filigree. Gamblers know they're being watched.
Little effort has been made to conceal the clusters of (real)
surveillance cameras overhead. These are so effective that the
casino's security staff seldom ventures into the crawl space, but
it is designed for use.
</P>
<P>
   The area is tall enough that you don't have to crawl. Catwalks
lead off in all directions. It's like a computer space, a virtual
environment sandwiched between two planes. Through the lower plane,
you glimpse the gambling floor, though the flashing lights and
electronic burblings of the one-armed bandits seem distant. One
wants Pierce Brosnan to materialize on the catwalk and struggle
with an archfiend, who plunges through the mirrored ceiling as lady
snipers in catsuits open fire with corks popped from chilled
bottles of foaming pink Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The high-roller suites, decorated in Egyptian, Roman and other
motifs, are more fabulous but less interesting. Trump sells
fantasies, and these rooms are free, if you don't mind dropping
several thou at the table. Behind the Arabian Nights dreams is an
elaborate and completely rational machine designed to harvest cash.
My fantasy is to see how the rational and the irrational are
joined. Above the mirrors, in the crawl space, this dream comes
true. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life in the Ruins &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beauty flows from universal and eternal principles. The purpose
of the art academy is to identify these principles and encourage
conformity to them: if taste were properly cultivated, everyone
would like the same things. In the 18th century, many Enlightenment
thinkers subscribed to these beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   They live on today in debased form: advertising copy (``The
timeless beauty of the Ding-Dong Watch''). Art writing conducted on
the level of advertising copy (``The universal language of abstract
form''). Social climbing (``Classic, impeccable, but warm _ that
was Jackie!'').
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, the universalist ideal persists in convention
hotels, airport lounges, fast-food outlets and other homogenized
environments of the global monoculture. Everyone's taste has been
cultivated and everyone likes small-figure maroon wall-to-wall
carpeting with borders of contrasting cream. You can love it but
you can't leave it.
</P>
<P>
   This was Pop Art's message. ``Pop Art is liking things,'' Warhol
said. Give us the serenity to accept what we cannot change.
Acquiesce to the inevitable. This idea was culturally therapeutic
for the generation that came of age in the postwar consumer
society. But Warhol was also terrified by many of the things he
professed to like. Painting Coca-Cola bottles was a way of
mastering a standard of normalcy that this completely weird person
could never measure up to.
</P>
<P>
   Pop Art helped overeducated neurasthenics to enjoy common
pleasures. When Ricky Martin arrives on stage, standing on the hood
of a white 1964 Mustang, I'm happy to overlook the dark side of pop
culture: the deadening conformity, the media brainwashing, the
indifference to difference, the Philistinism. Blue jeans,
Coca-Cola, white T-shirts, Marilyn Monroe are cultural achievements
Americans can be proud of. Uniformity can be a blissful escape from
the torture of having a discriminating mind.
</P>
<P>
   Pater advised critics: ``The first step towards seeing one's
object as it really is, is to know one's impression as it really
is, to discriminate it, to realize it distinctly.'' And if one's
impression is ambivalent? This is the question Pop Art raised
regarding modern American taste.
</P>
<P>
   Trump poses the same question. I can give myself over to
enjoying the spectacle of the man and his accouterments. His
pleasure in them is infectious. But when I go looking for
architecture, I keep coming up short. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Quantity is a pop culture quality. The most records. The most
tickets. The most magazine covers, newspaper stories, Web site
hits. The most votes in a presidential campaign. Since the
pyramids, quantity has been a quality in architecture, too. That's
why it was worth going to court to protect Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Rem Koolhaas talks about Bigness as a necessary response to the
fragmented urban center. The 20th century has seen no greater
architectural wonder than the Manhattan skyline. Donald Trump will
not be the last person who wants to be part of it. The sky's
supposed to be the limit here.
</P>
<P>
   But his most recent project, Trump World Tower on First Avenue,
has aroused the wrath of many New Yorkers on account of its height.
Billed as the world's tallest residential building, this bronze,
glass-sheathed lightning rod will rise 70 stories to a height of
861 feet. ``Aesthetic outrage,'' ``monstrosity'' are some of the
milder epithets it has attracted. Opponents have also gone to court
to stop it, unsuccessfully thus far.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could agree with the opposition. If it were going to
block my views, no doubt I'd be hell on a keyboard. I also wish I
could defend the project against its detractors. But the truth is
that New York forfeited its right to complain about aesthetic
outrage some time ago. In terms of contemporary architecture, the
entire city is an aesthetic outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The city has achieved a fine record in architectural
preservation, and the value of this should not be underestimated.
But our support for contemporary work, for buildings that interpret
changing relationships in urban life, has all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   A builder with Trump's ambition, and his public presence, could
make a difference here, of course. If he wants to be the hip
swinger, the 007 dude, why won't he connect with contemporary
architects with proven talent to transform such desires into art?
Arquitectonica, Rem Koolhaas, Zaha Hadid, Jean Nouvel, Thom Mayne
... One can rattle off names, but the point is this: what's
objectionable about Trump's taste is not the desire for attention,
for the best, the most, the tallest, the most eye-catching. It is
his failure to realize these desires creatively in the
architectural medium. The persona is a force of nature. The
buildings don't rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Trump would say they're selling like hot cakes, they're the most
expensive square footage in New York, they're full of rich, rich,
people, the marble is the finest in the land, I'm a businessman,
the guys you like are kooks and crazies.
</P>
<P>
   I would say: yes, they're just like you. Do you want other
developers to get the glory for buildings that embody the daring,
kid-with-a-dream image you project?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not Trump's alone. How can he be blamed for not
knowing what New York hasn't taught him? On Central Park South, the
developer had to cope with a city official's suggestion that he
build a 1930s skyscraper on the site of the St. Moritz Hotel. At
Riverside South, his residential development on the West Side, he
was compelled by five civic groups to work with a set of design
guidelines that essentially guaranteed that the architecture would
be dead on arrival. How can he be criticized for narcissism if the
city doesn't even recognize how pathological it is to go on gazing
in the rear view mirror? No architecture please. We're too
tasteful. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene of ``Fellini's Satyricon,'' we see Nero's
Rome suddenly transformed into a crumbling fresco on the wall of a
ruined seaside villa. Encolpius has been murdered. Ascyltos has
fallen in with a group of sailers who are about to depart on a
voyage to unknown islands. The camera freezes on a picture of him
on the shore, walking toward the sea. Two thousand years pass and
we see the two companions as well as Trimalchio and the film's
other characters reunited as flecks of paint.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is moving for many reasons, one of them being the
gentleness with which the director restates the cautionary theme:
our passions, rages, successes and failures are all vanity. Life
itself, he has shown, is not. The duendes matter. If it's vanity to
want buildings that express ideas like this, let's be vain.

<HEADLINE>
DUN &AMP; BRADSTREET WILL SPIN OFF MOODY'S
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure from investors to do something to increase value,
the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp. said Wednesday that it intended to
separate its Moody's Investors Service credit-rating subsidiary and
its operating company into two publicly traded concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to spin off Moody's comes less than two months
after Clifford L. Alexander Jr., a director who was appointed
interim chief executive in October, publicly dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Alexander indicated that an analysis
arguing in favor of such a step by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., retained
by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet as its financial adviser, had been persuasive.
``Our investment bankers made a very thorough presentation to the
board,'' he said. ``They indicated to us that the values and their
capacity to shine would be enhanced if they were each on their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Making Moody's a separate company is a risky move for the
surviving entity, the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Operating Co.
</P>
<P>
   That company, which is the home of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's core
credit-information business, has been floundering. Although nearly
90 percent of employees work for the operating business, the unit
generates less than half of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's profit.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's stands in stark contrast. With fewer than 1,500
employees, the credit-rating agency accounted for roughly 51
percent of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's operating profit in the fiscal year
that ended in September and about 28 percent of its $2 billion in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said a spinoff would reflect the respective
value of the two franchises. ``I think Moody's by itself will sell
in the mid-$20's,'' said James D. Dougherty of Prudential
Securities, estimating the stock price. ``The operating company,
whose business is deteriorating at an accelerating rate, will sell
for a lot less than that.''
</P>
<P>
   News that Dun &AMP; Bradstreet might take such a step was first
reported Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted positively to the news. Shares of Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet rose $2.6875, to $29.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Before Wednesday, the stock was down about 15 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The separation of Moody's and the Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Operating Co.
is expected to be a tax-free transaction for shareholders,
Alexander said. As such, the proposal needs to be approved by both
the IRS and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it will take six months to nine months to get all
of this done,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Big shareholders, who earlier this year said they were
considering filing resolutions to help force a sale of the company,
were guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is a constructive step toward unlocking
shareholder value at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet,'' said Henry Berghoef, an
analyst at Harris Associates LP, a Chicago money management firm
that owns nearly 13 percent of the company's stock. ``But the
biggest issue here is management, particularly at the operating
company. They need extremely capable management with strong
credibility among investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty of Prudential said that with two executives already in
place at both Moody's and the operating company, it seemed
extremely unlikely that a search would be needed to find someone to
replace Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't need a corporate chief executive,'' he said. ``John
Rutherford will continue to run Moody's and Frank Sowinski will run
the operating company. They will probably go with what they already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   William F. Doescher, a Dun &AMP; Bradstreet spokesman, confirmed
Dougherty's analysis. ``There won't be any need to look for an
outside person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dun &AMP; Bradstreet has taken steps in the recent past to increase
shareholder value by spinning off subsidiaries. In 1996, it spun
off A.C. Nielsen, the market research firm, and the technology
researcher Cognizant Corp., now Nielsen Media Research. And last
year, it spun off the R.R. Donnelley, a yellow pages advertising
company.

 &HT;    Dishwashers aren't efficient if you don't load them correctly
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you have a dishwasher, do you know where its
owner's manual is? As with any appliance, you can get the most out
of a dishwasher if you use it the way the manufacturer suggests.
But there are a few general rules that apply to just about every
brand.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashers all work by striking dishes with a spray of hot
water and detergent. The dishwasher then pumps out the dirty water
and detergent, rinses the dishes and dries them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Maytag Corp., three factors determine whether
your dishwasher will operate at maximum efficiency: the potency of
the detergent and rinse agents you use, water temperature and
proper loading.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashers won't work with the dish detergents you use for hand
washing in the sink or with laundry detergent. Both these products
may produce excessive suds that can hamper the dishwasher's
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwasher detergents come in one of three forms: powder, gelled
liquid and tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Granule powders, the most traditional form, are effective only
when they are fresh. Never store boxes of dishwashing powder under
the sink; the warmth and dampness there can cause caking and
weakening of the cleaning agents.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid gel detergents can separate as they age. Maytag also said
liquid detergents may cause excessive sudsing in soft water. If you
use a water softener, you may get better results from a powdered
detergent than a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwasher-detergent tablets are convenient and come
individually wrapped to stay fresh. But with powdered or liquid
detergents you can raise or lower the amount of detergent slightly
to get the best results.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse aids keep water from beading on the dishes. Without them,
water drops tend to cling to glass and metal, leaving spots as the
dishes dry.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid rinse agents are designed for dishwashers with automatic
rinse-aid dispenser. Solid rinse aids will work in dishwashers
without dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   Your owner's manual will lay out the proper loading pattern for
the dishwasher you use, but the guiding principle is that dishes
must be loaded loosely enough to allow spray to hit all dish
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Place all the items in the racks so they are facing the center.
Load silverware in such a way that matching spoons or forks can't
nest together. Don't block the top of the washer tower.
</P>
<P>
   In general, you should wait to use your dishwasher until you
have a full load to wash. Because of the volume of hot water a
dishwasher uses, it consumes a lot of energy. Washing one large
load is more energy efficient than several small loads.
</P>
<P>
   However, avoid overloading the dishwasher. The jets of water
must be able to reach all the dish surfaces, and they can't if the
dishes are too tightly packed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Power &AMP; Light Co. suggests household hot water be
kept at about 120 degrees. However, some dishwashers, particularly
dishwashers without internal heating elements, require water heated
to 130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   To test water temperature, run the hot-water faucet nearest to
the dishwasher and allow it to build to peak temperature. Insert a
thermometer into the stream or into a glass of the water to get a
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   If the water temperature is under the temperature your machine
needs or more than 140 degrees, you should adjust the temperature
setting at your hot water heater. Water at 140 degrees poses a
scalding hazard; it also wastes energy.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the dishwasher, turn on the hot-water tap in a
nearby sink until it runs hot. That will insure the water initially
entering the dishwasher will be hot. Avoid other activities that
deplete hot water _ showering, washing clothes _ while running the
dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   Washing in a dishwasher can kill germs about 100 times more
effectively than washing in a sink because of the heat in the
washing and drying cycles, as well as the detergent action,
according to Maytag. Be sure you wash your hands before unloading
the dishwasher or you'll just reapply germs to the dish surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashers are more effective in soft water than in hard water.
If you're not sure how hard the water in your home is, call your
local water supplier or have the water tested.
</P>
<P>
   If your water is hard, increasing the amount of detergent you
use should improve the cleaning. Dishwashers are naturally
self-cleaning, but especially hard water or water with high iron
and manganese content can leave deposits on the inside of the
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Check your owner's manual for cleaning suggestions, but you may
be able to remove hard-water stains by wiping down the wash chamber
with dishwasher detergent and vinegar. Be sure to wear rubber
gloves, because dishwasher detergent is caustic.
</P>
<P>
   To remove rust stains, start the empty dishwasher at the rinse
cycle and add a commercial soluble rust remover as the dishwasher
fills. Read the label of the rust remover carefully to be sure it
is meant for use in a dishwasher.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Scott Hicks was in China in 1995, an itinerant
filmmaker shooting a documentary, when he got a message from his
wife back in Australia that as relayed by the Chinese hotel clerk,
``CAM had called.'' Hicks couldn't figure out what that could
possibly mean. CAM.? Who was CAM? And why were they calling?
Finally, he got a line through to Australia. No, not CAM, he was
told, CAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, CAA!'' Mr. Hicks remembers thinking, the Creative Artists
Agency, one of Hollywood's power brokers. ``Even I knew who they
were,'' Hicks said. ``I read Premiere magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, then still a largely unknown documentarian and filmmaker
based in faraway Adelaide, Australia, was in a kind of wonderful
middle ground in his career, after he had completed his first
theatrical film, ``Shine,'' but before it had turned into a
worldwide box office smash and Academy Award nominee. He returned
CAA's call and got an agent on the phone. Well, well, he was asked,
what kind of project might he be interested in doing next?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the first thing that popped into my head,'' Hicks said.
``I said that I had just read this fabulous book called `Snow
Falling on Cedars.''' CAA was delighted. The agency, he was told,
had arranged a deal for one of its screenwriters, Ron Bass, to
write an adaptation of the novel, by David Guterson.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Shine'' opened, Hicks was no longer a little-known chap
from Adelaide, and everyone was trying to pitch him with ideas for
what might be his second film. He flirted with dozens of projects
but ``Cedars,'' he said, was always in the back of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one day, out of the blue, I got a fax from David
Guterson,'' Hicks remembered. ``He said he had just seen `Shine'
and wondered if I had ever heard of his novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between an author, especially the author of a
highly regarded literary novel like ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' and
a director, especially a director with the kind of meticulous
seriousness that produced ``Shine,'' can often be a querulous one.
But when there is a meeting of the minds, as there appears to have
been in the case of ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' (which opens
Wednesday), the results can be a kind of creative rapture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consulted with Scott exhaustively,'' said Guterson. ``Every
moment in the screenplay, every line of dialogue, was subject to
lengthy discussion and work that we did together.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, Hicks said, with a trip he made to Seattle to meet the
author and get him to conduct a tour of the offshore islands that
form the backdrop of the story _ about a young, embittered World
War II veteran caught up in a murder trial involving the husband of
a Japanese-American woman he had once loved. Guterson lives in the
area, on Bainbridge Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' Hicks said. ``David was not the
sort of melancholy type I thought he might be. He turned out to
have a wicked sense of humor. We just connected as people,
instantly.'' More important, Hicks said, the two came to realize
that they had something in common.
</P>
<P>
   Both were creative artists who had been laboring away in
semi-obscurity for many years who had recently and quite suddenly
had a huge rush of success. ``We were two men in early middle age
who had worked quietly for a long time on their own little project
that had suddenly exploded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is a complex story that spreads
across many years and while it is, at heart, a love story, it also
contains elements of epic historical importance, like the
incarceration of Japanese-Americans in detention camps during World
War II. And there are three main plot threads, Hicks said: a murder
mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a
white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a
soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and
editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife)
and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their
community.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the two men did, Guterson said, was discuss
whether they wanted to make changes in the first draft of the
script, by Bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first draft, there was a considerable amount of
voice-overs, which was Ron's attempt to bring the voice of the
narrator into the film,'' Guterson said. ``Scott and I were of like
mind about that, which was let's try to tell this story without any
abstraction or explanation, without any voice-over telling us what
it all means, what to think and feel about it. Let's let the images
do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson went with Hicks to Montana, where the director was to
meet with Bob Richardson, the cinematographer, who was then filming
``The Horse Whisperer'' with Robert Redford. Richardson lent them
the use of a mountain cabin where they hunkered down to work on a
new draft of the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott is incredibly meticulous,'' Guterson said. ``I've never
met anybody with that kind of energy. I was the author of the book
and you'd think I would be the one pushing, but we spent a few days
together in a small cabin in Montana working from dawn to dusk, at
Scott's insistence.'' Guterson said he had had dreams of taking a
little time to enjoy the Montana wilderness, but the director had
other ideas. ``We started working when the sun came up and finally,
late at night, he'd say, OK, let's go to bed. Then, in the wee
hours of the morning, I'd hear a knock on my door and Scott's voice
saying, `All right, let's get back to work.' And then he'd tell me
about some ideas he'd had during the night. During the night! I
don't know about him, but I was sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During these long hours, the author said, Hicks would describe
for him, shot by shot, how the film would look. ``Scott has this
three-ring binder, the thing is huge,'' Guterson said. ``Every
single moment in the screenplay is in it, each with its own
footnote and bibliography, with drawings, comments, inputs from
various people, research he's done. He just keeps building that
thing over time, page by page, note by note. He dreams the film,
over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Hicks said, was to convey a great deal of information
as economically as possible without burying the audience in
exposition and without draining the emotion from the story. ``I
find in movies the plot is the Devil,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the novel is a series of mysteries. How did the
fisherman die? Why is Ishmael so bitter? What happened between him
and his former Japanese-Ameover? The plot needed to become
``a gradual revealing of the truth,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rhythm of the movie, Hicks said he wanted it to
slowly build to moments of intense emotion and then explode. ``My
idea was to build a kind of dam of emotion and release it when I
was ready to release it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At various key points in the story, Hicks would let the music
swell and the film zoom back and forth in time, intercutting shots
from Ishmael's youth, from his adolescence, from the war, from the
``present day'' in which the murder trial was taking place (the
late 1940s).
</P>
<P>
   ``The climax of the story is the letter-reading scene,'' he
said, referring to a scene toward the end of the film when Ishmael,
wounded in the war, reads a letter that resolves many of the plot's
mysteries. ``As he is reading the letter, we are cutting between
five different time frames,'' he said. ``None of this was
happenstance or decided in the editing room. It was all indicated
in the screenplay. I wanted to move back and forth in time, in the
way that your memory really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Once these mysteries are revealed, Hicks said, the story can
have its catharsis, can come to a kind of emotional resolution in
the denouement of the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the screenplay was finished, my role became that of the
happy tourist,'' Guterson said. (The screenplay in the finished
film is credited to both Bass and Hicks.) ``I came to the set,
brought my family to the set. I'd stand there with my hands in my
pockets and stare at the monitors, make a few comments that had
absolutely no decision-making authority attached to them, then
waltz off to lunch. It was great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks finished shooting the film _ which stars Ethan Hawke as
Ishmael, Youki Kudoh as his haunted love and Max von Sydow as the
aged lawyer who defends the accused fisherman _ in 1998 and there
was, initially, some idea of releasing it a year ago. But it really
wasn't ready, Hicks said, so he spent the next several months
tinkering. ``With me, if there isn't a deadline, things sort of
trickle on, and so they trickled on for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hicks thought the film was in good enough shape to show
it to a few people, and he invited Guterson to visit him at the
Skywalker Ranch in northern California, where Hicks worked on the
film's audio mix. ``I went down there and I saw it, sitting in this
vast, cavernous, otherwise empty theater,'' Guterson said. ``Having
worked with Scott so hard through the whole process, I didn't have
any doubt it was going to be a great film. I didn't go in with any
apprehension at all. But it was an odd experience, to see actors
who were attempting to become these characters, who had been born
in my mind and were now taking human shape. It was kind of
unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who had been a little nervous about the author's reaction
to the film, waited to hear Guterson's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just ecstatic,'' Hicks said, grinning happily. ``He
told me, `There is not one thing about the movie that could be any
better.'''

A LOW-RENT REFUGE FOR BAY AREA DOCUMENTARIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY DEC. 19)(af)  
 Edward Wong writes for The City section of The New York Times.  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ It was where cinematic flights to the Sahara,
to the concert halls of 18th-century Vienna, to the Amazon jungle
took wing. But this seven-story glass and concrete structure known
as the Fantasy building, where the producer Saul Zaentz has
realized films like ``The English Patient,'' ``Amadeus'' and ``At
Play in the Fields of the Lord,'' is also home base to a different
breed of filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Zaentz has offered low-cost space to
local documentarians, making his building a center for San
Francisco's growing, well-regarded documentary community.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen documentary filmmakers and their crews work
here, where editing machines sit next to Sundance Film Festival
trophies and video camera bags lean against walls dotted with
Academy Award nomination plaques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities need a mother church,'' said Jon Else, a filmmaker
who teaches at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The doc
community in the Bay Area has a couple, and the Saul Zaentz center
is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the filmmakers pay $150 to $200 a month for an office,
only slightly more than what Zaentz charged a decade ago and well
below market rates in the booming Berkeley-Emeryville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the least paid and hardest working of everybody in
film,'' Zaentz said. ``They have something they believe in, some
passion they're working for.'' So he lets his more profitable
ventures, an Oscar-winning sound mix and design company and Fantasy
Records, subsidize the space he turns over to the documentary
makers.
</P>
<P>
   The largest documentary operation in the building is Bill
Jersey's. The hallway is lined with framed awards and
black-and-white stills of Jersey aiming his camera at guerrillas in
Nicaragua and the statue of David in Florence. He has won several
Emmys, and his film ``Super Chief: The Life and Times of Earl
Warren'' earned an Academy Award nomination in 1990, but inside the
building his claim to fame is his role as godfather of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just people who wanted to bind together out of
desperation,'' the silver-haired Jersey said as he looked over the
shoulder of his editor in a dimly lighted room. The two were
cutting a film on the Jim Crow era, and archival images of Earl
Warren and Medgar Evers stared back from the video screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like community through brownout,'' Jersey said. ``When
the electricity goes off, you either act like animals or strugglers
who share.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he and about 10 other filmmakers began renting the top
floor of a building in nearby Emeryville for $400 a month. The
group that bonded included Connie Field, producer of ``The Life and
Times of Rosie the Riveter,'' and a former philosophy student named
Errol Morris. Michael Chandler, now a producer for PBS's
``Frontline,'' called Jersey ``the sun around which we orbited.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Bay Area documentary movement had begun
gathering momentum. As early as the 1950s, local artists had picked
up movie cameras to record the Beat phenomenon. That concern with
social change continued as the hippie culture, anti-Vietnam War
movement and civil rights activity converged on the West Coast. In
the '70s, Les Blank, now one of the most respected filmmakers in
the field, began earning critical praise for his short
documentaries, and Jersey and his friends were toiling away in
their Emeryville sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   When that site was sold, in 1982, they migrated to an old Shell
Oil building, only to see that owner sell five years later. Paul
Zaentz, Saul Zaentz's nephew and an overseer of the Fantasy
building, heard of the roving band of producers and offered them
offices at the bargain prices many of them still pay today. The
building began attracting other artists, like Marlon Riggs, who
made the landmark film ``Tongues Untied'' about black gay
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documentarians talk nostalgically of the days at the
old Shell Oil space, where they shared a single bathroom, kitchen
and lounge area. They crawled over glass dividers to borrow each
other's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was a big disappointment to come here,'' Jersey
said. ``It was more institutional. The windows didn't open, and we
didn't have an open space to sit and have coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most documentarians, finding a reliable place to settle
overrides such concerns. For instance, Chandler split from Jersey's
group years ago but recently found himself back in the Fantasy
building. ``Producing documentary films is such a fragile
enterprise, fraught with uncertainty and cyclical funding,'' he
said. ``What this place provides is stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler sat on a waiting list for two years before landing an
office on the fifth floor. On a recent morning, he flipped through
four blue notebooks filled with interview transcripts while his
dog, Shumba, slept on the floor. Because Chandler is also an
experienced editor (he was nominated for an Oscar for ``Amadeus''),
two of his neighbors, Deborah Hoffmann and Avon Kirkland, sometimes
wander into his office and ask for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmaking can be a lonely situation,'' said Kirkland, who was
in preproduction on a Ralph Ellison biography. ``And it's terrific
that so many people are around to bounce ideas off of. The two
biggest concerns of many documentary filmmakers is where to find
funds and how to make their program better. And here, you find
people who know something about both.''
</P>
<P>
   While in postproduction on ``Street Soldiers,'' his 1997 PBS
documentary about a juvenile rehabilitation group in San Francisco,
Kirkland showed a rough cut to a half-dozen fellow filmmakers,
luring them with pizza. He gave Jersey a copy on tape. After
watching it, Jersey handed the producer an audiocassette with an
hour's worth of comments.
</P>
<P>
   Such favors are returned: in 1996, Kirkland sat in on a
screening of a rough cut of Deborah Kaufman and Alan Snitow's
``Blacks and Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The political bent of the Fantasy building filmmakers can seem a
bit overwhelming. Where else could you find two producers working
concurrently on unrelated films about apartheid? It's a situation
that could explode into heated competition. But the filmmakers,
Deborah Hoffmann and Connie Field, say they have shared all kinds
of resources, from listings of archival film to names of reliable
crew members in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we take it a little bit for granted, how special and
unique this place is,'' Ms. Hoffmann said. ``I think pretty much
the most interesting docs are coming out of the Bay Area, and a lot
are coming out of this building.''

WALL STREET'S EMBRACE OF DIVERSITY LAUDED DESPITE ITS POOR RECORD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite their poor track record on hiring and promoting women
and minorities, firms on Wall Street deserve credit for having
started to embrace diversity, a study from the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers show a dismal lack of progress,'' said Mary
Frances Berry, chairwoman of the commission. ``It is still true
that white males dominate the most remunerative jobs and
opportunities on Wall Street. But I cannot infer, legally, that
anybody has been discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dwell on those statistics, the commission applauded
the efforts of some firms _ Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. _ to recruit more women and
minorities and to consider them for promotion to high-paying jobs,
Ms. Berry said, summarizing the conclusions of the commission's
study of economic opportunities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report on Wall Street grew out of hearings the commission
held four years ago, Ms. Berry said. The commission gathered
employment data from the firms after those hearings, and again a
few years later, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However slowly, change is occurring,'' she said. ``By and
large, the message is that things are a lot better than they used
to be but not as good as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms accepted the report with a degree of relief in the
wake of several lawsuits that have contended that Wall Street firms
have systematically discriminated against women. The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission is reviewing hiring and pay data
from Morgan Stanley, after a bond saleswoman at the firm claimed
that she had been denied a promotion because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Securities Industry Association, a Wall
Street trade group, declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a prepared statement sent to firms, the group's
president, Mark Lackritz, said, ``As the report notes, we have
already made significant progress in these areas.''

believe in Jesus, Yeshua in Hebrew, as the messiah, celebrated the
end of Hanukkah with songs, dances, latkes and jelly doughnuts. The
group also was marking the opening of its newest outpost, a $2.2
million building on East 51st Street half a block from the Sutton
Place Synagogue, a 99-year-old Conservative Jewish congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank you for Hanukkah and because you sent your son,
Yeshua, to die for us and rise again,'' Ms. Glaser's husband, Mitch
Glaser, the 47-year old president and chief executive of Chosen
People Ministries, said as he dedicated the three-story building
that will serve as executive headquarters and house of worship and
study. He concluded, ``Help us to be your light in a dark place in
Yeshua's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Chosen People, Jews for Jesus, Friends of Israel and
Ariel Ministries are trying to convince Jews they can believe in
Christ without renouncing Judaism, a view that is considered heresy
by the four branches of Judaism _ Orthodox, Conservative, Reform
and Reconstructionist _ as well as by secular organizations like
the Jewish Community Relations Council.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the center comes at a time when Chosen People is
subject to growing suspicion of its motives. Most recently, doubts
have been fueled by its tightening alliances with evangelical
Christians, some of whose avowed goal is the conversion of 144,000
Jews that the New Testament says must precede the second coming of
Christ. In September, Chosen People co-sponsored an evangelical
conference with the Southern Baptist Convention that was called
``To the Jews First in the New Millennium'' and that drew fire from
leaders of the entire spectrum of Judaism. Seven joint follow-up
conferences will be held in the coming months in this country and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years, groups like this have become more
aggressive in attempts to become the fifth arm of Judaism and to
entice more Jews by the millennium,'' said Philip D. Abramowitz,
director of the Jewish Community Relations Council's task force on
missionaries, which monitors activities of Messianic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen People is one of the oldest Messianic Jewish
organizations. It was established in Brooklyn in 1894 by Leopold
Cohn, a Hungarian rabbi. Until 1986 it was known as the American
Board of Missions to the Jews. Last year, it had revenues of more
than $5.8 million derived mainly from donations, many of them from
evangelical churches and individuals. It has 15 other congregations
around the country, including centers in Yonkers, N.Y., Plainview,
N.Y., Livingston, N.J., West Hartford, Conn., and Brooklyn, where
services are mainly tailored to Jewish immigrants from Russia. It
also operates abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a number of years, Chosen People Ministries was a quiet
Hebrew Christian group that proselytized in an understated way on
the streets and through small advertisements in Christian
publications,'' Abramowitz said. ``Then Mitch Glaser, a former Jew
for Jesus, took over and built it up to be a formidable
organization. Since then it has become more and more visible. We
see its ads in newspapers, its signs on trains and buses, and it is
establishing new centers in Manhattan and Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ads feature headlines like ``Would you settle for just half
a bagel?'' that say the whole bagel _ acceptance of Christ and not
just Judaism _ is the source of complete spiritual nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of Chosen People's new headquarters to the Sutton
Place Synagogue is often mentioned by Glaser, but how much and what
kind of interaction will occur between the group and the
1,000-member synagogue remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that this is a country where they have the right
to promote their point of view, however wrong I believe it to be,''
Rabbi Alan Schranz, the synagogue's spiritual leader, said. ``But
knowing the membership of my congregation, I do not believe they
have fertile territory here, and I hope they will be courteous and
thoughtful in the way they approach people attending services at
our synagogue. Perhaps their coming here is an opportunity to see
what a true synagogue is. Maybe they'll stop off here and get
something of true Jewish value.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Jews, in accordance with their theology, reject the idea
that Jesus is their Messiah, many of them concede the right of
Chosen People to their views. It is the strategies used to draw new
followers that disturb them.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say their adoption of Hebrew and the Torah, their use of
skullcaps and prayer shawls is misleading, as is their street
missionary work and the way they sometimes advertise services and
programs as being Jewish without mentioning Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't challenge their right to believe as they see fit,''
said Michael Miller, executive vice president of the Jewish
Community Relations Council. ``But for a Christian to assert that
one can be a better Jew by becoming Christian is deceptive. You are
considered to have undergone conversion when you identify with
Jesus as your Lord and savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Jewish Community Relations Council also object to
the effort of Chosen People and other groups to attract Russian
immigrants. ``Russian Jews are prime targets because, coming out of
the former Soviet Union, they don't know much about Judaism,''
Abramowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, who grew up in an Orthodox home, was ordained a minister
by the Conservative Baptist Association of America in 1980 and
earned a doctorate this year from Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena, Calif. He sits on the board of the Russian Community Life
Center in the Kings Highway section of Brooklyn, which currently
has more than 100 people enrolled in English language and
citizenship classes as well as Bible study. ``We also give
financial aid to impoverished people,'' he said, denying that
acceptance of Christ was tied in anyway to the aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Glaser's view and in that of his followers, there is nothing
contradictory about accepting Christ as the messiah and holding
fast to Judaism. After all, Jesus, they repeatedly say, was Jewish
and so were the apostles.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that being Jewish is primarily an ethnic and cultural
label, he said: ``When Italians accepts Jesus, they remain Italian;
when Native Americans become Christian, they are still Native
American. Simply put, when Jewish people believe in Jesus, they
remain Jewish ethnically, culturally and in their communal
identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since all Jews should be looking for the coming of the
messiah, by believing in Jesus, we are doing a very religious
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the guests at the new center's celebration, Alan
Schwab, a clothing manufacturer's representative, said he saw
nothing incongruous about the fact that he had come from the
Sabbath service at the Civic Center Synagogue, an Orthodox
congregation on White Street. ``The neighborhood rabbi needed a
minyan,'' he said referring to the required quorum of 10 men.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Ginenthal, who described herself as ``Jewish and
Christian,'' said she was born into an atheist Jewish home and
became devoutly Orthodox during a marriage that ended in divorce
partly because of the religious demands made on her. ``I was a lost
soul and called a healing ministry in Georgia for help,'' she said
at the party. ``They led me over the phone to Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she attends church. ``But I need the connections with
mishpoke that you can't get in Christian churches,'' she said,
using the Yiddish word for family. ``The church in Georgia has told
me that my steps are doubly blessed, that I am a daughter of
Abraham and a bride of Christ.''

KMART AND YAHOO PLAN NEW INTERNET SHOPPING SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kmart Corp. said Wednesday that it was teaming up with the
Internet portal company Yahoo to create a new company that will
provide free access to the Internet and a co-branded shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart, looking to vault its lackluster Web store into the front
ranks of e-commerce competitors, is counting on Yahoo's popularity
as well as a suite of services like free e-mail to attract traffic
to the new venture. Yahoo is betting that access to the
discounter's enormous customer base _ both through its stores and
its detailed database of shoppers' habits _ will enable it to
become a top site among mass-market consumers, a last untapped
source of potential Web users.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kmart nor Yahoo will make a cash investment in the new
company, called Bluelight.com, after the blue light specials that
became famous at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank Venture Capital, a Menlo Park-based firm that has been
a leading investor in online companies, put up $62.5 million to get
the company started. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. also put
up an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart will own 60 percent of the new venture, which aims to have
a public stock offering within two years. Yahoo will own none of
the company but is receiving hefty advertising revenue in addition
to a new source for registering users.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as big brick-and-mortar retailers and online
service providers and portals have suddenly seen the advantage of
teaming up and sharing customers. In the last month, Microsoft has
signed a deal with Tandy Corp. to promote its Internet service
through Tandy's RadioShack Stores; America Online has linked up
with the electronic retailer Circuit City to promote its Web access
service, and AOL is said to be in talks with the world's largest
retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., to build a co-branded site.
</P>
<P>
   The Kmart site, which is operating but will not have a full
complement of merchandise until spring, will try to differentiate
itself from the stores by offering only the chain's most upscale
merchandise, like its Martha Stewart brand of linens and pool
furniture. It expects to earn revenue from shopping as well as
advertising. By tapping Kmart's extensive database of customer
information, it hopes to customize the site that consumers see when
they log on.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, Kmart has developed one of the most
advanced databases tracking customer purchases. ``Not only can we
tell when you buy toothpaste,'' said Kmart chairman Floyd Hall,
``we know what brand and what size you purchased. That can tell us
a lot about your family and the types of products you'll be
interested in purchasing in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to reach people not on the Web is a major priority
for Yahoo, which makes most of its revenue from advertising. Kmart
estimates that 30 million consumers, with household incomes ranging
from $25,000 to $60,000, visit its stores weekly and that 49
percent of them do not shop on the Web. Kmart will promote
Bluelight.com with promotions in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   While Yahoo stands to gain by putting pressure on AOL, which
charges a monthly fee for Internet access, the company risks losing
its image as an exciting young brand by being tied to Kmart.

ANOTHER WASTED SHOT IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One warm summer evening last June, for reasons we don't know, a
person we haven't captured pointed a pistol we haven't found into
the night sky and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been a few blocks south of Camelback Road and a few
blocks west of Central Avenue. Perhaps he was standing on the
street or in his back yard, or perhaps he was riding in an
automobile. Perhaps, even, it was a she.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon was fired and the sharp silent bullet rose into the
darkness, arching gently about a mile above Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It hesitated there, the way a diver seems to hang for a moment
above the diving board. Then, down.
</P>
<P>
   The small metal projectile bored through the still air. One
hundred feet per second. Three hundred. Five hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Below, in a house in central Phoenix, 14-year-old Shannon Smith
chatted with a friend on the telephone. She said she heard a noise
outside, something that sounded to her like an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   The phone was portable so she carried it with her into the back
yard. Above, the tiny slug plunged furiously toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There are 473 square miles in the city of Phoenix, many of them
empty, unpaved desert, uncluttered by office buildings and houses,
unoccupied by men or women or little girls. But that isn't where
the bullet came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's father found her in the yard at 10:40 p.m. &QL; 
MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR
</P>
<P>
   A day later, preparing for his daughter's funeral, Otis Smith
said, ``No parent should ever go through this.'' And he's correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths live in a nice neighborhood in a nice house with a
9-foot block wall surrounding their back yard. Still, their
daughter was killed. It was more than they could bear. It's more
than any of us could bear.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths got together with a few members of the Arizona
Legislature and came up with a proposed new law that would increase
penalties for randomly discharging a firearm from a misdemeanor to
a Class 6 felony.
</P>
<P>
   A version of ``Shannon's Law'' passed the state Senate but
hasn't yet been approved by the House. Parents organizations,
politicians, newspapers and even the National Rifle Association are
in favor of it. They say the new law will do something good for all
of us. And it will.
</P>
<P>
   It'll make us feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   We already have a law we could use to charge with a felony
anyone who fires a weapon in a populated area.
</P>
<P>
   The crime is reckless endangerment, and the statute reads: ``A
person commits endangerment by recklessly endangering another
person with a substantial risk of imminent death or physical
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting off a pistol in a neighborhood more than qualifies. &QL; 
MESSAGE TO THE POLICE
</P>
<P>
   But enforcing an existing law doesn't quite ease the pain. Not
when we've lost a little girl. That takes a new law. Shannon's Law.
One of those trying to get it approved in the state House is state
Sen. Chris Cummiskey.
</P>
<P>
   He told me Wednesday, ``Some neighborhoods where random gunfire
is a regular occurrence indicated that even with `reckless
endangerment' out there on the landscape, law enforcement has not
been coming out and pressing for some conclusion to this in those
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a new law would send a message to the police. Maybe
it will. That would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sending a message to ordinary gun owners is
absolutely vital. A good advertising campaign would do that, though
it won't stop all the gunfire. If caught, the person who killed
Shannon Smith would do time for manslaughter. That won't stop all
the gunfire, either.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Shannon's Law say they, too, would like to see
more public service announcements about the dangers of firing
weapons into the air, but they still want their new law.
</P>
<P>
   I can't fault them. The loss of any little girl is unacceptable.
It's more than any of us can bear. But we won't keep it from
happening again by taking our own shot in the dark. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A TOOTHLESS IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 16:
</P>
<P>
   After hearing testimony by outraged taxpayers claiming abuse by
agents of the Internal Revenue Service, Congress passed a tough
bill last year that told the IRS to treat taxpayers nicely and fire
agents who misbehave. The agency and agents got the message. In
startling interviews conducted by David Cay Johnston of The Times,
agents described how they have cut back efforts to catch cheating
by businesses and high-income taxpayers, overlooking complex issues
in a process the agents dub ``audit lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't collect taxes anymore,'' one longtime IRS official
told The Times. ``We aren't allowed to.'' The danger of such loose
enforcement is that it will foster wholesale cheating and breed
contempt for a code that until now most Americans voluntarily
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate held hearings in 1997 and 1998 during which outraged
taxpayers accused agents of bullying tactics, armed raids and other
abuses. Congress reacted to the inflammatory testimony by
instructing the agency to improve customer service, cut back on
aggressive tax collection tactics and fire agents who misbehaved in
any one of 10 specific ways that Congress wrote into law. Some of
the testimony was discredited, and a study by the General
Accounting Office failed to find systematic abuse. But Congress had
already cracked down.
</P>
<P>
   The results are beginning to emerge. Thousands of agents have
been transferred out of collecting revenue into customer service _
answering phones, solving problems and otherwise meeting the needs
of confused or upset taxpayers. Auditing has been cut sharply.
Fewer than one in 300 tax returns will be audited this year, a drop
of about 30 percent since 1997 and 70 percent since the early
1980s. In the year ending Sept. 30, the IRS seized property of
delinquent taxpayers 161 times. Two years ago, the number of
seizures was 10,000. Though cutting back its audits of rich
individuals and corporations, the IRS intends to pursue abuse of
tax credits for low-paid workers and people who fail to file tax
returns at all.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Charles Rossotti, appointed two years ago to clean
up the administrative mess, has clearly begun to turn that problem
around. But he issued a mission statement last year that focused
entirely on customer service and failed to even mention collecting
taxes. A Treasury official threatened to increase internal
investigations of IRS agents. That pledge was subsequently
retracted. But the chilling messages to go soft on pursuing tax
cheats reverberate through the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti appears worried that his customer-first edicts have
gone too far. He needs to act soon to counter the impression among
agents that ``no one will do anything'' to force taxpayers, even
cheats and criminals, to pay the taxes they owe.

FUGITIVE FOOTBALL PLAYER ARRESTED IN TENNESSEE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rae Carruth, the pro football player who disappeared after he
was charged with murder in the drive-by shooting death of his
girlfriend, was found hiding in the trunk of a car Wednesday night
at a Tennessee motel, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's arrest in the parking lot of a Best Western motel near
Jackson brought an end to a search that involved investigators from
the FBI. At a news conference in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday night,
law enforcement officials announced Carruth's capture, saying FBI
agents in Tennessee had received a tip that Carruth was staying at
the motel, about 25 miles east of Jackson. Carruth was apparently
at the motel with a woman, whose identity was not released. The
woman was not charged, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents checked the room, then searched the car parked in the
motel's lot, the law enforcement officials said. ``He was
cooperative during the course of the arrest and processing,'' said
Victor O'Korn, the FBI assistant agent in charge in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after the death of his girlfriend, Cherica Adams,
24, Carruth was charged with murder in her shooting, which occurred
as Ms. Adams drove through Charlotte just after midnight on Nov.
16.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators say that Carruth and two friends conspired to
kill Ms. Adams, who was six-and-a-half-months pregnant with his
child. The shooting forced doctors to deliver the child by
Caesarean section. Carruth was free on $3 million bail when he
disappeared. After his arrest, he was taken to the Madison County
jail in Jackson, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, 25, was the first-round draft choice of the NFL's
Carolina Panthers in 1997 out of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Matt Hunter, a spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Police Department, said the officials would try to extradite
Carruth to North Carolina, where he faces charges that include
conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, attempted murder and
shooting in an occupied vehicle. If convicted, Carruth could face
the death penalty or life in prison.

EDITORIAL: BUT YOSSARIAN LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 16:
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph Heller was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s, he
read the books of an American childhood then: the ``Tom Swift'' and
``Rover Boys'' series. When he also read a child's edition of ``The
Iliad,'' he thought he might want to be a writer. He became one,
and because he had a diamond eye for the phony, the funny and the
lunatic in life, and because he milled his own experience into
characters and dialogue no novelist had employed before, the young
of the last four decades have grown up with a different kind of
classic: Heller's great satire of war and American culture,
``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1961, it challenged the conventional, heroic view
of World War II. Heller, who died on Sunday at 76, served in that
conflict as a bombardier. He made his protagonist, Yossarian, a
bombardier who was convinced that even a war others viewed as a
necessary collision between good and evil was crazy and designed to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the genius of the book was that it allowed readers to
grasp Yossarian's terror and cynicism even if they continued to
believe that World War II was wholly necessary. Then came Vietnam.
When young Americans began to be drafted and die by the tens of
thousands, ``Catch-22'' became a predictive allegory for a war that
truly was unnecessary and therefore deserved the resistance of the
generation it was killing. In ``Catch-22,'' then, Heller left a
very rare kind of book. It succeeded first as a work of literary
art and, for Americans of a certain age, had a forceful second life
as a powerful political document.

MANHATTAN COURT WORKER CHARGED IN THEFT OF MALCOLM X DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan court worker was charged Wednesday with
stealing the bloodied and bullet-riddled diary of Malcolm X from a
court evidence safe and selling it to a collector for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the court employee, Doug Henderson, stole the
diary in 1991, a quarter-century after three men were convicted of
assassinating the civil rights leader in the Audubon Ballroom in
Upper Manhattan in 1965. The diary was in Malcolm's coat pocket
when he was shot to death and it was never returned to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who was charged with grand larceny and possession of
stolen property, declined to speak with reporters as he left the
Manhattan Criminal Courts building after he was released pending a
hearing on March 2. He faces up to seven years in jail if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's lawyer, Gregory Smith, said that Henderson, 41,
attended the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, graduated from Lehman
College and is a first-year student at New York University law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials were notified that the diary was
missing this spring by the editors of a Web site,
www.thesmokinggun.com. When a prominent San Francisco auction
house, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, announced that it planned to
auction the diary and estimated that it would sell for as much as
$50,000, Malcolm's family objected and the police halted the
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said there was no evidence that the auction house or
the memorabilia dealer involved, Mark Schafler, were aware that the
diary had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said
Wednesday that Henderson stole the diary in 1991 from a small safe
used to store bail money in the Supreme Court clerk's office in the
Manhattan Criminal Courts building. Officials said it was routine
for such evidence to be held indefinitely if relatives do not ask
for it. Henderson sold it to Schafler, the memorabilia dealer, for
$5,000 in January 1997, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials had moved the diary into the smaller bail safe,
from a walk-in evidence safe, because they feared that it might be
stolen, prosecutors said. At the time of the theft, Henderson was a
junior court analyst in the clerk's office and did not have
official access to the safe. It was usually left open during the
day, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   It is now in Morgenthau's own office.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Fleming, a Manhattan lawyer representing Malcolm's
daughters, said the plans for the auction were the first they knew
of the diary's existence.
</P>
<P>
   David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the court system, said
Henderson, who now works in a court mediation program, would be
suspended without pay pending the outcome of the investigation.

NEW YORK CITY PRINCIPALS GIVE UP TENURE FOR A RAISE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The union representing New York City school
principals said Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with
city officials and the Board of Education for a new contract that
would end principals' virtually ironclad job tenure, require them
to work a longer school day and eliminate their two-month summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those concessions, principals, who have not
received a pay increase in four years, would get a 33 percent raise
by next April.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Board of Education confirmed the
preliminary agreement, which extends through March 2001 and will
give the principals an average salary of $93,200. But City Hall
officials and others involved in the negotiation said the agreement
had not been signed and that the wording of some contract
provisions must be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all sides seemed to agree that there were no longer any
important issues under negotiation in a bitter contract stalemate
that had dragged on for almost four years and driven scores of
principals to leave for higher-paying jobs in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   One city official said the announcement of the contract, which
could come Thursday, was delayed so that it would not be
overshadowed by the settlement of the transit workers contract.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made elimination of principal tenure a
strong component of his education policy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 33 percent wage increase appears large, particularly
compared with the 18 percent increase over three years agreed to
this week by the transit workers union, principals have not had a
wage increase since 1995. The proposed contract extends through
April 2001, with the last scheduled pay increase in April 2000.
Thus, the new wage increase amounts to less than 5 percent per year
compounded annually.
</P>
<P>
   The longstanding system of principal tenure made it almost
impossible to remove an ineffective principal and required an
expensive administrative trial process that could often last years.
Union representatives say that the new system gives principals
three-year contracts and provides for annual performance reviews
that must form the basis for any principal's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The principals will gain the right to appeal a dismissal or
demotion to an independent arbitrator, to the schools chancellor
and, for a final decision, to the state education commissioner. But
the entire process can last no more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The tenure system for assistant principals and other
administrators has been preserved, both sides agreeing to stick to
an arbitration process that is supposed to last no more than 150
days but has frequently stretched much longer.

A DELAY IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL BLOCKS RELIEF AID FOR AFGHANISTAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The relief agency Doctors Without Borders said
Wednesday that it was unable to fly medicine and other relief goods
into Afghanistan because of a delay by the Security Council in
granting permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council imposed sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban
movement last month, including a prohibition on international
flights. But it has not found a chairman for the committee that
rules on exceptions to the flight ban.
</P>
<P>
   The aid group, which was awarded the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize,
appealed to the Security Council Wednesday and was promised a
decision by late afternoon on whether an aircraft loaded with
health supplies could fly into Kabul from Dubai, said Catherine
Dumait-Harper, the organization's representative at the United
Nations. Relief goods are permitted to be sent to Afghanistan once
the paperwork has been cleared in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The council deferred the decision until Thursday, too late for
the plane to take off under the aid group's charter contract. Ms.
Dumait-Harper said she was told that one council member, the United
States, asked for a delay. Washington is still considering the
request, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had requested the flight ban on Afghanistan
until the Taliban turned over the Saudi-born militant Osama bin
Laden. Any country put under sanctions is normally expected to be
allowed to import critical civilian goods, like medicine, but in
the case of Afghanistan no Security Council member wanted to become
chairman of the committee overseeing the restrictions, so no formal
channel exists to handle requests for exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   In Kabul, aid groups have also said that relief work and the
ability of Afghan citizens to keep in touch with families abroad
through a postal service dependent on air mail have been affected
by the flight ban. Requests for exemptions are not being dealt with
while the committee waits for new Security Council members to take
their seats in January, hoping one of them will become chairman.

FRENCH STALLING ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Dec. 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have dragged on for months on a United Nations
Security Council resolution to send an international inspection
team back to Iraq, while Saddam Hussein takes advantage of each
delay. This week, as the council prepared to vote, France balked at
the plan, asking for more time to see if new language can be
crafted that would move Russia and China from abstention to
support. The French tactic is mischievous and dangerous. The
security council can and should act immediately and get inspectors
back into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The pending resolution has been watered down already, but it has
acceptable provisions establishing a new inspection commission to
replace the one Iraq barred last December. The new monitoring group
would not only re-establish inspections but also would set up a new
system of electronic sensors and checks on stocks to ensure that
Iraq is not building biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.
Passage of the resolution would also clear the way for re-entry of
inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. If Iraq
carries out its disarmament tasks, the security council can ease
sanctions, while monitoring the uses of oil export revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China, which have long looked after Iraq's interests
at the council, were prepared to abstain on the new resolution,
allowing it to pass. That is why France's last-minute delaying
tactic, apparently dictated by President Jacques Chirac, is
dismaying. French disarmament experts have been vigilant in
identifying Iraqi abuses, but Chirac is sensitive to Iraq's threat
to cut off commercial ties with France. The French president wants
the foreign ministers of the Western democracies to discuss the
measure in Berlin later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since the resolution is the product of painstaking negotiations,
there is no reason to think that acceptable new provisions can be
added that are favorable to Russia and China. Further delays risk
unraveling the consensus already backing the measure. The
composition of the security council changes next month, and the
resolution would have to be redrafted to win approval of the new
members.
</P>
<P>
   France ought to stop temporizing and get behind a resolution
allowing for resumption of a tough monitoring system in Iraq. Any
further delay gives Hussein new opportunities to pose a threat to
his neighbors. &QL;

FAA ORDERS TODDLER SEATS ON AIRLINERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday
that it would require safety restraints for small children on all
commercial aircraft, meaning that a toddler will no longer be able
to ride in the lap of an adult but must be strapped in a small seat
as though riding in a car.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA administrator, Jane Garvey, told a safety conference
that her agency was putting the regulation into effect because it
was committed to ``ensuring that children are accorded the same
level of safety in aircraft as are adults.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with aviation safety and the Washington
regulatory process said the regulation would probably not be
enacted for many months, given the time required for public comment
and debate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will it be clear for some time who will provide the child
seats _ the airlines or parents or perhaps outside vendors _ or how
much allowance the airlines will make so parents do not wind up
having to pay full fare for separate seats for small children.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear Wednesday that the aviation agency's position
had changed, so that it and the National Transportation Safety
Board were essentially united on an issue that divided them for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board's chairman, James E. Hall, welcomed the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``No parents or caregiver would anticipate being in a situation
in which they are better protected than their children,'' Hall
said. ``That's exactly the predicament they find themselves in when
they and their children travel by airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he had been dismayed and amazed for years that
luggage, coffee, portable computers, even adult passengers must be
secured for takeoff and landing and during turbulence aloft while
``the most precious cargo on that aircraft, infants and toddlers,
were left unrestrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement by the FAA evolved at least in part
from a February 1997 report by the White House Commission on
Aviation Safety and Security, created after the July 1996 explosion
of a Trans World Airlines jetliner that killed 230 people off Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Child-safety restraints would have done no good in that
accident, but there have been several others in recent years in
which children who might have lived had they been strapped in were
killed when they hurtled through the cabin on impact.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, 1990, for instance, at least one infant who
conceivably could have survived had he been restrained was killed
in the crash of an Avianca Boeing 707 on Long Island. That crash
killed 73 of the 159 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 19, 1989, at least one unrestrained infant died as a
United Airlines DC-10 spun in flames down a runway of the airport
at Sioux City, Iowa, in a crash that killed 112 of 296 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, safety experts at Wednesday's conference noted, a
9-month-old child was among the 37 people who died in the 1994
crash of a DC-9 at Charlotte, N.C. The mother, who could not hold
her baby, survived.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, representing major U.S. airlines,
said the lack of a uniform standard for child-safety seats on
aircraft was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in all sizes and shapes and forms,'' Ron Welding, a
passenger-safety expert for the group, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Welding said most airlines thought passengers should bring their
own child-safety seats, and not just because that arrangement would
be easier for the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child is accustomed to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, the FAA has recommended child restraints. It
recommends a backward-facing seat for children under 20 pounds,
regardless of age, and a forward-facing one for children from 20 to
40 pounds. Children over 40 pounds can be safely buckled in with a
normal seat belt, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   One government aide who has followed the issue said that putting
the new rule into effect would be ``a mess.'' She said that
airlines have had a mixed record in handling young children and
aiding their parents and that more complicated problems lie ahead:
setting uniform standards for restraints, deciding who provides
them and under what circumstances and making sure that they can be
adapted to seats in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has recommended child restraints on airlines
for two decades. For much of that time, the FAA argued against
them, reasoning that if parents had to buy separate tickets for
infants they would be inclined to drive rather than fly _ putting
the child at greater statistical risk.

PATAKI FUND-RAISER CHARGED WITH PROMISING PAROLE HELP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Korea, N.J.)   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A businessman and political fund-raiser was charged
Wednesday with promising favorable state parole rulings to the
families of three convicted violent felons in exchange for more
than $36,000 in donations to the election campaign of Gov. George
E. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
charged that one inmate was released as a result of the
intervention by the businessman, Yung Soo Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge,
N.J., who raised tens of thousands of dollars for the campaigns of
Pataki and other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, who was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice
in connection with those donations, was also accused in the
indictment of violating federal campaign finance laws in an
unrelated case in which he was said to have solicited $40,000 from
a South Korean yogurt company and illegally funneled $15,000 of it
to the 1998 U.S. Senate campaign of Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charged that $20,000 was solicited for the
1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, but the Republican's
campaign did not receive the money because it canceled a planned
Korean community fund-raising dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The yogurt maker, the Korea Yakult Co., is also said to have
paid Yoo $100,000 to secure his help in assuring that a former
employee held in New York on federal immigration charges and
suspected of embezzling millions from the company was deported to
South Korea rather than the country of his choice, according to the
indictment, which did not charge wrongdoing by the company or its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contains the most detailed charges in a
two-and-a-half-year grand jury investigation into accusations that
Pataki campaign officials used the promise of early parole to drum
up contributions and exerted their influence with the
administration to affect State Division of Parole decisions about
Korean-American donors and politically influential Hasidic Jews.
The accusations have been particularly embarrassing for Pataki, who
has sought to eliminate parole entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the charges in the nine-count indictment tell the story
of three Korean families who in 1994 and 1995 were trying to win
early release for their sons. Yoo ``told contributors in substance
that, in exchange for contributions to the Pataki campaign, their
children, who were incarcerated in New York State prisons, would be
released from prison,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment described how the families were approached by
Yoo, how they attended Pataki fund-raisers and how they, friends
and family members made donations, in one case using Yoo as a
conduit or straw donor to give $10,000. It also said that in
October 1994, members of one family met with a Pataki campaign
representative at the campaign's Manhattan headquarters and
personally delivered contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has also focused on Patrick Donohue, who was
Pataki's campaign finance director and forwarded Yoo's requests to
administration officials. He has not been charged with any crime.
The U.S. attorney, Loretta E. Lynch, whose office is prosecuting
the case, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Giordano, an assistant U.S. attorney who has overseen
the investigation, said Wednesday that no evidence had been
uncovered that , D'Amato or Dole participated in or had knowledge
of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Michael F. McKeon, a spokesman for the governor,
pointed to that statement as support for the administration's
repeated and strenuous denials that officials had engaged in
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. MacKinnon, a spokesman for Dole, said that Yoo had
volunteered to raise money for the former Senate leader's
presidential campaign and that the fund-raising dinner referred to
in the indictment had been discussed but never scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, for whom Yoo had been a longtime and prolific
fund-raiser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Yoo, Nicholas M. De Feis, said his client had
committed no crime and called him a patriot and a respected
Korean-American businessman.

FUND TO HELP SAVE OPEN SPACE IN NEW JERSEY, RHODE ISLAND

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to stem the loss of undeveloped land to
suburban growth in the Northeast, the Doris Duke Charitable
Foundation will give $14 million to projects protecting fields,
marshes and forests in New Jersey and Rhode Island, the most
densely populated states in the country, foundation officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $8.4 million, will be used over the next four
years to help private conservation groups buy at least 10,000 acres
of land or restrictive easements in parts of central and northern
New Jersey where construction threatens two important ecosystems:
the Pine Barrens and the ridge of highlands that is the state's
western backbone, foundation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said $950,000 would be given over the same period to two
private groups in New Jersey working to strengthen local land
trusts and promote land-use planning by local governments that
focuses not just on economic growth but also on protecting wetlands
and other fragile habitats.
</P>
<P>
   A similar package of grants, totaling $4.7 million, is being
made to private groups in Rhode Island, said Peter Howell, the
director of environmental programs for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion foundation, based in Manhattan, was established
in 1997 by the estate of Ms. Duke to protect the environment and
support the arts and medical research.
</P>
<P>
   The $8.4 million for land protection in New Jersey will be split
over the next four years between the Nature Conservancy and the
Trust for Public Land, two national conservation groups. The grants
are contingent on the groups' raising at least $4 in public and
private money for each dollar from the Duke foundation, Howell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, representatives of the two groups said they were
confident that the prospect of the Duke foundation money would make
it easier to raise the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Harvey, the senior vice president of the Trust for Public
Land, said the extra money would come from other private donors,
from New Jersey's recent bond act for protecting open space and
from local taxes intended to preserve green tracts in crowded
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commitment of private funds is a great example and will
leverage many more dollars,'' Ms. Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the need to protect land was greater than ever.
Housing construction, she said, is threatening the northern Pine
Barrens _ a patchwork of stream-laced woods full of rare species _
and spreading up the ridge of rugged hills, west of the state's
coastal plain, that forms a green bridge linking many parks and
sheltering many species.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Duke foundation was welcomed by
environmental groups around the New York metropolitan region,
mainly because it would provide a spur to land preservation in a
state that has not seen many large gifts from philanthropists
intended for environmental protection, particularly compared with
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few dozen miles to the east, in the Hudson River Valley,
for example, more than $125 million has been spent over the last
decade on preserving land by a single foundation, the Lila Acheson
and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see this commitment to New Jersey,'' said Joe
Martens, the president of the Open Space Institute, one of two
groups that are conduits for the Wallace fund money, which can be
spent only in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Duke foundation appeared to be establishing a
long-term commitment to the region, with the new grants following
its gift of $5 million in 1997 to secure the purchase of Sterling
Forest, a 16,000-acre wooded tract straddling the New York-New
Jersey border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money necessary to curb sprawl and encourage
good land use is in short supply,'' Martens said, ``particularly in
places where development is heaviest and land prices are the
highest.''

IT'S A PERFECT TIME OF YEAR TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE COMMON GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's not supposed to be the Me Generation anymore, but
business managers and leaders of volunteer groups may argue.
</P>
<P>
   Workers ask (though perhaps not aloud), ``What's in it for me?''
when their participation is requested on a project beyond their
personal job descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no individual gain attached to the corporate effort,
many employees decline involvement, provided they have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The same question or its corollary, ``What's in it for my kid?''
are prime considerations when volunteer appeals are made.
</P>
<P>
   If the cause isn't my family's disease or my kid's activity,
then the volunteer commitments are much harder to get. Just ask
volunteer group leaders to tell you who constitutes their committed
core. It's usually people with the greatest self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   The unsteady state of human interaction in the 1990s has
elicited considerable sociological rumination about America's loss
of ``social capital.'' Consensus says the connective tissue that
binds people for mutual benefit has been shredded by attitudes of
``Who cares?'' and ``It's not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss is manifested in declining membership in organizations,
declining volunteer numbers, declining voter turnouts and declining
civility among strangers.
</P>
<P>
   It shows up, too, in the vanishing of ``third place'' gathering
spots, the term some sociologists give to those nonhome, nonwork
places, such as town social halls or neighborhood bars. Those are
the places where people spend time together and get to know one
another, instead of cocooning in front of their television sets or
making solitary daily commutes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, our connective tissue runs through telephone lines
and computer screens. The impersonalization of recorded sales
messages, voice mail and e-mail makes it possible to think real
people aren't on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   And if they're not real, who cares about them?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a do-gooder message attached:
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfect time of year, if not of the century, to
contribute to the collective good.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there are counterarguments:
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pay me enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's doing me any favors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I can do to take care of myself (or my family).''
</P>
<P>
   And the ever-present ``Who has the time?''
</P>
<P>
   All may be true to large or small degrees. But where would our
nonprofit and profit-making organizations be without individuals
who take the time and make the commitment to extend themselves
beyond their own self-interested orbits?
</P>
<P>
   Short answer: The institutions would be in worse shape than they
are now.
</P>
<P>
   Income levels and ``spare'' time vary mightily among
individuals. How much money or how much time one gives can't be
dictated or judged by others. It's a matter of billfold and
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet everyone prospers when some people respond to the small
voice that calls for weaving, instead of tearing, the social
fabric. The sum of individual commitment makes for better
workplaces, better communities, better schools and better families.

HOECHST, RHONE-POULENC ENTER NEW ERA AS LARGEST DRUGMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA completed
their $29 billion merger into the world's biggest drugmaker
Wednesday, signaling the start of a new era for the Kansas City
enterprise formerly known as Marion Laboratories Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is known as Aventis SA, with global headquarters
in Strasbourg, France. The company's U.S. drug operations will be
known as Aventis Pharmaceuticals. Drug operations outside the
United States will be known as Aventis Pharma.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the merger, the North American headquarters of the
former Hoechst Marion Roussel pharmaceutical unit will move from
Kansas City to New Jersey, a move that will pull 900 white-collar
jobs out of the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The North American headquarters will be housed at an interim
site in Parsippany, N.J., before establishing its permanent
headquarters in Bridgewater, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   After the headquarters move, the company will retain about 820
manufacturing and related employees in Kansas City, where it makes
the Cardizem heart drug and the Allegra allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis Pharmaceuticals spokesman Charles Rouse repeated the
company's earlier assertion that all 900 Kansas City headquarters
employees will have the opportunity to move to the new headquarters
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   However, they may have to be flexible concerning the kind of job
they move into, Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not get to go in the exact job they have now, but
there are many opportunities for which candidates are being
considered,'' Rouse said. ``Jobs are changing because the company
is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said about two dozen employees, mostly senior managers,
already had accepted offers to relocate from Kansas City to New
Jersey. Top managers are being selected and they will make plans
for their divisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis by April will have a better idea of how many Kansas City
employees will ultimately move to New Jersey, Rouse said. The
headquarters move is expected to begin in February and take most of
2000 to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary signs displaying the new Aventis corporate identity
will go up at the company's south Kansas City complex Thursday,
Rouse said. Permanent replacement signs will be installed in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the loss of 900 jobs, the headquarters loss will end
part of the legacy of the late Ewing Marion Kauffman, who in 1950
founded Marion Laboratories Inc. as a one-man company, operating
out of the basement of his home. Through mergers, the company later
became part of the former Marion Merrell Dow Inc. and Hoechst
Marion Roussel, which was part of Germany-based Hoechst AG.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman also was known for his philanthropy and for bringing
major league baseball back to Kansas City with the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The latest merger also hits Collegeville, Pa., where the
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer pharmaceutical unit has had extensive
operations. All 1,650 jobs at the Collegeville site will be moved
to other cities as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The merger became official after Rhone-Poulenc shareholders
backed the creation of shares to be exchanged for those of its
German partner. The new company will have more than $21 billion in
annual sales and leapfrog AstraZeneca PLC in becoming the world's
No. 1 drugmaker.

RYDER CUP TO REVISE DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each member of this year's U.S. Ryder Cup team will receive from
the PGA of America $200,000, which will be donated to charity and
to collegiate golf developmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   A Professional Golfers Association of America official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the plan calls for each
player and the captain Ben Crenshaw to receive $100,000 for the
charity of his choice. An additional $100,000 for Crenshaw and for
each player will be directed toward a college, or several colleges,
to finance a golf development program designed by the association.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement is expected to be made early next year,
once players have a chance to identify their charities. The plan is
similar to the one for the Presidents Cup, whose players each
receive $100,000 from the PGA Tour toward the charity of his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allocate Ryder Cup profits to the players'
charities for the first time comes in the aftermath of a
controversy this year concerning the tournament's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Golf Digest reported that the PGA was expected to gross $63
million from this year's Ryder Cup at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass. The net profit was expected to be $23 million,
with $6 million going to The Country Club. Meanwhile, a large
portion of the PGA profit goes toward its Ryder Cup Outreach
Program, which includes several projects aimed at promoting
interest and participation in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, most notably Tiger Woods, David Duval and Mark
O'Meara, strongly suggested that the Ryder Cup team members, who
are not paid to play, should have the right to designate revenue
from the biennial event toward the charities of their choice. Some
of them wanted the issue to be settled before this year's Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   During the PGA Championship last August, the debate became
heated. Two days before the tournament began in Medinah, Ill., team
members met with Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the PGA,
and Tim Finchem, commissioner of the PGA Tour, to devise a Ryder
Cup plan that would be satisfactory to the players and to the
association.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Awtrey said a plan would be in place by the
end of this year, but there were still some hard feelings. Some
players were strongly in favor of a revenue-for-charity plan. But
others insisted that the players should be worried more about
winning than about revenues, especially since the Ryder Cup did not
become a huge money maker until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Ryder Cup began in September, the issue was not a
distraction, and the event was memorable. The United States
defeated Europe, 14{-13{, overcoming a 10-6 deficit on Sunday to
stage the greatest final-day comeback in Ryder Cup history. The
event became even more compelling, and neither the players nor the
PGA of America wanted a dispute over revenue to linger for another
two years.  &QL;

CUBAN INMATES MAINTAIN TENSE HOSTAGE STANDOFF IN LOUISIANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ Nearly two decades after they were swept
ashore in the Mariel boatlift, a group of Cuban inmates is staging
a violent bid to be released or deported, holding three hostages at
knifepoint in a parish jail here.
</P>
<P>
   As many as nine inmates used hand-fashioned knives and sharpened
screwdrivers to overpower the jail warden and two deputies on
Monday afternoon, and the standoff showed no sign of easing by late
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates have apparently seized a control room of the St.
Martin Parish jail in the heart of Cajun country, because sheriff's
officials said they were unable to release or move the 80 prisoners
incarcerated elsewhere in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wednesday night marked the end of the 72-hour period
after which the inmates said they would kill their three hostages,
there was no sign that they had carried out their threat. As
heavily armed riot police surrounded the jail, FBI negotiators
continued trying to persuade the inmates to release their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the Cubans allowed 39 prisoners to leave the
jail, bringing to 90 the number of prisoners who have been allowed
to leave since the beginning of the incident. The action was
praised by Kriss Fortunato, an FBI spokeswoman, who also said the
hostages appeared to be in good condition. Ms. Fortunato would not
describe the progress of the negotiations, but said officials were
pleased that there was communication.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans' grievances are similar to those that have caused
numerous uprisings in Southern prisons and jails since 1980. ``All
we want to do is leave the country,'' one Cuban told a radio
station here.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will not release any
detainee who is deemed a threat to public safety, and though the
agency would like to return them to Cuba, the Castro government
will not let them back in.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, director of media relations for the immigration
service in Washington, said about 2,500 Cubans were in custody
around the country, many in small county jails like the one here.
About 1,750 of those came on the Mariel boatlift in 1980, during
which Fidel Castro sent hundreds of criminals to the United States,
and Bergeron said all of the 60 Cubans in the St. Martin jail
arrived then.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Bergeron said, the American government
has released 6,000 Cuban prisoners, including every detainee on the
Mariel boatlift. Any Mariel participant still in prison, he said,
has committed a crime in the United States and was then rearrested.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bergeron would not characterize the inmates who took
hostages, he repeated that all Cubans in the jail were Marielitos.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Longoria, a Cuban American lawyer in New Orleans who
has worked with many detainees around Louisiana, said the
frustration exhibited by the inmates was typical of those caught in
the political and legal limbo of detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be deported, and they can't be released,'' Longoria
said. ``Some of them have been in jail for years, and they see no
hope and no chance for liberty. They'll do anything to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   One inmate telephoned a local television station on Tuesday and
said he had been in jail for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be released and sent back to our country or any
other country,'' said the man, who identified himself as Jonne
Ponte. ``We don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service would not confirm the status of
individual prisoners or say on what charges they were being held.
But Bergeron said long-term prisoners could have their cases
reviewed every 90 days and were released if they could demonstrate
they had been rehabilitated or were no longer a threat to society.
Those still in prison, he said, are considered a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to gain by keeping them in jail,'' Bergeron
said. ``They are in custody because they have been convicted of
crimes, and we have to be judicious in determining who is
released.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubans being held in small-town jails around the country are
attractive to county governments because the immigration service
pays the counties an average of $55 a day for each prisoner, which
is more than the state pays for other criminals.

<P>
   Charles P. (Chuck) Colgan, a Philadelphia educator who had a
long association with rowing as an oarsman, coach and referee, died
on Nov. 30 at his home in Ardmore, Pa. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowing for the University of Pennsylvania and the Vesper Boat
Club in eights, fours and pairs, Colgan won numerous medals during
his college years, 1947 to 1950. He then went into coaching on a
part-time basis, at Columbia, Penn, LaSalle, St. Joseph's and
Vesper, and later served as a referee of intercollegiate races. He
also initiated rowing programs on the Schuylkill River in
Philadelphia for inner-city youths and for those with mental
disabilities.

REAL CAT PELTS USED FOR SOME CAT FIGURINES, INVESTIGATION FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ ``The smallest feline is a masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Leonardo da Vinci
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cats are held in high esteem in many
countries, especially in the United States. Do something bad to a
cat and you'll have an outraged cat fancier on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rick Swain, an official with the Humane Society of the
United States, boarded a plane two weeks ago to Kansas City, he
knew that he had information that would be explosive to legions of
cat lovers.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing to three Hallmark Cards executives, he laid out
the Humane Society's latest undercover investigation. The target:
those furry cat figurines that have become increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason that many of the figurines _ perhaps hundreds
of thousands _ looked so realistic. China was slaughtering cats and
using the pelts to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are appalled,'' said Michael W. Brim, a spokesman for the
Cat Fanciers' Association in New Jersey, a national registry of cat
breeds.
</P>
<P>
   The figurines were sold by retailers throughout the country. The
investigation determined at least a couple of Hallmark stores sold
them, which was one of the reasons for the Kansas City briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Humane Society found Hallmark blameless. The
company didn't know that real cat fur was being used, and the
figurines weren't a Hallmark product. Some Hallmark stores, which
are independently operated, had apparently bought some of the
figurines from outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger story stands, said Swain, vice president of
investigative services for the Humane Society. China is killing
hundreds of thousands of cats, and about 20 percent of the cat
figurines being sold in the United States are made with real cat
hides. The rest use fake fur, rabbit pelts or other materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't help but give you pause,'' said Steve Doyal,
Hallmark's vice president of communications and one of the
executives at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The details are horrific. The Humane Society investigation,
which included an undercover visit to one of the plants in China,
found that many cats were hanged and slowly suffocated, or clubbed
and allowed to bleed to death. On occasion, the cats were skinned
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five years of police work had not prepared me for the
level of cruelty I witnessed in China,'' Swain said.
</P>
<P>
   After the cats are stripped of their fur, the pelts are taken to
one of an estimated 20 factories. In the plant visited by the
investigator, stacks of orange and gray-tabby cat pelts were ready
to be made into figurines.
</P>
<P>
   The fur is stretched over molded plastic, and the figurines are
then finished by popping in plastic eyes and gluing on plastic
whiskers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is remarkably lifelike. Some of the cats appear to be
curled up and sleeping. Others have their paws playfully stuck up
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   And they're cheap. The Humane Society says a full-size cat
figurine costs no more than $35; some were found in the Kansas City
area for $12. A kitty figurine could be purchased for $6.
</P>
<P>
   The plant visited by the Humane Society was staffed mostly by
girls, some appearing to be no more than 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The use of child labor around the world has received plenty of
publicity in recent months. But many labor experts say very little
has actually changed, especially in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more surprised by the live cats than I am by the child
labor,'' said Judy Ancel, director of the Institute for Labor
Studies in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Some who bought the cats say they should have suspected
something was amiss. One area resident took one of the furry
figurines home, where her cat began to lick and groom it and even
played and went to sleep with it. She has put the figurine away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether to throw it away or bury it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Wolfe, owner of the Kitty Keepers pet-sitting service in
Shawnee, said that while shopping last week she saw one of the cat
figurines and petted it. The texture of the fur was similar to a
cat. But, she thought, how could it be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened my suspicions were correct,'' said Wolfe, who
didn't buy the figurine.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, the issue now is what to do with them. Some Osco
stores have sold the figurines that may have been made with cat
fur.
</P>
<P>
   The figurines were still on the shelves of at least one area
Osco store Tuesday evening. But Karen Ramos, an Osco spokeswoman,
said Wednesday that the figurines were being removed from stores,
and anyone who bought one could get a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a sensitive issue and potentially disturbing
to some people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark officials sent a letter about the figurines to all its
retailers last week. Although they aren't Hallmark products,
Hallmark urged them to stop selling the figurines and offered to
help pay refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Ferrel, owner of several area Hallmark stores, said he
found two of the figurines at his stores. He doesn't think they
were made from real cats, but he can't be sure, so he has
permanently taken them out of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in that kind of business'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swain said publicity would be the key to stop the selling of the
figurines. The Humane Society official believes retailers have
unknowingly sold them. As word spread, that shouldn't be an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Humane Society estimates that one out of five of the
figurines were made with real cat pelts, only an expensive forensic
test can tell. Swain's advice: Buy none of the furry figurines.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the lesson in all of this, say Wolfe, of Kitty
Keepers. If you want a furry cat, keep to the live ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer my fur to be living,'' she said.

METRO MATTERS: FORGET DIVERSITY, REPUBLICAN DEBATE IS A GUY THING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This column was going to focus on the absence of even
one remark about America's cities during Tuesday's Republican
presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Tuesday's debate was held in a farm state (Iowa), but if
the six candidates could intersperse pronouncements on the family
farm and ethanol subsidies with talk of trade with China and soft
money, presumably they could have given a nod to issues like
immigration, congestion, pollution and housing.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't, and now that unfortunate silence will not be
the subject of this column anyway, because an even more compelling
theme emerged from the debate:
</P>
<P>
   It was so very male.
</P>
<P>
   If MSNBC had broadcast the event in black and white, it could
have been Pleasantville, circa 1952. The candidates were men. The
questioners were men. The network analysts and campaign pitchmen
were men.
</P>
<P>
   No plot is herewith alleged; some of the evening's maleness was
coincidence. But the opinions voiced by the candidates were no
coincidence. And to fans of real debate and diversity, aspects of
those 90 minutes were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if nobody on that stage had ever heard of the gender
gap, as if anguished moderate Republicans had never called for a
broader range of party opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not talking about what is a woman's concerns, not
thinking, `What do women think about this?''' said Tanya Melich, a
disaffected Republican who wrote ``The Republican War Against
Women'' (1996, Bantam). The candidates spoke with one voice against
abortion, and where during any of the three debates, she asked, was
a serious discussion of other matters of particular concern to
women, like gun control and education?
</P>
<P>
   The debate began with Tom Brokaw's asking what had contributed
to the Columbine shootings, at one point saying ``things are a lot
worse off now'' than when President George Bush took office.
Actually, they are not. Despite the school shootings, FBI
statistics show that crime, including violent crime, has dropped
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates might have made that point. But instead
all spoke in dire terms about the country's terrible condition,
with back-runners Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Steve Forbes and
Alan Keyes citing the incidence of abortion as a contributing
factor. There was no discernible dissent from either of the two
front-runners, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   When Bauer asked Bush to pledge that he would never ask anyone
favoring abortion rights to be his running mate, singling out Gov.
Christie Whitman of New Jersey, Bush said he would name someone who
could be president. At no point did he or any of the other
candidates suggest that Whitman had a right to her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not abortion rights, yea or nay, or Republicans vs.
Democrats. It was just as disturbing a few years ago when
Democratic leaders in Albany, N.Y., opposed to a proposed ban on
late-term abortions, maneuvered to limit floor discussion. The
issue is the nature of our political debate, the pretense of the
candidates that there is no other side.
</P>
<P>
   For insight into that other side, the six candidates might pick
up a copy of ``In Our Time'' (The Dial Press), a new history of the
women's movement in which the author, Susan Brownmiller, recounts
women's harrowing search for illegal abortions in the days before
Roe vs. Wade. Ms. Brownmiller was resourceful and could afford to
pay enough to avoid a butcher. Other women could not; hence the
resort to coat hangers, often resulting in infections, sterility,
even death.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the candidates who oppose abortion have thought through
the likely ramifications of a constitutional amendment outlawing
abortions and concluded that they favor overturning Roe vs. Wade.
That is their right.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it also the obligation of the men running for
president to examine the complexity of this difficult matter?
Instead, viewers got either platitudes or silence from Bush and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Not all women favor abortion rights. Elizabeth Dole, who ran
briefly for the Republican nomination, does not. But even her
participation in that debate would probably have made a difference.
``They would have had to respond to someone of a different gender
sitting up there with them,'' Ms. Melich said. ``A different
dynamic occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no woman on the stage in Des Moines. In fact,
there was no woman _ just as there was no city _ in the mind of any
of the performers.

BILL WOULD CANCEL PARKING TICKETS OLDER THAN 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WENDY GINSBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Not long ago, Warren H. Victor reached into his
mailbox in Perth Amboy and pulled out a $169 bill from the city's
municipal court. A decade earlier, a meter reader had slapped his
car with a $1 ticket.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court's records, Victor had never paid the
dollar, and it had ballooned with penalties and interest into a
staggering fine and a court summons. ``I guess I was on my way to
jail,'' he said. But after a week rummaging through old files, he
found the dusty canceled $1 check that proved he had paid the
ticket on time.
</P>
<P>
   After Perth Amboy officials admitted their mistake, they offered
to take Victor to lunch. ``I told them to keep their lunch and get
their act together,'' he said. ``There are only three crimes in the
New Jersey that don't have a statute of limitations: murder, rape
and parking tickets. I knew something had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   So Victor turned the tables on municipalities that were slow or
sloppy in collecting parking fines. He found other New Jerseyans
who had been wrongly fined and began lobbying the Legislature to
step in. The result of that two-year campaign, he says, is a bill
that would excuse drivers from paying parking tickets that are more
than three years old.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was passed by the Senate on Dec. 6 and now
awaits a vote in the Assembly, also requires towns to notify
drivers by mail of overdue parking violations, and to warn them
that they could be arrested as scofflaws or have their licenses
suspended if they do not pay the fines.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's co-sponsor, Assemblywoman Joan Quigley, a Democrat of
Jersey City, said the idea is certainly popular. When she asked
constituents to relay their parking woes, her office was inundated
with mail for weeks.

MISSOURI PANEL APPROVES MERGER OF HARRAH'S AND PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYLAND HEIGHTS, Mo. _ Harrah's Entertainment Inc. took another
bite of the state gambling pie Wednesday, gaining approval from the
Missouri Gaming Commission for a merger with Players International
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If Harrah's gets approval from three other states, it will take
over two Players casinos in this St. Louis suburb and others
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's is battling with Station Casinos Inc. for market
supremacy in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas. Station has a bid
pending to buy the troubled Hilton Flamingo Casino in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's, with two casinos in North Kansas City, would bring in
more than 40 percent of the state's gambling revenue if the Players
merger is approved. State financial analysts said Harrah's had a
``strong financial picture'' but restated the need to closely
monitor the company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics called the $430 million merger part of a troubling
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Louisiana attorney general recommended
that Players lose its license after executives were caught up in a
casino licensing scheme that involved kickbacks to then-Gov. Edwin
Edwards and others.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of losing its license, the company is pursuing the
merger with Harrah's. However, Players must pay the state of
Louisiana $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, executive director of St. Louis-based Casino
Watch, said gambling companies were buying themselves off the hook
again.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and others criticized federal authorities for letting
Hilton executives avoid harsh sanctions if they sold the Flamingo.
Hilton agreed to pay a $500,000 fine to the federal government to
avoid criminal charges that it provided financial rewards to Kansas
City officials in exchange for political support for the casino
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This basically amounts to license laundering,'' Taylor said.
``These buyouts allow the companies to walk away clean. If you or I
had done these things, it wouldn't be that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a failed bid from financier Donald Trump, Hilton is
entertaining an offer from Station to buy the Flamingo. The
commission did not publicly discuss the pending offer Wednesday.
Station had hoped to complete the Flamingo acquisition by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also did not publicly discuss the status of
prominent St. Louis lawyer Michael Lazaroff, who resigned from his
law firm partnership earlier this month amid allegations of
misconduct. Lazaroff had represented Station on some gambling
issues in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, did come down hard on the Players
operations in Maryland Heights for recent violations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission suspended the gambling licenses of three
executives for three days for not reporting an employee's
allegation of theft in the casino's ``hard count'' room, where
tokens are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the commission fined Players $100,000 after a special
audit discovered 128 errors in counting money over a seven-month
period.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of Players' legal troubles in Louisiana, other
critics have called the buyouts a bad deal for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that fewer companies with licenses will move
Missouri's two major markets closer to a monopoly. That will
discourage the two key players, Station and Harrah's, from offering
promotions such as cut-rate coupons and high slot payouts, critics
fear.
</P>
<P>
   But Vern Jennings, senior vice president and general manager of
Harrah's St. Louis-Riverport, said the Station-Harrah's rivalry
would ensure that both companies keep customers in mind, even after
any acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep an eye on each other,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said he expected to retain nearly all the 2,500
employees at Harrah's and Players casinos in Maryland Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members quizzed Harrah's representatives about the
company's plans. The company plans to consolidate its four St.
Louis area casinos into two. Currently, the Harrah's and Players
casinos share the Riverport facility in Maryland Heights, about 20
miles west of downtown St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The merger still needs approval from gambling regulators in
Kentucky, Illinois and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In other action:
</P>
<P>
   - The commission struck a blow for gamblers by requiring casinos
to allow card counters to play blackjack. Some casinos nationwide
had tried to ban card counters from the table.
</P>
<P>
   When a player counts cards, he or she mentally keeps track of
what face cards have been dealt. That way, a player can determine
the likelihood of more face cards and adjust bets accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling industry has tried to curtail the practice.
</P>
<P>
   - The commission also levied a $15,000 fine against Bill Grace,
principal owner of St. Jo Frontier Casino in St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that on May 29, Grace verbally abused
security officers who were delaying patrons from boarding. Also,
Grace was disciplined for drinking wine at a restaurant that is
part of the casino's nongaming facilities. Grace did not submit a
written request to drink there, as state law requires.

   TWO CALIFORNIA MEN ACCUSED OF USING WEB TO LIFT STOCK
</P>
<P>
   In a case that shows both how easy it is to artificially inflate
the price of stocks on the Internet and how quickly prosecutors can
identify the culprits, two California men were charged with sending
bogus messages over the Internet to pump up the price of a bankrupt
company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that the men used the Internet to
artificially propel the price of an obscure stock from 15 cents a
share to more than $15 in less than two trading days last month,
reaping $364,000 in profits for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   MOODY'S INVESTORS TO BE SPUN OFF
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from investors to do something to increase value,
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet said that it intended to separate its Moody's
Investors Service credit-rating subsidiary and its operating
company into two publicly traded concerns. Stockholders reacted
positively to the news, sending shares of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet up
$2.6875, to $29.75.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY STOCKS RESUME RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft led the stock market higher, putting an end to a
one-day slump in high-technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 65.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,225.32. Broader
stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index increased 10.15 points, or 0.7 percent, to
1,413.32, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 50.29 points, or
1.4 percent, to 3,621.95.

   STUDY PRAISES PUSH FOR DIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   Despite their poor track record on hiring and promoting women

Civil Rights says.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN FOR TAX-FREE INTERNET ASSAILED
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to make the Internet a tax-free zone came under attack
by large retailers, shopping-center owners and state and local
officials in testimony before a panel created by Congress to study
the question.
</P>
<P>
   KMART IS TEAMING UP WITH YAHOO
</P>
<P>
   Kmart said that it was teaming up with the Internet portal
company Yahoo to create a new company that will provide free access
to the Internet and a co-branded shopping site. Floyd Hall, the
chairman and chief executive of Kmart, is looking to push the
company's lackluster Web store into the front ranks of e-commerce
competitors. Kmart is counting on Yahoo's popularity as well as a

SISTERS MAKE MOTHER'S WISH COME TRUE: KEEP FAMILY TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 5:30 p.m. in Bridgett Coburn's cozy _ some
might say cramped _ townhouse, it's dinnertime or homework time,
depending on which shift you are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell!'' Coburn yells from the kitchen stove while dishing
up fried chicken and fries to the older children, who eat at the
table. She steps over younger children, who use candy for
accounting to do math problems on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is that boy?'' Coburn, 29, asks anyone who will answer.
Aside from a shrug or two, nobody does. Too busy eating and
figuring.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn says with a sigh: ``I'm ready for the next crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 11 children are Coburn's. Two belong to her sister.
</P>
<P>
   And seven are her brothers and sisters, the adopted children of
her mother, Audrey Hamp, who died Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn and her sister, Belinda Coburn, 36, are faced with
fulfilling their mother's Christmas wish: Keep the children
together.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenging gift to give to their dead mother. The
daughters are both single, working mothers. Both live in
two-bedroom townhouses, and neither has a car.
</P>
<P>
   One gets up at 4:30 a.m. to drive a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   How can they take on seven more children?
</P>
<P>
   Because they both remember something their mother would say at
dinnertime, when there was too little food and too many mouths _
especially when stray children from the neighborhood would come
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord will provide,'' Audrey Hamp would say.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Hamp, 11, is thankful to his older sisters and knows his
mother would be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved us a lot and would want us to stay together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause to look at the floor, he added: ``I really miss
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the signs of her impending death were clear, the
older sisters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama was in a big hurry to get her Christmas shopping done
this year,'' Belinda Coburn said at the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she kept telling us what the kids wanted,'' Bridgett
Coburn added.
</P>
<P>
   Hamp, 53, died of congestive heart failure. She'd had the
children more than seven years. Some came to her as crack babies;
some had been abused. She turned them into a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've come a long way,'' Audrey Hamp told her daughters
before her death. ``If anything happens to me, /{please/}, don't
send them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``please'' was a nice touch, but unnecessary. Audrey Hamp
was a strong, forceful woman. The daughters took her plea not as a
request but as an order.
</P>
<P>
   Even in death, these girls aren't about to cross their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, they both said shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama wouldn't appreciate that,'' Belinda Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   So their small two-bedroom townhouses, across from each other in
Blue Valley Courts just off 23rd Street, went from crowded to
/{really/} crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgett Coburn, already with two daughters of her own, took the
four girls, ages 7 to 12. Belinda Coburn, mother of two sons, took
the three boys, ages 9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   After the holidays, they will both search for bigger places,
hopefully near each other.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they are making do. Children sleep two to a bed and
line up for the bathroom single file, just as at school. Clothes
hang in the basement because the closets are full.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters say it's easier to feed the whole bunch in one home
_ in shifts. That way, they can also help each other with homework.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cook, director of children and family services for
Catholic Charities in Kansas City, said such arrangements are
fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are situations all the time where relatives raise
children after a death,'' Cook said. ``A lot of families do this
and the state never gets involved _ as long as children thrive and
there's no abuse or neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are details that must be tended to.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance, for example.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Coburn sisters met with an attorney to ask
about keeping the children's Medicaid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For children to receive benefits, either from Medicaid or
private health insurance, the caretaker would probably have to be
named as a legal guardian, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters plan to do that. It's just another change along with
bigger dinners, more laundry and less hot water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a struggle because they are so young,'' said
Vivian Rogers, a longtime friend of Hamp. ``But their mother gave
them roots, and these are strong girls.''
</P>
<P>
   It's early, Belinda Coburn acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm enjoying these kids right now,'' she said. ``When I
take care of them, I feel my mama's love.''
</P>
<P>
   James Meador, pastor of Hosanna Missionary Baptist Church, lays
down a challenge: ``You can't find anybody who will say a bad thing
about Audrey Hamp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right up until she got sick,'' Meador said. ``Even when she
would carry the oxygen with her, she was ready to help someone who
needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those beautiful children...she had a special way with
children and you could see it in them.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently she was the type of mother who never grew tired
of the job.
</P>
<P>
   When her four children were raised and gone from home, she
opened her door to foster children.
</P>
<P>
   But that arrangement wasn't permanent enough for her. So she
adopted the children in her care.
</P>
<P>
   People would ask, ``You raised your kids _ why do you want
more?''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Hamp would smile.

   ``My blessing will go on,'' she would tell them.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be going on still. The children are healthy, do
well in school and they are ``Yes, sir,'' ``No, ma'am,'' ``Excuse
me'' kind of children.
</P>
<P>
   Older ones help the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Coburn, 13, Bridgett Coburn's daughter, says the new
arrangement has wrecked her hopes of getting a room of her own, but
that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how important is was to my Grandma for all the kids to
stick together,'' Tasha said.
</P>
<P>
   The children play together and study together. They stand in
line to brush their teeth and wash their faces.
</P>
<P>
   And at night before bed, they say their prayers. Perhaps they
give thanks for still being together.
</P>
<P>
   It was their mother's Christmas wish.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a gift that will last them a lifetime.

OWNER OF DAY CARE CENTERS IS ACCUSED OF OVERBILLING MEDICAID BY $62
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state attorney general on Wednesday accused the
owner of two adult day care centers in Brooklyn of illegally
billing the Medicaid program for invented or inflated services
totaling $62 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 21-count indictment, the owner, Lawrence
Friedman, 52, and two associates churned almost 1,000 elderly
people a day through the centers during the course of three years.
They arranged door-to-door transportation, meals and entertainment
for them and billed Medicaid for their medical care, even though
many of the patients were in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Using a range of inducements, Friedman's company, the Parkshore
Adult Health Care Center in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, lured
people, most of them Russian immigrants, to the centers,
prosecutors said. Once there, Friedman and his associates falsified
their medical records to make the registrants appear sicker,
provided them with door-to-door ambulette service that was not
medically necessary but for which the state paid. They also gave
elderly patients payments of $50, which the prosecutors called
kickbacks, for every friend they enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the staff asked participants to ``dress down'' to
conceal their good health from Department of Health inspectors, and
even took almost 200 of them to see a movie, ``Titanic,'' in March
1998 to evade inspectors, the indictment states.
</P>
<P>
   Adult day care, a popular and cost-effective alternative to
nursing home care, is intended to provide daily physical therapy
and rehabilitation to the frail or disabled elderly who can still
live independently. In New York state, adult day care providers can
bill up to 65 percent of the normal nursing-home rate.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman built up his scheme so quickly that since July
1996, his billings have grown from $500,000 a year to $47 million
now, as he continually increased the number of registrants and the
amount he billed per person, said Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney
general. In today's health marketplace, where an increase in
patients means an increase in profits, Friedman's two centers
accounted for a quarter of all state adult day-care billings.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman surrendered at the 69th Precinct in Canarsie and was
arraigned in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Wednesday, where bail was
set at $1 million. He pleaded not guilty. One of his lawyers, Randy
Mastro, a former deputy mayor, called him ``a respected businessman
and philanthropist, and a pillar of his community, who now stands
accused of crimes he did not commit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Friedman's facilities have been operated at all times in
full compliance with the applicable laws and regulations,'' Mastro
added.

RANGERS CRUSH KINGS, 8-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd was still filing into Madison Square Garden
as the first period was winding down. The game had a rare 7 o'clock
start, and as the fans hurried to their seats, they probably did a
double-take upon seeing the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rangers 6, Kings 0. Only 18 minutes 43 seconds had
elapsed, and the game was over. The Rangers went on to an 8-0 lead
in the second period and finally to an 8-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed to join in the fun. Todd Harvey and John MacLean
each doubled their previous season production with two goals. Tim
Taylor, Mike Knuble, Theo Fleury and Michael York scored the other
goals as all four lines contributed at least one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The power play, a sore point all season, even scored twice for
the first time in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Watching with glee at the other end of the ice was Mike Richter,
who turned aside 31 Los Angeles shots over the first two periods
before allowing three third-period goals in stretching his unbeaten
string to five (4-0-1). Not coincidentally, the Rangers' record
over that span is a season high. The Rangers evened their home
record at 7-7-1 and, over all, they are 11-14-1 with .500 again in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to look at the standings again,'' said Taylor, who
admitted it has been embarrassing for him to do so for much of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Rangers scored six goals in one period was
Dec. 26, 1998, in a 6-3 victory at Carolina. Not since Oct. 30,
1988 _ in a 9-2 rout of Pittsburgh _ had the Rangers scored six
first-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   The most goals the Rangers ever scored in a period was eight on
Nov. 21, 1971, in the third period of a 12-1 thrashing of the
former California Golden Seals. The last time the Rangers scored
eight unanswered goals was Nov. 25, 1992, in an 11-3 victory over
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   And to think Coach John Muckler was worried before the game that
his club might be a little rusty because it were coming off a
six-day break without a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great first period,'' he said. ``It was the best
first period we've played all year. We skated well, we moved well,
we created some great chances and we scored some power-play goals.
We seemed to have a lot of jump tonight in the first period.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Rangers were facing a Kings team that had
been taken apart, 7-1, by the New Jersey Devils the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings came in with a league-leading 22 points on
the road, they did not look like one of the National Hockey
League's bigger surprises this season on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr started in goal, less than 24 hours after he had
been yanked after allowing three goals in one period in New Jersey.
Storr fared even worse on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey opened the scoring at 4:58 of the first period. Eric
Lacroix and MacLean were awarded assists on the play, but the
biggest assist belonged to Kevin Stevens, who did everything but
score the goal himself.
</P>
<P>
   Parked in front of the net, Stevens had two Kings on him and his
stick between Storr's legs. He also had Storr screened. Harvey's
shot went through Stevens' stick, Storr's stick, Storr's skates and
in. And the Rangers led 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Taylor's goal at 13:45, the Rangers scored two
more goals in 38 seconds; three goals in 3:01; four goals in 4:01;
five goals in 4:58. In one stretch, the Rangers scored three goals
(their third, fourth and fifth) on three consecutive shots.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Rangers scored 6 goals on 17 shots against Storr,
who was again yanked after one period in favor of Stephane Fiset.
