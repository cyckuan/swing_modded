<HEADLINE> German President On Africa's Economic, Political Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German President
Roman Herzog today commended Africa for its progress in economic
development, saying that 21 nations in the continent have increased
their per capita income from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many people still regard Africa as a
continent "beset by hunger and misery, civil war and genocide".
</P>
<P>
The German president was speaking at a meeting organized by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) here.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, who arrived here on January 25 for a seven-day
official visit to Ethiopia, is currently on a three east
Africa-nation tour which has brought him to Uganda. He will also
visit Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Herzog said Africa had scored numerous
achievements in seeking peaceful solution to long-term conflicts,
and conducted free elections in pursuit of new political and
economic structures.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is in the process of taking its future into its own
hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said Germany's solidarity with Africa was reflected in,
among other things, development cooperation projects which have
so far cost more than 70 billion Marks (about 50 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"...we hope that...an exchange based on partnership benefiting
both sides will gradually take the place of the still widespread
donor-recipient mentality," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Germany strongly supported regional
cooperation in Africa because it was the best way of contributing
to stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for
Africa K. Y. Amoako, Ethiopian government officials and
ambassadors accredited to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Herzog said 40
percent of the bilateral and multilateral aid Germany extended
went to Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Germany's assistance to Africa has not dropped even after
unification (in 1990)," he added.

positions on this process, with the aim of reaching a fair an

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Breaks Silence On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's King Mswati
III today broke silence on a week-long strike and accused
organizers of the strike of attempting to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
In his first public comment on the strike, Mswati described
the strike as a sad event for Swaziland and warned that firm
action would be taken against anybody breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike was called by the Swaziland Federation
of Trade Unions (SFTU) on January 22, demanding for the lifting
of a 23-year-old ban on free political activity in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's economy and major cities including Mbabane and the
second largest City Manzini were paralyzed by the ongoing strike.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU had said the action would continue until the
government lifted a 23-year state of emergency, unbanned
political parties and restored the constitution scrapped by king
Sobhuza II in 1973.
</P>
<P>
However, King Mswati III, the only person with the power to
lift the 1973 decree, said he would call the Swazi nation
together to consult on political reform in the kingdom. He called
on the strikers to return to work.
</P>
<P>
Unionists, government delegates and business leaders held
discussions in a bid to find a solution before the strike entered
its second week.

NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Somali factions clashed
near the capital Mogadishu on Friday, killing 29 people and
wounding more than 60 others, according to a report reaching here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The fighting pitted militiamen loyal to faction leader General
Mohamed Farah Aideed against Rahanwein Resistance Army, which is
armed and supported by his rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in Harare
northeast of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Earliers reports said at least 70 people have been killed this
month in factional fighting in the Horn of Africa country.

Somalia has been without central government since rebels led
by Ali Mahdi and his former ally Aideed ousted late President
Mohamed Siad Barre in early 1991. The rebels later turned the
guns on each other in fighting which laid waste to the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Ulster Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew repeated today that all-party talks on the future
of Northern Ireland would not go ahead without an elected body in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Conservative conference in Scotland, Mayhew
declared Prime Minister John Major was still committed to the
all-party negotiations starting by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
But Mayhew reiterated the pre-condition for the negotiations
among the main parties in Ulster, saying that the Irish Republican
Army must start to decommission its weapons before the all-party
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Major called for elected body in Northern Ireland on January
24, few hours after the international commission in charge of arms
decommissioning in Ulster made public its report of arms
decommissioning process.
</P>
<P>
The international panel's report rejected the pre-condition
raised by the British government for all-party talks, maintaining
that the twin-track approach to the peace process in the troubled
province be carried out simultaneously, namely, some arms
decommissioning be considered during all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Major raised his elections notion as an alternative to
the report, insisting on his pre-condition.
</P>
<P>
This has caused a hot dispute between the British and Irish
governments. The latter has stressed that the international
commission's report must be materialized and all-party talks
should start by the end of Feburary without any conditions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Exchanges Benefit Macao, China's Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The growing exchanges between
Macao and China's mainland over the past decade have benefited
both sides in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
China's policy of reform and opening to the outside world has
greatly helped boost Macao's economic growth, local analysts said
at a recent seminar on economic exchanges between Macao and the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that since the early 1980s, a large amount of
capital, new technology and laborers have entered Macao following
the establishment of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone which
borders Macao.
</P>
<P>
Several leading company groups in Macao, like the Yangcheng and
the Nam Yeu, have all been originated from China's Guangdong
Province and are playing an important role in Macao's economic
life, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a leading profit-earning sector in Macao, also
benefited from economic growth in the Chinese mainland. More than
340,000 mainland citizens traveled to Macao between 1980 and 1994,
contributing to the boom of tourism in Macao over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Official figures from the Macao government show that in 1995
alone, the number of mainland tourists to Macao increased by 149
percent over 1994, ranking only after the number of Hong Kong and
Japanese tourists. But, a survey shows that mainland tourists did
the largest share of shopping in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 70 percent of the investment in real
estate industry in Macao come from China's mainland, especially,
the Pearl River Delta (PRD) centering Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tao Kueng, a scholar from the Macao Economic Sciences
Society, said at the seminar that many Macao businessmen have
helped the PRD by resettling their factories in the mainland, due
to its cheap cost of laborers.
</P>
<P>
As joint ventures were established, Macao businessmen brought
with them capital, technology and new way of management, which
enhanced economic development of China's local industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's mainland remains a leading import market for
Macao, as farm produces, daily-use goods and garments produced in
the mainland are well sold in Macao. Macao also serves as an
entrepot trade center for mainland products.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao in
1999, said Yang, the exchanges between the mainland, Hong Kong and
Macao are expected to be increased.
</P>
<P>
The three can cooperate on a wide range of issues, such as in
major projects, finance, labor, information service and education,
he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Veteran Sentenced to Five Years in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- An American Vietnam War veteran
was sentenced today to five years in prison by a Vietnamese court
in Haiphong for bringing weapons and ammunition into the country.
</P>
<P>
Everett Sennholz, 45, was also fined 140 million dong (12,700
U.S. dollars) for attempting to bring in 23 banned videotapes and
24 banned books.
</P>
<P>
Sennholz was arrested in August when a .30-caliber Savage rifle
was found in a shipment of household goods arriving in the port
city of Haiphong, 160 kilometers southeast of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The court heard he had concealed two rifles beneath a false
trunk bottom and stuffed hundreds of bullets into jacket and
trouser pockets and boots.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day-long trial, Sennholz admitted he had done
wrong and would accept whatever punishment the court decided. But
he insisted the two rifles were used only for hunting.
</P>
<P>
It was the second public trial of Americans in Vietnam since
Hanoi began further opening its economy to the outside world after
the normalization of the Vietnamese-U.S. relations last July.
</P>
<P>
The court said some of the books and video films Sennholz had
brought in "blackened" the country's name and distorted the
history of the war U.S. forces fought in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"If not discovered, they would have greatly affected social
safety and order, and the Vietnamese people's traditions and
customs," said Judge Nguyen Van Canh.
</P>
<P>
Sennholz's act "has violated national security. Military
weapons in Vietnam are only owned by the armed forces ... They may
be tools of crime. It may seriously affect the safety and order of
society," Canh said in an hour-long prepared verdict.
</P>
<P>
Sennholz, a self-employed tax consultant from Puyallup,
Washington, said he had visited Vietnam for five times since 1992
and was planning to marry a Vietnamese woman, settle in Haiphong,
teach English and live a peaceful life.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. diplomats and a number of international journalists
attended the court.
</P>
<P>
Two Vietnam-born Americans were sentenced by Vietnam to four
and seven years in prison last August and expelled out of the
country two months later.

NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus meets all five criteria
set by the Maastricht Treaty, Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on European Union (EU) customs
procedures, Christodoulou said, "Cyprus complies fully with all
the five criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, and certainly meets
the demands of the three main criteria on the public deficit,
public debt and inflation."
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus' public deficit was limited to 1.3 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), public debt ranged around 54
percent of the GDP and inflation dropped to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the government remained firm in achieving
its three main priorities, which are part and parcel of Cyprus'
efforts to find a just and viable solution of the Cyprus
question.
</P>
<P>
He cited the implementation of the joint Greco-Cypriot defense
pact, full EU membership and the maintenance of economic
stability as the main government objectives.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for the full EU membership in July 1990. It
signed an association agreement with the EC in 1972. In October
1987, it signed a customs union agreement.

JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
qualified for the semifinals of the 20th African Cup of Nations
after a 2-1 victory over Algeria in the quarterfinal match here.
</P>
<P>
The match took place at the First National Bank Stadium on the
outskirts of Johannesburg. About 70,000 soccer fans watched the
game despite the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The first half of the game was a goalless draw.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's two goals were scored by defender Mark Fish in
the 72nd minute and striker John Mashoeu in the 85th minute,
while Algeria's goal was scored by defender Tarek Lazizi in the
84th minute with a header.
</P>
<P>
During the first half, South Africa attacked for all they were
worth, while Algeria's desert warriors were content to stay back,
hoping to catch the opposition on the counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa could have gone ahead in the game when
referee Bujsaim Ali of the United Arab Emirates awarded South
Africa a penalty when Lazizi held onto Phil Masinga in the box.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Doctor Khumalo stepped up, but unfortunately he
hit a powder-puff shot which goalkeeper Muhamed Haniched saved
diving to his right.
</P>
<P>
The 20th African Cup of Nations soccer tournament kicked off
in Johannesburg on January 13. Fifteen African soccer team
participated in the continent's biggest sport event while the
defending championship Nigeria withdrew from the game.

<P>
New York state's population fell by about 17,000 people to
18,136,000 from July 1, 1994, to July 1, 1995. It was one of only
two states whose population dropped, according to the United
States Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The other was Rhode Island, whose population declined by about
5,000 people, to 990,000.
</P>
<P>
The population decline in New York was the first for the state
in two decades.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the population decline to the fact that
an estimated 219,000 people moved out of New York to other states,
and that the "outmigration" was greater than the number of new
comers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia National Farmers
Union (ZNFU) today welcomed measures announced in the 1996 budget
to boost the country's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU Executive Director George Gray said in a statement that
the new budget contains a number of measures that will assist
agricultural expansion.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of zero-rate of the Value Added Tax (VAT) for
agricultural products will allow farmers to claim back the VAT
they have been so far forced to pay on machinery, spare parts,
fuel and other inputs, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
The measure will reduce crop input costs by an average of five
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the VAT and import duties in the new budget will
benefit farmers, specially commercial farmers in the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Union will work closely with the Zambia Revenue Authority
to see if the introduction date can be brought forward, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, which Finance Minister Ronald Penza
presented to parliament on Friday, the zero-rate of the VAT for
agricultural products will take effect in July this year.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
said today it was surprised at the U.S. announcement that
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was invited to visit
Moscow by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Karasin, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry,
said Christopher would pay an official visit to Moscow in March at
the invitation of new Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, not
Yeltsin, as the U.S. State Department had announced.
</P>
<P>
The invitation from Yeltsin was untrue and the Foreign Ministry
was surprised at Washington's errors, said Karasin.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that it is only the Russian Foregin Minister
who is authorized to invite the (U.S.) Secretary of State to
official talks, which is exactly what was done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karasin added that the two countries' top diplomats have agreed
to hold a brief working meeting in Finland on February 10-11, but
the venue would be a quieter place rather than Finland's capital
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Karasin also expressed the hope that the U.S. administration
will be more particular about its public commentaries in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was appointed earlier this month to succeed Yeltsin's
more pro-Western foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that Russia has weathered an economic crisis and
entered a period of stabilization.
</P>
<P>
When visiting a "Russkoye Bistro" cafe construction site in
downtown Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters, "the crisis period in the
economy (of Russia) is over. We have just passed the peak of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
"Stabilization is on the way. Construction, industry, finance
and the social sectors are reviving," he said.
</P>
<P>
The life of people in the country was improving, so was the
people's attitude towards the market economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If construction is going on in the country, the country is
reviving," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The president ended a major government reshuffle Friday, in
which Vladimir Kadannikov, director of the Volga Car Plant,
replaced Anatoly Chubais as the first deputy prime minister in
charge of Russia's macro-economic policy and privatization
process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate has ratified
the U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II),
opening the way for radically reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals from present levels.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by former U.S. President George Bush and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in January 1993, was approved
overwhelmingly by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration officials hailed the 87 to 4 Senate vote
on the arms reduction treaty as a major foreign policy success.
Ratification of the accord had been held up in the U.S. Senate for
months because of Republican attempts to link the issue to
proposed cuts in U.S. foreign policy spending.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed the hope in an telephone
conversation with Yeltsin earlier Friday that the U.S. Senate move
will prompt the Russian Duma (parliament) to take the same action.
</P>
<P>
The START II requires the United States and Russia to reduce
their strategic arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 nuclear
weapons each by 2003, cutting some two thirds of the Cold War
levels.

<HEADLINE> Food Convoy Reaches Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A 150-truck food convoy
reached Kabul today, bringing a relief to the residents who are
facing an unprecedented food shortage due to the blockade of
supply roads.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, carrying wheat flour, rice, fuel and sugar, had
been waiting to enter the city for 13 days, a report from Kabul
said.
</P>
<P>
"This convoy will reduce the people's starvation for two or
three weeks and has caused a reduction of 35 percent on the wheat
flour price and 20 percent on other commodities prices," Mohammad
Dawood Qureshi, a local market dealer, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The last supply road to Kabul was cut off by the Hezb-i-Islami
of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar due to an intra-factional dispute over road
taxes, resulting in a price hike and shortage of staple food and
fuel in the besieged city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) warned that Kabul residents are facing an unprecedented
crisis as the food shortage problem got worsened in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of bakeries were forced to shut their doors as they
ran out of flour for bread.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is now extremely critical and has reached a
point that has never before been seen in Kabul," said a top ICRC
official.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also warned of a humanitarian catastrophe as
supplies are running out.

MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A collective peace-keeping
forces from the member countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) along the Tajik-Afghan border should be

</P>
<P>
The defense minister, expected to meet top Tajik leaders

<HEADLINE> Inflation To Rise By June In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government's
target to reduce inflation to 17 percent by June this year from
25.9 percent last month was impossible and it expected to rise
even further due to recent price increases, economists have said.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation will not fall in the first quarter of this year as
expected, if anying, it will rise before stabilizing in the
second half of the year," the Zimbabwe national news agency today
quoted Chief Economist at the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe Danny
Dube as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably increase to 26-27 percent before falling and
the target of cutting inflation to 17 percent by mid-year is just
impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government, under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund to restore macro-economic stability,
last year pledged to take measures to reduce inflation to 17
percent by mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
Dube said recent price and sales tax increases would make it
impossible to reduce inflation, which once soared to over 40
percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Consultant economist John Robertson also said that it was
"quite impossible" for inflation to fall to 17 percent by June.
But inflation was unlikely to rise at a faster rate than it did
last year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Denies Meeting Drug Cartel Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
Presidency today denied a new charge against President Ernesto
Samper, which accused him of meeting a Cali drug cartel envoy last
year.
</P>
<P>
Santiago Medina, treasurer of the Liberal Party during the 1994
presidential campaign, alleged that President Samper held talks
with an emissary from Cali cartel, the world's biggest cocaine
syndicate, on September 4 last year when he attended the Rio Group
summit in Quito, capital of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer, who was arrested last July on charge of
illegally accumulating wealth, made the remark in an interview
with the Spanish-language service of Cable News Network (CNN)
today.
</P>
<P>
Medina said Samper, as a Liberal Party candidate for presidency
in the 1994 elections, had personally agreed to let him take
millions of U.S. dollars from the drug cartel for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Medina alleged that Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Pardo, both the party's campaign leaders at that
time, had "perfect knowledge" about what had happened.
</P>
<P>
However, the Presidency dismissed Medina's allegation as
"absurd, libelous and odious."
</P>
<P>
It said President Samper has demanded an explanation from the
National Prosecutor General Alfonso Valdivieso on how Medina could
receive such an interview during his detention.

<P>
SOFIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Irina Slutskaya, a 16-year-old
Russian, took the women's title at the European Figure Skating
Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian teenager upset the pre-tournament favourite Surya
Bonaly's attempt and ended the Frenchwoman's dream of winning her
sixth consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
It was the first title for a Russian or former Soviet
individual woman in either the European or world championships.
</P>
<P>
Slutskaya, last year's world junior champion, had an
outstanding routine with six triple jumps, including two in
combination.
</P>
<P>
She also punctuated her routine with several variations of
spins that none of the top contenders could match.
</P>
<P>
Bonaly, hoping to tie Sonja Henie and Katarina Witt as a
six-time European winner, went down on a triple toe loop and did
only five triple jumps with three clean landings, having to settle
for the silver.
</P>
<P>
The bronze went to Maria Butyrskaya of Russia, who fell on one
jump and scaled down two others.
</P>
<P>
The championships ended with the Russians sweeping seven out of
12 golds.
</P>
<P>
The International Skating Union handed out cash rewards for the
first time at these championshipswith individual winners getting
20,000 U.S. dollars and pairs and ice dance titlists sharing 30,000.
</P>
<P>
The next European championships are in Paris on January 19 to
26 next year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sees "Second Honeymoon" With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today described his overnight telephone conversation with
U.S. President Bill Clinton as "the second wedding journey."
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said the one-hour conversation
focused on bilateral relations and a number of international
issues in "a calm and friendly tone."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Kremlin had an impression that "the honeymoon in
the Russian-U.S. relations was over," the Russian President told
reporters that he would describe the conversation as "the second
wedding journey."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to remind of the fact that there was a peak in
the Russian-U.S. relations which was followed by a certain pause,"
Yeltsin said, explaining that this was connected with his "rather
continuous illness."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he remains "true" to his "friend" Clinton, adding
that the U.S. President also confirmed on Friday night that he
"stayed true to our relations."
</P>
<P>
"Russia will protect its state interests the way the United
States protects its own interests. And we shall interact with the
United States on a parity basis. Bill Clinton has agreed with me,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin promised to urge the Russian parliament to quickly
ratify the START-II treaty, which the U.S. Senate passed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty envisages the reduction by the U.S. and Russia of
strategic nuclear weapons by two-thirds compared with their
stockpiles at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a chance to save a lot of funds and allocate the
money to social needs," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted speculations in both Washington and Moscow that
Russia had began to depart from reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no departure from reforms," he said, adding that
"I have reiterated this to Bill Clinton."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that he and Clinton had discussed the problem
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We are against NATO's expansion," Yeltsin said, noting that
President Clinton has agreed to thoroughly study Moscow's
position.

of Europe's decision to admit Russia on Thursday, Hungarian
Foreign Minister Kovacs Laszlo said today.

<P>
In an interview with the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Hirlap,
Kovacs said the maximum Russian participation in the European
cooperation system was one of the prerequisites to guarantee
security and stability in Europe.

The isolation of a country, especially a big power like Russia,
could only play a negative role, he added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM: Economic Growth Rate Should Triple Population Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today that the economic growth rate in Egypt
should be raised to triple the population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the government's policy statement before the
People's Assembly (Parliament), Ganzouri said that development and
production is one of the main challenges facing Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that it would work to increase the
annual growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) from 3.5 to
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last December, however, the Central Bank of Egypt put the
country's economic growth rate in the 1994-95 fiscal year at 4.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that no less than 500,000 job
opportunities should be provided annually, stressing that the
government is concerned with raising the people's living standards
and easing their burdens.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the government will provide necessary
facilities to investors and guarantee their rights.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has vowed to remove all obstacles hindering investments,
which the government believes to be very important in developing
the country's economy and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, foreign investments in Egypt stood at only about 400
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri was appointed prime minister earlier this month and
formed a cabinet with seven new faces.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle has been believed to be aimed at
quickening the pace of the country's economic reform and bettering
the economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri's predecessor Atef Sedki, who had remained in office
for nine years, has won praises for reforming Egypt's monetary
system by stabilizing foreign exchange rates and ending black
market dealings.
</P>
<P>
But he has failed to encourage investments sufficiently and
solve the problem of unemployment, observers said. The
unemployment rate is 7 percent according to recent official media
reports, but Western economists have put it at up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri called on politicians and members of various parties
to have constructive dialogue to serve the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government aims to realize Arab
conciliation and strengthen Egypt's relations with regional and
international groupings, which he described as "the real
challenge" facing the Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will continue to pursue peace and stability in the region
until a just and overall peace has been realized, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Sell Wheat to Albania at Preferential Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia will provide Albania
with 12,000 tons of wheat at a preferential price, announced
Lorenc Ligori, spokesman for the Albanian government today.
</P>
<P>
Albania is in a serious short supply of flour and bread as a
result of a decline in wheat import caused by wheat price rises on
the world market. One-third of Albania's need for wheat has been
relying on imports and foreign aid since the second half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country is negotiating with the European Union and other
countries over the purchase of wheat and flour at a preferential
price.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, which is bordering Albania, produced 360,000 tons of
wheat last year. The record high output is enough for the
country's domestic need for one and a half years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) today warned that Kabul residents are
facing an unprecedented crisis as the food shortage problem got
worsened in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of bakeries were forced to shut their doors as they
ran out of wheat flour for bread, a report from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is now extremely critical and has reached a
point that has never before been seen in Kabul," said a top ICRC
official.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst winter in four years here and the cold
combined with the total road blockade has exhausted the people's
coping mechanisms, leaving them very cold and hungry," the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The last supply road to Kabul was cut off by the Hezb-i-Islami
of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar 13 days ago due to an intra-factional
dispute over road taxes, resulting in a price hike and shortage of
staple food and fuel in the besieged city.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations earlier also warned of a humanitarian
catastrophe as supplies are running out.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Affirms Abduction of French Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni official sources have
affirmed the kidnapping of a group of French tourists, according
to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
A gang abducted the French nationals Thursday during their
visit to Maarib Province, some 200 kilometers east of Sanaa,
Yemeni reliable sources told the Yemeni Saba News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency carried a terse announcement today, saying the
number of hostages was 16.
</P>
<P>
Saba's report said security units "have taken the necessary
measures and are on the trail of the criminals... in order to free
the French tourists and guarantee their safety."
</P>
<P>
It described the abductors as "a gang of saboteurs."
</P>
<P>
According to official sources in Maarib, the hostages have been
moved to Ma'en, a mountainous region some 500 kilometers southeast
of Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the abductors belong to the Al Aslam tribe and
confirmed they were demanding the release of a relative jailed for
kidnapping an American oilman working in Yemen last September.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni security forces have besieged the village where some
tribe men hold the hostages and are currently conducting talks
with them to release the French tourists, a responsible source
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said 17 Frenchmen have been
kidnapped by a Yemeni tribe demanding Sanaa release a jailed
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said, "Apparently they have been
well-treated. Our ambassador is in contact with the Yemeni
authorities."
</P>
<P>
Such kidnappings are common in Yemen. In the past two years,
more than 200 foreigners have been grabbed by tribesmen seeking to
publicize their demands from the government. All hostages were
treated well and released safely.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government to Ensure Implementation of Policies Concerning  Hong Kong: Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng reiterated
today that the Chinese government will not change its principle
and policies concerning Hong Kong and do its utmost to ensure the
implementation of relevant principles and policies to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet given in honor of all members of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Li said that to prepare the establishment of the
Hong Kong SAR, it is essential to implement to the letter the
principle of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
He said that since the signing of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, no matter what changes have taken place in the
international and domestic situations, and no matter what
obstacles have cropped up in the Sino-British relations on the
Hong Kong issue, "the Chinese government has unswervingly adhered
to the basic principle and special policies towards Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the State Council, the premier expressed sincere
congratulations on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee
and extended warm welcome to all members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the establishment of the Preparatory Committee is a
historic event, which demonstrated that the work of the Chinese
government to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong
Kong has entered a new phase, thus constituting a new milestone
for Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are delighted to see that the number of Hong Kong
members on the Preparatory Committee is more than 2.5 times that
on the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Preparatory Committee shoulder an arduous task
in making preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that all members of the committee will
make concerted efforts to accomplish the sacred mission entrusted
to them by history.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li said that while meeting with the members of a
delegation from the Better Hong Kong Foundation recently, he
clarified that after 1997 there will be no relation of
subordination between all departments of the central government
and various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the central government, and the Hong Kong
SAR. Exchanges and cooperation between them will be carried out in
accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems" and
the relevant stipulations in the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will tighten management in this
regard," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, vice-chairman of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), cited the establishment of the Preparatory Committee
for the Hong Kong SAR of the National People's Congress as a
historic event, which, he said, signifies that China's resumption
of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong has entered a new stage.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of the First Plenary
Session of the Preparatory Committee, he said that according to
the "Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method for
the Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region" within the
year 1996, the National People's Congress (NPC) shall establish a
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, which shall be held responsible for preparing the
establishment of the Region.
</P>
<P>
As an organ of authority and a working organ, the Preparatory
Committee will carry out work and accelerate implementation in
line with the Basic Law and the relevant decisions adopted at the
NPC, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, a press communique of the First
Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee and the committee's
work rules were also issued.
</P>
<P>
When asked on the Sino-British co-operation, Chen replied that
the Chinese government will, as always, adhere to the principle of
"taking ourselves as the mainstay" on the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
After Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's
visit to Britain last October and British Foreign Secretary
Rifkind's trip to Beijing this year, he noted, some fresh progress
has been made on the issue. "For this, we express our welcome, as
it is in the interests of both sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of establishing the post of the chief executive of
the Hong Kong SAR, he added, the first chief executive candidate
shall be nominated and elected based on recommendations by the
Selection Committee, composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong
residents, through local consultations, and then the
candidate-elect will be reported to the central people's
government for appointment, according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Preparatory Committee stressed on giving full
scope to carrying out democracy and soliciting in an extensive way
opinions of people from various sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Preparatory Committee, who participate in the
work of the committee in their own capacities, will not represent
any political or social organization, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sixth Party Discipline Inspection Session Issues Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth Plenary Session of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, which ended here in Beijing today, issued a
communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that participants in the session agreed
that under the new domestic and international situation, it is of
great importance to further strengthen the Party building and
improve its internal self-checking mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that the correct and timely handling of
the former Beijing Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen case and the former
secretary of Beijing Municipal Party Committee Chen Xitong case
has given a big push to the country's campaign to fight corruption
and build a clean government.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the fight against corruption has scored notable
progress, but some problems still exist, as some leading officials
do not have a correct understanding of the importance and urgency
of the anti-corruption drive, corruption continues to occur in
some places and some unhealthy tendencies are resurging.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the communique said the task to fight corruption is still
demanding and arduous.
</P>
<P>
The demand for the 1996 effort to fight corruption, the
communique said, is to further deepen the campaign to fight
corruption around the central task of the economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed that the CPC Central Committee's
authority must be safeguarded and the regional protectionism
should be opposed in a bid to ensure the smooth implementation of
the Central Committee's policies and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the important policy decisions, appointment
and dismissal of important officials, undertaking of major
projects and use of large sums of of money should be decided by
the collective.
</P>
<P>
Resolute efforts must be made to oppose liberalism and all the
acts to undermine the Party's unity must be timely and seriously
dealt with, the communique said, adding that further efforts
should be made to investigate major corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The communique also urged the Party committees and governments
at all levels to strengthen their leadership over the work to
fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu
Huaqing, Hu Jintao and 98 members of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection attended the session which opened here
January 24.

CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that setting up a Palestinian state is the
solution to the Palestinian problem.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting between visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Moussa told reporters

Moussa, who attended the meeting, said that Mubarak and Arafat
discussed a number of issues pertaining to the latest developments
on the Palestinian track of the Middle East peace process in the
light of the first Palestinian elections held last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here this morning on his first visit to
Egypt since he was elected president of the Palestinian Authority,
briefed Mubarak on the outcome of his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres Wednesday.

the future of Jerusalem and the Jewish settlements and the return
of Palestinian refugees.

Earlier this week, Arafat said he believes a Palestinian state
can be set up within 18 months as a result of negotiations with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Knesset Member: Israel's Threat to Suspend Talks with Palestinians Aims to Woo Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's threat to suspend peace
talks with the Palestinian side if the latter does not amend its
National Charter aims to woo the Israeli public, a member of the
Israeli Knesset (Parliament) has said.
</P>
<P>
Teleb Al Sanei, also deputy head of the Arab Democratic Party,
told Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio that Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres wants to use the threat to attract
the largest number of votes in the Israeli general elections
scheduled for October this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview aired today, Sanei criticized the Israeli
government's policy regarding the Palestinian-Israeli talks on the
final peace settlement which are to begin in May.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that peace is a requisite for both Israel and the
Palestinians, and is equally in the interest of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel has warned that if Arafat reneges on its promise to
revoke by April sections in the PLO Charter that call for Israel's
destruction, the peacemaking will end altogether.
</P>
<P>
Arafat needs a two-thirds majority in the 483-member
Palestinian National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, to get parts of the Charter revoked.

heavy snow for over two weeks after months of blizzards in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
"No deaths have been reported," a provincial government

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Preparatory Committee's First Plenum Closes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He pointed out that in the course of preparing for the setting
up of the Hong Kong SAR, contradictions between partial interests
and interests of the whole and between immediate interests and
long-term interests may occur on some specific matters.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the committee members will, when
voicing their opinions, show concern for and be acquainted with
the interests of all social quarters and that when taking part in
making decisions, they should have in mind whether they are
beneficial to the national interests and Hong Kong's overall and
long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the preparatory committee win trust from
the Hong Kong people and live up to the expectations of the entire
Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Qian stressed, the preparatory committee should give
full scope to democracy, extensively solicit opinions from Hong
Kong people and further implement the principle of "catering to
the Hong Kong people and relying on them."
</P>
<P>
The rules governing the work of the committee approved at the
plenum stipulate that the committee should adopt the collective
responsibility system and the principle of maintaining secrecy.
</P>
<P>
What especially needs to be noticed is that it is not
contradictory but supplementary to each other for the Preparatory
Committee to implement the systems of collective responsibility
and keeping secrecy on one hand and for the committee to give full
scope to democracy and for its members to voice their opinions
fully and solicit opinions from the Hong Kong people on an
extensive scale on the other, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the adoption of the systems, which is determined
by the character of the preparatory committee as a power organ and
working organ of the state, is precisely able to ensure that
committee members speak their minds freely within the committee.
</P>
<P>
He added that since preparations for the establishment of the
HK SAR is an important matter that concerns the common interests
of the six million Hong Kong people, the committee should listen
to the views from all social strata of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the preparatory committee should make every
decision on the basis of extensively soliciting opinions from the
Hong Kong people, adding that in Hong Kong, it is essential to
conduct consultancies on the opinions of the local Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to institute a press release system so
as to keep the Hong Kong people abreast with the work of the
preparatory committee and maintain the committee's close
connections with the Hong Kong people through prompt, necessary
and accurate news release.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that another task of the committee
members is to arouse the Hong Kong residents for more involvement.
</P>
<P>
A press communique was adopted at the end of today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following the plenary session, Lu Ping, vice-chairman and
secretary-general of the preparatory committee, called a working
meeting to discuss the specific work for the next stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The first plenary session of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) closed at the Great Hall of the People here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session discussed the rules governing the work of
the Preparatory Committee and confirmed the formation of six
working panels, namely -- the Selection Committee Panel, the First
Chief Executive Panel, the Provisional Legislative Council Panel,
Economy Panel, Law Panel and Celebration Activity Panel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the close session, Qian Qichen, vice-premier and
chairman of the Preparatory Committee, described the convention of
the meeting as the prelude to the formation of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Preparatory Committee have discussed how to make
preparations better still and raised a lot of constructive
suggestions, centered on the work of the Preparatory
Committee. The set agenda has been accomplished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian outlined three requirements for the work of the
Preparatory Committee:
</P>
<P>
First, Implement the principle of "one country, two systems"
in strict accordance with the HK SAR Basic Law and relevant
decisions adopted by the National People's Congress (NPC) and its
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We should, first of all, be clear, ideologically, on what kind
of a special administrative region is to be built, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
To be brief, he noted, it should be a special administrative
region with a high degree of autonomy where the principle of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
will be implemented and it should a special administrative region
with the social system and way of life remaining basically
unchanged under the prerequisite of embodying state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The specifications contained in the Basic Law and relevant
decisions of the NPC and its Standing Committee are the legal
basis for all work in building the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The principle to be adhered to is that all matters prescribed
by the Basic Law and relevant decisions adopted by the NPC and its
Standing Committee will be implemented in real earnest and
down-to-earth manner. Views for disposal should be set forth
concerning those without distinct speculations and guidelines in
line with the principle of the Basic Law and relevant decisions,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
This is what has been done by the Preliminary Working Committee
and is still to be followed by the Preparatory Committee, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, proceeding from the principle of loving both the
motherland and Hong Kong and fostering the concept of taking into
account the interests of the whole.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory Committee is engaged in the work of making
preparations for the establishment of the HK SAR on behalf of the
state. As its members, they should base themselves on the overall
interests of the state and Hong Kong when they participate in
decision-making and exercise their functions and powers.

<HEADLINE> Major Confident of Single Currency Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major is becoming more and more confident that the European single
currency project could be postponed or even abandoned, a senior
government minister confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) government leaders might decide this
year to postpone the 1999 starting date for the European Monetary
Union (EMU) until 2000 or 2001, the Financial Times newspaper
quoted the minister close to Major as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the conviction that this could be the prelude
to an even longer postponement and possibly to the collapse of the
EMU as an ideal.
</P>
<P>
"A decision could be made at one of the EU summits in June or
December this year and it would certainly seem sensible not to let
it drag on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that around three-quarters of cabinet
ministers were "not attracted to a single currency" and senior
Tories have been lobbying Major to give a pledge to hold a
national referendum on the country's EMU membership.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Major was not expected to issue a formal
statement urging postponement of the EMU, because this would
certainly antagonize other EU member states, which were striving
to ensure their economies meet the single currency convergence
criteria.

Macao has a total population of about 400,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the higher unemployment rate was the
result of an economic slowdown. They also stressed that most of
the unemployed are aged, have poor education or are not skillful.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that the government will
continue to pose restrictions on the use of foreign laborers in
Macao.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Norway Down in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Norway's unemployment rate in
1995 dropped to below 4 percent for the first time since 1988,
according to statistics from Norway's labor pool survey.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1995, 88,000 people were out of work,
accounting for 3.8 percent of the country's labor pool and 18,000
fewer than the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Employment increased in most industries, with the highest
growth seen in retail sales and in the hotel and restaurant sector.
</P>
<P>
The direct reasons for the decrease in unemployment were
Norway's strong economy and stable political situation.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic boom is attributed to large-scale oil
drilling over the last 20 years. Rich oil resources in the
Atlantic Ocean off the country's east coast have helped its 4.3
million people stand among the world's richest.

<HEADLINE> Fiji to Continue Peace-Keeping Efforts in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni
Rabuka stressed in a southern Lebanese village Friday that his
country will continue its support and its participation in the
multinational peace-keeping force operating in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that a progress on the Syrian track will positively
reflect on the Lebanese track and will open a door for an Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon in compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure from this country, the Fiji Prime
Minister had a meeting last night with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi in the Beirut Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources close to the president announced that
the talks dealt with bilateral relations between the two
countries, the situation of the Fiji contingent deployed in South
Lebanon within the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), as well
as the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka inspected Friday morning an area in South Lebanon where
the Fiji contingent is operating within the framework of the
UNIFIL, which was sent to the South Lebanon in 1978 following a
large-scale Israeli invasion into the area.
</P>
<P>
He told prominent folk figures in Qana village that his
country supports the international emergency force and will
continue the participation in it in order to fulfill its duties in
keeping the peace and implementing the UN resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the difficulties the Fiji contingent is
confronting, the Fiji Premier added, "it will continue its
participation and it must make sacrifices for the achievement of
the peace."
</P>
<P>
Following the inspection, he went to the UNIFIL headquarters
in Southern Lebanese coastal town of Al-Naqoura near the Israeli
border and held a meeting with UNIFIL Commander Major General
Stanislaw Franciszek Wozniak in the presence of a number of
assistants of the commander as well as the international
peace-keeping force's Political Adviser and official Spokesman
Timor Goksel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was focused on the situations in South Lebanon and
in the region, affairs of the multinational force and the position
of the Fiji government of supporting the presence of the
peace-keeping force in Lebanon, according to UNIFIL sources.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the Fiji contingent center at
Qana village in the afternoon, the Fiji Prime Minister reiterated
his country's support for Lebanon for the implementation of the
U.N. Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation between the Fiji contingent and
the folks continues, noting that he is amazed by the
reconstruction in South Lebanon, which he did not witness in 1979
when he was the head of the third Fiji contingent in South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process in the region, the Fiji Prime Minister
said that during his visit in Lebanon, he has been informed on
what is taking place, emphasizing that the success of the peace
process will stabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
On the implementation of the resolution 425, he pointed out
that "progress on the Syrian track is in Lebanon's interest and
any agreement (between Syria and Israel) will positively reflect
in Lebanon and will then open the door for the Israeli withdrawal
and that means the implementation of the resolution 425 and a
redeployment of the Lebanese army until the international border."
</P>
<P>
He underlined his country's readiness to take part in a
possible international observation force in South Lebanon after
an Israeli withdrawal, adding that Fiji has experience in Sinai
and the Golan Heights since 1967.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Requests To Buy Products Through Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Primary
Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told the press here today that
Iraq had requested to buy a number of products through Malaysia
via credit.
</P>
<P>
After a close-door meeting with an Iraqi delegation headed by
its minister of industry and minerals Adnan Abdul Najeed Jassim
today Lim said that most of the items requested were food, such as
rice, flour, sugar, tea, coffee, medical and pharmaceutical items,
rubber gloves, palm oil, machineries and insecticide.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that Malaysia has agreed to give Iraq an extra 20
million US dollars under the palm oil credit and payment
agreement, adding that previously Malaysia had given Iraq 25
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Lim said, the Iraqis had requested for more than the
additional 20 million dollars, and he had to refer back this
matter to the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, the additional 20 million dollars were not
able to meet Iraq's needs for palm oil, so the Iraqis were asking
for more because they felt the sanction imposed by the United
Nations would be lifted pretty soon, and they would be able to pay
back.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis also requested for 10 million dollars credit to buy
medicine, but Lim said he needed to take up the matter with the
ministry of finance.
</P>
<P>
Lim said:" It is good under the circumstances that countries
recognized Malaysia as a sincere country who is a friend that can
be depended on and will help out friend who is in need."

Cuf Vice-Chairman, Mr. Seif Sariff Hamad and Secretary
General Mr. Shaaban Mloo, has been insisting on their demand

<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourist
arrivals in Turkey reached over 7.7 million at the end of 1995,
marking a 15.8 percent increase in visitors compared to the
previous year and showing a record year for Turkish tourism, the
Turkish Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,726,471 tourists visited Turkey in 1995, whereas
the corresponding figure for 1994 was 6,670,618, according to
Tourism Ministry statistics.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials as saying that this represented
a great boost for the Turkish tourism industry. The greatest
number of arrivals since the start of the season has been from
Germany, totalling 1,656,310 in 1995. With alternative tourism
attracting more and more people due to changing attitudes to
traditional sun, sea and sand holidays, the Tourism Ministry is
publicizing winter tourism, hunting, underwater sports and
tracking.
</P>
<P>
Officials said their new project, entitled "four seasons,
twelve months in Turkey," aimed to make the most of the potential
for alternative tourism throughout the country and to promote its
attractions around the world.
</P>
<P>
There were 2,300 tourism centers in Turkey, expected to
grow to 3,300 soon, and 2,300 travel agencies, officials added.
There has been development in the Black Sea tourism sector in
recent years, especially since 1988, when the Sarp border gate
was opened.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Tourism Ministry has launched a five-year project,
"faith tour 95," to promote Turkey and to open Moslem, Christian
and Jewish sanctuaries to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officals added that "faith tourism" would
increase the number of tourist arrivals and the flow of foreign
currency into the country by promoting valuable Moslem, Christian
and Jewish works of art and sites of significance.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi government,
under pressure of a crippling week-long nationwide strike, urged
labour unions to return to talks last night, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary sub-committee has been established to persuade
the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions to return to the
negotiating table, Labour Minister Albert Shabangu told the press
last night in Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
"Even if it means talks about talks, it is still important to
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The union federation has said it won't negotiate or end the
strike until the government repeals a 1973 decree banning
political parties and declaring a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Economic Planning and Development Minister Temba Masuku said
the strike has already cost about 20 million U.S. dollars in lost
production alone.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying come let's talk. It is no good to destroy an
already ailing economy," he added.

river. The second phase, to be conducted from the year 2001 to
2010, is aimed to improve water quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak urged all countries to cooperate in fighting against
terrorism and launched a veiled attack on countries providing
shelter and political asylum to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with local daily Arab times
issued today, the Egyptian president bitterly criticized Sudan
and its leadership tor training terrorists and supplying them
with arms.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt "know the details...where the terrorist groups
are hiding and when and where these groups moved from a place to
another. We are watching all this and are aware of the information
regarding thee terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also strongly condemned the recent violent riots in
Gulf state of Bahrain and charged that foreign hands were directly
involved in stirring trouble.
</P>

The Egyptian president pointed out that "the plotters are
targeting the whole Gulf area and are using Bahrain as a gate."
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Bahrain will be able to crack down
such riots.
</P>
<P>
Asked about terrorism in Egypt, Mubarak said that terrorism
has become an international phenomenon. "All countries should
cooperate to fight the bloodshed of innocent people. Terrorism is
in Egypt...in Algeria, Tunisia, France, the United States and in
Britain too."
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Mubarak said, terrorism is at present
everywhere in the world and if all countries do not cooperate to
confront this phenomenon, the whole world will pay the price.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt has strong agencies which are monitoring
events inside and are also monitoring terrorism exported to Egypt
from outside.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, terrorism has declined because the people rejected
it. The remaining few are falling apart," the president claimed.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Share prices ended the
week at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) easier with the
undertone of the market heavily dependent on the release of
October's external trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Malaysia's Statistics Department issued a report
announcing that Malaysia recorded a trade deficit of 1.6 billion
Malaysian Ringgit (about 0.64 billion US dollars) in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
But trading sentiment in the second board counters remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
The key Composite Index ended the week 5.29 points easier at
1,051.40 points compared to last week's 1,056.69 points, and the
all share Emas Index ended at 300.11 points against last week's
301.88 points, while the Industrial Index shed 24.06 points to
1,903.06 points from previous close.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said: "the market has been eagerly waiting for the
release of the trade deficit, and now the anxiety is over, we may
see some fresh buying coming in."
</P>
<P>
The weekly turnover of the main board rose to 1.576 billion
shares valued at 7.362 billion Ringgit (about 2.94 billion
dollars) from 1.477 billion shares worth 7.636 billion Ringgit
(about 3.05 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover decreased to 486.077 million shares
valued at 3.947 billion Ringgit (about 1.57 billion dollars)
against 531.082 million shares valued at 4.482 billion Ringgit
(about 1.79 billion dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to 2.312 billion shares valued at
12.256 billion Ringgit (about 4.9 billion dollars) compared to
last week's 118.923 million shares worth 605.415 million Ringgit
(about 242.16 million dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Problems and Hopes For Chinese State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Lack of funds is plaguing
ailing State-owned firms, while the obscurity of property rights
is listed as the most thorny problem in enterprise reform, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of state-owned enterprises are currently in
the red. Their total losses last year topped 50 billion yuan,
according to a survey conducted by the State Commission for
Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Apart from lack of funds, state firms are suffering from their
heavy burden of social commitment, bloated payrolls and the
responsibility of feeding sick and retired employees, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
The firms that responded to the survey cited 10 obstacles on
the road. About 36.8 percent regard the unclarified property
rights as the biggest barrier to reform in this sector.
</P>
<P>
They believe property must be traded and capital should be
allowed to flow freely in a market economy. This can only be
realized when property rights are clarified.
</P>
<P>
The second biggest barrier is the lack of a nationwide and
unified social insurance system, which poses a threat to further
enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
Some 15.7 percent of interviewees asset that the role of
government should be altered so as to avoid interference in the
day-to-day running of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
About 12.4 percent complain that the policies of macro-control
are not-coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the problems, over 80 percent of respondents are
confident that the sector can be reformed. They believe China will
be able to set up the framework for a modern enterprise system by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the firms in the survey said that
transforming large state-owned entities into corporations is a
reasonable and practical way to nurture a modern enterprise
system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Adoptive Parents Condemns Rumors on China Orphanage Abuse (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvey L. Cripps and Toshie T. Cripps said "it is grossly
unfair to suggest China has a policy of letting children die in
the orphanages based on one person's dated and uncorroborated
report on one orphanage".
</P>
<P>
"The mass media or one organization does not represent the
American people, either. We feel the reports or TV's news make an
unfair impression," they said.
</P>
<P>
John and Elaine Carrillo from Arizona, who are in the last
stage of our adoption process, voiced their similar viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
Ken and Brenda Barker, who have adopted a child in 1992 from
Changsha City in central China's Hunan Province, said "our
experience was very different than that of the recent newspaper
articles, and we visited the orphanage as well."
</P>
<P>
"Our daughter, Joy, is the greatest gift that we could have
ever asked for. Everyone who meets here absolutely adores her. She
is full of 'joy'," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We would love to adopt again, it was such a wonderful
experience. We also loved the people, culture, and land of China,"
they added.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Families with Children From China
(FCC), a national support group for adoptive families of Chinese
children, said the Chinese orphanages operate with very limited
resources, and conditions in the institutions often are Spartan at
best, as they are in many other sections of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted, however, that over the last four-five
years the Chinese government has developed a very successful
international adoption program, allowing about 5,000 children to
be adopted abroad," it added.
</P>
<P>
"It has been the observation of almost all of the thousands of
adopting parents that have visited dozens of different orphanages
that the care provided for their children was as good as possible,
given resource constraints."
</P>
<P>
"The orphanage staffs are faced with the daily challenge of
providing care to growing numbers of children with limited basic
resources, such as formula, clothing and medical supplies," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that "in general, we commend the
Chinese government for their efforts to improve the outcome of
institutionalization for a growing number of children through
their program of foreign adoption."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Adoptive Parents Condemns Rumors on China Orphanage Abuse (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of U.S. adoptive
parents and groups involving in adopting children from China
refuted reports in the Western media about the so-called abuse of
children in Chinese orphanages.
</P>
<P>
In their letters faxed to the Chinese ambassador to the U.S.,
they said the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages
is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
They also commended China for their efforts to improve the
welfare of its orphans.
</P>
<P>
Donna Taylor and Belinda Durham at Catholic Charities said in
their fax that "we have been very upset by the recent news and TV
coverage about Chinese orphanages."
</P>
<P>
"One person's report, who happened to be a Chinese doctor, who
was denied a US visa, cannot be reasonable enough to believe,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
"This of course does not reflect our feelings of the Chinese,
the experiences of all of my families who have wonderful daughters
from China, and those who are planning trips in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Sharon R. Grasflin said she and her husband have filed an
adoption petition with the People's Republic of China in hopes of
adopting a precious little girl.
</P>
<P>
She said her adoption agency, China's Children, allowed her and
her husband to look through a notebook in the past month, "full of
beautiful, smiling, happy and well cared for Chinese children who
are waiting to be adopted."
</P>
<P>
"Those children were from many different orphanages throughout
China. I believe that the faces of these adorable Chinese children
provide a true testimony about the care and love that they receive
while waiting to be adopted," she said in her fax to the Chinese
Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Cudy Herdson at Tennessee office of China's Children under the
Children's Hope International, said that "we ... are very
concerned over the recent media publicity about Chinese
orphanages. We just wanted to briefly relay our concern and
outrage at the US media for covering such a story."
</P>
<P>
"We have many families who have adopted from China, and they
always have very wonderful remarks about the Chinese and their
experience in China ... not to mention that the joy of their lives
-- a child has come from your land."

<HEADLINE> Seles Wins Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United
States won her fourth Australian Open champion after beating Anke
Huber of Germany in straight sets in the final in Melbourne on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by her parents and over 15,000 spectators, Seles
stormed to a 6-4, 6-1 win over Huber after one hour and 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
She met tough resistance in the first set from Huber, a rising
21-year-old who beat world number two Conchita Martinez of Spain
in her way to the final.
</P>
<P>
Seles bombarded both sides of Huber with her powerful
two-handed ground strokes, forcing Huber into errors continuously.
</P>
<P>
Huber, ranked 8th in the world, would not give up without
fight. She made full use of her big weapon -- forehand strokes --
to do damage on her rival both at the baseline and on the net.
</P>
<P>
But after Huber lost her only but crucial service in the final
game in the first set, her resistance is gone with it.
</P>
<P>
Seles perceptibly put on another gear in her game in the second
set, hitting the ball harder and making the angles of her shots
sharper.
</P>
<P>
She served and broke to lead at 3-0 in the first three games,
before Huber held her serve for the first time in the fourth
set. But that's where Huber stopped. Seles took the following
consecutive three games to claim the first Grand Slam title this
year.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first major event she won since she resumed
undisrupted session in Australia this month.
</P>
<P>
"To be back and to hold the trophey back means a lot to me,"
said a tearful Seles at the awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I left Australia three years ago with unbelieveable memories.
And the hardest thing for me is that when I could not play, I was
not be able to defend my title (I had won) from 1991 when I first
came in Melbourne," she said.
</P>
<P>
Seles, ranked joint world number one with Steffi Graf of
Germany, won three consecutive Australian Opens from 1991 to
1993. She also won three French Opens and two U.S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
Seles stopped playing tennis after she was stabbed by a fan of
Graf in Munich in Germany in 1993. She made her comeback to tennis
in August and won the Canadian Open and finished runner-up to Graf
in the U.S. Open. But she didn't play the WTA Championships and
the Federation Cup due to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, she won the Peter's International Champion
in Sydney immediately before the Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
At the Australian Open, despite injuries in her groin, shoulder
and calf, Seles extended her unbeaten streak to 32 matches she
played in Australia.

<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing offshore drilling
operated by foreign oil companies in the Bay of Bengal indicated a
huge reserves of gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary study gave the possibility of a deposit of 2.5
trillion cubic feet of hydrocarbon reserves (gas and oil) in the
shallow water of the Bay of Bengal, according to a competent
source.
</P>
<P>
The seismic image relating to hydrocarbon concentration under
the sea waters is also indicative of oil and gas deposit.
</P>
<P>
"But for all confirmations, there is the necessity of physical
verification through drilling ", said a senior Energy Ministry
official. The hydrocarbon deposit is expected to be lying at 3,500
meters below the sea bottom.
</P>
<P>
The two oil companies, Cairn Energy Plc of Scotland and
Holland Sea Search, took up the drilling at a location near
Chittagong City beginning last December.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails SAR Preparatory Committee's Establishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily", China's
leading newspaper, marked the formal establishment of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and the convention of its first plenary session in a
front-page editorial today.
</P>
<P>
It called on people on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong to
work with one heart and one mind to create a bright future.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the preparatory committee suggests that
China will materialize the grand task of resuming the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and that its efforts to prepare for
formation of the SAR is to be carried out in an all-round way, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up after repeated deliberation and
consultations and by taking into consideration factors and
representation from all sectors of society, it said.
</P>
<P>
Its membership from the Chinese mainland is composed mainly of
leading officials of the relevant central and local government
departments which are involved in Hong Kong affairs, as well as
scholars and experts. Those from Hong Kong totalled 94, accounting
for 63 percent of the total membership. They are representatives
of all walks of life in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial noted, it is still inadequate to merely
rely on the 150-member preparatory committee in preparing for the
formation of the SAR and realizing the smooth transfer of power in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the six million residents in Hong Kong would
participate, in various ways, the smooth hand-over of power in
Hong Kong and contribute to the maintenance of its prosperity and
stability," it said.
</P>
<P>
January 26, on which the Preparatory Committee of the SAR was
established, was only 521 days away from the historical moment
when Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland. It
was believed that the preparatory committee will certainly live up
to the expectations of the Chinese people including Hong Kong
compatriots in carrying out the principle of "One country, two
systems" and fulfilling the sacred historical mission, the
editorial said.

NEW DELHI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao, chief of India's ruling Congress Party, may convene a meeting
of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) early next month, the
Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held ostensibly to discuss preparations for
the general elections, but also to allow an in-house debate on the
hawala issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be of an extended CWC with all cabinet
ministers, chief ministers of the party, Pradesh Congress chiefs
and a host of other special invitees, sources in the Prime
Minister's Office (PMO) have indicated.
</P>
<P>
The sources said holding an extended meeting has in the recent
past helped diffuse tension and prevented prickly issues from
getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
Referring to increasing resentment within the party over party
leadership's inaction in the hawala scandal, they felt that the
CWC might be the correct forum for those who want to let the steam
off.
</P>
<P>
But the sources ruled out any trouble for the prime minister
over the issue because Rao had strong support in the party.
</P>
<P>
They added that the meeting could also be a forum to get a
clearer picture of the way the party should meet the challenge of
the hawala scandal.

</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the bill shortly after it arrived at his White
House desk Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The temporary funding bill provides 75 percent of the 1995
levels of spending through March 15 for education and other
programs not yet covered by annual appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
Congress has passed and Clinton has signed seven of the 13
annual spending bills, which mostly cover the Cabinet departments
and their programs.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six bills have been stalled in a bitter partisan
fight between the White House and Congress over a new
comprehensive federal budget, which is already four months late.

<HEADLINE> Auto Producer and Trading Firm to Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Backed by banks and financial
firms, the beijing-based Huilong Enterprise Group and the China
First Automobile Group Corp announced here new joint approaches to
expand the automotive market this week.
</P>
<P>
Huilong, with promises of support from the Beijing
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp(BITIC) and the Industrial &AMP;
Commercial Bank of China, was chosen by the China First Automobile
Group as a major outlet.
</P>
<P>
A conglomerate with assets of 2.2 billion yuan (about 265
million US dollars) and in which the Ministry of Internal Trade
holds shares, Huilong will raise funds for marketing products by
the China First Automobile Group, also known as FAW(First
Automobile Works).
</P>
<P>
FAW, which was established in 1953 as the cradle for China's
auto industry, will provide Huilong with vehicles in large
quantities and preferential terms.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wei, FAW's vice-president, said the new link-up with Huilong
is important to his firm's development. FAW, as China's largest
auto maker, produced 200,000 sedans, buses and trucks last year
and will increase production to 400,000 sedans together with
300,000 trucks and buses by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Huilong, as a state-chartered sedan trading company, will also
set up sales spots with automotive trading companies in other
cities and provinces. It will provide the spots with discount
vehicles and funds if needed.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Huilong and trading companies will be
developed into an internationally accepted agent system. They will
not only sell vehicles but will also conduct after-sales service
and market surveys and share risks with automakers.
</P>
<P>
BITIC executives said their firm will provide preferential
loans and guarantees for bulk purchasers such as taxi and
transportation companies and driving schools.
</P>
<P>
The approaches announced by Huilong and FAW and the new
relation between them are regarded as new efforts to strengthen
the market in the country, where a nationwide tight credit policy
continues to restrict demand and individual buying of automobiles
has begun.
</P>
<P>
The services BITIC promised have largely been used in the
country, Wu said. FAW has always paid great attention to the
market in Beijing, which has one-tenth of the country's automotive
population of 10 million units.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of more severe competition, other auto makers
and trading companies are also expected to adopt new measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Top Peruvian and Ecuadorian
commanders will meet to discuss the peace process next month,
suggesting the ease of tensions between the two countries a year
after their border war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held on February 11 in Ampama on the
Peru-Ecuador border, is arranged by the Rio de Janeiro Protocol
Guarantor Countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the U.S.) and
the Southern Command of the U.S. Army headquartered in the Panama
Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Commanding General of the Armed Forces Nicolas Hermoza
and Ecuadorian top military authority Jorge Ortega will attend the
meeting and deliver speeches respectively.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador were locked in a large-scale border conflict
in January 1995. Ceasefire was achieved 50 days later through the
mediation of the Rio De Janeiro Protocol Countries.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori and Ecuadorian President Sixto Duran Ballen had closer
contacts during recent months, which is another sign of their
willingness to work toward a solution to the border conflict and
their support for economic integration under the Andean Pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has granted more
privileges for foreign companies to open corporate regional
offices to promote the country as a regional trade and investment
center.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Board of Investment (BOI), chaired by Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa Friday, agreed to allow overseas
companies to open regional offices engaging in trade, export,
consultancy, and research and development.
</P>
<P>
The companies must have expenses of at least 10 million baht
(0.4 million US dollars) per year with their operations approved
by the board under the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said the existing regulations limit the number
of the staff of foreign branches to a maximum of five.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms will be granted licenses to purchase office
accommodation, but without any duty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The BOI also granted privileges for four-stroke motorcycle
engine plants, including a 90 percent tariff reduction on imported
raw materials, in a bid to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The board required the existing two-stroke engine manufacturers
to switch production to four-stroke engines by January 1, 1999
with a local component ratio of 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panama Decorates HIV Discoverer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government
today awarded the Vasco Nunez de Balboa decoration to French
scientist Luc Montagnier for his discovery of the virus that
causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
"Humanity will always be indebted" to Luc Montagnier, said
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares while addressing the
18th Panama and Central America Regional Meeting on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 health experts from France, the United States, Cuba,
Mexico, and Honduras attended the meeting, which will end tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Montagnier has dedicated all his life
to scientific research in the field of medicine.
</P>
<P>
"His extraordinary scientific competence, his dedication
without pause to research, his natural gifts as an investigator
and his brilliant talent, took him to the discovery in 1983 of the
virus that causes AIDS," said Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
"Later, in 1985, as the head of the same research team in
Paris, (Montagnier) isolated the second human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)," added the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rampant spreading of AIDS has become a social,
economic, and human development problem.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares said that one of the most important weapons to
combat this disease is an education campaign to let people know
the danger of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has registered some 340,000 victims of the lethal
disease since the discovery of the virus, according to statistics
released by the Pan American Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
In Panama, 604 people have died of the disease since 1984, and
402 are infected, the Epidemiology Department of the Panamanian
Health Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Considering a Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- NBA legend Earvin "Magic"
Johnson is considering returning to the Los Angeles Lakers, a team
he led to five championship titles, a Lakers spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who retired in 1991 after testing positive for HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, has all but guaranteed he will return
next week against the Chicago Bulls led by Michael Jordan, said a
New York Post report.
</P>
<P>
Lakers spokesman John Black declined to confirm the story, but
said: "We've had discussions with him about coming back and we've
had discussions with the league office about what is necessary for
him to return."
</P>
<P>
Black said the Lakers are ready to satisfy all the league
requirements if the former superstar point guard decides to emerge
from retirement.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared for him to return if he wants to," Black said.
"But we can't speak for him. It's his decision."
</P>
<P>
The Post said Johnson's first game would be next Friday in Los
Angeles, when the Lakers host the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been playing with his own touring all-star
team, has openly flirted with the idea of a comeback several
times.
</P>
<P>
He announced he was making a comeback six weeks before the
1992-1993 season. But just before the opening night, he said he
was retiring for good.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Factions Sign Confidence-Building Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The three former Bosnian warring
parties signed here today a landmark accord designed to build
mutual confidence and guarantee security in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
The accord was struck after more than three weeks of
negotiations between the Muslim-led Bosnian government, the
Muslim-Croat Federation and Bosnian Serbs under the auspices of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The accord is a further explanation of the Dayton peace
agreement, signed in Paris last month, and is hailed by diplomats
as a major step in anchoring peace in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Istvan Gyarmati, the OSCE representative chairing the
negotiations, told reporters that the accord is a significant step
in the Bosnian peace process and will play a decisive role in
promoting all sides to reduce troops and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite a substantial package," said Gyarmati.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides that the former foes will inform each other
of its military games and will withdraw troops from borders and
the 10-kilometer-wide separation zones along the borders. No
military exercises will be allowed near borders or sealed buffer
zones.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that each side should disarm its armed
civilian bands and accept intrusive OSCE inspections of its
military installations. Besides, no foreign armed forces will be
allowed to be stationed in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Pursue Economic Links with South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will send a delegation
to three South Asian nations to pursue a 1994 plan to boost
economic ties with that region, according to a Foreign Ministry
source.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which will include Foreign Ministry officials
and business people, will visit Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka,
scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will study possible economic relations between
Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Myanmar has
not yet stated its official position on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Three possible key areas for cooperation between Thailand and
the three countries are fisheries, labor-intensive investment and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Future cooperation could include tourism, agriculture,
technology transfer, navigation, airline services and human
resources development.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes to use the plan to broaden markets for Thai
products in the whole South Asian region, which has over one
billion population.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the economic linkage could be one between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The plan was initiated by then Thai deputy prime minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi, who was responsible for international
economics under the previous Chuan Leekpai administration.

<P>
WARSAW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Polish Council of Ministers
(cabinet) announced its resignation after an emergency meeting
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The council's spokeswoman A. Jakubowska announced at a press
conference that according to a regulation, the whole cabinet had
to step down after Prime Minister Josef Oleksy resigned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski accepted
the resignation of Oleksy, who was accused of passing state
secrets to Moscow from 1982 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has two weeks to name a successor, asked
Oleksy to remain as caretaker until a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The two ruling coalition parties, Oleksy's Democratic Left
Alliance (SLD) and the smaller Polish Peasant Party (PSL), are
discussing the issue of candidates for the prime minister's post,
but so far have failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy was appointed as the SLD head for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A Warsaw Military Prosecutor's Office Wednesday opened an
investigation into the allegations against Oleksy, who denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy told the nation on television Wednesday night that he
would resign and fight to clear his name.

<HEADLINE> Myanma Annual Economic Growth Rate Up by 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's annual economic growth
rate reached 8 percent in the past four fiscal years, the official
newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This growth rate is higher than the target for the four-year
short-term project from 1992-93 to 1995-96 fiscal year to be ended
on March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
At a coordination meeting of the Special Projects
Implementation Committee Friday, Myanmar Minister for National
Planning and Economic Development Brigadier General Abel disclosed
that the nation achieved an economic development rate of 9.7
percent in 1992-93, 6 percent in 1993-94, 7.5 percent in 1994-95
and an estimated 9.8 percent in 1995-96, with an annual average
rate of over 8 percent in the past four fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Abel said that investments and exports have increased markedly
year by year during the period and production in agriculture, the
main economic sector of the state, has been boosted considerably.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not disclose any data of it. According
to the earlier official statistics, the foreign investment in
Myanmar has already reached over 3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration
Council Senior General Than Shwe said that sustained efforts must
be made for successful implementation of the forthcoming five-year
short term project from 1996-97 to 2000-01.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Professional help on mental
health should be provided to teachers, parents and students of all
ages to prevent the young generation from plunging into mental
crises, said a noted psychologist.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, psychological issues are
attracting much attention in China. Due to rapid social change, it
added, fierce competition and new concepts of self-education,
youngsters are prone to frustrations for a number of reasons. It
is important to make professional help available to schools and
families as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Psychological counselling services are relatively new to China
as psychology itself was ignored and even criticized as a
pseudoscience for many years until the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Richang, head of the Beijing School Psychological Health
Committee and psychology professor at Beijing Normal University,
voiced his opinions in a recent discussion which was aimed at
seeking therapies for mentally troubled students.
</P>
<P>
The meeting drew teachers from about 50 colleges and
universities, as well as 100 primary and middle schools in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At the discussion, Zheng put forward his psychological help
scheme, which outlines tasks for benefiting students of different
age groups.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that primary schools should focus on training pupils
in good study habits and harmonious relations with classmates.
</P>
<P>
Middle schools should help students adapt to mental and
psychological changes in adolescence, and offer students guidance
on graduation and employment.
</P>
<P>
College and universities should put the emphasis on helping
students to build up an optimistic attitude to life, love and
society.
</P>
<P>
Psychological help can be spread through lectures, bulletins,
broadcasts, publicity hand-outs, and television and slide
shows. Special interviews can also be arranged between psychology
experts, teachers, parents, and students who may face mental
crises, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are also willing to spread Zheng's scheme in
Beijing's schools and nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Some of these schools have already set up psychological
counselling centers to help students affiliated with psychological
problems.
</P>
<P>
In the Capital's Teachers' University (CTU), the counselling
center incorporates psychological education into freshmen's school
training.
</P>
<P>
"People are sometimes misled that psychological help is only
for people with mental problems. In fact, such help can also be
preventive treatment for all," said Lin Guiru, director of the CTU
counselling center.
</P>
<P>
Some students feel lonely because they are far from home; some
who used to be top students in middle school may fall behind
classmates at college; some may feel inferior as they come from
the countryside or undeveloped areas; some are frustrated by
failure in personal relationships and academic work; some feel
depressed by being in single-parent families. And there are many
other confrontations which hurt students' feelings and affect
their studies, said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that about one-quarter of college students are
likely to face emotional crises at some point in their college
years.
</P>
<P>
Help from the counselling center can tide most students over
their troubles. Earlier psychological help can prevent students
from being trapped in mental disorders and avoid tragedies, Lin
added.

<HEADLINE> 17 French Tourists Kidnapped in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped 17
French tourists to press the authorities for releasing one of
their members jailed for abducting an American, the AFP news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Yemen's Marib province was quoted as saying
members of the Al-Aslam tribe kidnapped the hostages in Marib, 173
kilometers east of Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, Thursday and took
them to a village in Shabwah province, 458 kilometers southeast
Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
However, separate news reports from Sanaa put the number of the
tourists kidnapped at 18.
</P>
<P>
The governor, Abdel Wali al-Shamiri, reportedly said that the
kidnappers were demanding the release of a colleague who was held
by a Yemeni court for the abduction last September of an American
oilman working in Yemen. The American was later freed unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shamiri said all the French tourists were in good health and
talks on obtaining their release were under way.
</P>
<P>
"Tribal leaders who are leading the mediation have seen the
tourists walking in the village orange groves and they are all in
good health," said al-Shamiri.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yemeni government assured in a statement that
security forces were taking "necessary measures" to arrest the
kidnappers and free the tourists.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were seized when four tribesmen stopped two buses
from a Yemeni travel agency returning to Sanaa after a trip to
Marib to visit ancient ruins.
</P>
<P>
The incident marked the second time this year that Yemeni
tribes have taken foreigners hostage. Earlier this month,
tribesmen held four U.S. oilmen for four days before releasing
them.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni tribesmen have in the past kidnapped foreigners to force
the government to meet their demands. In those incidents, the
hostages have always been released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Impoverished Yemen, an oil-rich nation on the southwestern tip
of the Arabian peninsula, has been torn by civil strife between
rival tribes.

The two sides also agreed to change the name of the Balkan
Games to Jocuri Carpato-Balcanice. They wished Czech Republic and

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- In a last-minute effort to
avert a third partial government shutdown, the U.S. Senate
approved and sent to President Bill Clinton a temporary bill to
fund government at reduced levels through March 15.
</P>
<P>
White House aides said that Clinton will sign the bill into law
as soon as it reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
By an 82-8 roll call, the Senate passed the legislation.
Clinton's promised signature would avert another round of federal
worker furloughs.
</P>
<P>
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield, R-Ore,
said, "All of us want to avoid another shutdown of the federal
government." In a sign of the Republicans' determination to do so,
Hatfield called the threat of another closure "a gun to our head,"
that prevented senators from changing the measure.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives Thursday overwhelmingly approved
the bill by a 371-42 vote to keep federal agencies running through
March 15.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexican enterprises
complained today that high interest rates in the country have
caused a drastic stagnation of productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of the National Chambers of Commerce
Confederation (Concanaco) Luis Carlos Trevino de la Garza said
that Mexican enterprises are paying 150 percent more than those in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the real interest rate, 150 percent higher than
that in the U.S., has drastically reduced the productive sectors'
competitivity.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Mexico's banking institutions are charging 20
percent for interest rates while U.S. banks charge only 7 to 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
He called for more accessible interest rates for the productive
sectors and assistance for export-oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
The first weeks of the year have seen a more stringent credit
restriction than in 1995 because banks are demanding higher
collaterals to warrant loans.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Haunts North Europe in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nordic countries continued to
suffer from high unemployment in 1995 despite government efforts
to cure the running sore, the central statistical bureaus reported.
</P>
<P>
Finland remained the hardest hit with its jobless rate
rebounding to 17 percent in December from November's 16.7 percent,
the Finnish Central Statistical Bureau said. High unemployment
has been a major drag on Finland's economy since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sweden also suffered a bulging unemployment at the end of 1995,
with its jobless rate climbing to 7.4 percent from 7.2 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
While remaining at a high jobless rate, Denmark took some
relief to see its unemployment continue to decline in 1995, from
12 percent in January to 8.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Economic recovery and boosting individual consumption
contributed to the creation of jobs since July 1994, when the
country recorded a 15 percent unemployment and 350,000 people were
out of work.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the only country free from the trouble haunting its
neighbors. It enjoyed an 8-year low unemployment of 3.8 percent
in December, the lowest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Finland, Sweden and Denmark are member nations of the European
Union, which is scheduled to launch a single currency system in
1999. Low unemployment is a condition for the members to enter
into the monetary union.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Defense Minister Thage
Peterson will arrive in Thailand next week for talks with his Thai
counterpart to secure a submarine contract, it is learned here
today.
</P>
<P>
Peterson has plans to hold talks with Thai Defense Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh over building of two submarines for Thailand
by a Swedish company, Kockums.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister was due to travel to Bangkok late last
year but postponed the visit after bribery allegations made by a
Swedish peace group were published, saying that Kockums had paid
key members of the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party before the
general election of July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa is leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Thai opposition has demanded investigation into the
allegations and an explanation from the government.
</P>
<P>
The bribes were allegedly aimed at increasing Chart Thai's
chances of winning the election and in turn the party would favor
a deal for Swedish-built submarines.
</P>
<P>
Both key Chart Thai members and Kockums President Per Johnsson
have denied the charges, saying the allegations were baseless.

<HEADLINE> Keating Criticizes U.S. Policy on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating has criticized the U.S. policy towards China, saying that
it has not got "the weights right" in its relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
The United States has placed too much importance on human
rights issues and support for Taiwan rather than "looking at China
as a whole," Keating said in a comprehensive interview with The
Weekend Australian newspaper earlier this week, which was made
public today.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the United States has the weights right in the
China relations," the paper quoted Keating as saying. "The focus
on Taiwan and human rights...doesn't substitute for a policy of
looking at China as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum) "is the one new institutional bridge" between
the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
"I think the United States now appreciates that developing a
relationship with the Chinese President, or China, in APEC is a
very useful opportunity for the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Keating noted that China is the biggest emerging economy in the
world. "One of the principal reasons for APEC...one of the big
tasks of the post-Cold War world, is engaging China, putting our
arms around it, helping it into the world successfully," he
added.

MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas said Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, being accused
of power abuse, would quit his job before January 29, the Interfax
news service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas told the state television Thursday night that he and
the prime minister had discussed three ways for the latter to
resign and the latter had agreed to make a choice by Monday. But
the report did not specify the three choices.
</P>
<P>
Slezevicius and some other government officials have been
accused of abusing power for their own interests and polls have
showed that most Lithuanians wanted the government to step down.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling Democratic Labor party led by Slezevicius is
strongly opposed to possible departures of Slezevicius and his
interior minister. Brazauskas had been the party's chief till his
election as the president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, Slezevicius defended himself and
accused some people of trying to distract public attention to the
country's monetary crisis by demanding his resignation.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian General Procuratorate has decided to file
criminal suits against Slezevicius and other officials.

<HEADLINE> Office Opens for Foreign Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- This, China's Capital set up a
service organization to help foreign teachers find educational
vacancies this week, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The city's universities, colleges, high school and private
schools will no longer hire foreign teachers without
recommendation of the Beijing Foreign Expert Service Center.
</P>
<P>
The center also provides employment consultation for those who
want to work for the capital's scientific and cultural
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Before now, foreign teachers have usually been recruited
through advertisements or personal recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Establishment such as an organ is part of the city's effort to
devise a service system that confirms to practice throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
In operating the center, the Beijing Education Commission and
Foreign Liaison Office will not be engaged with the daily
management of foreign teachers and will only provide policy
guidance.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are required to present their personal records,
diploma, recommendation from a home professor, teacher's
certificate or other credentials, marital status and health
documents when asking help from the center. The center will then
study their application and recommend them to an appropriate
institution.
</P>
<P>
Currently, over 1,000 foreign teachers are working in the
Beijing area.
</P>
<P>
The center also offers to meet newcomers at the airport, and
provides orientation programmes and residence-card service for
them.
</P>
<P>
China began regulating the hiring of foreign teachers through
intermediary organizations, such as the Beijing center in June
1993. The regulation required each province, municipality and
autonomous region to set up one or two such organizations.
</P>
<P>
Their purpose is to protect the legal interests of both the
experts themselves and their Chinese employers.
</P>
<P>
But the center only started operations in late 1994 after a
long start-up period. The beijing center is the 25th.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the State Bureau of Foreign Experts,
some of the provincial centers have a bigger business scope than
their Beijing counterpart, including organizing overseas training
programmes and introducing technicians to companies.
</P>
<P>
throughout the country, more than 700 universities and colleges
are eligible to hire foreign teachers, and more and more
vacational schools, high schools and even some joint-venture
kindergartens have foreign faculty members as well.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Wrestler Shot to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An Olympic wrestling
champion was shot and killed today at the estate of John E. du
Pont and police believe the heir to the giant chemical company was
the suspect, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Schultz, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist and 1983 world
champion in the 163-pound category, was shot once in the arm and
twice in the chest at the sprawling suburban Philadelphia estate
of du Pont.
</P>
<P>
Police said Du Pont was holed up inside a room at the estate's
mansion after the shooting and was believed to be heavily armed.
The building was surrounded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
Schultz worked as a wrestling coach for du Pont's club team
based at the estate. Du Pont is head coach of Team FoxCatcher and
contributes about 500,000 U.S. dollars a year to USA Wrestling,
the governing body that runs the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
USA Wrestling spokesman Gary Abbott said he was unaware of any
rift between du Pont and Schultz.
</P>
<P>
Schultz, 36, was ranked first in the country in his weight
class and was working on a comeback, training for the 1996 Games
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"He was considered a top hopeful for the 1996 team," Abbott
said. "If the Olympics were today, he'd be the guy." The U.S.
Olympic trials are scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
The 800-acre du Pont estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, is
about 13 mile west of Philadelphia in an exclusive section of
rural Delaware County.

<HEADLINE> German Engineer Receives Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sepp Heim, a German
orthopedic-engineer, was awarded a top honor of the Ministry of
Civil Affairs Friday here for his three years of hard work in
China.
</P>
<P>
Heim was presented with a golden ox, representing the "herd
boy's willing ox" (a servant of the people) award. Doji Cering,
Minister of Civil Affairs said, "the honor and the prize are to
praise Heim's outstanding performance as head of the China
Training Center for Orthopedic Technologists (CTCOT) in Wuhan,
capital of Hubei Province, since 1992 and show him our respect."
</P>
<P>
Aside from K'uanshu Li, a Chinese-American who was given the
award for his contribution to the country's disabled population in
1992, Heim is the first foreigner to be awarded the honor by the
Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
"In the last three years, Heim has devoted himself to the
development of China's orthopedic education, playing a key role in
getting financial aid from the German Government for the founding
of the center, setting up a first-class artificial limbs school in
China," Wu Zhongze, director of the Ministry's welfare department,
said.
</P>
<P>
Heim, former vice-chairman of the International Society of
Prosthesis and Orthopedics (ISPO), has offered many valuable
suggestions to the Chinese authorities trying to set up an
orthopedic technology education system in line with the
international standards.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital for China to train more professionals of
prosthesis and orthopedics to help the disabled in the future," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the Wuhan-based CTCOT, built with funds
granted by the German Government, is equipped with facilities
imported from Germany.

<HEADLINE> Reform Progress in Guangdong's Distribution Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guangzhou, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, south
China, has made remarkable progress in turning its traditionally
highly-planned distribution sector to comply with the
market-oriented economic mechanism during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong was among the first in the country to free prices of
industrial and farm products and to revoke the use of grain
coupon. To date, prices of more than 95 percent of the consumer
and production goods are subject to market regulation.
</P>
<P>
In another major reform scheme, the province in 1992 turned the
provincial distribution department into an enterprise group, which
helped reduce the bureaucracy. And distribution departments at the
county-level were transformed into companies accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1995, the enterprise group in the province
generated a total pre-tax profit of 424 million yuan (51.08
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the process of adopting modern enterprise system, more than
400 distribution conglomerates and over 1,500 chain stores have
been established. In addition, 31 commercial enterprises have
formed share-holding companies.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures that have been taken helped the province to
raise its consumer sales by 16.2 percent annually over the past
five years.

the republic, industrial relations system and unemployment and
those issues concerned by the Australians.

<P>
"The election will also determine the prospects of our having
an Australian as our head of state," Keating said.

<HEADLINE> Progress made in Guangdong's Price Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, an economic powerhouse in the country, managed to effect
the level of 0.6 percentage point lower than the average national
retail price rise annually during the Eight Five-Year-Plan period
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
This success was attributed to the raise in the prices of
transportation, telecommunication, energy and prime products and
liberalized more prices for commodities and services than the
national total.
</P>
<P>
As part of its price reform, Guangdong has shifted the previous
focus on management of commodity prices to non-commodity prices
and intensified supervision on prices.
</P>
<P>
To keep a close-eye on the freer market, the provincial
authorities dealt with 124,400 law-violating cases, revoked and
corrected 12,878 random-charging items, and eased the social
burden of 1.6 billion yuan (192.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In an effort to strengthen the macro-economic control by the
government, the province has set up a price regulation fund, a
grain risk fund and reserves for major commodities.
</P>
<P>
The province also worked out several legislative documents
concerning the management of prices.

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Japanese
and South Korean officials ended a trilateral meeting in Honolulu
Thursday but have not made any decision, State Department said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that the two-day
meeting was designed to be a comprehensive discussion of all the
issues that the three partners must deal with concerning the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The three delegations, headed separately by U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Winston Lord, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister
Shunii Yanai and South Korean Assistant Foreign Minister Ban Ki
Mun, analyzed the current situation in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "They confirmed once again the commitment of the
three countries to make joint efforts to reduce tensions on the
Korean peninsula, to strengthen the groundwork for peaceful
reunification of the two Koreas through improvement in the
inter-Korean relationship."
</P>
<P>
They also discussed food assistance to the DPRK in their
meeting but made no decisions on what to do about it, Burns added.
</P>
<P>
The United States was pressing for additional assistance in
part to reward the DPRK for cooperating on nuclear issues.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese representative said his country would honor a pledge
to provide 500,000 tons of rice but was not considering additional
aid.
</P>
<P>
There was a consensus among the three delegations that there is
a food shortage in the DPRK, caused by the recent severe flooding
in that country, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The three delegations agreed to meet again within a few months
and to maintain close consultations on all issues about the Korean
peninsula.

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's boxer Frans
Botha tested positive for steroids in his second urine sample this
week in Los Angeles and could be stripped of his International
Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
Botha knocked out Germany's Axel Schulz for the vacant IBF
crown in Stuttgart on December 9 of last year on a controversial
12-round split decision that sparked a riot in the ring.
</P>
<P>
After the bout, German Boxing Federation president Alois Teuber
claimed that Botha tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs
in his first urine sample.
</P>
<P>
But Botha insisted he is innocent, saying that the Germans are
setting him up because they were unhappy Schulz lost the fight.
</P>
<P>
IBF will decided later how to do with Botha's title.
</P>
<P>
The IBF title was vacant because former champion George Foreman
had lost the crown for refusing to fight a rematch against

Ukrainians Irina Romanova and Igor Yaroshenko finished third

<P>
Gritschuk and Platov's pulsating combination of cha-cha, mambo

and Ovsiannikov to secure the silver medal with the help of Zorba
the Greek.
</P>
<P>
The only real medal battle was for the bronze, with French
couple Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat within striking
distance of the Ukrainians. Level on the technical marks, the
Ukrainians sealed third place on artistic merit.
</P>
<P>
There was no need for introductions on the podium as all three
couples live in the same town, Newark, in Delaware, and share the
same coaches, the 1980 Olympic ice dance champions Natalia
Linichuk and Gennady Karponosov.

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed its support for France's offer to mediate between Yemen
and Eritrea in their dispute over a Red Sea island.
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes the announcement by the government
of France that it has agreed to take an active role in efforts to
reach a peaceful solution to the conflict between Yemen and
Eritrea over the Hanish islands in the Red Sea," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a statement.

"We understand that the French government is now in touch with
the two parties, and we urge the governments of Yemen and Eritrea
to give every consideration to the French offer as soon as
possible," Burns said.

<P>
Tensions between Yemen and Eritrea over the issue of the Hanish
islands erupted into military clashes in mid-December last year.

But after a few days of fighting, both sides agreed to a
cease-fire.
</P>

The French foreign ministry announced Thursday that it was
willing to mediate between them and said it had presented a

WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Israeli
delegations today concluded their three-day peace talks at the Wye
Plantation conference center on Maryland apparently without any
progress.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher offered "some substantive
ideas" to the negotiators to try to push the talks forward when he
met with all the delegations on Maryland last night.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that Christopher telephoned Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres this morning to report on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Peres called for a redoubling of the efforts
towards Syria and Israel peace," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
However, Burns described the three-day talks as "very good
talks" which established "a good basis" for further discussions,
scheduled to begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wye talks addressed security arrangements of a
Syrian-Israeli peace agreement with military officers from both
sides participating, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were extensive, wide-ranging and detailed, and
they provided each side a better understanding of the others'
views," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Burns acknowledged that the negotiations between Syria and
Israel "is a very hard-fought and lengthy process" because their
differences will not disappear overnight.

ZAGREB, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat
Federation and Serb authorities said today that they had reached
an agreement to release all prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
"From our side, the order will be given to empty the prisons
and we've got it (agreement) from both sides," Serb assembly
speaker Momcilo Krajisnik told the Serb radio in Pale.
</P>
<P>
Kresimir Zubak, President of the Muslim-Croat Federation who
earlier held talks with Serb leaders in Pale, also told the radio
the two sides had agreed to free all prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed completely to release all prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Serb radio said Bosnian Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic would
give an order for the "unilateral release" of all prisoners held
by the Serbs "because the war is over".
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-led government, their Croat federation partners and
the Serb authorities still hold 645 prisoners listed by the Red
Cross in breach of the Bosnian peace accord signed last month.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear if the Muslim side, who has insisted
on Serbs to give information about the missing people before the
exchange of prisoner takes place, will sign on the agreement.

LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian minister revealed
today cases of leprosy in the country dropped drastically from
200,000 in 1989 to 16,000 in 1995, expressing optimism that
Nigeria would eliminate the disease by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here to mark the 1996 World
Leprosy Day, Health Minister Ihechukwu Madubuike attributed this
achievement to, among others, the unflinching support from
foreign organizations especially the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
All active leprosy cases on register in Nigeria have been put
on the Modern Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) for the treatment of
leprosy. The MDT coverage reached 100 percent in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Association has
declared the last Sunday of January every year as World Leprosy
Day to raise public awareness on the plight of leprosy sufferers
and the control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
At the news briefing, the minister expressed concerns of his
ministry over the rapid increase in the prevalence and incidence
of tuberculosis cases.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, an estimated 100,000 people develop infectious
tuberculosis annually. Less than 15 percent of the expected TB
patients are diagnosed annually.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
appealed today to the Ulster Unionist Party which is opposed to
the international commission's report on Ulster's peace process to
start talks with Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said that he could understand Ulster Unionists' fear
about meeting Sinn Fein which strives for the reunification of the
whole island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But peace could only come about by talking to adversaries, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister John Major is also seeking to
meet John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party
(SDLP), the largest Catholic nationalist party in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Major was prepared to discuss his elections plan in Northern
Ireland with Hume next week, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But Hume strongly opposed the elections notion and he has
accused Major of buying votes from Ulster's Protestant legislators
at Westminster to ensure the survival of the crisis-torn
Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SDLP was opposed to a new elected body in
Northern Ireland and had made its opposition on this issue very
clear.

<HEADLINE> US Economists See Economy Growing Moderately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will grow
moderately this year, inflation will be restrained, and the
unemployment rate will remain under 6 percent, according to a
survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 47 economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a
newsletter, was the latest assurance that the United States is not
falling into recession despite signs of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The consensus forecast sees 2.2 percent expansion both this
year and next, compared to anticipated growth of just 1.6 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the Blue Chip survey estimated the economy
slowed to a 1.9 percent annual rate of growth in the fourth
quarter of 1995, down sharply from 3.2 percent of the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
They forecast a 1.9 percent rate for the current January-March
period.
</P>
<P>
"Continued growth in capital spending and additional cuts in
short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve were rated by the
panel members as the two factors most likely to help boost
economic growth in 1996," the newsletter said. "High levels of
consumer debt and fiscal spending drag were cited as the two
factors most likely to curb growth."
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe Federal Reserve policy makers could cut
rates a third time in six months when they next meet Tuesday and
Wednesday.

<P>
Abel Chivukuvuku, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's political
adviser, made the remarks upon his arrival here heading a
delegation for talks with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Chivukuvuku said his delegation would discuss with the
government when and where the next meeting between Savimbi and
Angolan president Eduardo dos Santos should be held, and other
related issues.
</P>
<P>
The two rival leaders have met three times since the Angolan
peace accord was signed in November, 1994.
</P>
<P>
At its eight-day annual conference, which ended on January 24,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
discussed the Angolan peace process and adopted resolutions to
participate in a future government of national unity and assemble
its fighters within a time limit set by the United Nations Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM), among others.
</P>
<P>
UNITA forces began assembling on November 20, 1995. However,
the process has been rather slow. Only a total of 660 troops had
been quartered at assembly camps by January 23.
</P>
<P>
The process was halted early last December following armed
clashes near the northern city of Soyo between government forces
and UNITA. It resumed recently under the mediation of UNAVEM.

JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Swaziland's
business sectors today met King Mswati III in a bid to break the

by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions and other
pro-democracy groups.

King Sobhuza after he complained that it was unworkable.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Niger's army chief of staff
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara announced over state radio on Saturday
that his troops had seized power in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
Mainassara said that President Mahamane Ousmane had been
stripped of his powers and that a National Salvation Committee had
been set up, according to reports reaching here from Niamey, the
capital of Niger.
</P>

He said that the government and the national assembly had been
dissolved and political parties suspended.
</P>

A curfew would be in force from 9 p.m. until 5.30 a.m., the

parliament building on Saturday and took him away to an unknown
destination.

Mahamane lost his majority in the national assembly in 1994.
His opponents won a slender majority in a general election last

<HEADLINE> Oman, Israel to Exchange Trade Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Oman today announced that the
Sultanate and Israel have signed and exchanged notes on exchanging
trade representations.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Omani Foreign Ministry issued today by the
official Oman News Agency said the step is to boost the peace
process in the Middle East for the achievement of a just and
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not say when and where Oman and Israel
will establish the trade missions in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
made a ground-breaking visit to the Sultanate of Oman for talks
with Sultan Qaboos Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Oman by an Israeli head of
government. Israel and Oman have no diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Oman was also the first Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country
to host an official Israeli delegation during multilateral
negotiations on water resources in April 1994.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Republicans to Raise Debt Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the Republican-led Congress to raise the federal debt
limit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that if Congress fails to raise the federal
borrowing limit by the end of next month, the government will no
longer be able to pay the interest on its debt.
</P>
<P>
The president's comments, made in his weekly radio address,
came the day after he signed legislation averting a third
government shutdown in three months and making available the money
needed to run the government until March 15.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a default is now possible with consequences that
would hurt the United States, its citizens and the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"So Congress should act responsibly," he said. "Let our
government pay its bills."
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole sought to assure financial
markets on Friday that Republicans would reach agreement with
Clinton over extending the government's 4.9 trillion dollars
borrowing limit and avoiding a first-ever federal default.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we can resolve this," Dole said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked Republicans to reopen negotiations for a
seven-year balanced budget, "My door is open; let's get back to
work," he said.
