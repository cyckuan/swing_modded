<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Supports Thailand's AIDS Vaccine Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) on Tuesday expressed its support for the
decision by Thailand to authorize large-scale human testing of an
experimental AIDS vaccine, the first such trial in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
"This trial signifies an important early step toward the
development of a safe and effective vaccine against HIV, an
essential strategy for bringing the epidemic under control," said
Dr Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we cannot fully predict this vaccine's
potential for protecting people against HIV," he said. "But we do
know this trial will provide important information that can help
us understand how this and other AIDS vaccines may work and how to
improve their efficacy in the future."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Piot said, the trial would help build the
foundation for future clinical vaccine trials in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will trial test the AIDSVAX vaccine developed by
VaxGen, Inc., of Brisbane, California, which began a large-scale
trial in the United States last June.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine to be tested in Thailand will differ from the
product tested in the U.S., to match the different strains of HIV
that exist in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The trial in Thailand will involve 2,500 volunteers who are at
higher risk from HIV infection because they inject drugs. The U.S.
trial involves 5,000 volunteers primarily at risk through sexual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS said that the only way to know if a vaccine is effective
in protecting people against HIV infection or disease is by
conducting large-scale trials on humans.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the first results from the AIDSVAX trials
would be available in two to three years.

<HEADLINE> France, Britain to Pressure Kosovo Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 9 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain
have decided to increase pressure on the Serb and ethnic Albanian
negotiators at the Kosovo peace conference here as they remain
deadlocked on the third full day of talks.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook returned to Rambouillet on Tuesday to discuss
with the international mediators how to pressure the two sides to
make concessions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill said Tuesday that although
progress was being made in the talks, the negotiations were going
ahead with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have stuck to their original stands, which
contrast with the peace proposals made by the six-nation Contact
Group for former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians have called for a referendum at the end of a
three-year interim period to determine the future of the province.
</P>
<P>
They have also called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to participate in signing a peace deal and to deploy troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
All these requirements have been poorly received by the
mediators, who prefer to see the talks go ahead within the
framework of the Contact Group proposal, which calls for
substantial self-rule but not independence.
</P>
<P>
Hill said that the mediators, who include himself, Russian
diplomat Boris Mayorski, and Austrian diplomat Walfgang Petritsch,
are entering a dangerous territory as they have begun answering
the comments by the two negotiating sides on the peace formula
presented by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The talks were opened solemnly last Saturday by French
President Jacques Chirac and the two foreign ministers and are
attended by a 13-member Yugoslav delegation and a 16-member ethnic
Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
The mediators have been talking with the delegations separately
as the Yugoslav side has refused to meet some members of the
Albanian delegation, who they said are members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
Belgrade regards the KLA as a terrorist group.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, British Officials Discuss Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Defense and Aviation
Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz Tuesday held talks with his
British counterpart George Robertson on the latest developments of
the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the clashes between Iraq and the
U.S.-British airplanes in the no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq, western diplomatic sources in Saudi capital Riyadh
told the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Robertson stressed Britain's keenness on
preserving the no-fly zones set up by the U.S. and its allies
after the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from alleged
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 for what Washington said
Iraq's noncooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors, who were
authorized to oversee Iraq's elimination of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the clashes between Iraq and the U.S.-British
warplanes in the no-fly zones took place every now and then.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who arrived in Riyadh earlier in the day, said
that Britain is trying to prevent Iraq from threatening the
security and stability of its neighbors and the region as a whole,
which he said was vital to the West.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said that Prince Sultan, who is also
Saudi Arabia's second deputy prime minister, briefed the British
defense secretary on his country's stance toward the situation in
the region. He said Riyadh was keen on solving the Iraqi crisis
through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed sympathy with the Iraqi people who are
suffering from the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which sparked the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Robertson said in Qatar, the first
leg of his current four-nation Gulf tour, that London and other
allied states consider the military action as the only way to get
Iraq comply with international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Robertson flew in Saudi Arabia from Kuwait, where he discussed
the current situation in the region with British military
commanders stationed at Ali Al-Salem airbase.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 British Royal Air Force Tornado fighter jets at
the base, some 60 kilometers north of Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
He will travel on to Bahrain after his Saudi visit.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Stranded as American Airlines Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines has left
thousands of passengers in the lurch after scratching over 1,000
flights due to higher-than-usual absenteeism among its pilots.
</P>
<P>
American canceled about 20 percent of its 2,250 flights on
Monday, 11 percent on Sunday and 4 percent on Saturday. Talks
between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association stalled late
last week.
</P>
<P>
More flights may be dropped on Tuesday, depending on how many
pilots call in sick or decline overtime assignments. The
cancellations have crippled the nation's second-largest airline,
with Miami and New York the hardest-hit sites.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines' pilots have been bickering with the
company's parent, AMR Corporation, saying American should more
quickly integrate pilots from Reno Air onto its roster.
</P>
<P>
AMR's bought a controlling stake in Reno Air last December for
124 million U.S. dollars. American's pilots said the purchase
violates their contract and may cause them to lose assignments and
jobs to lower-paid Reno Air pilots.
</P>
<P>
Reno Air pilots have their own gripes. They are particularly
unhappy that American pilots plan to place them onto the bottom of
the seniority list, leaving them with fewer scheduling choices.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, a number of American pilots are refusing to take
on extra flights. While American pilots are barred by federal law
from striking over the issue, they are allowed to refuse overtime.
</P>
<P>
AMR chief executive Donald Carty said Monday that the airline
was considering asking a court for an injunction against the
pilots' job action, but a decision has not yet been reached.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find no Chemicals at Bombed Sudan Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists found no traces
of chemical weapons compounds in a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant,
which was destroyed in August by U.S. cruise missiles, the New
Times said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was attacked by the
United States, alleging that its CIA intelligents had
clandestinely collected soil samples from the plant site to find
that these samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in
the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The attack was conducted on August 20 after two U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were devastated by terrorist
bombs. And Washington decided Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was
behind the bombing and the Sudanese plant was used by bin Laden
to produce chemical weapons compounds.
</P>
<P>
The plant owner, Salih Idris, flatly rejected U.S. allegations
and asked scientists to examine soil, sludge and debris from the
plant in a preparation to sue the United States.
</P>
<P>
The sampling project was designed and supervised by Professor
Thomas D. Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department as
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
Tullius said the point of what the scientists did was
to "carefully and scientifically collect samples from variety of
locations and have them analyzed by one of the top laboratories
in the world for this kind of work."
</P>
<P>
"What they found was that in those samples, to the practical
limits of scientific detection, there was no Empta or Empa, its
breakdown product," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. administration officials dismissed the findings,
noting that their soil samples were taken long after the United
States obtained its soil from the site and long after the
bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
Some other officials said they have strong evidence linking
the plant owner to bin Laden.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Vaccine Trials Not Yet in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of
Health and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa said Tuesday there are
no Zimbabweans on AIDS vaccine trials being conducted by foreign
researchers.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency that vaccine trials were an
ethical and controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have to safeguard our people," he said, adding "when
foreign researchers come we have to make ethical considerations
first."
</P>
<P>
Researchers on AIDS vaccines should carry out trials in their
countries first before inviting other countries to participate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The first AIDS trial in Africa began with a group of 40
Ugandans, the news agency quoted medical experts in U.S. as saying
recently,
</P>
<P>
An estimated 22 million people in all of sub-Saharan Africa are
said to be infected with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, about 1.4 million adults, 25.8 percent of sexually
active adults between 15 and 49 years are thought to be infected
with HIV. More than 700 people die every week from
HIV/Aids-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Grows 2.2. Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. productivity at nonfarm
businesses surged by 2.2 percent in 1998, the Labor Department
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year's increase in productivity marked a significant
improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997 and came close to
the 2.4 percent rise in 1996, the Department added.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1998, productivity surged at a
seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent annual rate, the best since the
first three months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to
prosperity and rising living standards. Sizable gains mean
companies can pay employees more, hold the line on prices and
still deliver increased profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and
benefits jumped 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer
of underlying inflation pressures, slowed. They rose 2 percent in
1998, compared with 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe productivity growth, driven by
computers and other high-tech innovations, is the key factor
behind the economy's ability to produce the lowest unemployment
rate in 29 years, the lowest sustained inflation since the 1960s
and the longest peacetime stretch of economic growth in history.
</P>
<P>
At factories, many of them hard hit by loss of export sales to
Asia and other parts of the world because of the financial crises,
productivity still increased a strong 4.3 percent in 1998, down
from a five-year high of 4.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing, fourth-quarter productivity grew at a 5.6
percent annual rate, the best in a year and a half.

<HEADLINE> Education Gap Widens in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the best and
worst schools in England was still too wide in spite of
significant improvements in teaching, Chief Inspector of Schools
Chris Woodhead said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report, Woodhead said the education system
remained a "lottery" in which schools serving similar communities
achieved widely varying results.
</P>
<P>
He said although great strides had been made in recent years,
much needed to be done to realize the government's vision of a
world-class education system.
</P>
<P>
"Too many headteachers do not really know what is happening in
the classrooms of their schools," said Woodhead, who heads the
Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). "This is a fundamental
weakness."
</P>
<P>
He said that the quality of teaching had improved significantly
since Ofsted inspections began five years ago, with far fewer
lessons being described as unsatisfactory by school inspectors.
</P>
<P>
But Woodhead added there was evidence that there were still
15,000 sub-standard teachers - around 4 percent of the total - at
work in England's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
While seven out of 10 secondary schools inspected during the
past year were improving their pupils' exam results, children at
one in 10 primary and secondary schools showed "substantial
underachievement," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Around 3 percent of primary and secondary schools failed their
inspection reports in 1997-98, little change from previous years.
</P>
<P>
The secondary schools which failed their inspections during the
past year had made little or no improvement since their previous
inspection.
</P>
<P>
"It is deeply depressing that some schools have deteriorated
since their first inspection," said Woodhead.

field, it would seek strength through partners.
</P>
<P>
The sector of the information and communications technology was

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government would
like to see prominent political personalities of the world, such
as U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair involved in a serious manner in the Cyprus peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides made the
remarks Tuesday in the wake of comments by U.S. State Department
special coordinator on Cyprus Thomas Miller that Clinton and Blair
would get personally involved in the efforts to settle the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We all wish to see important personalities of the
international political scene, such as the U.S. president and
the British premier, engaged in the Cyprus question in a pivotal
and serious role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides pointed out that any such engagement should be
within the framework of the U.N. Security Council resolutions and
the U.N. secretary-general's good offices mission.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that at this stage there is no
formal announcement about a specific initiative.
</P>
<P>
He said that when there is a more concrete and serious
initiative, there must be something beyond the verbal statements.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis, serving a
three-year jail sentence in Cyprus, will not appeal against their
sentence, their lawyer Antis Triantafyllides said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Triantafyllides said that he advised his clients not to file
an appeal to the Supreme Court "because it has no chance of
success."
</P>
<P>
Udi Hagov, 37 and Igal Damari, 49, were sentenced to three
years in jail for approaching a prohibited military area in
November 1998 and were also given six months in prison for
possessing banned listening equipment without the permission of
the Cypriot authorities. Their sentences run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
Both were arrested by police in early November 1998. Initial
charges of espionage were dropped by the prosecution and they
pleaded guilty to the two charges they were convicted for.
</P>
<P>
Triantafyllides said the Assize Court decision was correct in
legal terms and the ruling presented the facts of the case in the
right context, therefore the appeal would not succeed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Concludes Visit in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. presidential envoy
to the Great Lakes region, Howard Wolpe, said here Tuesday that
the settlement of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) will bring peace to the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Wolpe made the remarks when concluding his 24-hour working
visit in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that leaders of the countries
involved in the conflict have expressed their willingness to sign
a ceasefire agreement regarding the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy believed that a peace transition in the DRC
depends on the withdrawal of all foreign troops in the vast
central African country before essential issues leading to the
conflict could be tackled.
</P>
<P>
The armed rebellion in the DRC which started last August has
seen Rwanda and Uganda backing the rebels while Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia had sent troops to prop up DRC President Laurent
Kabila
</P>
<P>
Wolpe admitted that the current wars in the Great Lakes region
have their backgrounds and causes, which are in turn related.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Angola, Wolpe met with the new Angolan
Foreign Minister Joao Miranda and General Secretary of the ruling
People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola Joao Lourenco.
However, he would not reveal any details of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who arrived here Monday, is on a five-week
African tour aiming at finding a way out for the military
conflicts in the DRC. He had already visited Rwanda and the DRC
and will go on to Uganda and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Angolan government announced that
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for African Affairs Witmey
Schneidman will arrive here Wednesday for discussions on current
political and military situation in Angola.

</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the miserable situation in Afghanistan,
he said that unfortunately, civil war and fratricide turned the
country into a bitter tragedy and the extent of bloodshed is
growing day by day.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, chairman of Iran's powerful advisory State
Expediency Council (SEP), stressed that use of force and violence
will get nowhere in Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Now after years of civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan, it
has become clear to all factions and ethnical entities that
fighting and violence will not bring victory," he said, adding
that "and there is no other alternative but participation of all
factions to establish peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The SEP chief also noted that unilateral support for a
specific group in Afghanistan is also futile.
</P>
<P>
Some neighboring states have reached the conclusion that
backing an Afghan group and ignoring the others will not solve
any problem, but on the contrary will aggravate the situation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called on the neighboring states to prepare the
ground for a national reconciliation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran's stance that a broad-based government
should be formed in Afghanistan with the participation of all Afghan
political and ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Livestock Breeder Show Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A three-day national livestock
breeder show opened here in the Kenyan capital Tuesday,
attracting entries from the cross section of cattle and goat.
</P>
<P>
On exhibition are some 500 heads of dairy and beef cattle and
goat breeds in different age groups from 13 small and large farms
across the country, an official with the show's organizing
committee told Xinhua, saying the event is the largest livestock
show this year.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the show, Kenyan Agricultural Minister
Musalia Mudavadi said the cattle industry in the country is the
most developed among the livestock sectors in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The livestock sector accounts for more than 10 percent of
Kenya's gross domestic product, said the minister, adding that the
sector also employs over half the country's rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Kenya has a cattle population of some 13
million, of which 3.2 million are dairy cattle with an annual
milk production of 2.39 billion litres. Currently Kenya is
largely self-sufficient in meat and milk.
</P>
<P>
Kenya boasts of its cattle breeds or crossbreeds. Its improved
Boran was once winner at the shows in Zimbabwe and Australia, and
is considered one of the most hardy, disease-resistant and fertile
cattle breeds in the world. Some of the country's cattle breeds
have been exported to Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During the event, auctions and a seminar will also be held.
Topics at the seminar scheduled for February 11 will focus on
progress in animal genetics, marketing, economic nutrition and dry
weather feeding, immunization and fertility in cattle.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Declares Eritrean Ambassador as Persona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
announced Tuesday that Eritrean Ambassador to Ethiopia Girma
Asmerom has been declared persona non grata and should leave
Ethiopia within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the ministry said ambassador Girma
"has been declared persona non grata for conducts unbecoming of a
diplomat and for activities incompatible with his status as a
diplomatic agent of Eritrea to Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
The government of Ethiopia has decided that ambassador Girma
leave Ethiopia within 24 hours as of February 10, at 2 p.m., said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian ambassador to Eritrea has been recalled back to
Ethiopia following the border dispute broke out in May last year.
Ethiopia has been represented by a charge d'affaires in Asmara who
is incidentally the sole Ethiopian diplomat in Asmara, according
to the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia's efforts to send another diplomat in Asmara who also
would have served as the head of mission could not materialize
because of lack of response from Asmara to requests made by
Ethiopia twice which amounted to Eritrean rejection of two names
submitted to it for approval," said the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month border dispute renewed as fighting broke out on
February 6. Ethiopia defense forces have captured three Eritrean
strongholds of Geza Gerlase, Konin and Konito during the first
three-day fighting on the common border, according to
announcements made by the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Yields to Be Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Forecast yields for Zimbabwe's
top foreign currency earning tobacco crops for 1999 have been
revised downwards by eight percent due to damage caused by the
non-stop rains falling in most parts of the country, the Zimbabwe
Tobacco Association (ZTA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the largest tobacco marketing countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the planting season, more than 4,000
commercial and small-scale farmers had expected to harvest about
200 million kilograms of tobacco, but ZTA said this figure had
been revised down to 185 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"The figure could still come down as the rains continue to
affect leaf development of the late crop while it makes it
difficult to harvest the ready crop," said ZTA marketing
information director Patrick Davies.
</P>
<P>
He said the affected crop was 35 percent of the total tobacco
planted.
</P>
<P>
"The crop that was planted in September and October had good
leaf development and has better weight than that of last year, but
it is the crop planted in November that is now being affected by
cold soils caused by incessant rains," he said.
</P>
<P>
The final assessment of the crop situation would be made in
mid-March, but there were indications that if world prices did not
dramatically increase from last year's average 1.72 U.S. Dollars
per kilogram, this year' s total earnings could be far less than
last year.

<HEADLINE> SPD Offers Nationality Law Deal after Election Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- German Social Democratic (SPD)
being in power will hold talks with Germany's opposition Christian
Democratic alliance (CDU/CSU) to reach a compromise on a more
limited reform of the nation's nationality law.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just about political parties -- We need a
consensus in our society in order to integrate foreigners," Oskar
Lafontaine, the SPD's chairman and German finance minister told
reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said the SPD had agreed to discuss changes to the
government's controversial citizenship reform proposal with other
parties in parliament.
</P>
<P>
SPD lost his majority in parliament's upper chamber on Sunday
after the SPD was defeated in Hesse state elections. The
Bundesrat, or upper house, has got 69 seats, representing the 16
states and must approve most domestic legislation.
</P>
<P>
After the Hesse state elections, the seats of the German
rot-green alliance being in power were down from 38 to 33 in the
Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
Through its Bundesrat blocking minority the opposition
Christian Democratic alliance can now prevent passage of the
government's citizenship reform, tax reform and plans to close
Germany's nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
However, with a further six state elections due this year,
Lafontaine underscored that the SPD could win back the upper house
majority.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said the SPD had lost in Hesse due to wide
opposition to Bonn's plan to offer dual-nationality to about half
of Germany's 7.3 million foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Promote Edible Oil Production: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will step up
production of its oil-bearing crops and their research under the
country's farming plan, Minister of Agriculture and Fishery Jose
Do Rosario said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rosario was speaking at an international seminar on sunflower
and other oilseed crops in developing countries in which about 100
experts and officials from all over the world attended. The
seminar is held in a bid to exchange experiences in the
production, processing and study of oil-bearing crops, and find
out the orientation for the research of the industry in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the four-day seminar, which opened
here Tuesday, the Mozambican Minister said he hoped that
participants can benefit from the exchange of experiences in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said that agriculture, which is the basis of Mozambique
with most of its population involved, should be given special
attention.
</P>
<P>
The climate in Mozambique is very good for sunflower
cultivation and the country is trying hard to restore the original
position of sunflower in its economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has to spend about 4.6 million U.S. Dollars annually
on importing sunflower seeds for its edible oil market, along with
others like beans and coconut oil, the minister said.

</P>
<P>
The premier, on a working visit here, said he had fruitful

<HEADLINE> Greece to Undertake Full Commitments on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece will carry out all the
commitments on the deployment of the Russian anti-aircraft missile
system on Greek Crete island, Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis
Chrysostomis was quoted as saying Tuesday in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis and his Greek counterpart Apostolos Tsohatzopoulos
signed an agreement Monday to enable the S-300 missiles to be
deployed on the Crete, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Greece will assume all the
responsibilities of Cyprus stipulated in the Cypriot-Russian deal
on the missiles, the agency said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the missiles from Russia in 1997 to cement its
defense capability and they had been originally scheduled to be
shipped to Cyprus by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey had since threatened to launch pre-emptive strikes
if the missiles were deployed on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides made a last minute decision
on December 28, 1998 to cancel the deployment of the missiles on
Cyprus and Greece agreed to allow the missiles to be transferred
to its Crete island.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis stressed that the missile's deployment on the
Crete will benefit the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian and Cypriot technicians on the system will go to Crete
to train Greeks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said Monday that the missiles will remain the
property of the Republic of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Missile Site Attacked by Allied Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi military spokesman
announced on Tuesday that U.S. and British warplanes attacked an
Iraqi missile site and air defense sites in the north and south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that initial analysis showed that "an enemy
plane" was downed by Iraqi anti-aircraft force.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that 11
formations of "enemy planes" from a Turkish air base violated
Iraq's northern airspace at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) and fired
missiles at Iraqi air defense sites near Mosul, the largest city
in the north.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi defense units counter-attacked the enemy
planes and forced them to flee.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said other enemy planes approached and attacked
an Iraqi missile site in the north at 12:40 p.m. (0940 GMT). The
Iraqis fired missiles in response and shot down a warplane, he
said, without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Twelve formations of enemy planes from Saudi and Kuwaiti air
bases violated Iraq's southern airspace at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT),
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, with
a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds and Shiite Muslims from
"Baghdad suppression."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain staged a joint military operation against
Iraq in mid-December to punish it for what they called
non-cooperation in U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq became more defiant, announcing that it does not recognize
the no-fly zones and will fire at U.S. and British jets entering
Iraqi air space. Clashes between Iraqi air defense and U.S. and
British warplanes have since ensued.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has posted awards for anyone
who shoots down U.S. or British planes, or missiles, or capture
their pilots.

<HEADLINE> EU Tries to Make Spending Transparent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here on Tuesday that it had adopted an Annual Evaluation Review and
the Annual Evaluation Program for 1999 in a bid to provide a public
source of information in order to enhance accountability and
transparency of European Union (EU) spending.
</P>
<P>
The Annual Review presents an inventory of evaluation projects
carried out on the EU actions and programs in 1998 and their
results. The commission, the EU's executive body, said the reports
on evaluation show that substantial progress has been made and most
policy areas have a well established evaluation function by now,
while program management has been markedly improved.
</P>
<P>
The commission also acknowleged that the state of the evaluation
function still varies between services and that some need to step up
their efforts further.
</P>
<P>
So far, the commission said, the value added in the context of
setting budget priorities has been limited. Furthermore, the
modalities for using evaluation for resource allocation in the
commission have not yet been fully clarified and agreed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EU body mainly for proposing and enforcing
legislation believes further steps should be taken to ensure that
evaluation would provide input also for addressing questions such as
comparing the effectiveness of programs or downsizing or phasing out
certain actions.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
denied that it was considering to offer food to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in exchange for access to an
underground site, which it believed could be part of a revived
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is to provide food on a humanitarian basis and we
do not link it to other issues.... We are not prepared to pay for
access to the site," a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Times, an English-language South Korean daily, said
Tuesday that the United States planned to persuade the DPRK to
allow inspection of the underground site by offering an additional
200,000 tons of grain to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
It said the chief U.S. negotiator with the DPRK, Charles
Kartman, revealed the plan during a meeting with South Korean and
Japanese officials.
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said the World Food Program sent
out an appeal for food aid for the DPRK for this year and the
United Stated had not responded to it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. response would be based only on an assessment of the
humanitarian needs of the DPRK, he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Tuesday that multilateral development
cooperation "remains a crucial path towards the safe and stable
world to which we aspire."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks in an address to the Ad Hoc Working
Group on Financing for Development, an open-ended body set up
under a resolution adopted by the 52nd General Assembly session.
The speech was delivered on behalf of the secretary-general by
Nitin Desai, under-secretary-general for economic and social
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The session was jointly organized by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the Economic Commission for Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Development cooperation emerged during the early years of the
United Nations as a way of expressing a global commitment to
economic and social progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
As "the people of the developing countries are impatient for
development," multilateral development cooperation is very
important, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For it remains a crucial path towards the safe and stable
world to which we aspire; a world not only of competition but of
solidarity; a world where we not only support each other in
emergencies, but work collectively and preventively to improve
standards of living and bring peace and opportunity to all the
world's people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To succeed in this endeavor, however, we need to rethink
development cooperation and the role the United Nations should
play in it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to find a basis for development cooperation today that
is relevant for realities of tomorrow," he said. "There lies the
challenge for this forum: to bring forward ideas that are
promising but have not yet been adequately developed; and to
breathe life into the cause of development cooperation in a way
that will capture the imagination of the world community."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artist Looks Back On Odyssey From West Lake To La Seine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zao Wou-Ki, the Chinese lyric
abstractionist who lives in France, will have a one-month
retrospective show of 60 years of work at the China Art Gallery,
from February 11.
</P>
<P>
Zao studied at the Hangzhou Arts College, near West lake,
before going to Paris in 1948 to expand his artistic horizons. The
Creuze Gallery sponsored his first show in Paris in 1949, marking
the beginning of his career in Western art circles and major
galleries and museums in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This exhibition of 103 paintings is being sponsored by China's
Culture Ministry and France's Foreign Affairs Ministry. President
Jiang Zemin has commented on Zao's work and its combining of
Western and Eastern art with his innovations. President Jacques
Chirac has praised Zao's genius in "understanding the souls of
both the Chinese and French...strengthening the ties between the
two countries and widening the dialog between the two cultures
which attract each other..."
</P>
<P>
Zao's early work showed traces of Matisse and Picasso. Then,
during his Paris days, he was influenced by the theory that the "
artist should not only describe the visible, but make the unseen
visible." He also began to explore abstract painting, relying more
and more on dots and irregular forms to convey his feelings. Later,
he shifted to more free-form painting, using sharp colors, complex
lines, and outlandish compositions to express feelings of illusion.
</P>
<P>
As his art matured, Zao tried to use his paintings to represent
nature and man as one as expressed in Oriental philosophy. He
explained once: "If I cannot deny the influence of Paris in my
journey as an artist, I must admit that I've found a new Chinese
culture while delving deeper into Western art. Paradoxically, this
return owes a lot to Paris."
</P>
<P>
But at a news conference today, in reply to a question about
the relation between cultures east and west in his works, this 78-
year-old artist just smiled and said, "Your question is too
profound for me to answer. Anyway, You may find some inspirations
in tomorrow's show."

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Development of New Satellite Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
governments should press ahead in developing the next generation
of satellite technology in order to improve safety, generate jobs
and avoid problems stemming from dependence on U.S. and Russian
satellites over which Europe has no control, the European
Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body, in a proposal for the Galileo project,
asked the 15 EU member states to give their political and
financial backing to a Europe-developed, state-of-the-art Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for the next century.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Neil Kinnock said that as the Internet
has revolutionized electronic communication, global satellite
systems are revolutionizing navigation.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must put itself in a position to capture a fair share
of a world market that could be worth an estimated 40,000 million
euros within a few years and would offer the potential to generate
quality jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Europe also must have control of the systems on which safe
movement by air, land and water transport will increasingly depend,
" he said. "That cannot happen without combined and consistent
political action."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner pointed out that failure to act now would mean
missing a huge and probably unrepeatable opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"The investment needed, less than 3,000 million euros, is not
unbearable since it would be spread between 15 member states over
ten years. And the return would be immense," Kinnock added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, GNSS has major strategic, political and commercial
implications for EU's capacity to control positioning, navigation
and precision timing services for its own territory, for
supporting economic growth and employment by giving industries the
chance to compete in this high technology sector, and for ensuring
that EU users have a system that suits their needs.
</P>
<P>
European Commission officials also said the fundamental issues
that the Galileo project addresses are how to best ensure that the
major strategy, political and commercial interests of the EU are
safeguarded, and how Europe can play an effective role in the long-
term development of GNSS.

<HEADLINE> First Ever Indo-Pak Parliamentary Conference to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The first ever Indo-Pak
Parliamentary Conference will be held here on February 12-13 which
is going to be attended by about 100 members of both houses of
parliaments of Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Imtiaz Aalam, organizer of the conference, said here Wednesday
at a news briefing that the response from almost all the major
parties of the two countries have been overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
More than 35 members representing major Indian parties,
including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main
opposition Congress Party, will attend the conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first ever non-official dialogue among the
elected representatives of Pakistan and India on major issues that
confront the two south Asian nations, said Aalam.
</P>
<P>
There has always been a need for a dialogue between the elected
representatives of the two neighboring countries to evolve a
deeper understanding on major issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Aalam, the agenda for detente (peace and security)
format and procedural details of the conference will be worked out
by the two sides. The conference will be co-chaired by senior
parliamentarians of Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
He said that 20 members from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League
(PML) will attend the forthcoming meeting, while the main
opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP) led by former prime
minister Benazir Mhutto will also take part in the event.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Hold Meeting for Greater Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies held
the first regional inter-agency coordination meeting here on
Tuesday with U.N. reform as one of the central themes.
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement, Louise Frechette, the deputy
secretary-general of the United Nations, noted that the regional
consultation meetings responded to a decision by the Economic and
Social Council in the context of its review of the U.N. reform
launched by Secretary-General Kofi Annan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on Tuesday involved the area covered by the
Economic Commission for Europe (ECE). It was the first in a series
of coordination meetings at the regional level. Other meetings are
scheduled to be held in the other regions of the world later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
The ECE regional meeting brought together representatives from
the European Offices of some 20 U.N. funds, programs and
specialized agencies.
</P>
<P>
Following a lively exchange of views, it was agreed that there
was a need for the U.N. organizations to further develop the
dialogue at the regional level in order to collectively improve
their common understanding of each region's needs, trends and
challenges, leading periodically to a joint assessment of the
economic and social situation therein.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that this could lead to shared goals and to
sharper policy dialogues in the region. It was clear that the
resident coordinator system needed to be supported by all to
strengthen the U.N. support at national level.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Postpones Decision on Thailand's GSP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
postponed its final decision on whether it will cut its trade
privileges under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) from
three items of Thai exports this year, a senior Foreign Ministry
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu Rienmahasarn, deputy director-general of the Department
of Foreign Trade, said that the postponement was due to
Washington's consent with Thailand's progress in improving labor
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The American Federation of Labor Congress of Industry
Organization (AFL-CIO) filed a petition to the Office of U.S.
Trade Representatives (USTR) urging the USTR to withdraw Thailand
from the GSP list for three export items, including fans with an
electric motor, watertight gloves for snow sports, and transistor
as well as television and radio receivers.
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO claimed that Thailand violated human rights in 1991
because it passed laws restricting the right of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu said that Washington had pledged to wait until the Thai
Parliament passes the State Enterprise Relations Bill before
announcing its final decision on the AFL-CIO petition.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, allowing state enterprises employees to form unions,
was already passed in the House of Representative and the Senate
is expected to pass the Bill in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Export values of the three items in 1998 were said to surpass
the limits set by the U.S. government. Washington has policy to
end GSP for any foreign export whose market share exceeds 50
percent or its export value surpasses 14 million U.S. dollar a
year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the export value of Thai fans with electric motor
was 59.51 million dollars with an 8.7 percent market share, while
those of watertight gloves for snow sports and transistors as well
as television and radio receivers amounted to 10.54 million
dollars and 8.41 million dollars with a 46.6-percent and a
52.8-percent market share respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prices for the three products could increase by 2.1 percent to
4.7 percent if their GSP concessions are removed, Pisanu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Due to interference by the
central bank and the release of foreign aid, Zambia's currency,
Kwacha, has appreciated against the U.S. Dollar and other hard
currencies.
</P>
<P>
It is found Wednesday that in the capital city Lusaka, middle
rate of Kwacha against the Dollar is at about 2370 in commercial
banks, up from about 2600 Kwacha to the Dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in bureaux de charge Kwacha has appreciated from
2610 last week to 2385 against the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Kwacha devalued by 69 percent against the Dollar
due to the fall of the country's export earings and no balance of
payment support from donors.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's central bank, the Bank of Zambia, released 9.3 million
U.S. Dollars last Friday onto the foreign exchange market in an
effort to stabilize the exchange rate of Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it will continue to interfere in the
country's foreign exchange market when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the World Bank released 117 million U.S. Dollars of
aid to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Party Members Need To Stick To Deng's Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, who is a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, told a gathering of Party and
government veterans today that Communist Party members need to
hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for outstanding
achievements to greet the coming 50th anniversary of the founding
of the New China.
</P>
<P>
Party members need to follow the Party Central Committee's
requirements, unify their thought, seize opportunities, unite
together as one, work diligently for new victories in the reforms,
opening-up, and modernization to greet the coming 50th anniversary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China managed to maintain a continuous economic growth last
year in spite of the Asian financial crisis, the worsening
international economic situation, and devastating floods, he said,
and this year will be special because of the many major events.
</P>
<P>
Doing this year's work well is significant for the Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000) and for being sure that China enters the 21
st century in a more active way, he said. So, the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory needs to be held high, and the basic Party line
implemented unswervingly, the nucleus of economic construction
grasped firmly, the reforms and opening-up continued, and they
need to try hard to achieve stable economic growth and ensure
social and political stability.
</P>
<P>
Although there are contradictions and difficulties of one kind
or another and predictable and unpredictable risks, he said, China
will withstand various tests under the leadership of the Party and
with all the people unified.
</P>
<P>
He urged Party officials to keep in close contact with the
people, to listen to their voices, to serve them, and to help them
diligently, especially impoverished people, people laid off by
state-owned enterprises, and retirees.
</P>
<P>
The key to fulfilling this year's tasks lies in strengthening
and improving Party leadership, enhancing the Party, and making
full use of Party organizations at all levels, Hu said, and he
praised retirees for their contributions to the independence and
liberation of the Chinese nation, to the founding of New China and
the socialist cause, and to the reforms, opening-up, and
modernization.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Celebrating New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans who have returned from
overseas got together with relatives of Tibetans overseas today to
celebrate the coming Spring Festival and the Tibetan New Year.
</P>
<P>
Basang, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Communist Party Committee who is in charge of returning Tibetan
affairs, said that the year 1999 has special significance for the
Tibetans because it is the 40th anniversary of the democratic
reforms in Tibet and the 50th anniversary of the founding of New
China.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now enjoys political stability, economic growth, and
unity among all ethnic groups, and its achievements of the past 40
years show that Tibet can have a glorious future and that the
Tibetans can prosper only within the big family of the socialist
motherland led by the CPC, Basang said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Tibetans overseas have come back to visit
relatives and friends, make a religious pilgrimage, or do business
and have seen with their own eyes that great changes have taken
place in Tibet since China began its market reforms and opening-up
20 years ago and that people's religious freedoms are fully
protected.
</P>
<P>
The participants praised the CPC's policies on national and
ethnic affairs and its religious policies in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artist Looks Back On Odyssey From West Lake To La Seine            By Lin Gu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zao Wou-Ki, the Chinese lyric
abstractionist who lives in France, will have a one-month
retrospective show of 60 years of work at the China Art Gallery,
from February 11.
</P>
<P>
Zao studied at the Hangzhou Arts College, near West lake,
before going to Paris in 1948 to expand his artistic horizons. The
Creuze Gallery sponsored his first show in Paris in 1949, marking
the beginning of his career in Western art circles and major
galleries and museums in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This exhibition of 103 paintings is being sponsored by China's
Culture Ministry and France's Foreign Affairs Ministry. President
Jiang Zemin has commented on Zao's work and its combining of
Western and Eastern art with his innovations. President Jacques
Chirac has praised Zao's genius in "understanding the souls of
both the Chinese and French...strengthening the ties between the
two countries and widening the dialog between the two cultures
which attract each other..."
</P>
<P>
Zao's early work showed traces of Matisse and Picasso. Then,
during his Paris days, he was influenced by the theory that the "
artist should not only describe the visible, but make the unseen
visible." He also began to explore abstract painting, relying more
and more on dots and irregular forms to convey his feelings. Later,
he shifted to more free-form painting, using sharp colors, complex
lines, and outlandish compositions to express feelings of illusion.
</P>
<P>
As his art matured, Zao tried to use his paintings to represent
nature and man as one as expressed in Oriental philosophy. He
explained once: "If I cannot deny the influence of Paris in my
journey as an artist, I must admit that I've found a new Chinese
culture while delving deeper into Western art. Paradoxically, this
return owes a lot to Paris."
</P>
<P>
But at a news conference today, in reply to a question about
the relation between cultures east and west in his works, this 78-
year-old artist just smiled and said, "Your question is too
profound for me to answer. Anyway, You may find some inspirations
in tomorrow's show."

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Keppel Corporation Expects to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 10 (Xinhua) --The Keppel Corporation
Limited, one of the giant local corporations in Singapore,
announced here Wednesday that the group is expected to return to a
reasonable level of profitability in 1999 although the impact of
the regional crisis will continue to be felt.
</P>
<P>
The group's Chairman Lim Chee An and Group Finance Director Teo
Soon Hoe made the point at a press conference organized to release
the group's full year financial statement and dividend
announcement for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two men said the group managed to get a revenue of 3.5
billion Singapore dollars (about 2.08 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998 which was about the same level as that of 1997 despite the
group's performance in the second half last year was severely
affected by the worsening of the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Teo elaborated that in 1998 the group's total loss was 224
million Singapore dollars (about 133.3 million U.S. dollars) at
the attributable level, including the extraordinary items of 7.9
million Singapore dollars (about 4.7 million U.S dollars),
representing mainly provisions for closure and divestment of
unprofitable or peripheral activities.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of the group in 1999, Lim expected the group's
performance will be underpinned by the non-recurrence of
exceptional provisions and operating costs will be much lower
following measures implemented internally and by the government.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing or planned merger involving the group's major
sectors will benefit the group significantly, he said
</P>
<P>
Lim also vowed that the group will continue its efforts to
restructure and expand its core activities, to remove
cross-holdings and to eliminate unprofitable and peripheral
operation.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Scores Injured in Hartal in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The second day of the three-day
hartal (general strike) in Bangladesh called by the opposition
alliance claimed one more life and left scores of others injured
across the country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A student leader of the Feni Town unit of Bangladesh Chatra
League was gunned down in Feni, some 136 kilometers southeast of
here, while he was returning home in a rickshaw, and one person
was arrested from the scene, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition -- the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jammat-e-Islami, the Islami Oikya Jote and others, originally
called a 48-hour countrywide hartal to press home their four-point
demand, including replacement of the chief election commissioner,
for joining the country's municipal elections scheduled to be held
later this month.
</P>
<P>
They extended the hartal by 12 hours on Tuesday night, on the
ground that one student of a pro-opposition organization was shot
dead during the first day of the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, life was fairly normal on Wednesday with
increased vehicular movement on the streets, attendance in offices
despite sporadic incidents of violence, and banks, financial
institutions and most private offices operating normally.
</P>
<P>
At least 200 others were injured in Bangladesh on Tuesday
during the first day of the opposition-sponsored hartal, and over
100 people were arrested in the capital on charges of violence,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Solution for Kosovo Must Lie Within Serbia: Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Wednesday that the future of Kosovo must be within
Serbia, and demanded that ethnic Albanians publicly give up their
demand for independence at the talks in France, Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos, Milosevic said "the only way to secure successful
solution to problems in southern Serbian province" is to have the
two delegations and international mediators pledge that Kosovo
will remain in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Both Milosevic and Pangalos agreed that the international
community must take an impartial stance in the process of
political talks on the Kosovo dispute and back an earlier peace
deal signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
Balkan envoy Richard Holbrooke in October.
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments are proposing to put as many as 30,000
peacekeepers in the southern Serbian province to police a peace
agreement which separatist ethnic Albanians and Serbs are under
pressure to conclude at talks underway in France.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Tuesday
Yugoslavia would not allow foreign peacekeeping troops into Kosovo
under any terms.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with his Greek counterpart,
Jovanovic said the October agreement "defined the nature and scope
of the international presence", referring to the international
verification mission already in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos reaffirmed that Greece, a traditional friend of
Yugoslavia's, opposed sending troops to the Serbian province
against the will of Belgrade.

KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda (BOU) has
warned commercial banks across the country that it will cancel
their licences if their computer systems are not adjusted for the
year 2000 by May this year.
</P>
<P>
The BOU is serious on the matter and there will be no
compromise, Radio Uganda quoted BOU spokesman Walugembe Musoke as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the banking sector has already had too many
problems and cannot afford another crisis by being complacent
about the matter.
</P>
<P>
The work to make Uganda's 21 commercial banks year 2000
compliant, which began in 1998, must be completed by solving the
computer problems in all those banks.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem is a product of several programmable
devices which have been discovered unable to roll over to the year
2000 unaided.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Base Ground Troops on Peace Deal: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said on Wednesday that only a signed peace
accord from the Rambouillet talks would serve as the basis for its
deployment of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
An official made the remark after a meeting of the North
Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The official said the peace deal would not only stipulate, like
the Dayton peace accord, the operation of the peace implementation
force in Kosovo, but also the obligations of the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO decision-makers were "fairly encouraged" by the
Rambouillet peace conference as the talks had got a fairly sound
start and a peace process was seriously launched.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to some press reports, the official noted, NATO
was actually stepping up its preparation of the ground troops in
the event of the signing of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"NATO cannot afford a vacuum between the signing of the peace
deal and the start of peace implementation," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The alliance had to be ready as soon as the peace deal was
signed. "When Rambouillet is ready, NATO will be ready as well,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been studying action plans for the deployment of peace
implementation troops in Kosovo. "NATO is considering the three-
tier extraction force and the deployment of ground troops in
parallel," said the official who added that the alliance had to
work out a contingency plan for the advance ground deployment.
</P>
<P>
NATO was inclined to use the extraction force now based in
Macedonia to serve as the advance element of the peace
implementation force.
</P>
<P>
Asked what NATO would do if the Yugoslav authorities rejected
NATO's deployment of ground troops, the official said that only
the final word of the Rambouillet talks mattered. He cited Dayton
as a precedent that Yugoslavia finally changed its approach toward
the deployment of NATO ground troops.
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait and see," said the official.

BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Chinese Soccer
Conference will be held in east China's port city Qingdao on March
3-5, the Chinese Football Association (CFA) said in a statement
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference, which was inaugurated in 1994 when the
CFA introduced professional league to the country, will focus on
solving the probelms emerging in the professionalization and
setting new goals for 1999, the statement said.

China, which has never qualified for the World Cup finals,

where its team was criticised as "the most unimpressive eleven".
China's top goal this year is to reach the 2000 Sydney Olympic
Games, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But its Olympic team, coached by Briton Bobby Houghton,
recently suffered another blow when they lost twice to arch-rivals
South Korea in a space of 10 days in the Dunhill Cup in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Beijing to Do Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged Beijing, the Chinese capital, to completely implement
the guidelines of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China and make the capital even more prosperous and
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, made the remark during an inspection tour of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing achieved new progress in economic growth, re-employment
of laid-off state-owned enterprise workers, urban construction and
administration, air pollution control, and in maintaining
stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing should pay great attention to agriculture and rural
work and completely implement the guidelines of the 3rd plenum of
the 15th CPC Central Committee and the Party's policies in the
countryside, as suburban areas account for more than 90 percent of
the city's total area, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that efforts should be made to explore new subjects in
deepening rural reforms, accelerate agriculture-related scientific
and technological advances, promote agricultural industrialization,
raise the science and technology content in agriculture, increase
agricultural vitality and farmers' income, and strive for
agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
He urged continued efforts for the "Vegetable Basket" Project
to increase vegetable varieties and improve quality of the
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
At present, special efforts should be made to ensure the
vegetable supply during the upcoming lunar year Spring Festival,
the country's traditional three-day holiday which falls on
February 16-18, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The President also said that great importance should be
attached to the establishment and development of new and high
technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We must proceed from the strategic need of trans-century
development and aim at the forward development of the world
science and technology and lay stress on priority projects and
concentrate our efforts to achieve breakthroughs," he said, adding
that Beijing, which is strong in terms of talents, science and
technology, and knowledge, should draft a new program for a faster
scientific and technological development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing should increase its contact with science
research institutes and institutions of higher learning to bring
into full play the initiative of all sectors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, efforts should be made to use overseas
successful experience in creating science city so as to establish
science and technology parks with Chinese characteristics, the
President said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government has decided to hold grand
and warm celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding
of New China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
It is both an honor and arduous task for Beijing to be
responsible for most of the celebrations, Jiang said, urging
Beijing to formulate a careful plan and make fine organization and
preparations.
</P>
<P>
As the national capital and political and cultural center of
China, Beijing is an important window of China's reform, opening-
up and socialist modernization construction, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He called on people in Beijing to do all of this year's work
well, continue reforms, open up wider, boost economic growth, step
up urban construction and administration, ensure a good public
order, and maintain stability.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Jiang, who is also Chairman of the
Central Military Commission, called on the officers and men of the
armed police to arm themselves with Deng Xiaoping Theory during a
visit to an armed police unit in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that armed police have made new progress in recent
years in ideological and political buildup, in training and
management.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the contribution of the armed police to
safeguarding social stability and guaranteeing the smooth progress
of reforms, opening-up and modernization drive.

The Washington Post:

Olympic scandal on Tuesday presented a 300-page report documenting

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was slightly
wounded Wednesday when his post on the verge of the Israeli
occupied zone in south Lebanon was shelled by Lebanese guerrillas,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war
against Israeli troops and its allied South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
The attack has raised to six the number of the Israeli soldiers
wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Mayors Send Protest Letters to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The mayors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki,two Japanese cities once hit by U.S. atomic bombs, sent
protest letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton Wednesday for
subcritical nuclear tests conducted by the United States on
Tuesday, the Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the president, Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka
demanded the U.S. end all nuclear testing and called on Washington
to work for nuclear disarmament, Kyodo quoted Hiroshima municipal
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hiraoka expressed his anger at the test as it was conducted
despite ongoing negotiations in Geneva to ban the production of
fissile materials for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito also criticized the U.S. for
disregarding the efforts of people around the world working toward
nuclear disarmament, municipal officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, municipal officials from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
only two cities ever to have been subject to atomic attack, urged
the government to call on the U.S. and Russia, who has also
recently conducted nuclear tests, to immediately halt all nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
About 20 members of the anti-nuclear group Japan Council
Against A and H Bombs, including the group's secretary general,
Koichi Akamatsu, visited the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to deliver a
protest letter urging the U.S. to discontinue its testing and
development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Other anti-nuclear groups also conducted protests in front of
the embassy in Tokyo's Minato Ward, while local groups in
Hiroshima have scheduled a protest at the city's Peace Memorial
Park.
</P>
<P>
The test, conducted at a site in Nevada, was the country's
sixth subcritical nuclear test. The experiments are called
subcritical because no critical mass is formed and therefore no
self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction occurs.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Man Gets Jail Term In China For Bigamy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese man, Watanabe
Nutsuyoshi, was sentenced to three months in prison for bigamy in
Shanghai today, and will be expelled from China after serving his
term.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Intermediate People's Court No.1 found that Watanabe
registered to marry a Chinese woman, Song Juru, in Tianjin, after
meeting her through a matrimonial agency in Japan. They married in
April of 1994. Song had a daughter, Yu Enying, residing in Japan,
who paid 900,000 yen to the matrimonial agency for service charges.
</P>
<P>
After their marriage, Song went to Japan, where, to her
surprise, she found that Watanabe had married another Chinese
woman just two months after he registered to marry her, by forging
her signature and going through divorce formalities.
</P>
<P>
So, Japanese police arrested Song and her daughter in January
of 1996 for falsified documents and a court decided that her
marriage to Watanabe was not valid, and the two ended up serving
prison terms in Japan, during which, Song's daughter gave birth to
a girl. They were released in January of 1998.
</P>
<P>
After returning to China, Song found that Watanabe had married
a third Chinese woman in May of 1995 and she filed suit against
him. Watanabe was detained at Hongqiao Airport while trying to go
to Japan in October and was ordered to appear in court.

CHONGQING, China, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The controversial

Dalian Wanda drew South Korea's Pusan Daewoo 2-2 in the quarter-
finals of the Asian Club Soccer Championship here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hao, famed for his scoring knack and infamous for hot temper

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Keep Rates Low Despite Peso Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday assured the public that the slight depreciation of the
currency peso against the U.S. dollar is only temporary and will
not affect its efforts to keep interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Wednesday's trading
at the Philippine Dealing System showed that the slight drop is
merely temporary, with the peso regaining strength at 39.06 to the
dollar as of noon.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank of the Philippines attributed the
slight depreciation of peso on Monday and Tuesday to the weakening
of regional currencies, its purchase of dollars, and high
corporate demand.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 39.30 pesos against the U.S. dollar on
Monday and dropped by another 20 centavos the following day.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that during the Monday auction of government
Treasury bills, there was a slight drop in the 91-day rate despite
the fall of the peso on that day.
</P>
<P>
"We are already beginning to see some normalization of the
exchange rate. Therefore, the fear that the government may not be
able to keep interest rates low is unfounded," Barican said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Regrets Over U.S., Britain's Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Myanmar has
expressed its great regret over the refusal of the United States
and Britain to participate in the forthcoming International
Police Conference on Heroin Production and Trafficking to be held
here this month.
</P>
<P>
"The international drug trade is an urgent problem which needs
to be addressed in a spirit of mutual cooperation by the entire
world community," said a statement issued by the Office of the
Strategic Studies (OSS) of the Myanmar Ministry of Defense here
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the two countries to put politics aside for
 the sake of the millions of people around the world whose lives
are threatened by the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
"As two of the largest markets for heroin in the world, the
U.S. and Britain bear a special responsibility to work with the
rest of the international community in every way possible," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Their huge markets fuel a global narcotics trade which
threatens to infect many countries in the developing world,
including Myanmar," it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has earlier urged the western countries, which are
seriously affected and inflicted by narcotic drug menace, not only
to stop fingerprinting and scapegoating others but also to
seriously find more realistic and practical methods to tackle the
drug menace problems.
</P>
<P>
The western bloc, especially the U.S. and the Britain, have
accused Myanmar of not being serious in the fight against narcotic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government also blamed the U.S. for not only
refusing to recognize and encourage Myanmar's efforts in the fight
against narcotic drugs but also putting obstacles in the move by
imposing an arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
On survey of poppy cultivation and production in the country,
Myanmar and the Western nations reported differently.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar official statistics, there were 61,236
hectares of poppy cultivation in the country that would yield
665.28 tons of raw opium and could be refined into 66.52 tons of
heroin, while the State Department of the United States said in
its statement issued in March 1998 that there were 157,089
hectares of poppy cultivation that would produce 2,365 tons of raw
opium and 197 tons of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Unveils More Aid for Layoff Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday announced an additional outlay of 5 million U.S. dollars
to a loan program for workers losing jobs or suffering reduced
income due to last year's currency depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Arellano, chairman and president of the Social Security
System (SSS), said the system's policy-making body has approved
the outlay after the 7.5 million U.S. dollars allocated for the
program ran out last December.
</P>
<P>
"The additional amount will benefit more workers who are
struggling to cope with the problems caused by the currency
crisis," Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
The SSS will accept and process applications until the
additional allocation has been exhausted, he added.
</P>
<P>
The SSS opened the emergency loan program in April last year to
help the workers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Assist SADC Peacekeeping Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
transport troops from cash-strapped southern African countries to
participate in a regional peacekeeping exercise, South African
Defense Minister Joe Modise said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Cape Town after talks with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, who is on a three-day official visit to
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, Operation Blue Crane, is scheduled for April in
South Africa's Northern Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 troops from the 14 member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) are expected to participate
in the exercise, which was postponed last year following South
Africa's military intervention in neighboring Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The Americans would provide two C-130 cargo planes to help some
 countries bring their soldiers to South Africa, South African
Press Association (SAPA)

quoted Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would also help create a simulation center for
training peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Modise said he and Cohen had extensive discussions on an
African peacekeeping force, but emphasized that South Africa was
operating within the SADC and not in isolation on the question.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, referring to the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), said Modise had spent a good deal of time
outlining the problems in both countries to him.
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed diplomacy is the only solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Modise said it was no secret that Angola's rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) leader Jonas Savimbi
and his top officers had visited South Africa for four days, where
attempts were made to persuade them to embrace a peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tire. We will make another effort to get them to
sit around a table and resolve the situation."
</P>
<P>
The same applied to the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cohen and Modise were presented with two draft
manuals, the product of a year's work by a combined U.S. and South
African working group on environmental security.
</P>
<P>
The manuals, on the conversion of military bases in South
Africa and military training-range management, would be finalized
for worldwide use, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Military staff were also preparing to host an international
conference on range management later this year, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who received a 19-gun salute during a military parade at
the Castle in Cape Town Tuesday morning, later had lunch with
members of parliament's joint committee on defense, and was to
meet Deputy President Thabo Mbeki Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He will visit Robben Island Thursday.

<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) - British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook is expected to return to the Kosovo peace talks on Thursday
to put more pressure on Serb and ethnic Albanian negotiators,
officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Secretary is likely to return to the talks
tomorrow, although this has not yet been set in stone," said a
British Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But Cook, who is co-chairing the talks in France with his
French counterpart Hubert Vedrine, would not be going back to
tackle any particular crisis, the spokesman said
</P>
<P>
Asked if Cook was going back to head off a crisis in the
negotiations, the spokesman said that he was "determined to do
what he can to ensure they are successful".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Cook has repeatedly said there was no guarantee that
the talks would succeed as the warring groups in Kosovo were far
from reaching any agreement in a short time.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were imposed by the Contact Group, which
comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
It was previously expected that the talks would last two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Imports Video Conference System From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A video conference system, a
kind of telecom hi-tech product from China, was launched at the
headquarters of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(KPTC) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The system, the first of its kind ever imported in Kenya,
comprises a control center and four terminals. The product is
manufactured by China Zhongxing Telecom Ltd.
</P>

The control center is at the Exchange Center of Kenya's General
Post Office, while the four terminals are located at KPTC
Managing Director office, the meeting room in the Extelecom
House, the board room of the Kenya College of Communication
Technologies (KCCT) and the Gilgil Telecom Industry (GTI).
</P>
<P>
The system, worth of 500,000 U.S. Dollars, is provided by the
Zhongxing Telecom Ltd. in accordance with a contract signed in
1998. The installation and trial test of the system only took
three months.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, KPTC managing director J.K. Mutai
sat in his office and talked face to face with the officials at
Extelecom, KCCT and GTI by using the system.
</P>

Mutai said the system was successfully launched. It would be
time- saving and save greatly travel expenses for his corporation.
</P>
<P>
Zhongxing Telecom Ltd. is one of China's large telecom
enterprises, with a staff of over 6,000, mainly engaged in
development, production and marketing of such products as
exchanges, video telecom, power sources, wireless local loop and

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks Flood Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the heavy floods
that killed at least 20 people in the south, the Philippine
government is seeking a flood control system to address this
recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters Wednesday, Philippine Vice
President Gloria Arroyo said she would recommend government
agencies to use their quick response funds to set up a control
system.
</P>
<P>
She said she would also ask the government to release more
funds for relief operations in the areas affected by flooding.
</P>
<P>
Other government officials said earlier that the floods were a
result of unhampered logging activities in the area during the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
Reports showed that at least 20 people died and 87,000 families
were affected in the recent floods in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, with the Caraga region sustaining heavy damage to
property.
</P>
<P>
"Caraga is the hardest hit region in the recent flooding in
Mindanao," Arroyo said. "The flooding of La Nina has been ongoing
since November."
</P>
<P>
The similar floods are likely to hit areas near the seas, she
added.

<HEADLINE> German Trade Surplus Sets Second Highest Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany achieved a trade surplus
of 74.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, the second highest in the
country's history, the Federal Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's exports last year totaled a record 551.7 billion
dollars, 6.9 percent higher than 1997, and the imports grew by 6.3
percent to 476.8 billion dollars, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus fell short of the record of 78.1 billion dollars
set in pre-unification West Germany in 1989, officials noted.
</P>
<P>
In December, German exports reached 43.9 billion dollars, down
2.8 percent from the December 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The December figures were the latest sign of trouble for the
export sector as the crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America
started to make themselves felt.
</P>
<P>
Imports in December were up 6.3 percent to 40.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The resulting surplus of 3.2 billion dollars in December was
far below the 6.9 billion dollar trade surplus in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Seafood Export Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's seafood export
was valued at only 63 million U.S. dollars in the first half (July
to December) of the current fiscal year due to the ban of seafood
export by European Union (EU) and global recession.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) Javed Anwar Khan
said in Karachi Wednesday Pakistan exported a total of 77,290 tons
of seafood worth 171.59 million dollars during 1997-98 while
79,577 tons of seafood worth 149.12 million dollars were exported
in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1997-98, the major importers of Pakistani
seafood were EU with 93 million dollars or 54 percent of the total
seafood export while Japan takes 13 percent worth 22.48 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the major reason for the shortfall in seafood export
during the first half of 1998-99 was the EU ban on Pakistan's
seafood. During the peak season of October, Pakistan's seafood
export was literally zero, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said another reason for the decline of seafood was global
recession which forced seafood buyers to slow down imports.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said global fishery export in 1996 was estimated at
50.134 billion dollars, of which Pakistan shared only 0.28
percent.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Trade Gap Reduced by 45.7 Pct in 7 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan recorded a trade
gap of 714 million U.S. dollars in the first seven months (July to
January) of 1998-99, showing a decline of 45.7 percent compared
with the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The consistent efforts by the government to arrest
non-essential imports have helped stem the ever-widening trade
gap, bringing it down to 714 million dollars in the first sevens
of the current fiscal year from 1.315 billion dollars in the same
period of the previous year, officials from the Commerce Ministry
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total imports during the period amounted to 5.07 billion
dollars as against that of 6.26 billion dollars recorded in the
same period last year, registering a decline of almost 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's export during the seven-month period was
only 4.36 billion dollars, showing a decline of 11.8 percent as
compared with the 4.94-billion-dollar exports in the corresponding
period in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The officials described the slide in exports due to world-wide
recession and a substantial decline in the value prices.
</P>
<P>
They also held the sanctions imposed against it after its
nuclear tests in May last year were a major cause adversely
affecting the government's efforts to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the world-wide recession many countries were
forced to devalue their currency which led to the decline in value
prices, thereby affecting Pakistan's competitiveness in the global
market, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They, however, hoped that as a result of improvement in the
country's economic milieu in the wake of successful negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Paris Club, the
exports are likely to show signs of resilience.

Incentives will be offered to encourage banks to provide loans
to the small-and-medium-sized projects, allocate part of their

them, Ghali said.

The Ministry of Economy will try to boost coordination with the
Ministry of Insurance and Social Affairs in an effort to push the
non-governmental institutions to fund the small-and-medium-sized
projects, he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Sinks Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Stock Market
closed weaker for the seventh time out of the eight sessions this
month with banking shares and other large-cap stocks leading
prices down.
</P>
<P>
The overnight fall in Wall Street and the government's issue of
bonds valued at 765 million Singapore dollars (451 million U.S.
dollars) issue of bonds redeemable for shares of the Development
Bank of Singapore brought down the share prices and deepened
pessimism in the market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 19.81 points to
close at 1286.56 points, falling through the 1300 mark for the
first time sine mid-November last year.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased marginally to 177.00 million units
valued at 387.28 million Singapore dollars (228.59 million U.S.
dollars). Gainers edged out losers by 122 to 100 with 198 shares
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
SembCorp remained the favorite stock of the day with a turnover
of 19.76 million shares. CSE Sys rank the second in term of volume
as it had 16.63 million units done. ST Engg was next with 8.22
million counters traded.
</P>
<P>
C &AMP; C was the top mover of the day running up by 40 cents to
6.15 Singapore dollars. F &AMP; N was the second biggest gainer of the
day with a 12-cent rise to 4.98 Singapore dollars. KepTel inched
up 10 cents to end at 2.42 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Gp Bat headed the descent of the day sliding
18 cents to 2.98 Singapore dollars. CityDev and SIA sank 15 cents
to end at 6.25 and 2.85 Singapore dollars respectively. SIA 200
and UOB also retreated 15 cents but ended at 6.90 and 6.50
Singapore dollars respectively. .  Dealers said today's slump
tone was a reaction to Wall Street fall overnight and
government's issue of 765 million Singapore dollars in bonds that
can be exchanged for shares in DBS bank in 2002 .
</P>
<P>
DBS shares took a drubbing as investors pared their holdings in
the stock to buy the convertible bonds instead.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Upbeat on Rice Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rice

Agriculture Secretary William Dar was quoted as saying that the
flashfloods damage in the south of the country was already
incorporated in the target and would be offset by the bountiful

<HEADLINE> Tung on Problems Arising from HK Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
today expressed his confidence in solving problems arising from
the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruling by sticking to the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
He noted at the media session that recently, the decision of
the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the right of abode of Hong
Kong residents' children born on the mainland has given rise to
wide concerns among its community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Implementing the "one country, two systems" principle and the
Basic Law is an enterprise unprecedented in history. In the
process, it is inevitable that some new phenomena will arise. The
decision of the Court of Final Appeal is an example of this, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "I am confident that because we adhere to the
principle of 'one country, two systems' and the constitutional
basis which the Basic Law has provided to Hong Kong, we can solve
any problems or any situations that we face."
</P>
<P>
"My confidence is based on our success in implementing the 'one
country, two systems' principle and the Basic Law in Hong Kong
over the 19 months in the past," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, he said he had kept in touch with the
Central Authorities and had arranged for Secretary for Justice to
visit Beijing as his representative to communicate further with
relevant departments of the Central Authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Final Appeal made the decision on the right of
abode of Hong Kong residents' children born on the mainland on
January 29.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers'
Union (CFU) has expressed its welcome to the government's
decision on land payment and pledged its assistance in the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman of the Land Acquisition Committee of
Zimbabwe, Joseph Msika has assured earlier that compensation for
the acquired land will be paid according to the existing laws of
the country, the Herald newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CFU President, Nick Swanepoel said in a statement issued here
Tuesday that the union believed adequate land will be offered for
the land resettlement program, adding that the assurance by Msika
will lend confidence to farmers who have land to offer the
government.
</P>

"We welcome the positive attitude, clarifications and
assurances given by Msika during a press conference last Friday,
and in particular our government's commitment to the spirit of the
international donors' conference in September last year,"
Swanepoel said.
</P>
<P>
"This offers a practical and attainable way forward on the land
reform program and we are ready to assist in the implementation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The union was further encouraged by the government's commitment
to developing a consultative process with stakeholders. Such
consultations will enhance transparency which is important in
rebuilding confidence so necessary for the agricultural industry
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The union leader urged farmers to press on with the business of
 farming, and to endeavor to be as productive as possible.
</P>
<P>
The government will require a total of five million hectares of
land to resettle about 150,000 black families throughout this

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Down as Commodity Prices Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued its retreat Wednesday, losing more than one third of a
U.S. cent as it came under pressure from falling commodity prices
and profit takers exploiting recent gains.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said the
domestic currency was also experiencing "a corrective phase" after
the past fortnight's strong performance.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar began February at 62.82 U.S. cents and
hit a peak of 65.47 on Monday - its highest level since April
1998.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the domestic unit was at 64.33 U.S.
cents from 64.70 Tuesday, after spending the day between 64.30 and
64.69.
</P>
<P>
"The Aussie is under a bit of pressure," Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
"It's had a big move up in the last two weeks and we are just
seeing it in a bit of a corrective phase.
</P>
<P>
"We had gold down a bit the last two nights, commodities were
down last night as well and generally speaking there's been some
profit taking."
</P>
<P>
In New York Tuesday night gold fell 2.00 U.S. dollars to 288.40
an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said a stronger U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen
also impacted negatively on the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the local currency was buying 0.5697 euro
from 0.5715 and trading Japanese yen at 74.11 from 74.14 Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Cabinet Set to Approve Higher Tax Cuts for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's cabinet was due Wednesday to approve higher than
initially planned corporate tax cuts in response to a storm of
criticism from the German business sectors, the Sueddeutshce
Zeitung newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Mittelstand, which would have been overburdened by aspects
of the reform, will get relief in several areas," Schroeder said
in an interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Mittelstand are small and medium-sized companies which form
the backbone of Germany's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are still capable of learning," said Schroeder, who did not
reveal what new tax breaks would be offered. Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine was due to hold a news briefing later Wednesday
on the final version of the tax reform.
</P>
<P>
Although Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) lost their majority
in parliament's upper chamber, the Bundesrat, as a result of Hesse
state elections last weekend, the government has vowed to win
necessary Bundesrat approval for the reform before Hesse's old SPD-
led government leaves office.
</P>
<P>
The modest reforms will be carried out step by step and are due
to yield a net annual tax cut of 9 billion U.S. dollars by 2002.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Is Difficult Trading Year for Australia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Growth in Australian exports
has slumped under the weight of the Asian economic crisis, with
1999 set to be an even more difficult trading year, Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer warned that exporters could be further harmed if the
Australian dollar continued to climb, after rising six percent
since January.
</P>
<P>
"Longer term, that would be a matter of concern," he told
reporters here at the launch of the "1999 Trade Outcomes and
Objectives Statement".
</P>
<P>
The statement revealed that in the 1997-98 financial year (Jul
1, 97 to Jun 30, 98), exports grew 8.4 percent, including growth
of 5.7 percent to Australia's key markets in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, in his speech to parliament tabling the report,
Fischer said more up to date information showed export growth had
been cut sharply in the last six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Consistent with government predictions, the difficult global
economic climate cut in more noticeably to Australia's export
performance in 1998," Fischer said in parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Using calendar year figures our exports have grown at a more
sobering two percent."
</P>
<P>
Fischer argued this was still a strong performance, given the
region's economic crisis, but he warned, "1999 will be a difficult
trading year."
</P>
<P>
"Continuing contraction in some economies and the spread of the
downturn to other markets mean that growth prospects for the world
economy remain subdued."
</P>
<P>
The cause of the slump is the Asian crisis, with exports to
East Asia falling 6.8 percent in the 12 month to December 1998,
after rising 5.7 percent in the year to June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the region now takes only 50 percent of
Australia's exports, down sharply from 60 percent before the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, import growth has soared and the trade
deficit blew out to 10 billion Australian dollars (6.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis is forcing Australian exporters to switch from
Asia to new markets.
</P>
<P>
Exports to countries outside East Asia soared 18.3 percent,
with exports to the United States up 41 percent, and to the
European Union by 25 percent, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
There was also strong growth in exports to emerging markets
such as Eastern Europe, Vietnam, Turkey, Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> Australia Vows to Fight U.S. Lamb Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Lamb producers and
the federal government Wednesday vowed to fight a move taken by
the United States to restrict imports of Australian lamb and
accused the Americans of punishing Australia for providing a
superior product.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. International Trade Commission reportedly unanimously
endorsed complaints by farmers that the imports could threaten
their livelihoods, a ruling that could lead to temporary tariffs
or a quota on Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer accused
the United States of hypocrisy, saying it was happy to push for
the scrapping of trade restrictions elsewhere, while protecting
its own patch.
</P>
<P>
"The United States can't have it both ways," Fischer told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They have responsibilities as the largest economy in the world
which gains so much of its economic drive from its trade with the
world, to accept that it can't always insist .... that they should
roll down the shutters."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said U.S. consumers were choosing the lean Australian
and New Zealand lamb because they preferred it to the fattier
local product, not because of any unfair trading practices.
</P>
<P>
Opposition trade spokesman Peter Cook called on the government
to take immediate action to overturn the U.S. decision, "the
government needs to go in hard for Australia's lamb producers - by
any measure one of our most efficient exporters. U.S. trade
bullying should not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the U.S. decision was not final, and the
government would work shoulder to shoulder with the industry to
fight any U.S. tariffs or quotas on the 90 million Australian
dollars (58.5 million U.S. dollars) a year Australian trade - the
biggest export market for Australia's lamb industry.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Will Maintain Dong Value in 1999: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stabilizing the value of the dong is a major target of
Vietnam's banking system in 1999, VNA quoted Vietnam's Permanent
Deputy Prime Minister and Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam
(SBV) Nguyen Tan Dzung as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dzung, who was speaking to the weekly "Vietnam Economic Times",
further said the ability of the banks to stabilize the dong was
crucial for ensuring sufficient capital for economic growth in the
orientation of national industrialization and modernization,
particularly for the agricultural and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has to face complicated developments of the regional
financial-monetary crisis as well as overcome the consequences of
last year's natural calamities and the weaknesses of the economy
itself in 1999, said Dzung.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the measures taken by Vietnam's banking sector to
obtain its set target, the Vietnam's SBV governor said the sector
should carry out a series of solutions covering the exercise of
tight control of both the monetary and foreign currency markets.
Vietnamese government will continue its flexible policy on
controlling foreign exchange rates to meet practical demand and
comply with the supply and demand law for foreign currencies in
the market.
</P>
<P>
Dzung said that crucial to the stability of the local currency
was to control the foreign currency market and improve the
international balance of payments. This was the only way to
achieve the target of only having the domestic currency used
within Vietnam's border, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ten Killed by Avalanche in French Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed and one
seriously injured by an avalanche which wiped away 17 small
chalets Tuesday afternoon in a skiing resort near a mountainous
village in Haute Savoie, east France.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are looking for other possible victims or survivors,
as at least five people are still missing, said the prefectural
government of the region in the French Alps near the Swiss border.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims are three men, four women and four children,
said the same source, who did not provide further details on their
identities.
</P>
<P>
One person who was rescued is still in a state of hypothermia
in a hospital in the nearby city of Chamonix.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have saved 27 people from the snow, after a 150-meter
wide and six-meter thick avalanche stormed a winter resort
sheltering tourists who came for the skiing season.
</P>
<P>
The avalanche was the most deadly that ever occurred in the
French Alps since January 23, 1998, when 11 people, including nine
college students and their teacher, were buried in an avalanche
which took place near a skiing station in Haute Alps.
</P>
<P>
The most devastating avalanche over the past 30 years took
place on April 16, 1970, when 74 people, including 56 children,
were killed in a snowslide in Assy, Haute Savoie.
</P>
<P>
This took place only two months after 39 people were killed
when a center of vacation was buried by an avalanche on February
10, 1970, in another skiing center of the French Alps.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations System in
China urged in a new appeal today the international community to
join the Chinese government in post-flood relief and
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ms Kerstin Leitner, resident coordinator of the UN System in
China, said the objective of the interagency appeal is to improve
coordination of international assistance to promote the Chinese
government's efforts to provide disaster relief to areas
devastated by last summer's record flooding.
</P>
<P>
She called on foreign governmental, intergovernmental,
nongovernmental and private donors to either earmark contributions
directly to the Chinese government or to the coordinating UN
agency.
</P>
<P>
Targeted donations of 46.15 million U.S. dollars will act as a
catalyst for consolidating flood relief efforts and promote the
rehabilitation of essential housing, education and production
facilities, as well as strengthen the implementation of flood
management and information systems to mitigate the risk of
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The first UN appeal, issued on September 23, 1998. solicited
emergency relief and initial rehabilitation assistance for flood
victims. The appeal raised close to 73 million U.S. dollars by
January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The long list of donors included the United States, Italy,
Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Britain, Australia, Norway,
Canada, the European Union (EU), Spain and Austria, as well as UN
agencies and companies.

LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 38 people have been
killed by cholera since the disease broke out last month out of
the admission to hospital of 918 cases in capital Lusaka and the
provinces including Luapula and Copperbelt.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Central Board of Health said Wednesday that Lusaka

The Chinese government and UN used the funds to provide relief
in the form of shelters, food, water supplies, sanitation
facilities, disease control services, seed and fertilizer and the
construction of schools, said Leitner.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed the heaviest flooding in over 40 years during
the summer of 1998. Official statistics show that devastating
floods affected over 180 million people in central and
northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,100 people died and over 18 million people were
evacuated from their homes and villages, with flood waters
completely destroying more than 6.8 million houses and damaging
over 13 million others. Direct economic losses exceeded 225
billion yuan (31 billion U.S. dollars), with immeasurable long-
term social impact resulting from the loss of homes and employment.
</P>
<P>
Leitner said the new funds are needed to ensure sustainable
emergency relief and initial rehabilitation achievements.
</P>
<P>
UN fact-finding missions to flood ravaged areas in central and
northeast China shortly after flood water receded indicated that
the winter freeze masked many flood related dangers.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of spring will increase the danger of water-borne
diseases, food supplies and environmental problems, especially
when displaced flood victims still lack access to potable water
and sanitation facilities, as well as seeds and fertilizer needed
for the rapidly approaching planting season.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Restore Use of Chinese in Official Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will soon restore
the use of Chinese characters in government documents and on
street signs, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The move means that South Korea will lift a 1970 ban on the use
of characters in official documents.
</P>
<P>
"If we ignore Chinese characters, we have problems in
understanding our classic literature and our traditional culture,"
President Kim Dae-jung said at a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Chinese road signs have been suggested along
with Korean and English words on street signs as the number of
tourists from countries and regions using Chinese characters is
rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, 4.5 million foreigners visited South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering reinforcing the learning of
Chinese characters at schools, said Minister of Culture and
Tourism Shin Nakyun.
</P>
<P>
"Use of Chinese characters along with Korean is needed to
better understand traditional Korean culture and promote
international exchanges with other Asian countries using Chinese
characters," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said the restoration is expected to
provoke a problem among South Korean linguists as Koreans have
debated for centuries over whether they should continue to use
Chinese characters or stick to using the Korean only.
</P>
<P>
Some South Korean linguists said using Korean and Chinese
characters together will eventually damage the Korean language.
They fear their language will be degenerated to a subsidiary
language controlled by Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, Koreans borrowed Chinese characters to record
their history. In 1446, Korean scholars created Korean alphabet
called Hangul. But Chinese characters are so much part of its
linguistic system that nearly all South Koreans can write their
names in Chinese now.
</P>
<P>
Since 1948 when South Korea was founded, in accordance with a
linguistic policy, South Koreans must use Korean only but can
adopt Chinese characters when necessary to clarify an idea that
cannot be easily expressed.
</P>
<P>
The past governments of South Korea discouraged school children
from learning Chinese, phasing out Chinese characters from
textbooks and Chinese disappeared from newspapers and magazines
and official documents.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, voices grew in support of restoring
use of Chinese characters, which some scholars say makes it easier
to form new words and express complicated ideas more concisely.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- War-torn Cambodia is like "a
burgeoning flower reborn from ashes. And I want to be a loyal
gardener to nurture the flower," said Cambodian prime minister Hun
Sen here today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I myself have witnessed the weathering and rebirth of the
flower, so I will make every effort to protect and take care of it
in the ensuing years of my tenure and for the rest of my life,"
Hun Sen, currently on an official visit to China, told Xinhua at
the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Today marked the 70th day since he became prime minister last
November. "The key goals -- national reconciliation and domestic
peace -- have been achieved in my country," he said, adding that
he now can concentrate more on economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to develop the economy without peace and
stability, and peace and stability can not be sustained without
economic growth," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, a warrior-turned-politician, resigned as commander-in-
chief of the Cambodian royal armed forces, and announced a
reduction of the army and police force to about 70,000. "The armed
forces are no longer independent, but are under the control of the
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said he will shift his focus to economic
issues, in particular learning from other economic models. China's
experience in undertaking massive economic construction while
ensuring domestic stability has aroused his attention. "I have
been interested in China since 1982 and I have read the books of
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping," he said, adding that the
Chinese leadership's realistic approach in handling domestic and
foreign affairs has impressed him most.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Helicopter Crash in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed
when a helicopter crashed into a building in downtown Cape Town
Wednesday morning, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Those killed were the captain, the co-pilot, the flight
engineer and another man.
</P>
<P>
Police said the helicopter, a large Russian M-I8, was
off-loading heavy air conditioning equipment on the roof of the
revamped Boston House opposite the Cape Sun Hotel when the
accident happened about 6:30 a.m. (0430 GMT).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a police officer, Mark Romburgh, as saying that
shortly after the helicopter off-loaded the equipment and was
turning to leave, its tail rotor blade struck an advertising
signboard on top of the building.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot lost control and the helicopter plunged on top of
Boston House," the police officer said. "The four occupants were
all killed."
</P>
<P>
He said pieces of the wreckage flew across the street into two
rooms of the Cape Sun Hotel. One room was badly damaged but it
was not occupied. The other room, which was occupied, was slightly
damaged and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
A security guard, who witnessed the crash, said that he was
watching the helicopter carrying a basket when its rotor blades
struck the signboard and crashed onto the building.
</P>
<P>
"There was one big loud explosion and an inferno," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Gets EIB Grant to Support Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank
(EIB) has given Zambia 15 million U.S. Dollars of grant to support
the country's private sector.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Economic Development Minister Edith Nawakwi said in
Ndola, capital of northern Copperbelt Province Tuesday, the funds
will go towards sustaining private sector development.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said that the grant has been forwarded to a commercial
bank and is now ready for disbursement, Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Government believes that the small-scale sector is the key for
the survival of the Zambian economy and that is why it has shown
commitment in this direction," Nawakwi said.
</P>
<P>
But Nawakwi who was addressing a budget review meeting
organized by the Ndola District Chambers of Commerce and Industry,
could not elaborate on how the funds from the EIB will be
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nawakwi expressed concern that a number of
businessmen were not serious in repaying the loans which they get
from lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Some businessmen are not keen on repaying the loans. This is a
very bad attitude which will bring them problems in future. It is
like they are stealing from themselves," Nawakwi said.

<HEADLINE> Osama Not to Be Forced Out of Afghanistan: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) --The Taliban militia on
Tuesday once again rejected the U.S. demand for expelling Osama
bin Laden from Afghanistan, saying the Saudi dissident "will not
be forced out of the country."
</P>
<P>
The rejection was made by the Taliban leadership after
considering the latest U.S. request for Osama to be expelled,
reports reaching here Wednesday from Kabul quoted Taliban
spokesman Abdul Mutmaen as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Mutmaen explained that the alleged terrorist
mastermind could leave Afghanistan if he decided so of his own
volition.
</P>
<P>
Mutmaen said that anybody possessing evidence linking the Saudi
dissident to terrorist activities should approach the Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
He observed that Osama, if found guilty, would be tried by the
Afghan Supreme Court in accordance with the law of the land.
"Unless proven a terrorist, Osama will enjoy all freedom on the
Afghan soil," Mutmaen said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have been under mounting pressure from the United
States, Britain and other western countries to take action against
Osama who they brand as a dreaded terrorist.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth, in a meeting
here last Wednesday with a senior Taliban senior officials,
demanded Osama be expelled from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State for Foreign affairs and Commonwealth
Affairs Derek Fetchett on Monday also requested the Taliban
militia to hand over Osama to the United States or extradite him
to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton's coordinator for counter terrorism,
Richard Clarke, asserted last week that the United States may bomb
government facilities in nations that provide sanctuary to
international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We may not just go in a strike against a terrorist facility;
we may choose to retaliate against the facilities of the host
country, if that host country is a knowing, cooperative
sanctuary," he told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan was believed to lead the U.S. list of those
possible bomb target countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to mount pressure on the Afghan government
without furnishing any proof," Mutmaen said on behalf of the
Taliban militia which has controlled over 80 percent of the area
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Devorcee Children Mentally Vulnerable: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The chances that a person
will suffer from psychiatric diseases during adulthood are 3.8
times higher than average among those younger than 17 when parents
divorced, Israeli researchers say.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in Wednesday's local daily Haaretz, was
conducted by a research team headed by Dr. Ofir Ageed and
Pro. Benjamin Larar of the Psychiatry Department of the Hadassah
Hospital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, wrote an article
at the turn of the century describing the emotional effects on
adults who lost a parent at an early age.
</P>
<P>
The study, the first of its kind on testing the hypothesis by
comparing healthy and sick subjects, focused on the loss of a
parent at the age of 17 or younger, with "loss" defined as the
parent's death or permanent absence from home.
</P>
<P>
The psychiatric patients joining in the study suffered from
clinical depression, manic depression or schizophrenia. Each
patient was paired with a psychologically healthy subject matched
as closely as possible by age, gender, ethnic background, and
education.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted on 79 pairings of patients suffering
from depression, 79 from manic depression, and 79 from
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
Among the patients who had experienced "loss", the
psychological effects of divorce were found to be greater than
those suffering from a parent's death. The loss of mother was
found to be more psychologically damaging than the loss of father.
</P>
<P>
Patients suffering from manic depression were 2.6 times more
likely to have been separated from a parent than their healthy
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenic patients were 3.8 times as likely to have been
separated from a parent as their healthy counterparts, while
illness was 4.3 times as likely among those subjects who lost a
parent before the age of nine.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that among those whose parents divorced
when they were children but did not develop depression as adults,
their own risk of divorcing, smoking, or having a low income and
suffering from physical disease is much higher than those from
two-parent families.

military would not bring in any votes in the general elections
slated for April 18.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):

<P>
-- Turkey's pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP) adopted a "military

<HEADLINE> Arafat Likely to Delay Declaration of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat may agree to postpone a
unilateral declaration of statehood if Washington promises that
Israel will carry out redeployment in the West Bank, a local
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's conditions for the postponement include an agreement
by the United States to pressure Israel to implement the Wye
Agreement after the Israeli elections in May, the daily Haaretz
quoted a strategic study report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Study, a
famous think tank in Israel, has submitted its report this week to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly pledged that he will declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4, when the five-year
interim period set by the 1993 Oslo accords expires, with or
without an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel's parliament decided last month to move elections
forward to May 17 from late 2000, however, Arafat has been under
mounting pressure to put off a declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the U.S. and the European Union have tried to convince
the Palestinian leader that a unilateral declaration on May 4
would help boost the election campaign of hard-line Netanyahu, who
staunchly opposes Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have emerged that Arafat is ready to delay the
announcement of a Palestinian state until December 31 if
Washington backs the new date.
</P>
<P>
Attending an annual prayer breakfast organized by the
U.S. Congress last week, Arafat held talks with President Bill
Clinton in Washington. But they did not succeed in reaching a
deal on this issue.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a unilateral declaration by the Palestinians, the
10-page strategic report suggested that the Israeli government
keep contacts with the Palestinians and the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
Also, it urged the Israeli government to halt settlement
activities and expropriation of Arab land in the West Bank, and
called for concluding talks on safe passage between the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to win back right-wing support, Netanyahu froze
the implementation of the Wye agreement in December, including the
troop withdrawal from the West Bank and talks on other interim
issues.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Strives to Produce 24.38 billion kwh Electric Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to produce 24.38
billion kwh electric power in 1999, 2.72 billion kwh higher than
1998, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This year, said VNA, Vietnam's electricity sector will invest
13,000 billion Vietnamese dong (vnd) (929 million U.S. dollars)
in building the electricity transmission network and power
plants. Of the sum, 53.5 percent will be spent for the
construction of power plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnam Electricity Corporation, a number of
power projects are scheduled to be put into operation this year.
They include two gas turbines in Tra Noc Power Plant in Can Tho
Mekong Delta Province, two turbines of the Yaly Hydro-Power Plant
in Vietnam's central highlands,  and Turbine Group No.1 of the
Hinh River Hydro-Power Plant in the central coastal province of
Binh Thuan with a combined capacity of nearly 1,000 mw.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,410 kilometers of power transmission lines will be
connected to the national grid in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's electricity sector plans to reduce the
hydro-electricity percentage from 67 percent of the country's
total electricity output at present to 50 percent to make itself
less dependent on natural conditions, especially in the dry
season.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's electricity grid has 15 major power plants and a
number of hydro-electric and diesel-fueled turbines with a total
capacity of 4,956 mw.
</P>
<P>
The electricity sector turned out 21.6 billion kwh electric
power last year, a 13 percent year-on-year increase over the
previous year. Its commercial electricity output reached more than
17.7 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
Electricity has been supplied to nearly 95 percent of the
country's districts and 75 percent of all communes nationwide.
Nearly 63 percent of all farmer households have access to the
national electricity network.
</P>
<P>
Under the sector's development plan for the 2000-2005 period,
it strives to turn out 30 billion kwh electric power by 2000 and
48 billion kwh electric power by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is accelerating preparations to start the construction
of the 3,600 mw Son La Hydro-Electric Power Plant by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeking Foreign Funding for Major Education Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is looking to
bilateral and multilateral funding to implement several major
education projects, Education Minister Najib Tun Razak said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the priority projects are a permanent campus for
University Malaysia Sarawak, smart schools, higher education fund,
and infrastructure development, especially for rural schools, the
minister said in an interview with the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of bilateral funding, we are looking at the
government's negotiations with Japan and we're hoping for some
funding for human resources, particularly in the education sector,
to come our way," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Najib expected bilateral funding from other countries, saying
as Malaysia has its own list of priorities, the donor countries
must agree (with the priorities).
</P>
<P>
Najib also expected funds to come through from the World Bank
for education projects, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not reveal the amount required.
</P>
<P>
Najib hoped that the smart schools program, which was scheduled
for implementation last month, would get off the ground soon.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was working on the final stage with the
consortium appointed for the project which would begin with 90
schools equipped with multimedia learning equipment throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Cambodian PM-China Tour Cambodian PM on China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here today that his current China visit has
been a "more remarkable achievement" than expected.
</P>
<P>
The visit has strengthened traditional Cambodia-China
friendship and promoted trade and economic cooperation, which will
ensure sound relations into the next century, he said during an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that economic cooperation and trade
agreements signed on Tuesday between the two countries will play
an important role in Cambodia's economic rejuvenation, especially
the development of agriculture, irrigation, and communications.
</P>
<P>
Though a large and important country, China treats the small
country of Cambodia on an equal footing, providing the foundation
for further development of friendly bilateral ties, Hun said.
</P>
<P>
"We need China's assistance, and welcome Chinese investment in
Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hun spoke highly of China's achievement in maintaining
political stability and spurring economic development, saying that
as early as 1982 he began to study China's theories and
experiences in economic reform, especially the theories of Deng
Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader, in order to apply them to the
economic development of his country.
</P>
<P>
Hun said that what impresses him most is that Chinese leaders
have adopted a realistic approach to both domestic and foreign
affairs, which guarantees stability and economic development at
home and trust and respect abroad, Hun said.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn a lot from China," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new Cambodian government born last November now has been in
power for 70 days, during which the government has fulfilled its
first goal of realizing peace and stability, Hun said, adding that
rejuvenating and advancing the economy is the next task.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to advance the economy without peace and
stability," Hun said. "And peace and stability can not last
without economic development."
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government's efforts in pursuing national
reconciliation and integrating itself with the international
community have earned support worldwide. This January 25 and 26,
scores of countries and international institutions, including
China, the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Japan, will
meet in Tokyo to discuss plans for providing assistance to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Since Cambodia is now on the correct track, I believe that
satisfactory results will be achieved at the meeting," Hun said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete
Sampras of the United States made his 1999 debut in fine form,
needing about 60 minutes to enter the second round of the Sybase
Open men's tennis tournament in San Jose on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras edged Spain's Galo Blanco 6-4, 6-4, losing only one
point on his first serves and only eight on his serve overall. He
fired 11 aces, double faulted only once and never faced a break
point.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old American's withdrawal from Melbourne marked the
first Grand Slam event he has missed in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Sampras won four titles last year, including his fifth
Wimbledon crown. Top seed Sampras is beginning his 258th week at
the top spot in the ATP rankings.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Third seed Mark Philippoussis of
Australia defeated Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 6-7 (2-7), 7-5, 6-3

<HEADLINE> Former World Champions Return to Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's retired world
champions Fu Mingxia and Xiong Ni will stage a comeback as they
return to competition in March at the qualifying match for the
National Championships.
</P>
<P>
Fu, Olympic gold medalist in Barcelona and Atlanta, had retired
to go to study in Qinghua University in 1996 but resumed training
last July with the university's diving team.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old was said to regained her form quickly and is
expected to produce good performance at the qualifying which is
her first appearance in the major national competition in two
years.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to reach my peak form and win the gold medal at the
Sydney Olympics in 2000," the former world champion was quoted by
local newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fu added she was confident she would qualify for the national
championships. The top six qualify for the April event.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who at 14 became the youngest world champion in the diving
history in 1991, dominated the world platform in the early 1990s,
winning both 1992 and 1996 Olympics and the world championships.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Xiong, 25, also returned to the diving pool in
last May and vowed to produce his best in Sydney if he could get
himself selected.
</P>
<P>
"Though I am relatively old with some injuries, I am
experienced. I hope to realize my Olympic dream," said Xiong, who
will return to the national team after the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who lost to the 1988 Olympic title to American Greg
Louganis, only finished third in the 10m platform four years later
in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
When he switched his event to the springboard, he took the
crown in Atlanta and became the first Chinese to win a men's
springboard gold at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Sports Association (CSSA) is now studying
when to re-introduce Xiong to the international circuit although
he has already picked up all the difficult routines.
</P>
<P>
The CSSA hopes to beef up its strength in next year's Sydney
Olympics against a Russian line-up spearheaded by the seemingly
invincible great Dimitry Sautin, double titlist at the world
championships last year.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Thailand to Enhance Border Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Thailand held
the second meeting of the Border Peace-Keeping Committee Wednesday
in Phnom Penh, aiming at increasing the cooperation in the field
of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Gen. Ke Kim Yan,
commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RACF), and
Gen. Mongkon Ampornpisit, supreme commander of the Royal Thai
Armed Forces. The first meeting was held in Bangkok on May 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere,
exchanged views on issues of common interests, and both sides were
satisfied with the results of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique released after the meeting, the
two parties reached agreements on many issues such as the border
cooperation, illegal immigration, peace-keeping along the border
and the border trade.
</P>
<P>
Both sides insisted that the issues of border disputes should
be settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to strengthen the cooperation and crackdown on
various crimes along the border, including drug smuggling, illegal
timber exports, piracy, illegal trade and fishery, etc.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to speed up cooperation to open their
border check-points in order to promote the contacts between the
peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
There were still less than 20,000 Cambodian refugees in
Thailand. Over the last two weeks, some 11,000 Cambodians have
returned from the Phu Noi camp in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Border Peace-Keeping Committee is an institution
established by an agreement between the governments of the two
countries on September 29, 1995. The third meeting is to be held
in Thailand in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the whereabout of Ta Mok, the only left Khmer
Rouge leader, Mongkon Ampornpisit ruled out the possibilities that
Ta Mok was still within the border of Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was
wounded in south Lebanon, the Daily Star reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was lightly injured on Tuesday when Lebanese
guerrillas fired mortar shells at the position of Blat, Teir Harfa
in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.

been no Israeli fatalities.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,

</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its allies South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Half Of U.S. Homes Have Personal Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Fifty percent of U.S.
households had a personal computer in 1998, said Dataquest Inc., a
leading market research firm, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. personal computer penetration into homes has been
consistent over the past couple of years, according to a survey
released by Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 50 percent of American homes had a PC compared with 43
percent in 1997, 36 percent in 1996, 27 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The PC penetration rate continues to increase at a healthy
clip, showing that the PC is rapidly becoming a standard household
appliance," said Van Baker, director for Dataquest's consumer
market research.
</P>
<P>
Market sources say the two major factors driving the trend are
falling prices and increasing performance of personal computers in
the U.S. market, which contributes strong sales of lower-priced
personal computers in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest is a recognized leader in providing the high-
technology and financial communities with market intelligence for
the semiconductor, computer systems and peripherals,
communications, document management, software and services sectors

<HEADLINE> EDS-Relics-Threat China's Ancient Relics Face Increasing Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's precious cultural
relics face an increasing threat due to the lack of protective
measures against theft and fires, the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH) said today.
</P>
<P>
Thefts of stone sculptures and relics housed in temples and
museums remain rampant, even though the total number of robberies
dropped by almost 50 percent last year. Some 233 relics were
stolen during 1998, compared to over 900 pieces in the previous
year, according to an SACH report.
</P>
<P>
Fires which destroyed seven cultural relics sites in 1998
resulted mainly from arson, burning incense and short circuited
power lines.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that protective equipment, including
monitoring, alarm and fire extinguishing systems, has not as yet
been installed at numerous sites. The report also pointed to the
negligence of security personnel at certain sites.
</P>
<P>
The administration, which is currently holding its annual
national meeting in Beijing, announced that ensuring the safety of
ancient relics is one of its major goals for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring equipment and both water and power supply facilities
at major relics sites will be improved during the year.
</P>
<P>
Related projects will be carried out at the Potala Palace in
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as the Qing
Dynasty Tombs near Beijing and the summer residence of Qing
emperors in Chengde, Hebei Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Ministry of Finance
has introduced new conditions to govern the licensing of clearing
and forwarding agents, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) announced
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a KRA public notice, the new conditions will
affect new applicants for licenses, renewals, and freight agents
with licenses valid for three years.
</P>
<P>
The conditions will also affect companies or institutions which
have handled or cleared their own goods, and applicants who paid a
late application fee of 10,000 Shillings (some 156 U.S. Dollars)
for 1998's licenses.
</P>
<P>
All customs agents and potential customs agents who had earlier
applied for 1999 licenses are now required to re-apply in the new
format, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Applicants who wish to be new clearing and forwarding agents
are required to furnish the KRA with a copy of their company's
registration certificate and copies of the company's memorandum
and articles of association.
</P>
<P>
Other documents supposed to accompany the application include a
copy of the personal identification number (PIN) certificate for
the company and each of the directors and a copy of the Value

According to the notice, all the applicants must be members of
a recognized clearing and forwarding association and they are also
supposed to have a letter from their bankers confirming that the
company maintains an account with them.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's move is a follow-up of the 1998 recommendations
by the KRA geared toward restructuring the clearing and forwarding
industry. The recommendations also demanded that importers be
required to appoint their agents in writing.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has hailed the
participation of Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah in King Hussein's funeral procession, saying
it reflected distinctive ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Saad's presence in the late Jordanian king's funeral and his
meeting with Jordan's new King Abdullah underlined the special
ties and the approach to cement them, said Jordan's Foreign
Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib in an interview with Kuwait's Arabic
daily Al-Rai Al-A'm published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Saad led a high-level Kuwaiti delegation to Amman on Monday to
attend King Hussein's funeral and express condolences to King
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib said he would visit Kuwait soon at the official
invitation by his Kuwaiti counterpart Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian foreign minister was originally due in Kuwait on
Saturday, but the visit was postponed because of Hussein's illness
and death.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti-Jordanian ties, which was soured because of Amman's
backing for Iraq in its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, has been steadily
improving.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have exchanged a number of official visits and other
forms of diplomatic gestures since 1997, when Kuwait declared its
willingness to improve and boost relations with all Arab states
except Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, also Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister, said in early
January that if his Jordanian counterpart comes, "everything will
be settled."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Foreign Undersecretary Suleiman Majed Al-Shahin said
last week that "based on the Jordanian understanding for Kuwait's
just causes, the Jordanian Embassy in Kuwait would be officially
reopened soon after eight years of closure."

<HEADLINE> Quake-Hit World Heritage Center Fights Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a major facelift and
reconstruction project the earthquake-prone Lijiang Prefecture in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, which is a major cultural relic
site, is now able to promote its unique attractions and draw in
more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Listed on the UNESCO's world heritage protection program,
Lijiang was hit by a severe earthquake in February 1996, which
measured seven on the Richter scale and left 309 people dead, 16,
000 injured and 200,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, 1.45 billion yuan has been
channeled into the reconstruction, including 880 million yuan from
the central and provincial governments. Now, the county-level
prefecture has had its urban area expanded to 13 sq.km. from 7.4
sq.km. and some 67,310 people have moved to the newly-built
residential area equipped with improved power and water facilities.
</P>
<P>
Major tourist spots, where rebuilding works have been focused
on upgrading traffic and telecommunications infrastructure, had
remained basically intact in the earthquake because of their
flexible wooden frameworks. Earlier reports have said that the
essential structures of most of the ancient houses were still
standing and only the walls had been knocked down.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Supported Through Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Following last summer's
devastating floods in China none of the survivors died as a result
of the cold this winter or shortage of food, according to the
country's Civil Affairs Ministry, which also confirmed that there
were no reports of epidemics following the unexpected natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said, "The government made every effort to
ensure the security and safety of flood victims in the severe
winter months and provided them with enough food, clothing and
temporary shelters and housing."
</P>
<P>
Floods along the Yangtze, Lengjiang and Songhuajiang rivers
last summer killed more than 3,000 people and affected 200 million,
causing economic losses of 260 billion yuan (some 80 billion U.S.
dollars
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has allocated 11.3 billion yuan from the
central budget for flood relief and received 7.2 billion yuan
donated by people across China to help the victims. It has also
collected 100 million articles of clothing and large amounts of
medicine and food, which has enabled the survivors to cope with
the winter and combat any threat of disease.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua reporter has recently visited a flood-hit area in the
northernmost Heilongjiang Province, and found that the victims
were living in temporary houses constructed with the help of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The houses were made of solid mud bricks and were covered in
thick plastic sheets. The inside temperature of the dwellings was
averaging about 14 centigrade degrees in comparison to the 30
degrees below zero outside.
</P>
<P>
In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a herdsman by the name
of Hohobhatu said, "The government built this 50 sq.m brick and
tile house for me". Apparently the family were only able to save a
television set and a few pieces of clothing when the floods hit.
</P>
<P>
Several grain sacks were piled up in the herdsman's house and
printed on some of them were the words: "Donated by Hong Kong Red
Cross Society".
</P>
<P>
In Zhongbao village in Jiayu county, central China's Hubei
province, Jiang Shan, a little girl who was saved from the raging
torrents by People's Liberation Army soldiers, has now moved into
a two-story house with her family.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 families in the village saw their houses
destroyed by the flooding but now they all have new houses, thanks
to government money and donations from the public.
</P>
<P>
As Spring Festival approaches, the Civil Affairs Ministry,
local government and Red Cross Society have sent workers to
further help the victims and provide them with more food for the
celebrations as well as assisting them to prepare for the spring
plantings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were more than 1,000 big floods in
China over the past 2,000 years before the founding of the People'
s Republic in 1949. Many of the victims were not immediately
killed by the floods, but died from famine, cold and epidemics
after they became homeless.

<HEADLINE> African Animals Wintering Safely in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Animals imported from South
Africa to populate Shanghai's new safari park have wintered safely
in the colder climate and are ready to greet their first tourists
during Spring Festival next week.
</P>
<P>
The park, built only three years ago, has introduced more than
10,000 animals of some 200 species from all over the world and the
156 African animals arrived last October.
</P>
<P>
There are nine species, such as black gnus, springboks, white
rhinoceroses and giraffes, some of which had never been seen in
Shanghai before.
</P>
<P>
Park rangers laid tons of thick hay on the floors of sheds and
shelters and installed special heating systems to help the animals,
more used to hot weather, spend their first winter in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the African animals are in good health, apart from
one gnu which became distressed when the temperature fell to minus
three degrees centigrade.

<HEADLINE> ADB Says Asian Crisis Has Reached Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis has
already reached the bottom, and the region's economic recovery
will start later this year, but the growth rate will be much lower
than the pre-crisis level, Asian Development Bank (ADB) President
Tadao Chino said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference since he assumed office
last month, Chino said that the outlook for the regional economy
depends on "the fate of the current reform initiatives taken by
Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
The restructure and recapitalization of firms and the banking
sector should be the top priorities of Asian countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chino said that the sharp reduction in the private capital
inflow into Asia will keep the overall supplies of foreign
exchanges to the region well below the pre-crisis level.
</P>
<P>
This is the main problem which will affect the region's
economic recovery, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think, the Asian economy will recover, but the growth in
East and Southeast Asia will well below the pre-crisis level in
1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring the bank's role in assisting the crisis-hit
countries, the ADB president said that the bank will make further
efforts to reduce poverty because poverty reduction is the
over-arching objective of the ADB.
</P>
<P>
"As the Asian crisis has been so severe, the provision of
adequate social safety net to the vulnerable population is
critical in short-term," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chino also said that the bank will continue to strive to become
a broad-based development institution to meet the changing needs
of its members.
</P>
<P>
Chino was unanimously elected the bank's president by the ADB
Board of Governors on November 5, 1998, and assumed office on
January 16, 1999. He succeeded Mitsuo Sato in the position. Chino
was formerly Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A series of popular science
books authored by over 170 academicians from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) and Chinese Engineering Academy (CEA) will be
published early in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 100 books, jointly sponsored by the CAS, CEA, and the
Qinghua and Jinan university publishing houses, cover scientific
and technological problems and pressing issues related to the
nation's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The popularization of scientific and technological knowledge
is crucial to revitalizing the country through science and
technology," said CAS Vice-President Bai Chunli.
</P>
<P>
Bai pointed out that the nation must improve scientific
education. He cited the results of a survey which show that over
46 percent of Chinese people have never heard of DNA, with 70
percent unable to explain the meaning of "scientific research".
</P>
<P>
Good popular science books should be both useful and
interesting, in addition to providing sufficient scientific
knowledge for readers, said CAS President Lu Yongxiang, who is
directing the compilation effort.
</P>
<P>
He said the books will mainly serve party and government
officials, scientists and technicians, teachers and individuals
with advanced education levels.
</P>
<P>
The project will be the largest popular science publication
project in Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Launches New Tax-Raising Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines Wednesday
launched a program to encourage taxpayers to make themselves
immune from further investigation and audit by paying more.
</P>
<P>
Through the Economic Recovery Assistance Payment Program,
taxpayers could pay 20 percent more than the tax paid in 1997 for
immunity from further investigation and audit, Beethoven L. Rualo,
commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenues, told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The program will maximize revenue collection with least
administrative costs and encourage voluntary tax compliance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another objective of the program is to clean up the bureau's
backlog of unaudited tax returns in order to keep the bureau
updated and be focused on the most current accounts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rualo estimated that the government could generate some
40-billion-peso (1-billion-U.S. dollar) revenues after the
program's deadline is effected on April 15, 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China and France plan to share
satellite control nets this year in a bid to upgrade their
satellite control capacity.
</P>
<P>
China Xi'an Satellite Control Center (XSCC) and the France's

<HEADLINE> PBOC to Lend More Support to Regional Financial Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (
PBOC), the nation's central bank, will take a series of measures
to ensure the healthy development of the regional financial sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a PBOC press release on Tuesday, the central bank
will give more policy guidance to help smaller financial
institutions improve the quality of their assets and avoid risks.
</P>
<P>
State-owned commercial banks will conduct business mainly in
large and medium cities and focus on state-owned large and medium
enterprises, which will leave more room for development among
local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Steady measures will be taken to form city commercial banks and
further promote the development of urban and rural cooperatives to
better serve the regional, private and rural economy, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
China's regional financial institutions played a pivotal role
in the development of medium and small enterprises and private
firms last year, as some 80 percent of the loans from city
commercial banks and urban cooperatives were channeled into these
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans grew at an average annual rate of 55.4
percent between 1986 and the end of last year, when they reached
388.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans from rural co-operatives surged 25 percent a
year during this period, standing at 834 billion yuan at the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate there were 88 city commercial banks, 3,200
urban cooperatives and 44,000 rural cooperatives at the end of
last year, with 2.1 trillion yuan in combined assets.

<HEADLINE> Software Industry Slated for Priority Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of
Information Industry (MII) has recently announced plans to
prioritize development of the country's software industry, a core
sector for the emerging knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Information Office estimated that
the total 1999 sales volume for the domestic software market will
approach 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion U.S. dollars), up 43 percent
on 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the nation's software industry has initially
taken shape about ten years of development, with some 2,000
software companies and more than 100,000 software developers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the software sector's 1998 sales volume
grew by 21.7 percent on the previous year to 14 billion yuan, with
the information service industry growing by 31 percent to 17.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's software sales volume, despite the big increase last
year, accounts for only one percent of the international market.
An MII official pointed out that China lags far behind developed
countries in terms of development standards for software products.
</P>
<P>
He added that domestic software basically centers on word
processing programs and application software, with imports
accounting for a substantial portion of basic software.
</P>
<P>
The MII has worked out plans to provide a sound investment
environment for domestic and foreign software developers. It will
formulate favorable policies in accordance with high-tech
development mechanisms, according to the official.

<HEADLINE>   New Zealand Disappointed With US Decision on Lamb Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith has expressed "surprise and
disappointment" with a U.S. trade commission finding Wednesday
that lamb imports from New Zealand and Australia are causing
"injury" to United States domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the International Trade Commission (ITC) of the
 United States arises from a petition filed by the U.S. sheep meat
 industry last September. The petition claimed that increased
quantities of imported lamb directly correlates with declining
trends of the U.S. domestic industry, and sought "safeguard
action" against imported lamb.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised and disappointed that the ITC has reached the
conclusion that imports of lamb from New Zealand are causing
injury to U.S. domestic producers," Smith said Wednesday in a
media release.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept that lamb imports are responsible for the
plight of U.S. sheep industry. We take the view that U.S.
industry concerns can be addressed by promoting the growth of the
lamb market in competition with other meat food products, rather
than by limiting trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government, Smith said, will continue to fully
support the New Zealand meat industry in its representations to
U.S. government agencies in order to retain access for New Zealand
lamb exports to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
It is learned from the office of the minister, Smith met with a
senior U.S. trade representative in Wellington Wednesday,
expressing his disappointment with the ITC finding.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge the difficulties of the U.S. sheep meat
industry, but do not accept that imported lamb is the cause of its
decline," he told the U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
"Continued access to U.S. markets for New Zealand lamb is very
important," the minister said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The large amount of patent
applications in south China's province of Guangdong has been
attributed to a powerful impetus by the province's fast-wheeling
economy.
</P>
<P>
The province's patent bureau received a total of 13,124
applications and approved 10,535 patents last year; and this
continues its first place ranking in the country which it has
maintained for several years in a row. So far, it has recorded a
reserve of 40,555 patents.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the patents have been applied to
production and have become a major driving force to the province's
exports. A number of high-tech companies in the province have been
developed based on patent-oriented strategy. For example, the
Huawei Technological Co. has developed and marketed over 30,000
patent document databank CD-ROMs during the past few years.

<P>
HAIKOU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The largest safari park in
China, boasting more than 3,500 crocodiles, has been opened in
South China's Hainan Province and more exotic animals are being
brought in to stock it.
</P>
<P>
The park covers 144.6 hectares in Chengmai county, 20 km west
of Haikou, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
It is a Sino-foreign joint venture. The park was built by Li
Chuanye, a 47-year-old farmer in Hainan, at a cost of 40 million
yuan. His partner, Yang Haiquan, a Thailander of Chinese origin,
provided the 3,500 crocodiles valued at 50 million yuan as his
investment in the venture.

The crocodiles live in two man-made lakes with islets in the
center and surrounded by beaches and wire netting.

Panel Recommendations are as follows, according to the
Associated Press report:
</P>
<P>
-- The IOC should put forth and enforce rules governing
interactions between bid cities and IOC members.
</P>
<P>
-- The IOC should require bid cities to file periodic reports
detailing all expenditures on behalf of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
-- The IOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee should prohibit bid
cities from participating in assisting national Olympic committees
or Olympic Solidarity programs during the bid progress.
</P>
<P>
-- SLOC should monitor the efforts of the IOC and the USOC to
put forth rules governing interactions with IOC members, and
should establish supplementary policies as necessary.
</P>
<P>
-- SLOC should seek Board of Ethics review prior to making
decisions that raise ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
-- SLOC's Executive Committee should conduct twice-annual
reviews of all significant expenditures by SLOC.
</P>
<P>
-- SLOC should thoroughly review its policies so that
appropriate direction is given to management and the Board of
Trustees in conducting their business.
</P>
<P>

violations in secretly giving cash, travel, scholarships and other
gifts to members of the IOC and their families.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi mango growers are
expecting a bumper crop of mango as this year has been termed as
"On Year" by the mango researchers, an English daily said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As per the yielding nature of the mango trees, bumper
production occurs every alternative year and last year was "Off
Year" with a poor yield, the New Nation reported.
</P>
<P>
The condition of budding of mango trees in the northwestern
districts of Natore, Rajshahi and Naogaon is inspiring, according
to the Mango Research Institute (MRI).
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the trees already had their budding
last month while the remaining 20 percent will sprout this month.
</P>
<P>
The mango production was very poor last year with only 60,000
to 70,000 tons of mangoes produced in the three districts, due to
unfavorable climate, the MRI said.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of mango production will be far better this year,
the MRI added.
</P>
<P>
About 225 kinds of mangoes have so far been detected in
Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Stresses Importance of National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant
General Khin Nyunt has stressed the importance of national unity,
citing historical development of the country which had
inter-relations with the national solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Meeting delegates to the forthcoming 52nd Myanmar Union Day
activities planned for Friday, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said the union was
strong, firm, magnificent and enjoyed high prestige during the
period when there was national unity, and the nation's political,
economic, security and social conditions were low during the times
when national unity was weak.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that for half a century the national races, holding
diverse views, had taken to armed struggle since independence,
pointing out that though successive governments tackle the
problems related to armed opposition politically and militarily,
their efforts did not bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the union lagged behind in development
compared with other nations on account of weak national solidarity
for about half a century.
</P>
<P>
He further blamed that the union, though rich in natural
resources, did not develop because of lack of peace and
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the national brethren to seriously take a
historical lesson, saying that if national races continue to
fight, the state will suffer more.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Myanmar saying that "the strength of the nation lies
within," he called for reliance on three internal forces of the
union -- the national people, the government and the Tatmadaw
(armed forces).
</P>
<P>
On February 12, 1947, Myanmar ethnic leaders met at the Panlong
Conference in Shan state, sponsored under the leadership of the
late Myanmar independence hero General Aung San, and signed the
Panlong Agreement to strive in unity for the country's
independence from the British colonial rule. Myanmar won
independence on January 4, 1948.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Water Crisis Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The water shortage which is
expected to affect the northern and northeastern provinces of
Thailand is now under control, a source from the Interior Ministry
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A national ad-hoc committee on water management has been
established to address the water crisis, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Measures implemented by the committee include pumping water for
three days and stopping the supply for six days in all areas
affected by the shortage.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the amount of water in a major dam is reported to
increase from 10 million cubic meters per day to about 15-20
million.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart held
a meeting of governors from all over the country at the Government
House, at which Sanan ordered the water management plan be carried
out until the end of May and the governor revise it every two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Interior Ministry statistics, the number of
villagers affected by the water shortage this year is as much as
7.6 million (1.65 million families) in 435 districts of 47
provinces, more than half of which are in the northeast.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's 1st Wind Power Project Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on Sri
Lanka's first ever wind power project is in progress and expected
to complete soon at Hambantota in the deep south.
</P>
<P>
The 250 million rupees (3.67 million U.S. dollars) project, a
pilot project launched by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), will
add three megawatts of power to the national grid upon completion,
the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to generate power using the country's natural
resources effectively and efficiently, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka experienced a serious shortage of electricity in 1996
due to a severe drought which affected hydro power generation.
</P>
<P>
N.E.G. Nicon of Denmark has been awarded the contract for the
project, which is funded by the International Development
Association and the Global Environmental Facility under a loan
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Three more wind power projects have been proposed at Kirinda,
Palatupana and Bundala in the south, if this pilot project proves
a success, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The CEB plans to generate some 200 megawatts of power by using
natural wind power.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Backs Pullout From Int'l Rubber Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet agreed that
the country withdraws from the International Rubber Organization
(INRO), which is expected to trigger the collapse of the body, a
Government House press release available here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest producer and exporter of natural
rubber, will also delay paying 401 million baht (11.1 million U.S.
dollars) to the INRO until the other members pay their share.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the reason for Thailand's withdrawal is
that "the benefit of being a member of the INRO is not significant
compared to the financial support Thailand contributed to the
INRO."
</P>
<P>
Thailand has paid a total of 2.3 billion baht (63.9 million
dollars) to the buffer fund that is used to support the rubber
price.
</P>
<P>
Newin Chidchob, deputy agriculture and cooperative minister,
said the INRO had done nothing to help producers and it had tended
to help rubber consumers instead.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Foreign Ministry has been assigned to proceed on
the notification to the secretary general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's withdrawal from the INRO will be enforced within one
year from the date when the U.N. secretary general receives the
official statement from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is likely to receive a two billion baht (55.6 million
dollars) refund.
</P>
<P>
The INRO comprises six rubber producing countries and 16
consuming countries. Although Thailand last month paid 375 million
baht (10.4 million dollars) toward the rubber fund, major
producers Nigeria, Malaysia and Indonesia had not paid their
contributions, nor had large-scale users.

COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of Sri Lanka's army
and air force were deployed and a police curfew was imposed to
curb mob violence which broke out at Pannala in the North Western
province, police sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seen as a continuation of the election violence in the province
following the poll of January 25, Tuesday's incident took place
after a funeral in the area of a person who was beaten and killed
by shop owners Sunday for not settling the bill.
</P>
<P>
Crowds that attended the funeral were later alleged to have
attempted to attack the home of a rival party member when the
police were called in.
</P>
<P>
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the
crowds when the crowds turned on them and attacked them with hand
grenades and other missiles, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the officer in charge of the Pannala police
station was seriously injured in the fray. Five members of the mob
were also hospitalized after receiving injuries.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Assembly Approves Bill on Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian National
Assembly Tuesday approved a bill that will allow the country to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by 330 votes
for, 13 against and 1 abstention.
</P>
<P>
The voting marked the end of the legal process of Hungary's
endeavor to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the assembly before general deliberation,
Prime Minister Orban Viktor called for the bill to be passed,
saying Hungary's gaining of NATO membership will be a "historic"
event and allows Hungary to return to the western defense system.
</P>
<P>
Csurka Istvan, leader of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (
MIEP), said his party opposed the bill and urged the country to
take a "neutral" position.
</P>
<P>
NATO membership is not in Hungary's interests and will involve
Hungary in unnecessary conflicts, he added.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also approved a bill on partnership between
Hungary and NATO in 1999. Under the bill, foreign troops involved
in the military maneuvers under NATO's Partnership for Peace
program will be allowed to cross Hungarian territory. MIEP,
however, voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
Hungary applied for NATO membership in early 90's. In July of
1997, Hungary, Poland and the Czech participated in NATO's
expansion negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The three countries' protocols on joining NATO were first
signed in December 1997 and later approved by all the member
states of the organization on December 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Hungarian government on January 29 this year,
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana confirmed NATO's invitation
to Hungary's participation and required the relevant documents on
Hungary's joining of NATO to be stored in the United States.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
approved a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars for a road
restructuring project that will help create greater transport
efficiency in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The project includes the rehabilitation of priority sections of
national roads: the upgrading of routine road maintenance,
institutional improvement in the Department of Roads, the
development of road maintenance and construction industries, and
improvement in road transport policies, regulations and road
safety.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's road network is in poor condition and rapidly
deteriorating, the bank said. Of the 17,000 kilometers of national
roads, only 37 percent are in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost, including contingencies, is 135.7
million dollars, of which the Kazakh government is contributing 35.
7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan will carry the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based
single currency loans in U.S. dollars, and has a maturity of
twenty years, including a 5-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Since Kazakhstan joined the World Bank in 1992, the bank has
committed a total of 1.75 billion dollars for 17 projects in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Large-Scale Testing for AIDS Vaccine Launched in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand announced Tuesday the
launch of large-scale human testing of an experimental AIDS
vaccine, the first in this country and the second in the world,
the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yooth Bodharamik, director-general of the Communicable Disease
Control Department, was quoted as saying that the trial will
involve the Aidsvax B/E vaccine, made by VaxGen of the United
States, which began large-scale trials in the U.S. last June.
</P>
<P>
Aidsvax B/E is not the first experimental AIDS vaccine to be
tested in humans. Since 1987, a number of vaccine candidates have
been given to people enrolled in small clinical trials in the
U.S., Thailand, and other countries. However, after having been
found to be safe and to stimulate an immune response, Aidsvax B/E
is the first to proceed to large-scale human testing, or "Phase
III" trials.
</P>
<P>
Yooth said the vaccine to be tested in Thailand will differ
from that tested in the U.S., to match the different strains of
HIV found in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai trial will involve 2,500 volunteers frequenting
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's drug rehabilitation clinics,
while the U.S. trial involves 5,000 volunteers primarily at risk
of sexual transmission.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vichai Chokvivatana, secretary to the committee considering
the study and research in humans, said the Thai volunteers, who
are currently not infected, will be divided into two groups. The
first will receive the active vaccine while the other will be
given a placebo. These volunteers will be monitored for three
years to see how many become infected.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, according to the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, the number
of people living with HIV will have grown to 33.4 million, with
16,000 becoming infected each day, or 11 per minute. More than 95
percent of HIV-infected people now live in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
According to new estimates, the number of people living with
HIV/AIDS is rising beyond 800,000 in Thailand. Therefor, the
development of a safe and effective vaccine is essential to bring
the epidemic under control.

<HEADLINE> Hungary-Romania Ties Enter New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor and his visiting Romanian counterpart Radu Vasile said here
Tuesday that their recent meeting has ushered in a new phase in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, the Hungarian prime
minister said he appreciated the efforts made by the two
governments to increase trust and eliminate differences.
</P>
<P>
He said they have begun to resolve long-standing issues between
the two countries, which include issues related to bilateral
economic ties, regional cooperation and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian prime minister said the two countries should
continue to strengthen economic and trade relations. The two-way
trade this year is expected to increase to one billion U.S.
dollars, compared to 700 million dollars last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the super-highway which will be built between the two
countries is intended to strengthen bilateral trade and economic
ties. They did not, however, discuss whether the highway would
extend to residences of ethnic Romanians inside Hungary, he added.
</P>
<P>
Vasile arrived here on Monday for a two-day official visit,
during which the two sides discussed issues such as setting up a
mixed agricultural committee, increasing cultural exchanges, and
developing border trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have improved since the two countries signed
good-neighbor and friendship pacts in 1996. But the two countries
still have differences regarding ethnic minorities living within
their borders, which remain a major block in the development of
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Utah Report: No Criminal Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The top two officials of
Salt Lake's Olympic Bidding Committee were blamed today for
ethical violations, but no criminal conduct, in a report released
by the Organizing Committee's probe into the Olympic corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The report focused on Tom Welch, who led the successful bid for
the 2002 Winter Games, and Dave Johnson, vice president of the
bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
"This is an ethical dilemma, and we did find several instances
in which individuals stepped over the line," said SLOC attorney
Beth Wilkinson. The investigation by the independent panel,
headed by a former Utah Supreme Court justice, found no evidence
of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
In summarizing the more than 300-page report, SLOC chairman
Robert Garff said Johnson and Welch spent payment to IOC members
and their relatives without getting the authorization from the bid
committee's board.
</P>
<P>
Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week
claimed that Gov. Mike Leavitt and others gave them the permit to
do all those things. However, Leavitt denied it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report pointed out they did not have
subpoena powers and some people refused to cooperate. The probe
based mainly on examining documents.
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel inquiry was just one of five investigations
into Olympic corruption. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S.
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The IOC investigation focused on its own members, while the
ethics panel probed at Utah Olympic bidders.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the IOC found that $800,000 in cash
payments, scholarships, medical care and travel expenses was paid
to 14 IOC members. So far, nine have been expelled or have
resigned.

<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Health said that more than 100
million Chinese suffer from hypertension, and the incidence is
expected to continue to rise in the near future, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the ministry showed that only 53 percent
of Chinese have had their blood pressure measured, and only four
percent of cases involving high blood pressure are effectively
controlled in China's urban areas, one percent in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged experts with the Chinese Association of
Hypertension to compile a programmatic outline dubbed the "China
Guidebook on Hypertension Prevention and Control."
</P>
<P>
The guidebook focuses on instructing physicians at all levels
in the country in blood pressure control and in telling them how
to improve public-awareness about the disease.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's experts have asked public health units at all
levels to prioritize hypertension control through budgetary and
policy support and through public-awareness activities.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Favors Partial Revision of CIS Security Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Kemelevich Tokayev has called for partial revision of
the seven-year-old collective security treaty of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), the Interfax news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Uzbekistan's decision
not to renew the treaty, Tokayev said his country has all along
respected foreign policies and acts of a sovereignty state and so
respects Uzbekstan's decision to withdraw from the pact, "if it
believes this choice better benefits its national interests."
</P>
<P>
He noted that some articles of the treaty should be revised to
adapt it to the current situation of the CIS, while acknowledging
that the collective security treaty is of great importance for CIS
members to coordinate action in handling crises.
</P>
<P>
The treaty helped maintain safety in the southern CIS border
region when the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated in 1996. In
October 1996, signatories met in Alma Ata to discuss ways to
prevent the Afghan situation from endangering the Mid-Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The collective security treaty, signed in May 1992 in the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent, stresses that all signatories share duties of
common defense.
</P>
<P>
The document stipulates that signatories should join hands to
eliminate dangers that threaten the security, territorial unity
and sovereignty of any member of the pact or world peace.
</P>
<P>
All CIS member states, except Moldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan,
have signed the treaty, which expires in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the signatories have expressed their readiness
to renew the treaty, with Uzbekistan backing out and Azerbaijan
undecided on the issue.

</P>
<P>
Some 560 private enterprises in the province have set up joint
ventures with overseas counterparts, with combined contractual

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Wealth Abroad Not Found Yet: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Lt. Gen. A.M. Ghalib has said that his office, in cooperation with
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has yet to find any wealth
belonging to former president Soeharto overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a report to us has stated
that it conducted investigations into the possibility of Soeharto
possessing wealth overseas in the form of bank accounts, saving
deposits or real estate. But so far, the ministry's search has not
come to any discoveries," Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
The result of months of work by both offices would be submitted
to President B.J. Habibie soon, Ghalib was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general office's spokesman Soehandoyo described
the failed attempts of the Indonesian Embassy in Britain to find
any data or information on the money reportedly kept in Indonesian
banks in London under the names of Soeharto and his family
members.
</P>
<P>
For its part in the task of tracking down and if possible
retrieving Soeharto's reported overseas wealth, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said it gathered reports from at least 16
Indonesian embassies abroad.
</P>
<P>
"In Washington, it was difficult to seek any information about
Soeharto's wealth as the issue was considered too complex and
sensitive there," Soehandoyo said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Luxembourg government had promised to help with
the investigation only if the case was brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 last year amid the
country's worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is
accused of corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in
power.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Denounces Evaluation of U.S. Anti-Drug Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government has
again denounced the annual evaluation and certification of
countries made by the United States, which are recognized as
having conducted adequate and sufficient anti-drug operations,
said Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said that Mexico does not accept the evaluation by
Washington D.C. of its anti-drug policies, adding that the country'
s anti-narcotics actions were carried out under Mexican laws and
with the respect of territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico had refused to extradite to the U.S. five former
Mexican bank employees allegedly involved in drug-money laundering
by U.S. agents during the anti-drug "Operation Casa Blanca" last
year.
</P>
<P>
The operation violated the United Nations Anti-Drugs Convention
and a Mexican-American bilateral accord since U.S. undercover
agents took illegal action in Mexican territory, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said the five former bank employees would be tried by
Mexican courts on charges of money laundering and the judge in
charge of the case would issue his ruling by February 11.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said the Casa Blanca issue would not be included in the
agenda of the February 15 meeting between Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and U.S. President Bill Clinton in the Mexican
southeastern peninsula of Yucatan.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges End of Fighting Between Ethiopia and Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Tuesday called on Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop their fighting
and respect the moratorium on air raids agreed in June of last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency ANSA, the Italian
government has urged both sides to avoid the use of force and make
every effort to achieve a peaceful solution in line with proposals
advanced by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Italy is planning to promote a political initiative within the
EU and with the help of the U.S. in support of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean-Ethiopian border tensions erupted on June 5 last year
when the two sides launched a series of bombing raids. An
estimated 1,000 people were killed in two weeks of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
Since then, various mediation attempts have been made, most
recently by the United States, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The dispute blew up over territories along the countries'
colonial borders, whose status was left hanging when Ethiopia
recognized independent Eritrea. Italy is the former colonial power
of the region and has been involved in seeking a peaceful solution
since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Dini sent two government letters mentioning maps
drawn by Italian cartographers early in the century. The maps show
precise boundaries for the two countries at the time, which
diplomatic experts say could be used as a reference for settling
the dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to end their
fighting, which he said threatened the entire region.
</P>
<P>
"I urge both parties to halt the fighting immediately. If the
conflict continues, its human and economic cost will be
incalculable for the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea," Clinton said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"A peaceful solution can and must be found without delay."
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, heavy fighting erupted between the two countries
because of a border dispute dating back from May. Fighting has
raged for a fourth day in a row.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged Ethiopia to end an air-strike campaign in
support of its troops, which he said violated a moratorium on such
attacks and escalated the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent former National Security Adviser
Anthony Lake to the region four times in recent weeks to try to
seek a settlement. Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for African Affairs, has pursued what Clinton called "intensive"
shuttle diplomacy between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian, Brazilian Presidents Inaugurate Giant Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Bolivia and
Brazil on Tuesday inaugurated a 2-billion-dollar natural gas
pipeline linking their countries.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is Bolivia's largest investment project and the
major project currently underway in South America.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia's Finance Minister Herbert Muller said at the ceremony
held near the border town of Puerto Suarez that the pipeline will
also enable Bolivia to export 50,000 to 100,000 barrels of crude a
day.
</P>
<P>
He said the production process of natural condensed gas left
large quantities of residual oil which could also be sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
Muller said the area of the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo alone
needs 100 million cubic meters of gas a day, equivalent to the
whole amount used daily by Argentina, ensuring a huge regional
market for Bolivia's natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline took a little more than a year to build. More than
25 years ago, Bolivia signed an agreement with Brazil to export
gas to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline extends 3,000 kilometers from Rio Grande, Bolivia,
to the cities of Sao Paulo, Curitiba and Porto Alegre of Brazil.
It is jointly administered by the Bolivian State Petroleum Company,
Brazil's Petrobras, and Gas Transboliviano.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras is in charge of the construction in both countries.
Also involved are two U.S. companies, Enron Corp. of Houston and
Bechtel of San Francisco, and Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch
oil and gas giant.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras, the Brazilian oil and gas company, has agreed to buy
8 million cubic meters of natural gas a day for the first seven
years of the 20-year supply contract. Afterward, the volume
purchased will go up to 16 million cubic meters a day.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Petrobras will pay for the
gas even if it does not find buyers.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas from that pipeline will be used by a thermoelectric
plant to produce more electricity for the region.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia has an estimated 281 billion cubic meters of natural
gas reserves, according to the State Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to bring Bolivia an annual earning of
130 million U.S. dollars in the fifth year of operation, according
to the State Petroleum Company.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank and
the Andean Development Corp are financing the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) presented on Tuesday International Olympic
Committee (IOC) sponsored scholarships to three badminton players,
the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles specialist Candra Wijaya, his female counterpart
Deyana Lomban and rising men's singles star Taufik Hidayat are
three of four Indonesian sportsmen and women who have won the
Olympic Solidarity scholarships. The other athlete, female lifter
Sri Indriyani, will receive her share on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
M. Moeslim, a KONI official in charge of scholarships, said the
shuttlers deserve 220 U.S. dollars in monthly allowances for a
year while Indriyani will only get 200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moeslim said that in the first phase of the scholarship program
each athlete would receive reimbursement of their allowances from
September to November.
</P>
<P>
The allowance is part of an IOC monthly scholarship worth 1,200
U.S. dollars, which will also be used for sports facilities,
coaches' salaries, medication, expert advice in nutrition and
psychology, medical insurance, board and lodging and
administration for the council.
</P>
<P>
Moeslim said the amount of an allowance was determined by each
sports federation.
</P>
<P>
"That's why Indriyani is receiving a different amount from the
badminton players," he said, adding that the federation could
adjust the sum if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Both Candra and Taufik said the scholarships would encourage
them to fare better in international tournaments and aim to win
gold medals at the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Increase Coffee Export in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is to increase
its coffee export after a six-month low in January, the Federation
of Brazilian Coffee Exporters announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports last month totaled 1.39 million 60-kilogram bags, the
lowest since the 1998-99 crop year beginning in July, although 68
percent higher than a year earlier, the federation added.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the world's leading coffee producer and exporter, and
the current crop is estimated at 34.6 million bags, the largest in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Brazil earned from its January exports less than 170 million U.
S. dollars, virtually unchanged from 168.7 million U.S. dollars in
January 1998 despite the higher volume. The average sale price per
bag in January was 121.5 U.S. dollars, compared to 202.7 dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Brazil increased its coffee export due to
the recent evaluation of its currency, the real.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to See First Ever Foreign-Funded Electric Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's energy sector is going to
benefit from the first new surge of foreign investment on the
island in nearly 40 years, said the weekly Opciones published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the Panamanian company Genpower Cuba will
invest 15 million U.S. dollars to build a diesel-fueled electric
plant in Juventud, 125 kilometers south of Havana.
</P>
<P>
Specialized companies have already started to construct the
plant, which is due to be finished by the end of this year, with a
capacity that will meet the needs of 100 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The investment is expected to be recovered within four and a
half years with the sale of electricity to Cuba's Electric Union.
</P>
<P>
Genpower Cuba General Manager Mike Nahmad said the company
would reinvest the benefits in Cuba, noting that another 150
million dollar giant energy project might be launched later.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said other foreign investors are participating in
the modernization of the island's thermoelectric plants and in
projects to boost natural gas supplies for domestic consumption.

<HEADLINE> 14 Cubans Die From Pesticide Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's health authorities said
Tuesday a highly toxic pesticide caused the death of 14 people and
the poisoning of 48 others last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The mass poisoning affected people who had eaten fried food
prepared by a private vendor, who also died after consuming his
own food in the village of Manguito, 180 kilometers east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Arnaldo Castro, of the Public Health Ministry, said the
vendor might have used containers previously storing pesticides,
which caused the mass poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The latest medical report said that 15 of the 48 people
hospitalized were seriously ill, while nine others were moderately
sick and 24 were recovering.

<HEADLINE> Bankers See Less Risks for Brazilian Crisis to Affect Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexican bankers Tuesday
said the risk that Brazil's crisis could affect Mexico has
significantly decreased and foreign investors are dealing with the
two economies separately.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the risks were shown by growing purchases of
Mexico's Brady bond compared to Brazil's treasury bonds, Mexican
bank analysts said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They said Mexico's benchmark 28-day Cetes bonds whose rates
went up to 33.41 percent after the devaluation of Brazil's
currency, the real, dropped to 30.92 percent in the first week of
February, while interest rates in Brazil remained high.
</P>
<P>
The real's accumulated slippage reached 35 percent in the
period between January 14 and February 4, while the Mexican peso's
rate went up six percent during that time.
</P>
<P>
They said the main danger threatening Mexico would be the
return of hyper-inflation in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The financial analysts said they expected the Brazilian
economic growth to fall between 3-6 percent, adding that the
contraction would not affect Mexico due to the low levels of trade
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 80 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Tuesday the provision of a total of 80 million U.S. dollars in
loan and credit to help China restore basic services to
communities devastated by last year's Yangtze floods.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to support the Yangtze Flood Emergency
Rehabilitation Project aimed to rapidly rebuild the social and
economic infrastructure of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 80 million dollars, 40 million dollars will be provided
in a loan which carries the bank's standard interest rate, with a
maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period. The
other 40 million dollars are a credit from the International
Development Association (IDA) on standard IDA terms with 35 years'
maturity.
</P>
<P>
The project cost is 132.5 million dollars, 52.5 million dollars
will be supplied by the government of China, according to the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project funds will cover the restoration and reconstruction
of 84 roads with a total length of 945 kilometers, 55 water supply
systems, 146 hospitals or health centers, and 194 secondary and
primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen irrigation areas will be restored to supply water to
44,200 hectares of farmland, benefiting an estimated 446,000
farmers. In addition, computer modeling systems to improve flood
forecasting, simulation, and management will be funded by the
project.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses caused by floods in the three provinces are
estimated at 15.2 billion U.S. dollars, the World Bank said. It
added that the damage would have been much worse without the
massive flood-fighting operation mounted by the government of
China.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Suspends Crude Exports After Major Pipeline Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's state-run oil company
Petroecuador said Tuesday it will suspend its crude exports due to
the rupturing of a major oil duct on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that pressure on parts of the
tubes eroded by rust has caused the leakage in the pipeline, which
used to send 350,000 barrels of crude daily from the Amazon jungle
oil wells to the sea port of Balao, near the Colombian border.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage will last for at least three days, causing losses
of about 1.8 million U.S. dollars a day, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Pipeline manager Pedro Freile denied that the problem was
caused by a mechanical failure at the pressure-reducing station of
Chriboga, 90 kilometers away from Quito.
</P>
<P>
Petroecuador said that it will clean up the zone and repair the
duct as soon as possible.

LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, the world governing body
of football, plans to intervene in the continuing row between
Celtic and Croatia Zagreb over Mark Viduka's transfer fee.
</P>

The Croatian club are furious that the Scottish champions
forwarded only 900,000 pounds for the controversial Australian
striker when they expected the agreed three million pounds fee.

Instead Celtic said they would split the remaining 2.1m with
the player and his previous club, Melbourne Knights.
</P>
<P>
Zagreb, already angry about the delay in payment, complained to
FIFA about the Glasgow club's action.
</P>

FIFA spokesman said: "We are in contact with both parties about
the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is pending, and we have nothing more to say on it
at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Viduka returned to Parkhead only last month after fleeing to
Australia over Christmas, complaining of emotional stress.
</P>
<P>
He has been building up his fitness after a seven-week absence
and could make a long-awaited debut on Saturday in the Tennents
Scottish Cup third-round match against Dunfermline.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A 73rd-minute goal by Jan
Koller lifted the Czech Republic to a 1-0 away win over hosts
Belgium in a soccer international on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Koller, playing his first cap on the national squad, scored the
lone goal after he beat Belgian defenders Gordan Vidovic, Glen de
Boeck and goalkeeper Geert de Vlieger in a run-up from outside the
box to within close range of the goalmouth to put the visitors
ahead and finally to a victory in the team's first international
match this year.
</P>
<P>
Koller, ironically, now plays in the Belgian first division and
leads this season's scorers list with 15 goals from 11 games his
club Lokeren played so far.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Horvath almost made it 2-0 for the 1996 European
championship runners-up at the 85th minute but his shot went just
over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The visitors played a better game with sound teamwork and more
shots at goal. The Czech outshot the Belgians with seven attempts
against four.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, the co-host of the 2000 European championship with the
Netherlands, has so far played three internationals. It beat
Cyprus 1-0 but went 1-0 down to Greece, both in Cyprus, before
Tuesday's defeat on home turf.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian eleven, better known as the Red Demons in Europe,
plan to play Bulgaria later this month at home for another warm-up
game.

line on the club vs country issues currently under dispute.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here on Tuesday, the G14 group
discussed compensation by national federations for clubs whose
players are called away on international duty, and how many times
a year they should be allowed to be called.
</P>
<P>
All the clubs want compensation, arguing that as they pay their
players' salaries they are entitled to some recompense, but
opinions vary as to how far they should push federations, many of
which in Eastern Europe and Africa are strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
The clubs expect to meet with Blatter in Zurich on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Two other matters failed to reach agreement and will also be
looked at again next month.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan proposed that the number of players allowed to be
registered for European competition should be raised from 25 to 35.
</P>
<P>
And several of the 13 clubs present -- representatives from
Italian club Juventus were absent -- want to be able to field
players in European competition even if they have played for
another club in Europe during the same season.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The ad-hoc commission of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) will have a full review of
the report released today by the Board of Ethics of the Salt Lake
Organization Committee (SLOC) as soon as the report is forwarded
to the commission.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after being informed that the SLOC had released
the report, the IOC said that it remained fully committed to
investigating and taking action based on all available evidence
about the Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IOC Executive Board expects to receive the earliest
possible recommendations of the ad-hoc commission after its review
of the SLOC Board of Ethics report.
</P>
<P>
Based on the evidence available at the time, the ad-hoc
commission submitted its recommendations on January 24 to the IOC
Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Board called for the expulsion of five members, a
reform of the bid city process and a review of any credible
evidence relating to the past bid cities.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Rapporteur to Tour Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. special
rapporteur is expected to visit the Balkans to monitor the human
rights situation in the region, a U.N. spokesman announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that "the
U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the
former Yugoslavia, Jiri Diestbier, will travel to the region this
Sunday for a two-day mission."
</P>
<P>
Diestbier will first meet with Croatian government officials in
the capital of Zagreb, and go to the former conflict zones there,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
He will then travel to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY), and spend several days in Vojvodina, in the northern part
of the FRY, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The rapporteur's proposed tour coincides with the peace talks
in France between warring parties in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the
provicne's population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs
for independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Alex Ferguson, the Premiership's
most successful manager, now has the chance to become the best
paid boss in Britain, after Manchester United revealed they had
opened contract talks.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who has been in charge at Old Trafford since 1986,
could be in line for a three-year deal reported to be worth five
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The new deal would eclipse the 1m-a-year the 57-year-old Scot
now earns and would give him the biggest pay packet in the
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards initially said negotiations on a
new contract would not start until the summer.
</P>
<P>
But the club have instead chosen to move now after the Football
Association identified Ferguson as a contender for the England
manager's job.
</P>
<P>
It is thought United are aiming to complete the negotiations
after the end of the season.

<HEADLINE> Robson Backs Wilkinson for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager, Bobby
Robson, believes Howard Wilkinson should become national coach on
a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Robson has given his backing to the former Leeds manager, who,
he says, has all the right qualities to steer his country through
the troubled Euro 2000 qualifying campaign.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson has been given the first chance to stake a claim for
the job on a permanent basis and leads his team out against World
Cup winners France at Wembley on Wednesday evening knowing a good
performance will probably see his tenure extended until the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
That would take in crucial European Championship qualifiers
against Poland, Sweden and Bulgaria, by which time England's fate
may already be sealed.
</P>
<P>
Robson, who also said that he would not be applying for the
vacant position, believes Wilkinson is the safe pair of hands his
country desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a formality that he will be given the job until
the end of the season, and it would be right if that happened,"
Robson said.
</P>
<P>
"I know Howard very well because he worked for me in 1986 and
1990.
</P>
<P>
"He has lots of experience and won the championship with Leeds
United not too many years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If he wants the job, sets about it in the right way and does a
good job over the next few weeks, I feel sure the Football
Association will keep him in position on a permanent basis."
</P>
<P>
Robson, back as coach at Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven, said that
if the Football Association need a man to help them out of a
crisis, they know where he is.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-profile candidates have already ruled
themselves out of the running to become Glenn Hoddle's successor --
but Robson will not let his country down if his services are
required.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio Four, Robson said: "I won't apply for the
job -- I don't need to do that.
</P>
<P>
"If the FA are finding it difficult to get someone to do the
job, I would never turn my back on my country.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying I want them to come to me. The international
selection panel are good people, and I'm sure they already know
the type of person who is needed," he added.

UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General
Assembly Tuesday accused Israel of illegal actions in occupied
East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian
territories and urged it to stop doing so.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the end of its tenth emergency
special session on the issue, the assembly said Israel should
immediately and fully cease the construction at Jabal Abu Ghneim
and all other Israeli settlement activities as well as all illegal
measures and actions in occupied East Jerusalem according to U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It said all legislative and administrative measures and actions
taken by Israel to alter the character, legal status and
demographic composition of occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of
the occupied Palestinian territory "are all null and void and have
no validity whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly recommended that a conference be convened
in Geneva on July 15 to take measures to enforce the 1949 Geneva
Convention in the occupied Palestinian territory, including
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Ask UN to Send Aid Staff to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have asked the United Nations to send back its international staff
to Afghanistan, assuring them of full protection.
</P>
<P>
Taliban senior officials told a four-member U.N. team in the
Afghan capital of Kabul that the militia has fulfilled most of the
conditions in the security agreement signed between the two sides
last year, the News Network International reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Islamabad that had bound the
Taliban to provide security to U.N. staff and its premises in
Kabul and other areas controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pulled out of its international staff from
the war-torn country after the killing of an Italian U.N. official
in Kabul in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official was attacked by some angry demonstrators
against the U.S. cruise missile attack on alleged terrorist camps
run by Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden in Khost last August.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with the U.N. team Tuesday, the Taliban urged
them to send back its international aid workers since the militia
claimed to have fulfilled most of the conditions contained in the
security agreement.
</P>
<P>
The current talks were a follow up of the negotiations between
U.N. coordinator Erick De Mulle with Taliban officials in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Issue, Core of Middle East Question: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China believes that the
Palestine issue is the core of the Middle East question, said its
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the stand as he took the floor at the resumed
session of the Tenth Emergency Special Session of the U.N. General
Assembly on illegal Israeli actions in occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that only after the Palestine issue is solved in a
just and reasonable manner and all the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people are restored, can genuine and lasting peace be
brought about between Israel and Palestine and peace, stability
and development in the Middle East be realized.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that a political settlement of the Middle East
question should be found on the basis of the relevant U.N.
resolutions and according to the principle of `land for peace,'"
Ambassador Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided recently to temporarily suspend
the implementation of the Wye peace accord, continue building
settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including
East Jerusalem, and postpone the second-phase troop withdrawal
from the West Bank, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
China is gravely concerned over this development and believes
that such moves by Israel, which seriously sabotage the Middle East
peace process and cause tension in the region, should be put to a
halt immediately, Qin said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF, UNESCO Sign MOU to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Two U.N. agencies
Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to deepen the
cooperation in providing education opportunities for girls and
women, and ensuring the provision of early childhood care and
development, a senior U.N. official announced.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), told a session here Tuesday of the
Commission for Social Development that UNICEF and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
signed the MOU to deepen the collaboration between the two U.N.
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We are so delighted that UNICEF and UNESCO are today signing a
Memorandum of Understanding that will deepen our collaboration --
in this case, by pursuing a variety of joint activities aimed at
expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; by
promoting education in situation of emergency and reconstruction;
by supporting the U.N. System-wide Special Initiative on Africa --
and by working to ensure the provision of early childhood care and
development," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 10 years, our two agencies have shared resources
and expertise at the global, regional and national levels to
ensure that all children -- especially the neediest and most
vulnerable, girls as well as boys -- enjoy the basic right to
education," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, in every region of the world, we have learned that
providing quality education, especially for girls, can overcome
the effects of generations of poverty and social inequity, leading
to reductions in infant and under-five mortality, helping to
mobilize communities -- and providing countries with their best
chance for social and economic progress," the UNICEF chief said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the more significant lessons of the last decade has
been that the quality of care for the young child is not only
fundamental to his or her future educational achievement -- but
lies at the very heart of human development," Bellamy said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber, FBI Join Forces to Combat Economic Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Tuesday an
initiative designed to combat jointly economic espionage which
they described as one of the newest threats to the United States'
security.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue at a
conference at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hosted by the National
Chamber Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Business espionage -- whether state-sponsored or conducted by
a rogue hacker -- is a growing threat to shareholder value with
current losses estimated at 2 billion U.S. dollars per month,"
Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
The FBI-U.S. Chamber of Commerce initiative will include: a
system to alert the business community to "cyber" and economic
espionage threats; short- and long-term strategies for identifying
and implementing steps to prevent and solve economic espionage
cases; and a broad-based program designed to educate the private
sector about the problem of economic espionage.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations also reached an agreement on sharing
information between them as well as an initiative to work with the
84 American Chambers of Commerce abroad to begin to discuss the
need for a global understanding of the priority to end economic
espionage.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes to Change Definition of SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced here Tuesday that it has presented a proposal for a
directive to adapt the financial thresholds in the definition of
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in European Union (EU)
financial reporting directives.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow EU member states to extend derogation
from EU financial reporting requirements to more SMEs, thus
increasing by 25 percent the thresholds defining "small" and
"medium-sized" enterprises laid down in the 4th and 7th EU Company
Law directives on annual and consolidated accounts.
</P>
<P>
EU single market commissioner Mario Monti said that adoption of
this proposal would be of immediate practical benefit to thousands
of SMEs in the EU. "It would allow member states to exempt many
more SMEs than at present from full compliance with financial
reporting requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 4th and 7th EU directives, member states have the
option of granting SMEs certain exemptions from the financial
reporting and disclosure requirements imposed on limited liability
companies. The commission said member states may allow them to
draw up and publish only an abridged balance sheet, abridged notes
on the accounts and an abridged profit and loss account. Moreover,
in the case of "small" companies only, member states may allow
them not to publish a profit and loss account or an annual report,
not to disclose certain defined categories of information in the
accounts and not to have their accounts audited.
</P>
<P>
The thresholds for defining "small" and "medium-sized"
enterprises expressed in terms of number of employees, balance
sheet total and net turnover, said the commission, the EU's
executive branch responsible for proposing and enforcing
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the employees threshold remains unchanged
at 50 for "small" companies and 250 for "medium-sized"
enterprises, while the other thresholds are revised every five
years to take account of economic and monetary trends. In the
absence of such a revision, the number of companies which can
benefit from the accounting exemptions is reduced, the EU organ
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of economic and monetary developments since the
last revision of the amounts in 1994, the commission has proposed
to increase the thresholds for balance sheet total and net
turnover by 25 percent as "small" companies hold 3.125 million
euros in balance sheet total while "medium-sized" 12.5 million
euros, and "small" companies have 6.25 million euro net turnover
while "medium-sized" 25 million euro net turnover.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that once adopted by the EU's Council of
Ministers, the amended thresholds would enter into effect when EU
issues its official journal.

<HEADLINE> 34 Million in West Africa Protected From Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) said Tuesday that it has protected over 34
million West Africans from "river blindness" since it launched a
program for the purpose 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It has prevented over 400,000 cases of blindness and cured at
least 1.5 million from infection, according to a press statement
issued by the U.N. spokesman's office in New York.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 million children born after 1974 are not at risk
of going blind due to the disease, WHO added.
</P>
<P>
River blindness is also called onchocerciasis. Before the
Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) was launched in 1974, 60
percent of the people in the region had been infected and in some
cases 10 percent of the villagers were blinded by the bite of the
simuli.
</P>
<P>
Today the risk of onchocercal blindness has been eliminated
throughout the OCP area.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Effective Mobilization of Private Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- In order to promote the
world economic development against the backdrop of the changing
financial universe, private sectors need to be more effectively
mobilized, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks in his address to the Ad Hoc
Working Group on Financing for Development, an open-ended body set
up under a resolution adopted by the 52nd General Assembly
session. The speech was delivered on Annan's behalf by Nitin
Desai, under-secretary-general for economic and development
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Towards this end, we will need to involve more stake-holders
than has been typical in the past. And we will need to devise
innovative mechanisms for dialogue with the business community and
civil society," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Private-sector resources can make enormous contributions, and
certainly we can do more to mobilize them more effectively. But
let us have no illusions here: private resources will not and
cannot do everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The universe of financing is changing, and changing in ways
that have significant political, social and economic consequences.
In this new context, the United Nations will continue to advance
new ideas for identifying new and additional resources for
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic resources are the overwhelming source of financing
for development," he said. "In many instances, however, domestic
savings have not increased in recent years. At the same time,
public resources for development purposes have also declined."
</P>
<P>
"These trends must be reversed," he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Africa Needs Development of Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A symposium held here on
Tuesday once again brought the issue of African development into
the lime light.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), focused its
discussion on the development of science and technology in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa is one of the world's richest regions in terms of
natural resources, yet it has seen little of the profits from their
exploitation. At present, 33 of the world's 48 least developed
countries (LDCs) are in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The continent is blessed with vast mineral wealth, great
agricultural capacity and rich diversity of plants and animals.
Yet, as the market value of these commodities declines, Africa
will need to stimulate the manufacture of value-added products in
order to compete in an increasingly technological market. This
will mean making a commitment to science and technology.
</P>
<P>
However, the science and technology base in most of sub-Saharan
Africa today is inadequate. According to the latest figure given
by UNESCO, Africa only counted 20,000 scientists and engineers, or
0.36 percent of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the continent was responsible for only 0.8 percent of
total world scientific publications. Its world share of patents is
close to zero.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the United States and Europe, there are two to five
scientists and engineers per 1,000 population. Parts of
sub-Saharan Africa have only one scientist or engineer for about
every 10,000 population.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, only South Africa and the Seychelles spend 1 percent
or more of the Gross National Product (GNP) on Research and
development. However, the investment in the development of Science
and Technology in the most developed countries is closer to 3
percent of GNP.
</P>
<P>
It has been said that Africa has its feet in the Stone Age and
its head in the Computer Age. In essence, the following factors
have contributed to distancing the feet from the head.
</P>
<P>
First, brain drain is to blame. Available figures suggest that
as many as 30,000 African holding Ph.D. degrees are living outside
the continent. Students who are able to find employment abroad
leave, while some of those trained abroad do not return.
Meanwhile, poor salaries and prospects in universities mean that
trained scientists and engineers often move to civil service jobs
or to business and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Obsolescence is one of the most serious challenges
for the Science and Technology community in Africa. Training
curricula and science facilities lag far behind those in other
parts of the world. It is common in Africa to see science classes
with students taking turns to use a handful microscopes and other
instruments, if these are even available. In some cases students
have to pay for essential materials themselves.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, political instability and declining infrastructure are
denying the chances for development. War and armed conflicts have
undermined the long-term stability, peace and prosperity of much
of the region. Up to date, more than one third of the 53 countries
of Africa have been afflicted by armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Even in those states that are politically stable, with some
notable exceptions, the inadequate energy, transport and
communications infrastructures are a brake on development, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As the pace of globalization quickens, the interdependence
between nations is growing day after day. Against such a backdrop,
the advancement of science and technology in Africa is very much
helpful to the maintenance of political stability and economic
expansion in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the world should take specific steps to help Africa
out of poverty and catch up with the development levels in other
parts of the world. Science and Technology is one of the most
needy fields on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The international community, especially the most developed
countries which have been long cashing in on Africa's cheaper
prime commodities and labor force, should make sincere efforts to
relieve its debt burdens and increase their official development
assistance, which is steadily on decrease, thus paving the way for
the African development in science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Official Development Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Official development
assistance (ODA) has been the backbone of international finance
for development but is now in absolute and relative decline, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks in his address to the Ad hoc Working
Group on Financing for Development, an open-ended body set up
under a resolution adopted by the 52nd General Assembly session.
The speech was delivered on Annan's behalf by Nitin Desai,
under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that some countries have needed development
aid in the past and will need much less of it in the 21st century.
But the vast majority of developing countries, especially the
least developed countries, still require considerable assistance
if they are to avoid marginalization and compete in the global
marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"ODA can be a catalyst for economic development, a mechanism
that helps countries to reach the stage at which they can take
advantage of potentially larger and more dynamic private capital
flows," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And for many of the poorest countries, official flows are
necessary because they do not succeed in attracting foreign
private investment and other financing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A key related issue is debt relief: the need to help the
poorest countries find a way out of the debt trap so that they can
reduce poverty and pursue sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he has been encouraged by recent efforts to give
high-level political impetus to the search for solutions.

<HEADLINE> Annan on U.N. Role in Promoting World Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- "The United Nations has
a central legitimate interest in questions of international
finance," and the 185-nation world body must do better in
promoting world economic expansion, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement in his speech to the Ad hoc Working
Group on Financing for Development, an open-ended body set up under
a resolution adopted by the 52nd General Assembly session. The
speech was delivered on Annan's behalf by Nitin Desai,
under-secretary-general for economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has a central legitimate interest in
questions of international finance. This mandate derives from the
Organization's over-riding concern with development, and because
of the international financial system's great influence on the
development process and on peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, many countries have found themselves
extremely vulnerable to violent swings in global flows of private
capital. "As we have seen time and again, the main victims are the
poor, the weak and the vulnerable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, economic disruptions, distortions and imbalances can
be root cause of social distress and political instability," he
said. "These are sufficient reasons for the United Nations to step
in."
</P>
<P>
It follows that "we must work with finance ministries and
central banks, and with our own specialized international
institutions, to strengthen the international financial
environment so that it better promotes development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In doing so, we would only be doing what we have always done.
Indeed, ideas launched in the United Nations over the years have
been implemented by the Bretton Woods institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bretton Woods institutions, created in the postwar era
under auspices of the United Nations, include the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, the latter popularly known as the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The most prominent were the International Development
Association, the concessional financing facility at the World
Bank, and the concept of 'adjustment with a human face'," he said.
"This is an area in which we can improve our contribution."
</P>
<P>
Throughout its history and especially in the 1990s, the United
Nations has been a forum for the elaboration of international
norms and goals on critical aspects of economic and social
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All too frequently, such declarations and plans of action have
been followed, several years later, by disappointed appraisals
attributable in no small part to a lack of financial resources,"
he said. "We must do better."

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russia Against Return of Old UNSCOM to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday that the return of the U.N. special
commission to Iraq in its old form is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
"That is a matter of the past," Ivanov said at a press
conference following his meeting with Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber as-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He said a reliable monitoring system should be created to
prevent the production of weapons of mass destruction and their
delivery vehicles in Iraq, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of such monitoring would simultaneously mean
the abolition of the oil embargo against Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Russia's commitment to ensuring Kuwait's
territorial integrity within its internationally recognized
borders.
</P>
<P>
Russia "will assume its full responsibility for peace, security
and stability in the region" as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council, and in light of its historic ties with Arab
countries, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation worsened in the aftermath of U.S.-British
air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister, for his part, urged Baghdad to fulfill
"all U.N. Security Council resolutions without exception."
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about "the sufferings of the Iraqi
people."
</P>
<P>
Sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1991 following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have crippled the country's economy and
people's living standard plummeted.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's stance on U.S. efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein,
the minister said his country is "opposed to any interference in
the internal affairs of any country, including Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "practical results will be achieved
in the near future on the settlement in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Russian and Kuwaiti deputy finance ministers
signed an agreement on the prevention of dual taxation after the
talks.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on
Tuesday held a symposium on the development of science and
technology in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the symposium, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said that "as the world increasingly adapted to the
information age, it is clear that science and technology will
become ever more important to every country's growth and
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"From the communications industry to the bio-technology field,
scientific innovations is the driving force of growth and
development," he said, "And if Africa is to take part in the
progress, nothing less than a transformation in priorities and
policies is needed."
</P>
<P>
"And if Africa is to redress its shortfall in human resources
and scientific progress, it must begin by affording the education
of girls and women complete and comprehensive equality," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our age -- the age of globalization -- offers a unique
opportunity to reverse course. Globalization, as you all know, is
a subject of much discussion and research today. But there is a
tendency still to view the matter largely in economic terms," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is affecting all aspects of our lives, from the
political to the social to the cultural," he said. "Only
knowledge, it would seem, is not being globalized."
</P>
<P>
Nitin Desai, under-secretary-general in charge of economic and
social affairs, attended the symposium and read the prepared
speech on behalf of Annan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Deputy Minister of the
Interior and National Security Artsrun Markaryan was killed
Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Markaryan, 39, was gunned down on a highway near Yerevan, the
Armenian capital, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the second attempt on his life in a little over
a year.
</P>
<P>
On January 22 last year, Markaryan came under submachine gun
fire and sustained grave wounds. He managed to continue work after
complex operations and treatment.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic has witnessed a series of
high-profile assassinations in the past few years. Most were
unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The victims included the chief of the Armenian railway, the
chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the chairman of
the Armenian Culture Fund and the former mayor of Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
The country's prosecutor-general, Genrikh Khachatryan, was shot
dead in his office last August.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, 1998, Armenia's Deputy Defense Minister Vagram
Khorkhoruni was killed on the doorsteps of his apartment.

<HEADLINE> UK Immigration Bill Unveiled for 'Faster' System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw unveiled on Tuesday what he said was the biggest shake-up of
immigration law since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Under the Asylum and Immigration Bill, all cash benefits for
asylum seekers will be replaced with vouchers or support in kind.
</P>
<P>
The bill also contains powers to force local councils to house
asylum seekers where suitable accommodation exists.
</P>
<P>
The new bill is intended to speed up the processing of
applications at a time when the system is under great strain.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the new system would be "fairer, firmer and faster."
</P>
<P>
Home Office figures say 20,000 asylum-seekers are living
illegally in the UK, but the Immigration Service Union believes
the real figure is more than three times higher.
</P>
<P>
Crises such as the conflict in Kosovo have also contributed to
a 50 percent rise in the number of people seeking asylum in the UK
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the bill would also crackdown on those people who
made money smuggling or aiding illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"There are unscrupulous immigration advisers, get-rich quick
solicitors and criminal gangs involved in this who abuse the right
of appeal and so you have three, four or five appeals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we are aiming to do is by having a swifter system is to
ensure that yes we still meet our international obligations to
genuine asylum seekers but we bear down on the criminals," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Build its Own Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official
announced on Tuesday that Iran will build its own satellite with
assistance from a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Post, Telegraph and Telephone Minister Mostafa
Safavi made the announcement in Shahr Kord in Chahalmahal and
Bakhtiyari province, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Majlis (parliament) has approved an allocation up
to 300 million U.S. dollars for the construction of the
satellite, Safavi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as Iran lacks such a technology, it will assign
the construction of the satellite to a foreign company through an
international tender.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani also
announced that Iran is producing a new rocket designed to launch
a satellite into space.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Shahab-4 (Meteor-4) rocket is at the stage of
engine design and test, and will have no military application. All
the works pertaining to Shahab-4 rocket will be accomplished by
Iranian experts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Iran successfully tested the Shahab-3 missile with
a range of 1,300 kilometers, prompting serious concerns of the
United States and Israel about Iran's ambition to produce weapons
of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) - Kenya coffee prices were up by
between 10 to 25 U.S. Dollars per 50-kg bag due to increased
demand from overseas buyers at the weekly auction Tuesday,
according to a source here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prices were also buoyed by improved quality and the main
coffee was offered, a trader at the auction said.
</P>
<P>
Premium grade AAs grades were sold at prices of 178 to 268
Dollars per 50-kg bag from 140 to 230 Dollars while ABs increased
to between 157 to 227 Dollars against 130 to 200 Dollars in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
There was obviously increased general demand for coffee at this
auction, which was mainly driven by quality coffee on sale, said
the trader.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that unlike the auctions held previously when old
coffee was offered alongside the main crop. However, Tuesday's
auction offered only quality main crop.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) said the board
traded all 25,000 50-kg bags it had ready for sale.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Start Final Debate in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate, after
listening quietly for weeks to testimony and arguments, Tuesday
closed the doors of its chamber and began to debate for only the
second time in history whether to remove an American president
from office.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we won't just have speeches, that in fact we will
have deliberations," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said after
senators rejected a request that the final debate be opened to the
public. The Senate voted 59-41 in favor of opening the
deliberations, eight votes short of the required two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
With the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868 on
course to end this week, senators were given 15 minutes each to
debate whether to convict President Bill Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice in the two articles of impeachment in
connection with his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles on February
11 or 12. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict Clinton and
remove him from office. No one believes there are enough votes in
the Senate to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, senators searched for an alternate

support after the trial ends. Democrats want to move right to the
issue of censure, but some Republicans suggested it was possible
Clinton could escape with no punishment at all.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's ruling Likud Party Tuesday announced its
candidate list for the next Knesset (parliament) that will be
elected in the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who already received the
Likud party's nomination for premier in May 17 elections,
remained as number one in the list.
</P>
<P>
The number two slot went to current Science Minister Silvan
Shalom, whose parents immigrated to Israel from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Third, fifth and sixth slots also went to Sephardic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The fact that several Sephardic candidates took top places in
the list will likely help Netanyahu muster more support from
Sephardic Jews in the elections. (BC-Israel-Likud)

<HEADLINE> Kenya Court Demands Proof of a Treaty Between FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The High Court at Mombasa
Tuesday demanded Attorney General Amos Wako should present
evidence of a treaty that allows the FBI to interrogate, arrest
and apply to extradite Nairobi blast suspects within seven days.
</P>
<P>
A senior state counsel, on behalf of Wako, told Justice Philip
Waki, sitting in Mombasa, that there was such a treaty. But she
was unable to produce a copy of it.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Taib Ali Taib, for bomb suspect Ali Mahfoudh Salim, said
the treaty did not exist and he challenged Wako to produce it in
court.
</P>
<P>
"He is bound by law to produce the treaty which he is
alleging," Taib said.
</P>
<P>
The argument over the treaty came after Mwangi made her
preliminary remarks in a case in which Salim, a Kenyan mechanic,
has challenged his extradition for further questioning in
connection with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Salim was arrested last Thursday on suspicion that he had some
 information about the bombing.
</P>
<P>
However, he was released last Saturday after a High Court order
of stopping FBI from extraditing him was issued.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Yugoslavia With Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
threatened Yugoslavia with NATO air strikes if it refuses to allow
foreign peacekeeping troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has... decided that if Serbs fail to agree to the Contact
Group plan and Kosovar Albanians do -- and a prime example of
failing to agree would be to refuse to allow the peace
implementation force -- the Serbs would be subject to air
strikes," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"So they would be making a big mistake to hold up this
agreement over the question of allowing forces in if the Kosovo
Albanians are prepared to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks as Yugoslavia said it would not allow
foreign peacekeeping troops into Kosovo under any terms.
</P>
<P>
Rubin was emphatic, saying: "There is no consideration of a
NATO force being deployed in the absence of an agreement by Serbs
and the Kosovars to its presence."
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have forced warring Serbs and
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo into peace talks now taking place at
Rambouillet, near Paris.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States strongly

Earlier, Iraq said it confronted Western planes that attacked

"At 12:40 (0940 GMT) today, hostile formations approached one

<HEADLINE> Population Explosion Threatens Africa's Future: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The former Vice-Chancellor of
the University of Ghana, Professor George Benneh, has warned that
escalating population growth is exceeding sustainable yield of
life support systems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "In one country after another, the pressure on crop lands,
forests, grasslands and water is excessive as shown by dwindling
forests, eroding soils, desertification and falling water
tables," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Benneh, a leading African Geographer and Chairman of the
National Population Council (NPC), wrote this in an article in
his special issue of the "People and the Planet" magazine,
according to a special story faxed to Xinhua here Tuesday from
Ghana News Agency (GNA).
</P>
<P>
The article coincides with a meeting in Hague, the
Netherlands, to review the world's population and development
situation five years after the ground-breaking meeting on
population in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting which started Monday and ends on February
11, is on the topic: "A World Beyond Six Billion".
</P>
<P>
Benneh noted that "with annual population growth rates of
around three percent, Africa is the fastest growing region with
45 percent of the population under the age of 15 in most
countries."
</P>
<P>
Benneh said while population will double within the next 23
years or even less in the case of countries such as Togo and
Libya, where numbers are projected to double in less than 19
years, the youthful age structure is putting immense strain on
health and education services.
</P>
<P>
In Ghana, more than 30 percent of the government's budget
goes into education, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the goal of free and compulsory education "will become
elusive as the number of primary school-aged children escalates
in the face of declining resources."
</P>
<P>
"There is a real danger that some African countries whose
populations will double in the next few decades may face falling
living standards and scarcity of natural resources... This could
drive them back into stage one of the demographic transition
marked by high birth and death rates from which they have been
emerging."
</P>
<P>
Benneh said the situation is complicated by the spread of AIDS
 with more than 20 million people infected by the HIV virus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Keeps Final Clinton Trial Debate Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate, after
listening quietly for weeks to testimony and arguments, Tuesday
closed the doors of its chamber and began to debate for only the
second time in history whether to remove an American president
from office.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we won't just have speeches, that in fact we will
have deliberations," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said after
senators rejected a request that the final debate be opened to the
public. The Senate voted 59-41 in favor of opening the
deliberations, eight votes short of the required two-thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
With the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868 on
course to end this week, senators were given 15 minutes each to
debate whether to convict President Bill Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice in the two articles of impeachment in
connection with his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles on February
11 or 12. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict Clinton and
remove him from office. No one believes there are enough votes in
the Senate to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, senators searched for an alternate
punishment, such as a censure or rebuke, that might win bipartisan
support after the trial ends. Members of both parties conceded the
final vote was expected to fall far short of the 67 senators
needed to convict and oust Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In a sign that many senators are eager to end the proceedings,
Lott made an offhanded plea that his colleagues keep the debate as
short as possible. "I remind all senators that Lincoln gave his
Gettysburg Address in less than three minutes, and (President)
Kennedy's first inaugural was slightly over seven minutes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lott offered a compromise to those wanting to provide a window
to the public. On a voice vote, senators approved Lott's idea to
allow senators to insert into the Congressional Record after the
trial any statements they made during the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Senators rejected a request from House prosecutors to call more
witnesses to resolve a question over whether White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal gave truthful testimony during the impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Blumenthal said he never passed on to
reporters derogatory information he had received from Clinton in a
private conversations that Lewinsky was a "stalker." Two
journalists have filed affidavits challenging that assertion.
</P>
<P>
Even as the deliberations began, senators were struggling to
draft a strong censure resolution condemning Clinton's behavior in
trying to hide an extramarital affair with Lewinsky. Proponents of
censure hope to bring it to the Senate floor immediately after the
trial.
</P>
<P>
But opponents said they feared that if the television cameras
stayed on, senators would use the maximum time allowed under the
rules -- 15 minutes per senator, or a total of 25 hours -- for
debate on the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
With all the evidence submitted, including videotaped testimony
from Lewinsky, the woman at the center of the sex and cover-up
case, the Senate was on a path to end the first presidential
impeachment trial since 1868 by week's end and then move to
censure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. NIH Conducts AIDS Vaccine Test in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Institute
of Health said that it has begun test of a human AIDS vaccine in
Uganda, according to the Associated Press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine known as ALVAC was made by Pasteur Merieux
Connaught using a canarypox virus. It carries three HIV genes. The
NIH said that the canarypox cannot cause human disease, and the
HIV genes by themselves aren't infectious.
</P>
<P>
Although the vaccine has undergone safety testing in about 800
people in the United States and France with no serious side
effects reported, the NIH wants to know whether the vaccine will
trigger a protective immune response to the different HIV subtypes
found in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa and Uganda in particular are heavy hit by AIDS. In
Uganda alone about half-million people have been killed by the
disease and left 1 million children orphaned.

<HEADLINE> Annan Pledges to Help Building Foundations of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday pledged that the United
Nations continues to be engaged in helping to build the
foundations of peace for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the opening of the 1999 session of the
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the
Palestinian People, Annan said the fifty-third session of the
General Assembly has reamined actively involved in matters
relating to the question of Palestine, reflecting the abiding
commitment of the United Nations to the cause of peace, security
and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Assembly resumed its tenth emergency special
session, demonstrating the international community's mounting
alarm at the worsening of the situation on the ground and the lack
of progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that the parties remain committed to the
achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
region based on relevant Security Council resolutions. We must not
lose sight of the gains the peace process has brought so far. Nor
should we forget that success in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations could lead to progress on the other track," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the improvement of the economic and social
conditions was a central element of the peace process, and some
progress had been made in this regard including creating
employment opportunities, improving health and education
facilities and promoting industrial development and Palestinian
institution-building, but much was yet to be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations, for its part, was ready to be
involved to provide vital services to millions of Palestinians.
