Daiwa Bank denies report of merger talks with other banks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Daiwa Bank Ltd. denied a published report Monday
that it was negotiating to merge with the ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. and another major Japanese lender.
	   Several newspapers have reported that Long-Term Credit Bank is
looking for a merger partner after the company's stock plunged
about 40 percent last week on rumors it was struggling to stay
afloat.
	   The latest, published in the Yomiuri, Japan's largest
circulation newspaper, said a merger was in the works between LTCB,
Daiwa and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest
commercial banks. Such a combination would surpass Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi as Japan's largest bank.
	   Daiwa issued a release denying the report.
	   LTCB and Dai-Ichi Kangyo both issued statements Sunday denying
that they were in merger negotiations and on Friday LTCB officials
denied a separate report that their bank would merge with Nippon
Credit Bank.
	   Reports of mergers have increased as Japan's political and
financial leaders say they are determined to do more to clean up
the bad-loan problems at the nation's banks.
	   The Yomiuri said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party would
support the merger as a solution to the banking sector's problems.
	   Japan's financial authorities have traditionally orchestrated
buyouts of weaker banks by stronger institutions as a way of
getting rid of problems without the job losses that would result
from an outright bank failure.
	   Japan's banking industry has been hobbled by hundreds of
billions of dollars in bad loans resulting from the collapse of a
speculative real estate bubble and efforts to fix the problem have
so far not worked.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general, Koichi
Kato, said Monday the government will make a final decision
regarding the formation of a public ``bridge bank'' to dispose of
banks' bad debts by July 8.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ At least 15 people were killed or went missing in
floods that disrupted traffic and shut the airport in the

Striking workers block cars; sabotage leaves 26,000 without service 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Picketing telephone workers scooted
like crabs to block cars leaving company's headquarters Sunday, the
fourth day of a strike in which sabotage has left 26,000 Puerto
Rican customers without service.
	   Some executives were forced to escape by helicopter from the
roof the building by strikers protesting the privatization of the
state-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co., known as Telefonica.
	   Police grabbed the sitting protesters, who tried to block the
driveway by scuttling across, and hauled them away as the cars
rushed through chanting crowds. They made no arrests.
	   Telefonica officials said that workers were continuing to
sabotage telephone lines, cutting off 26,000 of 1.3 million
customers and an unspecified number of automatic bank machines.
	   Nine percent of the company's cellular telephone antennas were
malfunctioning, the company said. In the eastern port city of
Fajardo, fire stations and a hospital were without telephone
service.
	   Fearing for their jobs, 6,400 unionized Telefonica employees are
striking to stop the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of controlling shares to
a consortium led by telecommunications giant GTE Corporation. More
than 1,000 managers are working to keep service going.
	   On Sunday, protesters accused company president Carmen Ana
Culpeper of trying to run them down as she tried to enter the
building. Culpeper said she was turning her car to try another
entrance.
	   The sale of the telephone utility is the centerpiece of Gov.
Pedro Rossello's efforts to privatize government corporations. The
company had a monopoly on telephone service until new federal laws
toppled it in 1996. Rossello says the company no longer can compete
as a government agency.
	   The Puerto Rican Senate approved the sale last week by a 19-9
vote, and the House of Representatives is expected to vote
Wednesday on the measure.

Louise Woodward implies Eappens were responsible for baby's death 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS name of BBC reporter in graf 10; fixes typo in graf 16
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States after being convicted of killing a baby
in her care, Louise Woodward implied the parents were responsible
for the death.
	   ``If the parents didn't do it, who did?'' Ms. Woodward told the
British Broadcasting Corp. in an interview scheduled to be aired on
British television Monday night.
	   Prosecutors had claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to
Britain on Thursday with a manslaughter conviction, shook
8-month-old Matthew Eappen to death. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me,'' she said in the interview, according to
excerpts released by the BBC.
	   Woodward allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had already
spent in prison.
	   A BBC spokeswoman, speaking on customary anonymity, said the
interview will cover Ms. Woodward's ``desperate attempts to cope
with Matthew on the day he went to hospital, her arrest, reaction
to the trial and fight to clear her name.''
	   During the program, the 20-year-old former au pair will talk
about life with the Eappen family, her supporters back in Britain
and her reaction to last week's high court decision to allow her to
go home, the BBC said.
	   The Eappen family was not immediately available for comment late
Sunday.
	   Ms. Woodward's mother, Susan, has promised ``lots of answers''
to questions surrounding the baby's death in February 1997.
	   A photograph released by the BBC of Ms. Woodward being
interviewed by reporter Martin Bashir drew criticism Monday from
The Sun and The Mirror tabloid newspapers, which saw echoes of
Bashir's famous interview with Princess Diana in 1995, in which she
talked of the breakdown of her marriage.
	   ``Woodward seems to model herself on the princess by dressing
and sitting like her,'' The Mirror said. ``She has perfected the
coy, wide-eyed look Diana used.''
	   Even the hotel room where the talk takes place looks similar to
the setting chosen by Diana, the chairs arranged in identical
fashion, the newspaper said, dubbing the interview the ``Princess
Louise'' talk.
	   ``It's downright deliberate. Why not wear a summer dress or hold
the interview in a garden? Louise Woodward is taking off Diana,''
The Mirror quoted royal expert Margaret Holder as saying.
	   ``I can't imagine what this interview is for unless it is to
convey 'I'm as innocent as Diana was' or 'I'm as great a lover of
children as Diana was,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying.
	   The BBC countered that any resemblance to the Princess Diana
interview was ``pure coincidence,'' The Mirror said.
	   ``Don't treat this killer like royalty,'' the newspaper said in
an editorial headline.
	   Although Ms. Woodward said during a press conference on Thursday
that she would receive no payment for the BBC interview and that
she would not sell her story, controversy has since broken out over
the tabloid Daily Mail's confirmation that it paid 40,000 pounds
(dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, before the
conviction was reduced. The newspaper began publishing a series on
Saturday, which it said was based on contacts with the girl and her
parents over several months.
	   In Monday's installment, the newspaper reported on Ms.
Woodward's life inside prison.

Malaysia loses billions in capital flight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A total of 32 billion ringgit
(dlrs 8 billion) has been pulled from Malaysia's banks since the
Asian contagion crushed currencies one year ago, the country's
Finance Minister said.
	   Up to 20 billion ringgit (dlrs 4 billion) had been transferred
overseas while the rest was withdrawn from deposits at banks, Anwar
Ibrahim said Sunday.
	   ``Of course, this has led to a situation where our financial
institutions are having difficulties,'' he said.
	   Anwar cited the capital flight to defend high interest rates, a
policy that has put him at odds with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad who blames the tight monetary policy for choking the
economy.
	   ``If we reduce our interest rates, surely more money will flow
out of our country,'' Anwar said at the final session of the annual
convention of his United Malays National Organization party.
	   Mahathir and his chief economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, have
railed against high rates, echoing complaints by businessmen that
borrowing money had become more expensive and was hurting them.
	   Many Malaysian banks, burdened by non-performing loans, have
become tight-fisted.
	   Anwar said banks could reduce their effective lending rates to
13 percent from 15 percent now. Maybank, the largest commercial
bank in the country, has lowered its base lending rate to 12.10
percent.
	   However, Anwar said not all banks were following government
directives to relax lending to productive sectors. He named the
Bank of Tokyo and Public Bank as those which did not provide
satisfactory loans.
	   ``I have directed Bank Negara (the central bank) to give me a
weekly report. If a bank trusted with disbursing the loans fails to
comply, we will replace it with another bank,'' he warned.

Australia faces retaliation if it puts up ``shutters,'' EU's Brittan warns 
</HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
Associated press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ European Union vice president Sir Leon
Brittan issued a blunt warning to Australia Monday that reverting
to protectionist trade policies would result in retaliation by its
trading partners.
	   Australia's conservative coalition government is under pressure
from the right-wing populist One Nation party, which severely
eroded support for the ruling coalition at a recent state election
and threatens to repeat the performance at upcoming national
elections.
	   Led by Pauline Hanson, One Nation won about 23 percent of the
vote in the Queensland election with policies opposing Asian
immigration and international trade liberalization.
	   Hanson's policies include reintroduction of tariff protection
for agricultural industries and, until a recent backflip, the
funding of low-interest loans to farmers by printing more money.
	   Declining to comment directly on Hanson's rise, Sir Leon told a
Foreign Correspondents Association briefing that in the modern era
of globalization, no country could exist on its own.
	   ``You have to decide at the end of the day whether you want to
look forwards or go backwards,'' Sir Leon said.
	   ``If you go backwards and set up protectionist barriers you
can't expect other countries not to retaliate.
	   ``There will always be people who think closing up shop is the
best thing ... (but) if you decide to put up the shutters other
countries will do the same.''
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard has denounced Hanson's
economic policies as dangerous, but is fighting to win back voters
disaffected by the effects of globalization who flocked to Hanson
in Queensland.
	   Some members of the junior coalition partner the Nationals have
called on the government to adopt Hanson-like policies or face a
backlash among country voters at the national elections, which
Howard is widely expected to call within months.

Jackson won't return as Bulls coach AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and CORRECTS spelling of Musburger throughout.
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls' sixth championship was,
indeed, the last with coach Phil Jackson.
	   Jackson won't return to the Bulls, despite an offer from
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for another year, Jackson's
attorney, Todd Musberger, confirmed Sunday night. Jackson does not
have another job, Musberger said.
	   Jackson's departure was first reported in an interview with
Newsweek magazine, which goes on sale Monday.
	   ``It is accurate,'' Musberger told The Associated Press.
	   Neither Jackson, Reinsdorf nor Bulls general manager Jerry
Krause returned messages left for them Sunday by the AP.
	   Musberger said Jackson did not want to elaborate on why he chose
not to come back for another season. Jackson's relations with
Krause have been rancorous all season, and he said after signing a
one-year contract last summer that ``wild horses'' could not bring
him back for another year.
	   ``I said no, it's time for me to step away and enjoy some
different things,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   ``For me, it's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful team,'' he
said. ``There's nothing we can do to top this anymore. Now it's
time to step back from the game for a while.''
	   Though Musberger said Jackson has had ``discreet feelers'' from
other teams, he does not have another job.
	   Jackson told Newsweek he did not expect to coach anywhere next
season.
	   Jackson's departure is the first of what could be many for the
six-time NBA champions. Michael Jordan, who is especially close to
Jackson, is a free agent and has said he will not play for anyone
else, though he has recently softened his stance.
	   Jackson said he thinks Jordan, who scored the title-winning
basket a week ago as the Bulls beat the Utah Jazz in six games,
also wants to go out on top.
	   ``I can't imagine him doing it again. I don't know but I
anticipate that's how he feels,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   Musberger said Jackson's decision was not tied in any way to
Jordan.
	   ``It's an individual decision, and I know if Michael decides to
return, he will have Phil's blessing,'' Musburger said.
	   Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also are free agents, as are
six other of the 12 players on Chicago's playoff roster. Rodman has
said he would like to play for the Bulls again, but Pippen, hurt by
what he deems as a lack of respect and low salaries, has said
repeatedly that he won't return.
	   But Pippen, too, has wavered, saying he would be open-minded to
an offer from the Bulls if the other key personalities involved
return.
	   That Jordan, Rodman and, to some extent, Pippen, have such
intense loyalty to Jackson is no surprise. A meditator, a
motivator, an ex-hippie, Jackson used his somewhat offbeat methods
to blend the egos of three of the most talented players ever into a
team.
	   He was always able to get through to his players and relate to
them with _ as Jordan refers to it _ ``that Zen Buddhism stuff.''
He bought them each books he thought would interest them before the
first West Coast road trip.
	   Jackson's one-year, dlrs 6 million deal was negotiated with
Reinsdorf last summer.
	   Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history.
	   But despite his six titles, he's captured just one coach of the
year award, that coming in 1996 after the Bulls went 72-10, the
best record in league history.
	   Jackson became Bulls head coach on July 10, 1989, replacing the
fired Doug Collins for whom he had been an assistant the previous
two seasons.
	   He spent 11 of his 13 NBA seasons as a player with the Knicks
and was a member of their 1973 championship team.

in the 50th minute Sunday night to give Tampa Bay a 1-0 victory
over the Dallas Burn in the MLS debut of Mutiny coach Tim
Hankinson.
	   Tampa Bay goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli made three saves to record
his first MLS shutout. He did hold Miami without a goal in March,
but the Mutiny lost 1-0 in a shootout.
	   With the victory, Tampa Bay (4-12) moved into fourth place in
the Eastern Conference.
	   Dallas (8-7) lost its second in a row.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Financially embattled Philippine
Airlines is planning to hire laid-off Indonesian pilots to replace
Filipino pilots who went on strike and brought the airline close to
collapse, an official said Monday.
	   PAL has sent officials to Jakarta to screen hundreds of pilots
laid off by at least four Indonesian carriers hurt by the
Indonesian rupiah's sharp fall, senior vice president Avelino
Zapanta said.
	   The Indonesian carriers, which together laid off more than 1,000
pilots, include national airline Garuda and Sempati Air. The latter
closed June 1 because of huge financial losses.
	   Zapanta said PAL currently has 83 pilots, including some union
members who have returned to work, but needs a total of 200 to
handle its scaled down operations following the 18-day pilots'
strike.
	   He said Indonesian pilots fly the same types of aircraft used by
PAL, which would allow the airline to save on training costs and
time.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest an
airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The plan put 225
pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union says.
	   On Friday, PAL flight attendants and ground personnel threatened
to join the work stoppage, which has pushed Asia's oldest airline
to the brink of closure.
	   The ground workers' union filed a strike notice with the labor
department accusing PAL of union busting and harassment. The flight
attendants' union said it also plans a strike vote.
	   PAL chairman and business magnate Lucio Tan urged the two unions
not to strike and pledged not to pursue sanctions against them if
they agree to suspend the terms of existing collective bargaining
agreements for five years. Both unions refused.
	   PAL filed a rehabilitation plan Friday with Manila's Securities
and Exchange Commission, saying it is unable to meet payments on
its loans, estimated at dlrs 2 billion, because of drastically
reduced cash flow.
	   The pilots' strike has cost the company more than 2 billion
pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL says.
	   ``PAL has sufficient assets to cover obligations but we want to
prevent creditors from panicking and starting to haul away our
assets,'' Zapanta said, adding the airline will pursue an orderly
settlement of obligations.
	   As part of its rehabilitation plan, the airline says it will lay
off 40 percent of its 13,000-member work force, dispose of 40 of
its 54 planes, suspend more than two-thirds of its routes and sell
some subsidiaries.
	   It said Thursday it will decide in three months whether it will
shut down after seeing the results of the rehabilitation plan.
	   PAL says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in the
fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its 57-year
history.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Frenzied Iranians spilled out of the stadium
into the streets after their 2-1 World Cup soccer victory against
the United States, turning it into a jubilant rally for dissident
leaders.
	   But Iranians in Tehran, Iran, took a more traditional approach
as millions poured into the streets to celebrate a game that had
obvious ramifications beyond the field because of two decades of
tense relations between Iran and the United States.
	   Thousands in Lyon removed their red and green football jerseys
to reveal white T-shirts bearing photos of Maryam Rajavi, wife of
Massoud Rajavi who heads the Mujahadeen Khalq resistance movement.
Dissidents want her to be the president of a new Iran.
	   Dancing to pounding drums and bellowing jubilation, they
chanted, ``Iran Rajavi, Rajavi Iran.'' An overwhelming majority at
the rally were Iranians living in Europe and elsewhere abroad.
	   ``This is the first time in 18 years we've had a chance to
express our view like this, said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a member of
the resistance. ``A lot of these people have lost family members to
repression; for them this is life and death.''
	   French police had confiscated many of the shirts before the
game, enforcing a World Cup rule against mixing politics and
soccer. But organizers claimed 25,000 got through security checks.
	   The politics abruptly pushed aside soccer after a day of
partying between Iranians and Americans, which began as groups from
both sides tied together the tips of their national flags and
danced the linked colors through the streets.
	   Amazed Americans beamed to hear their supposed foes chanting,
``USA,'' and not adding, ``Down With,'' before it.
	   ``We've never really stopped being friends, whatever the
governments did,'' said Afsaneh, a London architect who withheld
her last name for fear of reprisals to her family. She held aloft a
huge heart, with Iran and the U.S. sharing equal space.
	   The nations broke off diplomatic relations during the 1979-81
hostage crisis, and U.S. President Bill Clinton and other American
officials saw this game as an opportunity for a thaw.
	   ``As we cheer today's game between American and Iranian
athletes, I hope it can be another step toward ending the
estrangement between our nations,'' Clinton said in a statement
before the game.
	   Police outside the stadium opened every bag and bundle. Mothers
lifted babies from strollers for a careful search. As the game
ended, riot police filed out to block off the field.
	   The only trouble was among Iranians. In one flareup, a young
exile pushed aside Syed Saeed Loghmani, 53 and bearded, muttering,
``Get out of my way, you're with the mullahs.'' Loghmani spat back
that he had lived in France for 32 years.
	   Banners unfurled at the game read, ``Iran Rajavi.'' Security
police pulled them down and hauled at least one Mujahadeen out of
the stands. During Iran's national anthem, new banners appeared,
and police poured over the railings to seize them, often by fierce
tug-of-war.
	   Scuffles broke out in the stands between supporters of the
Mujahedeen, whose headquarters are in Iraq, and Iranians who had
come just to see the match. Security forces intervened to break
them up.
	   ``There were so many fights around me that I decided to move,''
said Mohammad Dadmanesh, an Iranian who came from Canada to see the
match.
	   Ten people were hurt so badly that they were taken to the
hospital, and two people were hospitalized after suffering heart
attacks, said an official from the World Cup organizing committee,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A Mujahedeen spokesman complained about the methods of the
French police.
	   ``The French police brutally attacked many of our supporters,''
said the spokesman Alireza Jafarzadeh. He said one woman suffered a
broken arm when police pushed into the stands and beat Mujahedeen
supporters with sticks.
	   Earlier Sunday, French authorities responded to Mujahedeen
accusations by saying they had prevented hundreds of Iranian
refugees from entering France for the game.

Japan, Russia discuss peace treaty at one-day meeting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese and Russian diplomats began discussing
Monday the contents of a proposed peace treaty between their two
nations, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Minoru Tamba led the Japanese side for
the one-day meeting in Tokyo, while the Russian delegation was
headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin.
	   The two sides were to take up clauses regarding political and
cultural cooperation as well as dialogue exchanges on security
issues, said the ministry spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Tokyo meeting was being held to speed up working-level
efforts to conclude a peace treaty by 2000, a target date agreed by
Prussia but claimed by Japan.
	   Japan and Russia have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of the dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war.
	   In the April meeting with Yeltsin, Hashimoto proposed drawing a
border demarcation line with Russia that would run through the
middle of one of the islands. The other three would fall on the
Japanese side of the line.
	   Yeltsin has said he was still considering Hashimoto's proposal,
which would leave the question of possession of that island to
bilateral negotiations after the conclusion of a peace treaty.
	   The two sides last held similar level talks in Moscow on May 6.

Jackson won't return as Bulls coach Jordan's options. AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Musburger throughout; ADDS details on
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls' sixth championship was,
indeed, the last with coach Phil Jackson.
	   Jackson won't return to the Bulls, despite an offer from
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for another year, Jackson's
attorney, Todd Musburger, confirmed Sunday night. Jackson does not
have another job, Musburger said.
	   Jackson's departure was first reported in an interview with
Newsweek magazine, which goes on sale Monday.
	   ``It is accurate,'' Musburger told The Associated Press.
	   Neither Jackson, Reinsdorf nor Bulls general manager Jerry
Krause returned messages left for them Sunday by the AP.
	   That Jackson is leaving comes hardly as a surprise. His
relations this season with Krause were strained, at best, and
Jackson said after signing a one-year, dlrs 6 million contract last
summer that ``wild horses'' could not bring him back for another
year.
	   He billed Chicago's sixth championship run the ``Last Dance,''
and said his public goodbye at the Bulls' citywide celebration last
week.
	   ``I said no, it's time for me to step away and enjoy some
different things,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   ``For me, it's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful team,'' he
said. ``There's nothing we can do to top this anymore. Now it's
time to step back from the game for a while.''
	   Jackson has had ``discreet feelers'' from other teams, but
Musburger said Jackson does not have another job. Jackson told
Newsweek he did not expect to coach anywhere next season.
	   ``This announcement will not be accompanied by an announcement
from another club,'' Musburger said.
	   Jackson has said he would like to take a year off and explore
his other interests. He leaves this week for a vacation in Turkey
with former New York Knicks teammate and U.S. senator Bill Bradley,
who is considering a presidential bid.
	   With Jackson's departure official, the question now becomes
what's next for the Bulls. Michael Jordan, who is especially close
to Jackson, has had one-year contracts the past two seasons and has
said he won't play for anyone else.
	   Jordan has softened his stance lately, saying he still wants to
play. Much will depend on whom the Bulls select as their new coach.
Iowa State coach Tim Floyd, a favorite of Krause's, has long been
considered a possibility, but it's unlikely Jordan would play for
him.
	   But Jordan might consider playing for George Karl, who was fired
a few weeks ago by the Seattle SuperSonics, or Kansas coach Roy
Williams. Both Karl and Williams are North Carolina alums, as is
Jordan.
	   Or Jordan, who scored the title-winning basket as the Bulls beat
the Utah Jazz in six games, might simply choose to retire. That's
what Jackson thinks he will do.
	   ``I can't imagine him doing it again. I don't know but I
anticipate that's how he feels,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   Jackson's decision was not tied in any way to Jordan, Musburger
said.
	   ``It's an individual decision, and I know if Michael decides to
return, he will have Phil's blessing,'' Musburger said.
	   Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also are free agents, as are
six other of the 12 players on Chicago's playoff roster. Rodman has
said he would like to play for the Bulls again, but Pippen, hurt by
what he deems as a lack of respect and low salaries, has said
repeatedly that he won't return.
	   But Pippen, too, has wavered, saying he would be open-minded to
an offer from the Bulls if the other key personalities involved
return.
	   That Jordan, Rodman and, to some extent, Pippen, have such
intense loyalty to Jackson is no surprise. A meditator, a
motivator, an ex-hippie, Jackson used his somewhat offbeat methods
to blend the egos of three of the most talented players ever into a
team.
	   He was always able to get through to his players and relate to
them with _ as Jordan refers to it _ ``that Zen Buddhism stuff.''
He bought them each books he thought would interest them before the
first West Coast road trip.
	   Most importantly, Jackson's unusual style worked. He has the
highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA regular-season
(.738) and playoff (.730) history.
	   But despite his six titles, he's captured just one coach of the
year award, that coming in 1996 after the Bulls went 72-10, the
best record in league history.
	   Jackson became Bulls head coach on July 10, 1989, replacing the
fired Doug Collins for whom he had been an assistant the previous
two seasons. Jackson worked his way up, coaching the Albany
Patroons of the CBA for five years when he would often drive the
team van with one hand while working the New York Times crossword
puzzle with the other.
	   He spent 11 of his 13 NBA seasons as a player with the Knicks
and was a member of their 1973 championship team.

China again pushes Japan to brace slipping yen 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Top Chinese leaders resumed calls Monday for
Japan to shore up its slipping currency for the sake of stability
in Asia, as the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar.
	   Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng urged Japan and the United
States to prop up the yen, warning that the failure to do so could
cause renewed upheaval in the economically shaky region.
	   ``We hope to see Japan and the United States making continual
efforts to prevent the yen from falling further,'' Shi said. ``We
hope Japan as a big country will take a responsible attitude and
play a stabilizing rather than destabilizing role.''
	   The comments, made at a news conference, came as last week's
market intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Japanese
central bank appeared to be wearing off, with the dollar trading at
138.19 yen, up 3.22 yen from its level of 134.97 yen late Friday.
	   The head of China's legislature, Li Peng, also voiced
dissatisfaction with Japan's efforts on the yen, saying the
currency's weakness ``has imposed new pressure on the economies in
Asia,'' the state-run Xinhua New Agency reported.
	   Shi reiterated the Chinese government's pledge not to devalue
its currency, the yuan, in order to make its exports more
competitive.
	   Yuan stability, he said, ``is a precondition for future growth''
and crucial for the health of Hong Kong's economy.
	   Sun Zhenyu, trade vice minister, denied that China had
threatened to devalue the yuan to force Japan and the United States
to take action.
	   The dollar's surge to a peak value of 146 yen last week, before
the U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened, came amid signs
that China's economy was slowing further.
	   China's exports grew 8.6 percent in the first five months of
1998, but declined 1.5 percent in May _ the first fall in 22
months. Actually realized foreign investment in the January-May
period dipped 1.5 percent.
	   Despite the difficulty in maintaining growth in exports and
foreign investment, Shi said he was confident China would manage to
achieve its target of 8 percent economic growth this year, mainly
through its own efforts.
	   The government has called for about dlrs 1 trillion in
investment over the next three years in new projects to spur job
creation and consumer spending. On Sunday, the government announced
it would increase export tax rebates to help boost exports.
	   Shi said China hoped President Clinton's visit to the country
this week would lead to some agreements on trade and financing _
perhaps for aircraft and power plants _ and that it would help
Beijing's long-stalled bid to join the World Trade Organization.
	   China would like to see Clinton relax or gradually phase out
restrictions on U.S. exports of sensitive technology. Beijing
argues that those limits have driven up its trade surplus with the
United States to dlrs 49.7 billion in 1997, second only to Japan's.
	   At the same time, Shi said, ``We want to emphasize that the
Chinese government acknowledges the political sensitivity of the
trade deficit in the United States and that it is working to
increase imports.''

Filipino sentenced to death for drug offense 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court in the eastern province of
Sabah on Monday sentenced a Filipino man to death for trafficking
in 811 grams of cannabis, Malaysia's national news agency reported.
	   Andy Bagindah, 28, of Zamboanga, was found guilty of the
offense, which carries a mandatory death sentence under Malaysian
law, Bernama news agency reported.
	   The accused was caught on Dec. 31, 1996 with the cannabis in his
bag, Bernama reported.
	   Justice Richard Malanjum, of the Kota Kinabalu High Court, said
the court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case
beyond reasonable doubt.
	   The judge said the execution would be stayed until the hearing
of an appeal if Bagindah chose to challenge the sentence.
	   Malaysia, which has among the harshest drug laws in the world,
says it is committed to creating a drug-free society by the year
2023.

Rights group urges Clinton to push China at summit June 22, time set by source 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Material between dashes EMBARGOED for release at 1501 GMT,
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton should use this week's summit
to urge China to release all political prisoners and recognize
international human rights standards, a rights group said in a
letter to Clinton released Monday.
	   Human Rights in China also appealed to Clinton to condemn the
1989 military crackdown that killed hundreds of people when Beijing
crushed democracy protests at Tiananmen Square.
	   In another appeal, Amnesty International urged Clinton to meet
with dissidents and relatives of those killed in the crackdown, and
to seek the release of protesters still in prison.
	   Clinton, who will be the first American president to visit China
since the crackdown, will be officially welcomed at Tiananmen
Square on Saturday before meeting President Jiang Zemin.
	   New York-based Human Rights in China included with its letter a
list of 158 Beijing citizens who remain in prison for participating
in the 1989 protests.
	   ``Their only crime consisted of standing up for democracy and
respect for human rights,'' the letter said.
	   The group urged Clinton to ask Jiang for the release of all 158
and particularly of Li Hai, a Beijing philosophy student who was
sentenced to nine years in prison in 1996 for divulging state
secrets after he compiled a list of prisoners.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that
Clinton would speak directly about the Tiananmen crackdown and
criticize China's human rights record. She added that the United
States wanted results on human rights.
	   China's rights abuses include arbitrary detention, imprisonment
for political views, abuse of prisoners and failure to uphold
citizens' rights to freedom of expression and assembly.
 &UR; _____
	   Eds: The following material is embargoed until 1501 GMT Monday
	   Closed-door discussions on human rights by foreign diplomats and
Chinese officials have so far yielded few improvements in China,
Human Rights Watch argued in a report released Tuesday.
	   It recommended that quiet diplomacy should insist on
international human rights standards, include experts and activists
along with diplomats and be backed up with pressure such as
criticism of China before the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
	   Many Western countries have dropped public pressure on China and
instead hold private meetings with Chinese officials to discuss
human rights.
	   Too often this approach reduces human rights concerns to
``differences'' between countries, the report said. China should be
held to the same internationally recognized human rights standards
applied to all other countries, it said.
	   ``Excuses should never be made for systematic violations of
basic rights,'' it said.
	   Restricting international efforts on behalf of human rights to
closed-door diplomatic meetings is a ``serious challenge to the
already tarnished credibility of the international human rights
monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations.''
	   The report added that turning the rights of Chinese citizens
into ``one of a number of bargaining chips'' in diplomacy degrades
international human rights norms in the eyes of ordinary Chinese
citizens.
	   End of embargoed material.
 &UR; _____
	   London-based Amnesty International wrote that that by raising
the cases of little-known political prisoners and demanding
releases, Clinton ``can send a clear signal that China must clean
up its act if it wants to play on the world stage.''
	   It also asked him to urge Chinese authorities not to intimidate
dissidents.
	   Amnesty released a list of 50 dissidents who have been harassed
since the beginning of the year, and said 15 of them are still
detained or otherwise restricted. It warned some may be sentenced
to prison ``when the publicity surrounding the summit has died
down.''

Seven Mexican border agents held in shooting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Seven Mexican federal agents have been
taken into custody pending a probe into the fatal shooting of a
suspected smuggler of migrants across the U.S. border.
	   The incident may be the most serious involving members of the
Beta Group border crimes task force since its founding in 1991. The
elite force of 45 former police officers, which patrols Tijuana's
border, was considered relatively corruption-free.
	   The unidentified victim, who was known by his street name ``El
Fish,'' was shot Friday.
	   Investigators suspect the man was shot on the U.S. side of the
border and dragged into Mexican territory, said Baja California
state police Commander Alvaro Castilla Gracia.
	   State police agents found the body about 20 miles (30
kilometers) east of downtown Tijuana, just north of the
Tijuana-Tecate toll highway, in an area known as Big Groves Canyon.
The area is a popular jump-off zone for groups of illegal migrants
and migrant smugglers.
	   He appeared to have been shot in the back, Castilla said. The
victim, who appeared to be in his late 20s, had a pistol in his
hand.
	   State investigators questioned seven Beta agents who were in the
area at the time of the shooting.
	   ``They indicated that they had had a confrontation with this
individual and that was how he had lost his life,'' Castilla said.
``However, our preliminary investigation indicates that the
deceased did not fire his weapon, that he was shot while trying to
rise.''
	   The investigators also quoted witnesses as saying the victim had
been carrying a toy pistol, which was replaced by a real gun after
the shooting to confuse police, Castilla said.
	   The seven Beta agents were being held pending the outcome of the
investigation.

Police arrest five suspects in kidnapping of Dutch businessman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Authorities have arrested five
suspects in the kidnapping of a Dutch business executive who was
freed after his partners paid 20 million pesos (dlrs 500,000) in
ransom, police said Monday.
	   National police chief Santiago Alino identified the victim as
Gerard Heinen, the 44-year-old owner of Decordesign Inc., a
handicraft-exporting company in Cavite province, south of Manila.
Heinen is from Dinxperlo, Netherlands.
	   Heinen was kidnapped June 3 by seven men wearing shirts with big
``police'' markings printed on them, a few kilometers (miles) from
his factory in Silang town, Alino said.
	   He was with three business partners, including another Dutchman,
Leonardus Nicssen, but the three did not inform police of the
kidnapping for fear they would be harmed, Alino said.
	   His business associates then negotiated for Heinen's release and
paid the ransom the following day.
	   Heinen was freed by his captors a day later and reported the
incident to police and led them to his captors' hideout in nearby
Bacoor town.
	   Three men, including alleged mastermind Policarpio Avenir, and
Avenir's common-law wife were arrested. A fifth suspect who works
as the chief security officer in Heinen's factory was later
arrested after being linked by Avenir, Alino said.
	   ``I was treated well by my captors,'' said Heinen. ``They even
allowed me to drink beer with them without blindfolds,'' which
enabled him to identify his kidnappers.
	   Alino said Avenir was involved in at least six other kidnappings
and four payroll van robberies in the Manila area. There was a
300,000-peso (dlrs 7,500) reward for his arrest.
	   Alino said police seized a grenade-launching rifle, the car used
in Heinen's kidnapping, a cellular phone used in negotiating the
ransom, and about 1.418 million pesos (dlrs 35,450) believed to be
part of the ransom.
	   Kidnapping charges are being prepared against the suspects,
Alino said.
	   Kidnapping for ransom is a lucrative criminal activity in the
Manila area and in the southern Philippines. Police and military
personnel are widely believed to be active in kidnapping groups.

Indonesian president grants hero status to slain students

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president Monday declared
four student protesters shot dead by security forces last month as
heroes of the country's reform movement.
	   ``In my view they are heroes and I declare them heroes,''
President B.J. Habibie said during an emotional meeting with the
parents of the dead at Jakarta's state palace.
	   ``Nothing can replace those who died in this tragedy. I and the
government offer our deepest sympathies to all the families. We
hope their sacrifice will not be wasted,'' he said.
	   The four were gunned down during a pro-reform rally at Jakarta's
Trisakti University on May 12.
	   Their deaths triggered a wave of rioting that killed about 1,200
and helped force former President Suharto to quit after 32 years in
power.
	   Habibie replaced Suharto and has since promised sweeping
reforms, including free and fair elections next year.
	   The military has charged 18 police officers in the deaths.
	   Habibie also promised that the government would pay medical
bills for an injured student, Sofyan Rahman, who remains
unconscious in an intensive care unit at Jakarta's Sumber Waras
Hospital.
	   Habibie said he planned to visit him and, if necessary, would
pay for foreign doctors to treat him.
	   He did not say whether any compensation would be paid to the
families of the dead.
	   Officials said later that hero status would be formally granted
at a ceremony in the near future.

Though hit hard by crackdown, Japan's racketeers could stage comeback 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ It's tough being a Japanese gangster these days.
	   Satoshi Yamamoto, a 56-year-old with a taste for tailored suits
and jeweled tie pins, was for years one of Japan's most notorious
``sokaiya'' _ racketeers who brazenly threaten executives at
shareholders meetings.
	   But last year Japan did something unusual: it cracked down.
Hounded by police and snubbed by companies, Yamamoto's health
failed him in May, and he dropped out of the racket altogether.
	   Yamamoto isn't alone.
	   The tough new stance by law enforcement has decimated the
sokaiya's ranks. But experts warn the business-suited bullies could
stage a comeback _ unless Japanese companies make themselves less
vulnerable by tearing down their walls of secrecy.
	   ``The root of the problem hasn't changed. Japanese corporations
still hide their operations from the public behind a thick wall,''
said Raisuke Miyawaki, former head of the National Policy Agency's
organized crime division.
	   At the moment, however, the sokaiya are a dwindling breed.
	   Over the past year, police estimate their number has shrunk by
10 percent to 900. Experts say only about 200 are still active.
	   Police promise to keep raising the pressure _ and they will get
their annual showdown this week.
	   More than 10,000 officers will stand guard on June 26, when
shareholders of some 2,800 companies meet. Most companies hold
their meetings on the same day to dilute the sokaiya's strength.
	   These meetings once filled management with dread. They are the
one time every year that executives, most of whom are unaccustomed
to justifying themselves in public, have to take questions from
shareholders.
	   Sokaiya for decades targeted this moment of vulnerability.
	   The gangsters specialized in sniffing out a company's dirty
linen _ a hidden loss, say, or a president's secret mistress _ and
demanding an explanation. Some sokaiya also used violence, charging
the podium with fists and feet flying.
	   To avoid such scenes, companies frequently agreed to pay sokaiya
not to come, or to attend and silence other racketeers _ or
shareholders with legitimate questions.
	   But last year, authorities cracked down not only on sokaiya but
also those who paid them off.
	   In what proved to be the biggest sokaiya scandal ever,
prosecutors arrested 35 executives, including the president of
Japan's largest brokerage and the chairman of one of its biggest
banks, for allegedly handing more than a quarter million dollars to
racketeer Ryuichi Koike.
	   Police say racketeers are feeling the pinch. More than 410 of
Japan's largest companies have cut subscriptions to sokaiya
publications, a common way of hiding payoffs.
	   That alone will cost the underworld 20 billion yen (dlrs 140
million) this year, the National Police Agency said.
	   With funds drying up, Japan's largest sokaiya group said it is
exploring other, legal ways to make a living, at least until the
dust clears.
	   One new source of income for the 40-member Rondan Doyukai: an
Italian restaurant in Tokyo that the group purchased during
brighter days, said a member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Rondan, of which Yamamoto was a member when he quit, is also
putting its sleuthing skills to work in a Web site it created last
year to post the latest corporate scandals.
	   The site, which is mainly in Japanese but contains an English
section, has had almost 400,000 hits since it opened. The group
member said the Rondan hopes to attract enough readers to start
selling advertising space.
	   But while the police appear to be winning the battle against the
sokaiya today, some observers say racketeers won't stay away from
the shareholders meetings for long because corporate Japan remains
as closed as ever _ and that means lots of dirty little secrets
remain.
	   They point to a slew of recent bankruptcies, including that of
Yamaichi Securities Co., where the companies had been hiding
massive losses for years.
	   Until Japan Inc. throws open its doors to outside scrutiny, such
deception will continue _ and the sokaiya will be there, demanding
money for their silence.
	   ``Lack of transparency is still a problem,'' said Tomio Sano,
who has spent his career tracking sokaiya and compiling their names
in a directory, which he sells to companies.
	   ``Some company somewhere will have something to hide.''

Russia: Troop withdrawal from Kosovo could cause wave of refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned that a
withdrawal of Serbian police and military troops from Kosovo would
result in a flood of Serbian refugees from the ethnic
Albanian-majority province.
	   In an interview Sunday night on Russia's RTR television station,
Primakov said that the six-nation Contact Group, which is
monitoring developments in the Balkans, should postpone its meeting
scheduled for Wednesday to give the Yugoslav authorities time to
fulfill conditions.
	   ``It will be clear in a week how the obligations, which were not
simply undertaken by (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) but
also sealed with Russia's authority, are fulfilled,'' Primakov
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
withdraw his estimated 45,000 to 50,000 police and Yugoslav army
soldiers from the province.
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has promised to try to persuade
Belgrade to ease up on its attacks but says the West must get the
Kosovo Liberation Army to halt fighting as well.
	   In a meeting in Moscow last week, Milosevic promised Yeltsin
that he would resume talks with moderate ethnic Albanians. But
Albanian negotiators have said that Milosevic's forces must first
leave the separatist province.
	   Primakov warned against pulling Serbian troops out of Kosovo
``without heeding the process of stopping the terrorist activity,
because it will result in a flow of Serbian refugees, who will
regard the move as a signal to leave.''
	   He also warned Russia's partners in the Contact Group, which
also includes Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ against leaving
Moscow out of decision-making.
	   ``I understand that constant pressure on Milosevic is sought to
make him stick to the obligations he has undertaken. But at the
same time, another motif emerges _ jealousy _ although we have
always stressed .... that this is our common position, our common
issue,'' Primakov said.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky flew to
Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital, on Sunday and met with Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Russian diplomat Alexander Avdeyev went
for talks to Yugoslavia's neighbor Albania, considered a vital
source of support to the ethnic Albanian separatists.

One year after crash, astronaut remembers the black silence AP Aerospace Writer

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ More than anything, astronaut
Michael Foale remembers the black silence each time the ruptured
Mir space station slipped around the dark side of the Earth.
	   A collision with a cargo ship last June 25 had left Mir without
power, and so all the clattering fans and other equipment had
hushed to a halt. As the world worried and wondered, Foale savored
the stillness.
	   ``Silence was fan-tas-tic,'' he told The Associated Press. ``I
had actually sort of wanted to experience that, and I got to
experience that in spades.''
	   Foale is astonished by his vivid recollections of that harrowing
day _ and everything else about his bumpy 4 1/2-month Mir ride.
	   ``It's almost like I'm right there,'' he said. ``I can almost
imagine where the cables are in my face.''
	   For one sense, that of smell, the 41-year-old astrophysicist
need not rely on memory. He inadvertently brought back L'Essence de
Mir inside two Ziploc bags that had held family photos and a novel.
	   ``When I open those up, the smell of Mir comes out,'' he said.
``It's like an old library, but an old library where old people
live maybe. A very old house where Grandma, Great-Grandma live.''
	   Foale moved into Russia's old orbital home in May 1997, three
months after a serious fire had struck. No one imagined things
could get worse. They could.
	   On June 25, 1997, a trash-filled cargo ship veered off course
during a docking test and rammed the Spektr laboratory module. A
solar panel was damaged beyond repair. More immediately worrisome,
the module was punctured.
	   As air seeped out of small, hidden holes, Foale and cosmonaut
Alexander Lazutkin swiftly disconnected the cables snaking through
the hatch and, within 10 minutes, had sealed off the depressurizing
lab. Commander Vasily Tsibliyev, meanwhile, was on the radio with
Russia's Mission Control, which insisted all three remain on board
despite flight rules dictating they should flee in the attached
Soyuz capsule.
	   Afraid they might suffocate from the exhaled carbon dioxide
pooling around them in the stagnant air, Tsibliyev ordered his crew
to find a place where they could watch one another whenever Mir
flew into darkness.
	   They gathered before a window; by then, four or five hours had
passed since the crash. The aurora australis, or southern lights,
glittered below, and small meteorites flashed in the distance.
	   Foale tried to cheer up his ``shell-shocked'' commander, who was
at the controls when the cargo ship crashed and feared he'd be
blamed. (He was.)
	   ``This is incredibly beautiful, Vasily,'' Foale said, gazing
outside. ``I know this has been a terrible day, but I'll always
remember this particular moment.''
	   ``Yes, yes,'' Tsibliyev replied. ``It's been a terrible day.''
	   Foale laughed as he recalled the conversation in his top-floor
office at Johnson Space Center, where he serves as assistant
technical director.
	   ``It's things like that that really come back to me strong,'' he
said.
	   The astronaut-manager was part of a NASA contingent that
traveled to Moscow this spring to discuss the fate of the
12-year-old Mir and delays in the international space station, the
result of Russia's money crunch. To his surprise and satisfaction,
the Russians agreed to send Mir plunging through the atmosphere by
the end of 1999, once the international space station is inhabited.
	   It was the first time Foale had seen his Mir comrades since his
return to Earth in October.
	   Foale hooked up again with Tsibliyev earlier this month in
Houston to inspect pieces of the international space station that
should be aloft by year's end.
	   Unlike Mir's other problems _ fire, computer breakdowns, toxic
leaks _ the collision provided little if any technical benefit to
the international station, Foale said. What it did, he noted, was
underscore the need to follow rules.
	   The docking experiment never should have been attempted, NASA
maintained, given the near miss a few months earlier during a
similar test aimed at cutting costs. The Russian Space Agency
conceded a number of factors led to the crash, including crew
fatigue.
	   ``I'm afraid it all added up and it came to a big crunch,''
Foale said.
	   The collision was a turning point in NASA's relationship with
the Russian Space Agency, said Jim Van Laak, deputy director of the
recently completed shuttle-Mir program. Van Laak and his superiors
demanded ``more insight into what was going on.'' And they got it,
he said, although at times it's tough.
	   Foale considers his Mir experience worthwhile, and not just for
NASA.
	   ``It's a critical phase that I was lucky enough to be a part of,
and I consider it luck. It's not so much like fate as the Russian
way of looking at it,'' he said, pausing. ``Or damnation,'' he
added, bursting into laughter.

Trial ends for commander accused of allowing rape

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Muslim prisoner of war was
hauled before her captors for questioning and then, prosecutors
say, raped repeatedly as the Bosnian Croat officer in charge stood
by and watched.
	   On Monday, U.N. judges were hearing closing arguments in the
first war crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault
committed during an interrogation.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, accused paramilitary commander
Anto Furundzija became a ``direct perpetrator committing the crimes
of torture and outrages upon personal dignity,'' prosecutors
contended during the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's sixth and
fastest trial.
	   Furundzija, 28, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. He has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges and
has denied being present at the May 1993 rape.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
keen to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Defense lawyers sought to show that the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim, who testified in
closed session before the tribunal last week.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   Furundzija was arrested in December in the central Bosnian town
of Vitez. The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was
raped at the headquarters of his unit just outside Vitez,
prosecutors said.
	   In 1993, Furundzija's unit _ known as ``The Jokers'' _ allegedly
took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian Croat forces to drive
Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 21 people,
including Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, and has issued an
unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28 defendants in
custody.

Joint Australian-French survey locates signs of big gas hydrate deposit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A seismic survey more than 600 miles
(1,000 kms) east of Australia has discovered strong indications of
gas hydrates, a potential long-term energy source, Resources and
Energy Minister Warwick Parer said Monday.
	   The discovery, the first in Australian waters, lies on the
eastern flank of the Lord Howe Rise, a sub-sea plateau about 1,000
yards (meters) deep and located about 500 miles (800 kms) northeast
of Lord Howe Island.
	   Gas hydrates are a frozen mixture of gas and water that have
been found by remote sensing in the deep oceans in many parts of
the world, Parer said.
	   ``Sampling has shown that they are a potentially huge gas
resource, but major engineering problems means that their
development is far in the future,'' he said.
	   Parer said the seismic survey was undertaken by the government's
Australian Geological Survey Organization, in cooperation with
French scientists.
	   The survey is designed primarily to help define the limits of
Australia's offshore territory, which abuts sea areas claimed by
France, through proximity of its New Caledonian territory, and New
Zealand, he said.
	   The survey also is aimed at assessing the potential for
conventional petroleum resources, through a better understanding of
the geological framework of the continental fragments east of
Australia, he added.
	   ``The gas hydrate discovery could eventually lead to a different
style of gas development in Australia,'' Parer said.
	   Australia has until 2004 to establish its claim to a vast area
of the sea bed beyond its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic
zone, but detailed bathymetric and sediment thickness information
is required to support any claim, the survey organization said.

Dodgers fire Bill Russell as manager, Fred Claire as general manager 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In another major shakeup, the Los Angeles
Dodgers have fired Bill Russell as manager and Fred Claire as
general manager.
	   Russell will be replaced by Glenn Hoffman, manager of the
Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, officials said
late Sunday. Claire will be replaced by Tommy Lasorda, a team vice
president and the club's longtime manager.
	   Both Hoffman and Lasorda will serve on an interim basis. Lasorda
said he will help the team search for Claire's permanent
replacement.
	   ``I didn't know anything about it,'' said Lasorda, who retired
as manager in 1996 and was succeeded by Russell.
	   Last season, the Dodgers went 88-74 under Russell and finished
second in the NL West. The are 36-38 this year, 12 1/2 games behind
first-place San Diego.
	   Dodgers president Bob Graziano said he made the decision to fire
Russell and Claire in consultation with former owner Peter
O'Malley, who sold the team to Australian media magnate Rupert
Murdoch and his Fox Corp. in a deal completed in January.
	   ``Peter and I have spent a lot of time meeting over the last few
days talking about how to improve our team and get it back on
track,'' Graziano said.
	   ``I did let the people at Fox know about the decision I was
making. They fully support it ''
	   The dismissals come after the Dodgers last month traded catcher
Mike Piazza, who eventually ended up with the New York Mets, and
pitcher Hideo Nomo, who also went to the Mets.

Downer: Free and fair elections still possible in Cambodia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Free, fair and credible elections in
Cambodia are still possible, but there should be an independent
investigation into politically motivated killings there, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Monday.
	   ``The registration of voters has moved ahead relatively
successfully, but problems remain,'' Downer said of the elections
scheduled for July 26.
	   These include restrictions on the opposition's access to the
electronic media and its right to hold public assemblies.
	   ``Over and above that, it is very important that in Cambodia
there is an independent investigation into politically motivated
killings,'' Downer told Parliament.
	   Since July last year, Australia has been working with other
countries to promote the restoration of appropriate democratic
processes in Cambodia, Downer said.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of its PolyGram
music unit to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs 10.4 billion.
	   The price is below the dlrs 10.6 billion agreed to earlier for
the purchase of PolyGram, which will make Seagram the world's
largest record company.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation from a
beverage giant to an entertainment conglomerate three years after
it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
	   Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.

Hamas leader arrives in Egypt en route to Gaza 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of
Hamas, arrived here Monday from Sudan on his way to the Gaza Strip,
officials said.
	   Yassin, his son and an aide had waited more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, after Egypt denied them entry
visas. Egypt was reportedly waiting until Israel officially
announced that they would let the Hamas leader return to Gaza.
	   But on Thursday, the Egyptian Embassy in Khartoum informed
Yassin that he would be granted permission to travel to Egypt. It
was not clear what prompted Egypt's change of mind since Israel has
not announced any decision for his return.
	   Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   He is expected to stay here for two days to receive medical
treatment before he travels to Gaza, said the officials, who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt feared that if Yassin got stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas' popularity
in the Palestinian territories, especially in the strip, is seen as
a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin, a 64-year old quadriplegic, went to Sudan on May 29
after a 14-week fund-raising tour of the Arab world and Iran.
During his trip he repeatedly issued statements supporting armed
struggle against Israel.
	   Some Israeli legislators oppose his return, but others in the
government think Yassin poses more of a threat abroad than in Gaza,
where his activities can be monitored by the Palestinian Authority.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stock prices edge higher dollar rates 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, and afternoon bond and
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar soared against the yen Monday amid
disappointment that Japan offered no concrete plans to save its
economy and permanently strengthen the yen at a weekend finance
meeting. Tokyo stock prices edged higher.
	   The dollar bought 137.62 yen at midafternoon, up 2.65 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.10 yen on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 15,309.09 points.
On Friday, the Nikkei fell 9.356 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Finance officials from around the world, including Deputy U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, met in Tokyo over the weekend,
urging Japan to stimulate its economy and clean up its bad debt
problem. But Japan unveiled no new measures to accomplish those
goals.
	   ``There was nothing new from the meeting,'' said Minoru Shioiri,
assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank. ``Both
domestic and overseas buying just jumped in to buy the dollar.''
	   Some traders and investors had expected Japan to announce at
least some details on how it planned to resolve problems at the
nation's banks.
	   The dollar had risen as high as 138.45 yen in morning trading
but fell back after a Ministry of Finance official hinted Japan
would intervene again in currency markets. Joint intervention by
the United States and Japan last week brought the yen up from an
eight-year low against the dollar.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international
affairs at the Finance Ministry, hinted at further yen-buying
intervention.
	   ``When Japan has to do what it has to do, it has the ability to
do it,'' Sakakibara told reporters, adding that he was in contact
with his counterparts from other Group of Seven countries and Asian
nations.
	   Meanwhile, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
secretary-general, Koichi Kato, said on Monday the government will
make a final decision regarding the formation of a public ``bridge
bank'' to dispose of banks' bad debts by July 8.
	   The government bank would be given greater scope than the
current Resolution and Collection Bank which was set up to help
banks dispose of their bad loans. The new bank would likely take
over loans of failed banks and continue providing credit to their
healthy clients, government sources said.
	   Dealers also hesitated to bid the dollar up higher against the
yen amid expectations any further gains would prompt the United
States and Japan to again intervene to support the Japanese
currency.
	   Such expectations are especially strong ahead of U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week. China has already
complained that the weak yen was putting pressure on its economy.
	   The yen's slide in recent weeks roiled Asian financial markets
by stirring concerns about a possible new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic
turmoil last year.
	   Earlier last week, the dollar hit a nearly eight-year high of
146.73 yen in global markets, prompting the joint Japan-U.S. move
Wednesday which pushed the dollar back down.
	   On the stock market, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section rose 0.04 points, insignificant
in percentage terms, to 1,187.31. The TOPIX closed down 11.57
points, or 0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond was unchanged from Friday's close at 1.255 percent
from Friday's finish. Its price was little changed to 111.57 yen
from 111.47 yen.

Rebels say army rebuffed again at Mankulam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Sri Lankan soldiers pounded at a key
rebel-held town in northern Sri Lanka in weekend battles that
killed at least 21 on both sides but resulted in no gained ground,
rebels said Monday.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in a statement faxed to
news agencies in New Delhi from the group's London headquarters,
said it lost 13 fighters and recovered the bodies of eight soldiers
after one battle Saturday on what it said was a new front east of
Mankulam. On Sunday, the army launched another offensive toward
Mankulam, backed by heavy artillery and a fleet of warplanes and
helicopters, the statement said.
	   Mankulam, 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri
Lankan capital, is the last LTTE-held town on a 70-kilometer
(43-mile) highway government troops have been trying to capture
since May 1997. The government has advanced about two-thirds of the
way.
	   Capturing the highway would let the government send supplies to
the isolated northern Jaffna peninsula by road. The peninsula is
presently accessible only by air and sea.
	   The military admits having lost nearly 1,000 soldiers and claims
to have killed 3,200 guerrillas in the highway campaign. The rebels
have not given their total casualty figures.
	   No independent assessment of the battle situation was possible
since the government bars journalists from visiting the war theater
on their own. The government also has imposed censorship on reports
about the fighting emanating from Sri Lanka.
	   The rebels want a separate homeland carved from this island off
India's southeastern tip, accusing the Sinhalese majority of
oppressing the Tamil minority. The war began in 1983 and has so far
claimed 52,000 lives.

Attackers fire at Russian helicopter base in Dagestan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified attackers opened fire with grenade
launchers on a Russian helicopter base in the restive Caucasus
republic of Dagestan, news agencies reported Monday.
	   One serviceman was injured in the attack on the border guards'
helicopter squadron late Sunday night, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported, citing the border guards' command. The
attackers fled in a car after the shooting.
	   Dagestan, which borders the breakaway republic of Chechnya, has
seen several outbreaks of violence in the past few years. Most
appear to be linked to longstanding political and ethnic tensions.
	   No significant damage was reported, but investigators were
searching the military base, located near the town of Kaspiisk, for
explosive devices that may have been planted, ITAR-Tass and
Interfax said.
	   Officials blamed the attack on unspecified criminal groups
seeking to disrupt upcoming parliamentary elections in the
republic.
	   ``Criminal bandit gangs are again trying to exert psychological
and military pressure on Russian border guards and destabilize the
situation in the region, just as they did two years ago,'' border
guards spokesman Sergei Ivanchenko was quoted as saying by
Interfax.
	   In 1996, 56 people were killed in a bomb blast in a building
housing Russian border guard officers and their families.

Ramos orders security for Marcos family after Communist threats 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos ordered tighter
security for former first lady Imelda Marcos and her children
Monday after Communist rebels threatened to seize them for ``crimes
to the people.''
	   Ramos told reporters that he had instructed government agencies
to ``monitor, preempt and counter these published threats.''
	   On Sunday, a rebel spokesman condemned President-elect Joseph
Estrada for allowing the burial of Mrs. Marcos' strongman husband,
Ferdinand, next month in a heroes' cemetery in metropolitan Manila.
	   Spokesman Gregorio Rosal said special rebel units have been
ordered to arrest the Marcoses so they could face trial in a rebel
court.
	   He did not specify any charges against the Marcoses but
mentioned human rights violations.
	   Rosal said the planned burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery
was a ``hard slap'' at the victims of Marcos' 20-year autocratic
rule.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986. He fled
to Hawaii where he died three years later.
	   His body was only allowed to return to the country in September
1993 and has been kept in a glass coffin in an air-conditioned
mausoleum in his northern hometown.
	   Rosal said the Communist Party of the Philippines is determined
``to have the relatives and cronies of the fascist dictator answer
for their crimes to the people.''
	   The government accuses Marcos and his associates of illegally
amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule. Marcos'
government also has been accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.
	   Mrs. Marcos has been convicted of graft and sentenced to 12
years in prison but is free on bail pending a final Supreme Court
appeal. As a former first lady she already has at least four police
guards assigned to her.
	   Opponents say the burial of Marcos in the Heroes' Cemetery would
``desecrate'' hallowed ground.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial there is appropriate because
he was a decorated veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor, said burying Marcos would end the bitter conflict
between Marcos' supporters and opponents.
	   He said the former president will not be given state honors at
the burial, set for July 11.

Trial ends for commander accused of allowing rape

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Muslim prisoner of war was
hauled before her captors for questioning and then, prosecutors
say, raped repeatedly while the Bosnian Croat officer in charge
stood by and watched.
	   On Monday, U.N. judges were hearing closing arguments in the
first war crimes case focusing on sexual assault committed during
interrogation.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, accused paramilitary commander
Anto Furundzija became a ``direct perpetrator committing the crimes
of torture and outrages upon personal dignity,'' prosecutors
contended during the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's sixth trial.
	   Furundzija, 28, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. He has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges and
has denied being present at the May 1993 rape.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
keen to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Defense lawyers sought to show that the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim, who testified in
closed session before the tribunal last week.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   Furundzija was arrested in December in the central Bosnian town
of Vitez. The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was
raped at the headquarters of his unit just outside Vitez,
prosecutors said.
	   In 1993, Furundzija's unit _ known as ``The Jokers'' _ allegedly
took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian Croat forces to drive
Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 21 people,
including Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, and has issued an
unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28 defendants in
custody.

Kiriyenko, Yeltsin discuss economic program on eve of IMF visit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Sergei
Kiriyenko were meeting Monday to finalize the government's strategy
to combat the economic crisis, while a high-level team of
negotiators from the International Monetary Fund headed to Moscow
to discuss a multibillion dollar aid package.
	   Kiriyenko promised Sunday to impose ``quick, tough and often
unpopular measures'' to turn around the country's ailing economy.
	   Appearing on the RTR television station, Kiriyenko said it was
clear what the government needed to do, but that knowledge wouldn't
make the steps any easier.
	   The IMF has told Russia that it needs to slash its budget,
dramatically improve tax collection and make its financial workings
more visible.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer is scheduled to arrive in
Moscow later Monday. He and his delegation will spend the week
meeting with top Russian Cabinet officials.
	   Fischer has warned that the dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in emergency credits that the Kremlin wants may be too steep for
the fund. At a news conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, he said the
sum was too much for the IMF to give to one country.
	   Speaking of the anti-crisis measures, Kiriyenko said: ``It will
be a program of quick, tough and often unpopular measures.''
	   ``It will take colossal political courage to pass it,'' he
added. ``And it will take colossal consolidation of all ways and
means of the authorities ... to implement it.''

Wakanohana to debut as grand champion in upcoming tournament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Wakanohana will join his younger brother at
sumo's highest rank _ yokozuna, or grand champion _ in next month's
tournament.
	   The 27-year-old Wakanohana will hold the east yokozuna position,
just below yokozuna Akebono, in the tournament starting July 5, the
Japan Sumo Association announced Monday. The east side is more
prestigious than the west in Japanese tradition.
	   Wakanohana was promoted from ozeki (champion) rank after winning
two consecutive tournaments, with a 14-1 record in March and a 12-3
record in May. In all, he has won five tournaments.
	   ``As always, I will try to work hard to the end without giving
up,'' Wakanohana told reporters Monday. He entered sumo wrestling
in 1988.
	   Takanohana, 25, Wakanohana's younger brother, will be in the
west yokozuna position after finishing at 10-5 in the last
tournament. Takanohana has held yokozuna rank since 1994.
	   The two are the first brothers ever to hold the traditional
sport's top rank at the same time.
	   The 29-year-old Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, also
finished at 10-5 in May. He became the first foreign-born wrestler
to reach yokozuna rank in 1993.
	   Musashimaru, 27, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, is in the west
ozeki spot after also winding up at 10-5.
	   Takanonami, 26, who finished at 11-4, will hold the top ozeki
spot in the east.
	   Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, rose two ranks to No.
11 maegashira (senior wrestler) for his 9-6 record in the previous
tourney
	   Fellow Mongolian Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was promoted
to No. 15 maegashira, the lowest rank in the senior makuuchi
division, from No. 1 in the juryo division, where he ended at 8-7
in May.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, Hoshitango, or Argentine
Imach Marcelo Salomon, was promoted to No. 2 from No. 9 for his 5-2
record.
	   Yamato, or American George Kalima, was demoted from No. 9 in
juryo to No. 9 in makushita for his disappointing 1-14 record.
	   Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, went up to No. 10
from No. 13 for his 4-3 record.
	   Kaishinzan, or American Henry Armstrong Miller, rose to No. 16
from No. 36 for his 6-1 record.
	   Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, fell to No. 27 from
No. 19 for his 3-4 record, while compatriot Ikemori, or Luis Go
Ikemori, dropped to No. 50 from No. 39 for his 3-4 record.
	   Kitaazuma, or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, fell to No. 56 from No.
45 for his 3-4 record.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, Kyokutenzan, or
Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, rose to No. 17 from No. 30. Azumakaze,
or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, rose to No. 65 from No. 84.
	   Kuniazuma, or Brazilian Vader Ramos, is ranked No. 67, down from
No. 7.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram

Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on deal, price per share.
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of PolyGram, the
world's largest music company, to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs
10.4 billion.
	   The price is below the dlrs 10.6 billion agreed to earlier for
the purchase of PolyGram, which will make the Canadian beverage
giant a leading entertainment conglomerate.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation three years
after it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.
	   Philips announced in May it intended to sell its 75 percent
stake in the Dutch entertainment group PolyGram to the Canadian
liquor giant.
	   Seagram, which will purchase the stake through its subsidiary
Universal Studios Inc. as part of tender offer for all issued
shares, will pay 115 guilders, or dlrs 57, per share.
	   The final agreement calls for Seagram to issue a maximum of
about 47.9 million common shares.

Dodgers fire Bill Russell as manager, Fred Claire as general manager AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with backgroun and ADDS byline
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In another major shakeup under Fox ownership,
the Los Angeles Dodgers fired Bill Russell as manager and Fred
Claire as general manager.
	   Russell will be replaced by Glenn Hoffman, manager of the
Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, and Claire will
be replaced by Tommy Lasorda, a team vice president and the club's
longtime manager.
	   Dodgers president Bob Graziano said late Sunday that Hoffman and
Lasorda will serve on an interim basis. Lasorda said he will help
the team search for Claire's permanent replacement.
	   ``I didn't know anything about it,'' said Lasorda, who retired
as manager in 1996 and was succeeded by Russell.
	   Last season, the Dodgers went 88-74 under Russell and finished
second in the NL West. They are 36-38 this year, 12 1/2 games
behind first-place San Diego.
	   Graziano said he made the decision to fire Russell and Claire in
consultation with former owner Peter O'Malley, who sold the team to
Rupert Murdoch and his Fox Corp. in a deal completed in January.
	   ``I did let the people at Fox know about the decision I was
making. They fully support it ''
	   Sunday's moves follow last month's high-profile trades of
catcher Mike Piazza, who eventually ended up with the New York
Mets, and pitcher Hideo Nomo, who also went to the Mets.
	   Graziano said Russell and Claire were disappointed upon hearing
the news.
	   ``They always gave 100 percent to their jobs so they were
disappointed that that effort wasn't enough,'' he said.
	   ``Fact of the matter is we haven't been getting our job done,''
Graziano said of the team's struggles, including the recent injury
to pitcher Ramon Martinez.
	   After the Piazza trade with Florida was engineered by Fox
executive Chase Carey, Claire openly complained that he had no
knowledge of the deal until it was done.
	   Russell, 49, was an All-Star shortstop three times during his 18
seasons playing for the Dodgers. He was the team's infield and
bench coach from 1987-91 before managing Albuquerque from 1992-93
and compiling a 136-150 record.
	   Claire, 62, was in his 30th season with the Dodgers and his 12th
as general manager. He took over after Al Campanis was fired in
1987 for controversial remarks about blacks lacking ``the
necessities'' to become managers or executives. Campanis died
earlier Sunday at age 81.
	   Under Claire's tenure, the Dodgers produced five of the last six
NL rookies of the year _ Eric Karros, Piazza, Raul Mondesi, Nomo
and Todd Hollandsworth.
	   In his second season as general manager in 1988, Los Angeles won
the World Series with players he acquired, including Kirk Gibson,
Mickey Hatcher, Rick Dempsey, Jay Howell, Alfredo Griffin and Tim
Belcher. He joined the team in 1969.

Garfield's creator may attend Malaysia's `Meow' festival 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ The creator of the portly cat who has
endured as part of comic America for two decades is likely to visit
Malaysia's cat city for a ``Meow'' festival, an organizer said
Monday.
	   Cat lovers will welcome the presence of Jim Davies, the creator
of Garfield, at this year's festival in the eastern city of
Kuching, said Cat Museum assistant curator Bahtiar Affendi.
	   The only uncertainty surrounding the Nov. 23 visit was
confirmation from the sponsors, the national news agency, Bernama,
quoted Bahtiar, as saying.
	   ``Davies would like to join in Garfield's 20th anniversary
celebrations here after being informed by foreign tourists who are
Garfield's fans that the city has a Cat Museum with a Garfield
gallery,'' he said.
	   Activities at the museum during the five-day Meow Festival,
starting Nov. 22, will include a cat show, exhibitions, cat cartoon
drawing and cat imitation contests.
	   Kuching is known as Malaysia's cat city. Bronze cat sculptures
perch on the Sarawak River esplanade and stone obelisks encircled
by larger-than-life cat statues stand like shrines at major
intersections.
	   The cat museum has received nearly 400,000 visitors since 1993.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram

Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on deal, price per share.
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of PolyGram, the
world's largest music company, to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs
10.4 billion.
	   The price is below the dlrs 10.6 billion agreed to in May for
the purchase of PolyGram, which will make the Canadian beverage
giant a leading entertainment conglomerate.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation three years
after it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.
	   Philips announced in May it intended to sell its 75 percent
stake in the Dutch entertainment group PolyGram to the liquor
giant.
	   Seagram, which will purchase the stake through its subsidiary
Universal Studios Inc. as part of tender offer for all issued
shares, will pay 115 guilders (dlrs 57) per share.
	   The final agreement calls for Seagram to issue a maximum of
about 47.9 million common shares.

Philippine shares close lower on Japan woes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell Monday,
dragged down by continuing concerns over the faltering Japanese
economy, analysts said.
	   The peso also lost ground, reflecting the mostly weaker regional
currency trend, dealers said.
	   The absence of a concrete plan to bolster the sagging Japanese
economy after a weekend meeting of officials from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations further worried investors, analysts
added.
	   ``We were expecting significant news from Japan over the
weekend. But no complete plan to revive the Japanese economy was
introduced,'' said Astro del Castillo, analyst for A and A
Securities.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.02 points,
or 3 percent, to 1,689.69 after slumping 86.88 points Friday.
	   ``There was no turnaround in sentiment'' since Friday's fall,
said Ramon Lucas, trader for Kim Eng Securities. ``The economic
policies people were waiting for to restrain the recession in Japan
were nowhere in sight.''
	   Lucas said trading was lackluster, with most investors keeping
to the sidelines until stronger steps are taken by Japan to
jump-start its economy.
	   Del Castillo said another concern is the ability of the incoming
administration of President-elect Joseph Estrada to deal with
worsening economic problems.
	   Estrada, who assumes the presidency on June 30, admits he isn't
well versed in economics and says he will rely heavily on his team
of economic managers to steer the economy.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.101 pesos in morning
trading compared to Friday's 40.898 pesos.
	   Dealers said the early peso market was closely tracking moves in
the dollar-yen exchange rate.

Trial ends for commander accused of allowing rape 
</HEADLINE>

graf. Will be led with quotes from closing arguments.
By JENIFER CHAO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Muslim prisoner of war was
hauled before her captors for questioning and then, prosecutors
say, raped repeatedly as a Bosnian Croat officer in charge stood by
and watched.
	   On Monday, U.N. judges were hearing closing arguments in the
first war crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault
committed during an interrogation.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, accused paramilitary commander
Anto Furundzija became a ``direct perpetrator committing the crimes
of torture and outrages upon personal dignity,'' prosecutors
contended during the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's sixth and
fastest trial.
	   Furundzija, 28, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. He has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges and
has denied being present at the May 1993 rape.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
keen to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Defense lawyers sought to show that the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim, who testified in
closed session before the tribunal last week.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   Furundzija was arrested in December in the central Bosnian town
of Vitez. The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was
raped at the headquarters of his unit just outside Vitez,
prosecutors said.
	   In 1993, Furundzija's unit _ known as ``The Jokers'' _ allegedly
took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian Croat forces to drive
Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 60 people,
including Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, and has issued an
unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28 defendants in
custody.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against

just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has made scant progress in combating
computer software piracy, registering only a 2 percent drop in the
amount of unlicensed software sold in the country, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   Software producers racked up dlrs 251 million in losses in
Russia in 1997, said a report by the Business Software Alliance and
Software Publication Association, which was cited by the Interfax
news agency.
	   It said that unlicensed software made up 89 percent of Russia's
market in 1997, down just 2 percent from the previous year.
	   Russia had the biggest losses in Eastern Europe from pirated
software, the report said. Next came Poland, with dlrs 107 in
losses, and the Czech Republic, with dlrs 51 million.
	   Altogether, losses in Eastern Europe were dlrs 561 million, the
report said.

Yeltsin warns of neo-Nazi threat in Russia 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin used an address to the
nation on Monday, the 57th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of
Russia, to warn of a growing neo-Nazi movement in the country.
	   The ideologues of Nazi Germany regarded Russia's people as
subhuman, suitable for nothing more than manual labor to serve the
Third Reich.
	   Yet over the last few months, Moscow has seen an increasing
number of racist attacks by skinheads, drawing attention to a small
but violent neo-fascist movement.
	   ``Half a century ago, our country saved the world from
fascism,'' Yeltsin said in his radio address. ``But today, it is
raising its head in Russia, stupefying our youth.''
	   Often poorly educated and without hope of finding good work,
Russia's disaffected youth blame racial and religious minorities
for their troubles, and call for a ``strong hand'' to restore
Russia's prosperity.
	   ``Under the cover of fine words about the revival of Russia, of
its national spirit, they are again looking for an enemy _ to
humiliate, to lock away in prisons, to shoot,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Although figures are inconclusive, both neo-Nazis and human
rights groups estimate that Moscow has about 4,000 neo-fascists,
mostly young males. And they are becoming more active.
	   Last month, a bomb exploded at an Orthodox synagogue in the
capital, injuring two people and causing extensive damage; Jewish
leaders blamed fascist groups. A black American Marine was badly
beaten by four skinheads at an outdoor market.
	   ``I am worried that not everybody is aware of the reality of the
threat of extremism in Russia today,'' Yeltsin said. ``But it's
there. And it's very dangerous for society.''
	   ``Our common duty to the memory of the victims of fascism is not
to allow the rebirth of the `plague of the 20th century,''' he
said. ``We have no right to betray those who already defeated that
terrible evil once.''
	   Earlier Monday, Yeltsin laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier near Red Square.
	   ``Looking at the eternal flame, I remembered how young boys were
running away to the front, how the mailman brought a death
notification to my neighbors,'' Yeltsin said in his radio address.
``That is difficult to forget.''
	   ``There are dates in history that are painful to remember,'' he
said. ``But they must not be forgotten.''

Eds: RECASTS to RAISE likely impact of Pastrana's victory.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The election of conservative challenger
Andres Pastrana ended the ruling Liberal Party's 12-year lock on
the presidency and is likely to improve the image of a country
battered by a drug corruption scandal.
	   ``My foreign policy will aim to restore Colombians' lost
dignity, to regain the respect that our people deserve in the
international community so that once again we can be proud to
pronounce Colombia's name in all corners of the world,'' Pastrana
said Sunday in his victory speech.
	   With 98 percent of the vote counted in Sunday's runoff election,
the 44-year-old former Bogota mayor, in his second straight bid for
Colombia's highest office, had won 50.4 percent versus 46.5 percent
for the Liberals' Horacio Serpa.
	   Serpa served as interior minister under outgoing President
Ernesto Samper, who was accused of accepting campaign contributions
from the Cali drug cartel. The scandal crippled Samper's four-year
tenure and likely doomed Serpa's presidential hopes.
	   Still, the Liberal candidate's populist rhetoric and lower
middle-class upbringing helped win the favor of millions of
Colombians who viewed Pastrana, son of the late President Misael
Pastrana, as the candidate of the rich.
	   On Sunday, Pastrana promised to better the lot of 18 million
Colombians who live in poverty.
	   ``I'm going to be the president of the poor,'' he said. ``I
don't want any more hunger in Colombia.''
	   Firecrackers exploded outside the hall where Pastrana declared
victory. People danced in the streets, waved flags, honked horns
and shouted ``Andres! Andres!''
	   Voter turnout was 54 percent, up from 43 percent in 1994.
	   ``Finally, God has remembered Colombia. This poor country
couldn't take anymore,'' said Eduardo Pantoja, a 52-year-old
merchant in Bogota.
	   Pastrana inherits a nation mired in political and economic
crises. Leftist rebels took advantage of Samper's weak government
to expand their influence and now control 40 percent of the
countryside. Right-wing death squads killed scores of people, and
unemployment climbed.
	   Pastrana promised to make peace his top priority and meet
personally with guerrilla leaders.
	   Compared with previous elections, Sunday's balloting took place
in relative peace.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters and ambushed a police truck
in two separate incidents, killing two police officers and wounding
six, officials said. Since Friday, guerrillas have kidnapped at
least 11 election officials and burned 37 vehicles nationwide.
	   In first round voting May 31, Serpa and Pastrana each received
about 35 percent of the vote. Independent candidate Noemi Sanin
placed a close third. Many of her supporters apparently voted for
Pastrana in the runoff, rejecting the legacy of the outgoing
administration.
	   Samper narrowly defeated Pastrana in 1994, and it was Pastrana
who first blew the whistle on the incumbent's alleged drug links.
	   Three days after tearfully admitting defeat, Pastrana called a
news conference and played a taped phone conversation in which a
leading Cali cartel drug trafficker discussed a dlrs 6 million
donation to Samper's campaign. The disclosure unleashed a political
furor and an investigation that lasted years, putting ministers and
congressmen in jail, discrediting Samper and souring relations with
the United States.
	   U.S. officials refrained from supporting either of the two
candidates, saying they would work with whomever won. But
privately, they acknowledged that a Pastrana victory would augur
much better for U.S.-Colombia relations.
	   Pastrana was vilified in the press after his 1994 disclosure. He
moved overseas and disappeared from public life until launching his
campaign last year.
	   Conceding defeat Sunday, Serpa congratulated Pastrana but, in a
reference to his opponent's prolonged absence, promised to stay in
Colombia.
	   ``I will never elude my responsibilities,'' he said.

Dodgers fire Bill Russell as manager, Fred Claire as general manager of Hoffman AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lede and ADDS details on team's troubles, background
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The floundering Los Angeles Dodgers fired
manager Bill Russell and longtime general manager Fred Claire _ the
latest major shakeup under new Fox ownership.
	   Russell will be replaced by Glenn Hoffman, manager of the
Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, and Claire will
be replaced by Tom Lasorda, a team vice president and the club's
longtime manager.
	   Both Hoffman, the older brother of San Diego closer Trevor
Hoffman, and Lasorda will serve on an interim basis, president Bob
Graziano said late Sunday. Lasorda said he will help the team
search for Claire's permanent replacement.
	   ``I didn't know anything about it,'' said Lasorda, who retired
as manager in 1996 and was succeeded by Russell.
	   Last season, the Dodgers went 88-74 under Russell and finished
second in the NL West. They are 36-38 this year, 12 1/2 games
behind first-place San Diego.
	   Graziano said he made the decision to fire Russell and Claire in
consultation with former owner Peter O'Malley, who sold the team to
Rupert Murdoch and his Fox Corp. in a deal completed in January.
	   ``I did let the people at Fox know about the decision I was
making. They fully support it,'' Graziano said.
	   The dismissals come after the Dodgers recently traded catcher
Mike Piazza, who eventually ended up with the New York Mets, and
pitcher Hideo Nomo, who also went to the Mets.
	   The team has been troubled by injuries to staff ace Ramon
Martinez, Bobby Bonilla, Todd Hollandsworth, Eric Young and Jose
Vizcaino. Bonilla, Young and Vizcaino were part of the blockbuster
trade involving Piazza.
	   ``You can't just answer every injury. You lose your No. 1
starting pitcher and you can't go out and just find another
starting pitcher,'' Claire said before being fired. ``You can't go
out and find a starting third baseman.''
	   Martinez went on the disabled list Friday because of a torn
rotator cuff in his right shoulder. A day later, Bonilla joined him
on the DL because of an intestinal infection acquired on the team's
recent road trip.
	   Los Angeles had already lost Hollandsworth to the 60-day DL,
while Young has missed time twice with a strained right quadricep
muscle. Vizcaino is out with a sprained right ankle.
	   The Dodgers inserted Dennis Reyes into Martinez's spot in the
rotation and had rookie Paul Konerko take over for Bonilla at
third.
	   ``Those two are doing the best they can, but they have yet to
establish themselves,'' Russell said before being dismissed. ``You
don't replace a Bobby Bonilla, a left-handed bat in the middle of
the lineup. You don't replace a Ramon Martinez. They are your
everyday starters.''
	   Graziano said Russell and Claire ``always gave 100 percent to
their jobs so they were disappointed that that effort wasn't
enough.''
	   ``Fact of the matter is we haven't been getting our job done,''
Graziano said.
	   Hoffman led Albuquerque to a 62-79 record in his first season.
He was forced to play 49 different players because of injuries and
promotions. He oversaw the development of Konerko.
	   Hoffman played nine major league seasons as an infielder with
Boston, the Dodgers and the Anaheim Angels.
	   Russell, 49, was an All-Star shortstop three times during his 18
seasons playing for the Dodgers. He was the team's infield and
bench coach from 1987-91 before managing Albuquerque from 1992-93
and compiling a 136-150 record.
	   Claire, 62, was in his 30th season with the Dodgers and his 12th
as general manager. He took over after Al Campanis was fired in
1987 for controversial remarks about blacks lacking ``the
necessities'' to become managers or executives. Campanis died
earlier Sunday at age 81.
	   Under Claire's tenure, the Dodgers produced five of the last six
NL rookies of the year _ Eric Karros, Piazza, Raul Mondesi, Nomo
and Hollandsworth.
	   In his second season as general manager in 1988, Los Angeles won
the World Series with players he acquired, including Kirk Gibson,
Mickey Hatcher, Rick Dempsey, Jay Howell, Alfredo Griffin and Tim
Belcher. He joined the team in 1969.

Hamas leader arrives in Egypt en route to Gaza

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of
Hamas, arrived here Monday from Sudan on his way to the Gaza Strip,
officials said.
	   Yassin, his son and an aide had waited more than two weeks in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, after Egypt denied them entry
visas. Egypt was reportedly waiting until Israel officially
announced that they would let the Hamas leader return to Gaza.
	   But on Thursday, the Egyptian Embassy in Khartoum informed
Yassin that he would be granted permission to travel to Egypt. It
was not clear what prompted Egypt's change of mind since Israel has
not announced any decision for his return.
	   Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   He is expected to stay here for two days to receive medical
treatment before he travels to Gaza, said the officials, who spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan, which borders the Palestinian-administered West Bank,
also has refused to allow Yassin in.
	   Egypt feared that if Yassin got stuck at its border with Gaza,
he would be an embarrassment to the government, which has close
ties with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas' popularity
in the Palestinian territories, especially in the strip, is seen as
a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin, a 62-year old quadriplegic, went to Sudan on May 29
after a 14-week fund-raising tour of the Arab world and Iran.
During his trip he repeatedly issued statements supporting armed
struggle against Israel.
	   Some Israeli legislators oppose his return, but others in the
government think Yassin poses more of a threat abroad than in Gaza,
where his activities can be monitored by the Palestinian Authority.

Japan pledges quick fix to recession-hit economy 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ With expectations focused on Japan to
revive its ailing economy and ease the regional slump, Tokyo
pledged again Monday to do its part.
	   Japanese trade minister Mitsuo Horiuchi told his U.S.
counterpart Charlene Barshefsky he hoped Japan's 16 trillion yen
(dlrs 118.5 billion) stimulus package and tax cuts would boost the
recession-hit economy, said Atsuo Shibota, a top Japanese trade
official.
	   Separately, a senior Japanese official told The Associated Press
that Japan did feel pressured to support its neighbors, ``but we
are trying to do all we can do.''
	   Horiuchi added that the fiscal measures would help reduce
Japan's surplus in trade with the United States, which has risen 41
percent since last May, Shibota told reporters after the two trade
ministers met. It also has climbed for 20 straight months.
	   Japan's overall trade surplus has surged 67 percent since May
1997. Its economy now has contracted for two consecutive quarters,
meaning it is officially considered in recession. Its banks are a
wreck and the yen has plummeted.
	   Horiuchi's closed-door session with Barshefsky was one of
several meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting that began Monday.
	   Sources said Barshefsky told Horiuchi she had ``serious
concerns'' as to whether Japan's stimulus package would be
sufficient to cure its economic ills.
	   Japan ``must, in addition, apply physical stimulus measures, as
well as dealing appropriately with the banking sector, deregulate
and open its economy,'' Barshefsky told reporters after the
meeting.
	   ``The United States has reiterated time and again Japan must be
an engine of growth for Asia,'' said Barshefsky. ``These APEC
meetings are a test of Japan's willingness to do just that.''
	   APEC's 18 members have met to discuss lifting trade barriers on
nine industries representing dlrs 1.5 trillion of world trade among
the member economies.
	   The United States and New Zealand are pushing for specific dates
and amounts of tariff reductions in all nine industries _ known as
early voluntary liberalization sectors _ while Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan are calling for more emphasis on the APEC principals of
voluntarism and flexibility in liberalizing ``sensitive''
industries, particularly fish and forests.
	   Barshefsky told Horiuchi she was ``very concerned'' about
progress in the APEC trade talks, Shibota said.
	   He said Horiuchi replied that ``EVSL depends on voluntarism.
Flexibility has to be permitted, otherwise it's going to be very
difficult for some countries to participate.''

Pacific-Rim trade ministers open trade talks Asian economic crisis 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Japanese comment on liberalization,
AP Photos KC101-103
By BETH DUFF-BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States demanded Monday that
Japan serve as the ``engine of growth'' for shrinking Asian
economies as two days of talks opened on liberalizing trade in the
Pacific-Rim countries.
	   ``The United States has reiterated time and again Japan must be
an engine of growth for Asia,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky told reporters after an hour-long, closed-door session
with her Japanese counterpart, trade minister Mitsuo Horiuchi.
	   ``It must, in addition, apply physical stimulus measures, as
well as dealing appropriately with the banking sector, deregulate
and open its economy,'' said Barshefsky on the first day of talks
between trade ministers of the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``These APEC meetings are a test of Japan's willingness to do
just that,'' she said.
	   Atsuo Shibota, a senior official in Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, said Tokyo believes its 16
trillion yen (dlrs 118.5 billion) stimulus package and tax cuts
will boost its deteriorating economy and reduce its trade surplus
with the United States, which has risen 41 percent since May 1997.
	   Malaysia, one of the APEC countries socked hard by the yearlong
Asian economic crisis, also politely called on Japan to put its
house in order.
	   ``We in Malaysia, we don't want to tell Japan what to do,
definitely not,'' said Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz. ``But
if Japan takes whatever is necessary domestically, that will have
the necessary positive impact for the region.''
	   The U.S. and Japanese strategies for lifting trade barriers and
lowering tariffs for some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and
services differ widely.
	   In negotiations leading up to the talks, senior-level officials
indicated Japan was holding up a plan to begin liberalizing trade
in nine industries by next year.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and expected to be ready for
final signatures by the APEC summit of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Shibota told reporters that Horiuchi told Barshefsky during
their talks that fast-track liberalization should be carried out on
a voluntary basis.
	   He added that full APEC participation would ``be very
difficult'' if countries reluctant to open their markets were
denied flexibility in setting free-market schedules.
	   A senior Japanese official told The Associated Press on Sunday
that it felt the United States was bullying Tokyo into signing on
to the EVSL agreement before it was ready.
	   ``I think it's a very critical moment for APEC, whether it will
change or not,'' the official said.
	   The United States, the official noted, intends to make the list
of fast-track sectors binding, with specific time targets to cut
tariffs, with an eye on the next round of talks at the World Trade
Organization in 2000.
	   ``The U.S. is trying to take advantage of this APEC exercise to
increase the momentum in the WTO process,'' the official said.
	   For Japan, six of the nine sectors _ fish, forestry, toys,
jewelry, energy and environment _ are seen as ``sensitive''
industries. In particular, the forestry and fish industries are
heavily subsidized and seen as vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   Much has changed since APEC member economies signed on to the
EVSL concept in Vancouver last year.
	   Japan now is in full-blown recession and worries that reducing
its plywood tariffs, for example, would lead to more paper mills
closing down.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Kenya's Philip Tarus went from opening act to
headliner over the course of the inaugural U.S. Rock `n' Roll
Marathon on Sunday.
	   Running the full 26 miles, 385 yards (42.19 kilometers) for the
first time, the 24-year-old Tarus pulled away from countryman and
training partner Christopher Cheboiboch and won the Rock `n' Roll
Marathon in a respectable 2 hours, 10 minutes, 42 seconds.
	   ``At last I see I can run well and finish,'' said Tarus, who
started this year's Boston Marathon as a pacesetter and dropped out
at about the 20-mile mark (after about 32 kilometers).
	   That's about the point Sunday where Tarus had opened a 20-yard
(18-meter) lead over Cheboiboch, 22, who was bothered by a stomach
ailment in his first marathon. Cheboiboch finished in 2:10:53. A
third Kenyan also broke 2:11 _ Jonathan Ndambuki in 2:10:58.
	   ``I knew after 25 kilometers, because some had dropped out,''
said Tarus, who had built a lead of 80 yards (73 meters) as the
course headed toward the finish line downtown.
	   The Kenyans rocked _ they swept the first six spots and seven of
the first 10 _ and so did the course, which featured several bands
along the way.
	   ``The bands were enjoyable,'' Cheboiboch said. ``Seeing as music
is a big part of Kenya, it was very nice.''
	   Nadezhda Ilyina, 34, of Russia won the women's race in 2:34:17,
beating rival Irina Bogacheva, 37, by 11 seconds. Salina Chirchir,
29, of Kenya was third in 2:35:17.
	   But the marathon had some opening-day glitches, most notably the
38-minute delay at the start in Balboa Park. Nine hours after the
start, 15,746 of the 19,978 entrants had finished.
	   The wheelchair racers, who took off 15 minutes before the rest
of the field, came to a stop at the seventh mile (11th kilometer)
and had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes.
	   Just past the Mile 7 marker (At about the 11-kilometer mark), a
U-Haul van backed out of a self-storage complex after the lead pack
of 15 runners went past and stayed on the course for about
three-quarters of a mile (1.2 kilometers) until police intercepted
the driver and forced him off.
	   The delay may have been enough to keep Tarus from cracking 2:10,
which would have earned him a dlrs 5,000 bonus. By the marathon's
midpoint, the sun had broken through the cloud cover and the
temperature began to rise.
	   Cheboiboch said the delay didn't bother the Kenyans, ``because
we were patient.''
	   But the course had a lot of sharp turns, and that took its toll
on the pace.
	   ``Sometimes I changed speed around the curve and to pick up my
speed was a bit difficult,'' Tarus said.
	   Tarus won dlrs 10,000 cash and a sport utility vehicle, plus
other products from Suzuki, the marathon's sponsor.
	   ``Maybe I will sell it because I don't have a driving license,''
said Tarus, who runs about 140 miles (225 kilometers) a week back
home in Kenya.
	   Ilyina said winning this marathon helped make up for being
disqualified from the 1997 Los Angeles Marathon for apparently
taking a shortcut through a gas station while looking for a
bathroom.
	   ``It was very hard for me to lose in LA, but you have to be able
to approach life with an easy attitude,'' she said. ``It happens.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and rebuff speculative attacks.
	   ``We're merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central
Bank,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``This will increase reliability and will make it possible to
rebuff any speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.''
	   Kiriyenko met with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the economic crisis, as a team of
IMF negotiators was headed to Moscow.
	   Kiriyenko said that the government program to cope with the
crisis included many unpopular steps, including tightly reining in
government spending, but that the poorest Russians would be
protected.
	   Yeltsin was giving ``maximal support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said, adding that ``there hasn't been a single case when we didn't
receive such support for the measures elaborated by the
government.''
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials
including Yeltsin have sufficient political will to push through an
austerity program.
	   An expanded Cabinet meeting on the strategy, chaired by Yeltsin,
is scheduled Tuesday.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on the so-called gray economy.
	   He said that the poorest Russians ``pay their 12 percent in
income tax, but a very significant amount that could be paid by the
others never reaches the budget,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The essence (of the program) is straightforward: The country
cannot live unless taxes are collected, and it cannot spend more
than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   The IMF has told Russia that it needs to slash its budget,
dramatically improve tax collection and make its financial workings
more visible.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   ``The IMF will make pretty tough conditions for making loans
available to Russia and very thoroughly analyze the government
program of improving finances,'' Interfax quoted Deputy Finance
Minister Oleg Vyugin as saying.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer and a separate team of
negotiators are scheduled to arrive in Moscow later Monday. Fischer
will meet this week with top Russian Cabinet officials.
	   Fischer has warned that the dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in emergency credits that the Kremlin wants may be too steep for
the fund. At a news conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, he said the
sum was too much for the IMF to give to one country.

Report: Protest planned for first stop of Clinton's tour 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ People whose homes were demolished for
redevelopment in the ancient Chinese city of Xi'an plan street
protests when U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives there on the
first leg of his China tour, a human rights group said Monday.
	   The city, near the site of China's famed terra cotta warriors,
has seen more than 100 demonstrations since 1993 by people angered
by the destruction of their houses for redevelopment, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Last week, 200 people whose homes were demolished protested on
Liberation Road, one of the city's main thoroughfares, the Hong
Kong-based group said.
	   Quoting someone whose home was demolished, the group said
another street protest was planned during Clinton's visit. Clinton
arrives in the city Thursday, kicking off his nine-day, five-city
tour.
	   A spokeswoman for the Xi'an government, who gave only her
surname, Chen, said she did not know about any protests.
	   The Information Center said property developers backed by senior
city government officials forcibly demolished homes and hired
people to beat up residents who did not want to move.
	   Many older sections in central Xi'an have been demolished, as
have old neighborhoods in most Chinese cities. Some residents
welcome the chance to move into newer apartments, but others resent
being forced out of their old neighborhoods, often into areas far
from city centers.

U.N. refugee chief warns of Guinea-Bissau refugee crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Appealing to West African nations to find a
peaceful solution to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, the head of the
U.N. refugee agency Monday warned that a ``major humanitarian
crisis'' could develop.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata wrote to the
presidents of Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Guinea Friday calling for
``a peaceful and prompt settlement'' to the crisis, a statement
said.
	   Most of the 300,000 people in the capital, Bissau, have fled and
many are reportedly without food in tiny villages throughout the
country.
	   Immediate consequences could be famine and a refugee outflow
into the country's neighbors, Ogata said.
	   The agency has no news of some 5,000 refugees from Senegal who
have been living in villages in northern Guinea-Bissau's Cacheu
region since 1992, her statement added.
	   They arrived after fleeing the 15-year-old civil war in
Senegal's southern Casamance province.
	   ``Reports indicate that fighting has also broken out in this
region, where Jolmete refugee camp is located,'' the statement
said.
	   UNHCR staff in Dakar have registered ``several hundred''
refugees from Bissau who arrived in Senegal by boat, it added.
	   A mission last week to Senegal's border region with
Guinea-Bissau counted ``hundreds of people of other nationalities''
arriving in Casamance.
	   UNHCR's last foreign staff member left Bissau last week. The
agency has deployed emergency staff to bordering areas of Senegal
and Guinea, itself host to more than 500,000 refugees from
conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ The creator of the portly cat who has
endured as part of comic America for two decades is likely to visit
Malaysia's cat city for a ``Meow'' festival, an organizer said
Monday.
	   Cat lovers will welcome the presence of Jim Davies, the creator
of Garfield, at this year's festival in the eastern city of
Kuching, said Cat Museum assistant curator Bahtiar Affendi.
	   The only uncertainty surrounding the Nov. 23 visit was
confirmation from the sponsors, the national news agency, Bernama,
quoted Bahtiar, as saying.
	   ``Davies would like to join in Garfield's 20th anniversary
celebrations here after being informed by foreign tourists who are
Garfield's fans that the city has a Cat Museum with a Garfield
gallery,'' he said.
	   Activities at the museum during the five-day Meow Festival,
starting Nov. 22, will include a cat show, exhibitions, cat cartoon
drawing and cat imitation contests.
	   Kuching is known as Malaysia's cat city. The word itself means
cat in the Malay language. Bronze cat sculptures perch on the
Sarawak River esplanade and stone obelisks encircled by
larger-than-life cat statues stand like shrines at major
intersections.
	   The cat museum has received nearly 400,000 visitors since 1993.

Impeachment committee sets first meeting date 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A commission set up to prepare an impeachment
motion against President Boris Yeltsin will hold its first meeting
on June 29, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The lower house of parliament voted Friday to set up the
commission, which would draw up formal charges against Yeltsin that
would serve as a legal foundation for impeachment.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of several
transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's
economy.
	   Several attempts since 1994 to set up a panel to prepare a
formal indictment have collapsed.
	   The latest initiative, too, is unlikely to succeed. Once the
indictment is prepared, a two-thirds majority of the 450 Duma
members is needed to launch the impeachment motion. Then it would
have to win confirmation from both the Constitutional and Supreme
Courts, as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the Federation
Council.

World Cup: For Norway, it's beat Brazil or else 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ For Norway, the choice is simple: beat
Brazil or risk elimination from the World Cup. The defending
champions are out for some fun, practice _ and maybe a little
revenge.
	   Although first and second in Group A, the two teams seem headed
in opposite directions as they prepare to meet Tuesday night in the
group's final qualifying game.
	   The Brazilians are on an ascendant curve. After a shaky 2-1
victory over Scotland, they steamrolled Morocco 3-0 to clinch first
place with an insurmountable six points.
	   The mood at training camp is contagiously upbeat. Players talk
about ``building momentum'' and being ``on a roll'' as they look
ahead to Italy or Chile as a possible adversary in the next round.
	   For the Norwegians, nothing is going right. Although unbeaten in
their last 16 matches, they managed only a disappointing 2-2 tie
with Morocco and a 1-1 draw with Scotland.
	   That means they probably have to defeat Brazil to reach the
second round for the first time in their history, although they
could squeak by with a tie if Scotland and Morocco also tie.
	   Not that a victory is unthinkable. The Norwegians beat Brazil
4-2 in a friendly match last year, and before the Cup they trounced
Denmark, Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2. FIFA ranks
them No. 4 in the world.
	   But first they have to find the cause of their mysterious slump.
And no one seems to have a clue.
	   ``It's not easy to explain,'' said Chelsea striker Andre Tore
Flo, dubbed ``Flonaldo'' after scoring two goals in the victory
over Brazil. ``We're not satisfied so far either.''
	   ``I can't really find any reason,'' shrugged defender Dan Eggen.
``There's always a danger you become bigger than you actually are
because of training game results.''
	   Norway will likely keep doing what it does best _ play long
balls and an aerial game keyed to the 1.93 meter (6-foot-4) Flo. It
may be predictable and boring, but it works _ or has worked so far.
	   Meanwhile, Brazil is preparing some surprises.
	   With the suspension of midfielder Cesar Sampaio, who picked up
his second yellow card against Morocco, coach Mario Zagallo got a
rare opportunity to experiment during the Cup.
	   ``It's an atypical game,'' he admitted. ``I can take any risk
without a risk, understand?''
	   The formation he came up with last week was the answer to fans'
prayers. Leonardo moved back to cover Sampaio's slot and Denilson,
the 20-year-old dribbling dervish who is headed for Spain's Betis,
moved in as a virtual third striker alongside Ronaldo and Bebeto.
	   Zagallo refused to confirm the change, saying he might simply
use Emerson, Sampaio's immediate backup. ``I won't give weapons to
the adversary,'' he said.
	   But Zagallo makes no secret that Denilson will get playing time,
even if it's coming off the bench. And Denilson promises he's up to
the task.
	   ``I want to make those dribbles that drive the 'gringos'
crazy,'' he said. ``Violence doesn't intimidate me. The bigger the
back, the harder he falls.''
	   Another change is likely in the back line. Starting fullbacks
Aldair and Junior Baiano have one yellow card, which will be erased
in the next round. But if either picks up a second yellow against
Norway he will miss the next game _ when the loser goes home.
	   Zagallo's solution, also not confirmed, is to sit out one
starter against Norway. In the team's final scrimmage on Sunday,
Goncalves replaced Aldair alongside Junior Baiano.
	   Making his Cup debut against the Norwegian air game doesn't
worry him, Goncalves said.
	   ``They have the height advantage, but we have the edge in ball
touch, speed, mobility,'' he said. ``We have to use our weapons and
see who's better.''
	   And if the need to win doesn't exist for Brazil, the desire for
a little payback does. The Norwegians' crowing after last year's
win still sticks in Brazil's craw.
	   ``They have a history with us,'' said Leonardo. ``Maybe it's
time to revert that history with a win.''

	   MAKHACHKALA, Dagestan (AP) _ A truck carrying Russian riot
police officers struck a road mine near the border with Chechnya on
Monday. One officer was killed and two were seriously injured.
	   The mine was planted near the village of Solnechnoye in Russia's
republic of Dagestan, the police press service said. The officers
were members of a Russian riot police force deployed to guard the
border with Chechnya.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's independence war against Russia two
years ago, the separatist republic has become an epicenter of
violent crime that has spread into Dagestan and other neighboring
Russian regions. The republics' own, internal conflicts also
contribute to the unrest.
	   In another violent incident, unidentified attackers opened fire
with grenade launchers on a Russian border guards' helicopter base
in Dagestan late Sunday night.
	   One serviceman was injured in the attack on the helicopter
squadron, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported, citing
the border guards' command. The attackers fled in a car after the
shooting.
	   Dagestan has seen several outbreaks of violence in the past few
years. Most appear to be linked to longstanding political and
ethnic tensions.

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's justice minister and legal advisers
Monday explored ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank troop
withdrawal, a step that would delay a pullback for many months and
was denounced by the Palestinians as a new stalling tactic.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet decided whether to
hold a referendum, which would be a first for Israel and would
require changes in the nation's basic law.
	   The dovish opposition said Israel committed itself to the
withdrawals in international agreements and that Netanyahu had no
right to submit the issue again to a referendum.
	   The referendum idea also appears to run counter to appeals by
the Clinton administration for Netanyahu to quickly accept a U.S.
proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   The pullback plan was first proposed in January and has been
accepted by the Palestinians, but Netanyahu has ignored informal
deadlines set by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Ties between Israel and the United States were further strained
Sunday when the Cabinet approved a plan for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under the peace accords, the status of Jerusalem is to
be determined in negotiations with the Palestinians, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   The United States called Israel's expansion plan
``provocative.'' Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, said Monday it was concerned the plan would
``complicate the peace process at a very sensitive time.''
	   In a news conference Sunday, Netanyahu's aides said the plan
called for extending Jerusalem municipal authority over nearby
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but not for annexing them.
	   However, confusion remained Monday over what exactly had been
approved by the Cabinet on Sunday. The Maariv daily quoted Cabinet
ministers as saying that it was decided during the session to
expand the city's territory, not just extend municipal authority.
	   Several ministers, including Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, demanded that Jerusalem expand in all directions. In the
end, the Cabinet decided on a territorial expansion, but did not
specify whether into Israel proper, the West Bank or both, the
newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately
available for comment Monday.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman also complained that he was
misled by the prime minister. Israeli media quoted Weizman as
saying Netanyahu had given him reason to believe that a West Bank
withdrawal would be carried out, but that this was no longer the
case. Weizman abruptly canceled his participation in a major
economic conference, saying he had expected the withdrawal to be
under way by the time he was to address the conference.
	   In Sunday's meeting, the Cabinet also asked the Justice Minister
Tsahi Hanegbi to look into ways of holding a referendum. On Monday,
Hanegbi met with senior legal advisers and other ministers, and
said arranging such a vote could take weeks.
	   However, at least one legal expert _ Alon Liel, a former Israeli
diplomat, who researched the subject for a Jerusalem think tank _
said it could take up to two years to prepare for a referendum.
	   Recent surveys indicate about two-thirds of Israelis support the
U.S. plan for a 13 percent pullback.
	   In other developments Monday:
	   _ In the Palestinian village of Walajeh south of Jerusalem,
Israel destroyed the home of 37-year-old Mustafa Dadean on grounds
that he did not have a license to build. Israel has stepped up the
pace of house demolitions in recent weeks, prompting sharp
criticism from the United States.
	   _ Jewish settlers took possession of a home in Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhood of Silwan, just outside the walled Old City. The
settlement movement Elad said it bought the home, and that it
planned to move into four others in the area in the next few days.

Pro-Kurdish paper targeted in bomb attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BATMAN, Turkey (AP) _ A bomb exploded at the premises of a
pro-Kurdish newspaper in this southeastern city early Monday,
causing slight damage, the paper said. There were no casualties.
	   The makeshift bomb, hurled at daily Ulkede Gundem's balcony on
the third-floor of a building, went off at 2:35 a.m. (1135 GMT),
shattering windows, the paper said. The office was empty at the
time.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility.
	   The attack came a week after police confiscated hundreds of
copies of the newspaper for printing statements by a Kurdish rebel
leader. Last month, an appeals court imposed a 10-day ban on the
Istanbul-based daily for publishing an article advocating Kurdish
separatism.
	   Kurdish rebels have been waging a guerrilla war for autonomy in
Turkey's southeast since 1984. The war has claimed some 37,000
lives.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news GUYANA: Opposition party calls meeting to organize demonstrations 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The opposition People's National
Congress said Sunday it will meet early this week to organize a new
round of demonstrations against President Janet Jagan's government.
	   Racially charged demonstrations have taken place in downtown
Georgetown since Thursday. The People's National Congress decided
Friday to throw its support behind the protesters.
	   Leader Desmond Hoyte said Sunday the party would hold a public
meeting in the Square of the Revolution, a favorite assembly point
for demonstrators.
	   He said the party sympathizes with protesters who claim Jagan's
People's Progressive Party rigged the elections in December.
	   Race riots broke out following the elections as Guyanese of
African descent, who primarily support Hoyte's party, protested the
win by Jagan's party, which is backed by people of East Indian
descent.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Clinton says political status bill is top priority for
island
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In a letter to a Democratic Party
supporter, U.S. President Bill Clinton said offering statehood or
sovereignty to Puerto Rico is his ``highest priority'' for the
island.
	   Clinton wrote to Democratic Party fund raiser Miguel Lausell,
who has urged changes in a Congressional bill that would ask Puerto
Ricans to choose between statehood, sovereignty or continued
commonwealth status. The measure narrowly passed the House of
Representatives in March, and the Senate will hold a second
fact-finding hearing on the bill on Tuesday.
	   ``Establishing a process for resolving the fundamental _ and
frustrating _ status issue is my highest priority regarding the
islands (Puerto Rico),'' Clinton wrote.
	   Clinton has promised to sign the bill if it passes Congress.
	   Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, and under the current
commonwealth its 3.8 million residents are U.S. citizens, receive
federal benefits and can be drafted into the U.S. military. But
they have no vote in Congress, cannot vote for president and do not
pay federal taxes.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Dominican business leaders to visit Cuba
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican business
leaders are meeting with Cuban counterparts in the first
government-sponsored trade conference since the two countries
normalized relations in April.
	   About 30 Dominican executives were expected at the meeting
Monday in Santiago, Cuba, the Dominican Export Promotion Center
said. Cuba and the Dominican Republic are sharing the costs of the
meeting.
	   The two countries, separated by only about 150 miles (250
kilometers) were on chilly terms for decades after the Dominican
Republic severed diplomatic ties in 1961. Relations began improving
after centrist Dominican president Leonel Fernandez took office in
1996.
	   The countries opened diplomatic offices on each other's soil
earlier this year and are now trying to broaden their commercial
ties.
	   In August, Cuban President Fidel Castro is expected to make his
first visit to the Dominican Republic since the 1959 revolution
that brought him to power.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ General Motors Corp. has signed a dlrs 230
million joint venture agreement with China's FAW-Jinbei Automotive
Co. to manufacture pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, GM
said Monday.
	   The 50-50 joint venture, known as Jinbei GM Automotive Co., will
be located in Shenyang, Liaoning province, the company said in a
press release.
	   The company will manufacture the Chevrolet Blazer four-door
sport utility vehicle and the Chevrolet S-10 crew cab pickup.
	   Production will begin in the year 2000, GM said. The company
plans to manufacture 4,000 vehicles in the first year of operation
and eventually produce 50,000 a year ``as the market develops,''
the company said.
	   GM has 18 ventures in China, including those with its business
divisions Delphi Automotive Systems and Delco Electronics.
	   FAW-Jinbei Automotive was formed in 1995 from the merger of
Jinbei Automotive Co. and First Auto Works.

services by connecting their networks, NTT said Monday.
	   NTT Worldwide Telecommunication Corp. and IBM will start the
joint data transmission network service July 1, connecting NTT's
Arcstar frame relay network with IBM's global frame relay network,
NTT said.
	   NTT has already announced the start of international fax and
Internet services using the Arcstar brand name.
	   The services will be aimed at corporate customers, a spokesman
said.
	   NTT Worldwide said the two companies will cooperate in
maintenance of the network. Billing will be done on a cooperative
basis, making one-stop billing possible, he said. The company said
IBM and NTT will also cooperate in sales of the services worldwide.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The South Korean government, trying to
help construction companies hit by the slumbering real estate
market, said Monday it will provide a total of 3.6 trillion won
(dlrs 2.57 billion) in loans to buyers of apartments.
	   Since the country requested a record dlrs 58.35 billion bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund late last year, prices
of real estate, particularly apartments, have fallen nearly 30
percent, government officials said.
	   In return for the bailout package, the IMF calls for massive
corporate and financial reforms, which seriously undermine job
security of workers accustomed to lifetime employment.
	   The reforms, which lead to layoffs and curtailed wages, force
many buyers of apartments to cancel their contracts with
construction companies, already teetering on the brink of collapse
because of cash strains.
	   The government said that until the end of next year, loans of up
to 40 million won (dlrs 28,570) will be provided at annual interest
rates of 12 percent, sharply lower than market loan rates of 17
percent.
	   Borrowers must pay the principal for 10 years after a three-year
grace period, it said.
	   ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A total of 32 billion ringgit
(dlrs 8 billion) has been pulled from Malaysia's banks since the
Asian contagion crushed currencies one year ago, the country's
finance minister said.
	   Up to 20 billion ringgit (dlrs 4 billion) had been transferred
overseas while the rest was withdrawn from deposits at banks, Anwar
Ibrahim said Sunday.
	   Anwar cited the capital flight to defend high interest rates, a
policy that has put him at odds with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who blames the tight monetary policy for choking the
economy.
	   Mahathir and his chief economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, have
railed against high rates, echoing complaints by businessmen that
borrowing money had become more expensive and was hurting them.
	   Many Malaysian banks, burdened by non-performing loans, have
become tight-fisted.
	   Anwar said banks could reduce their effective lending rates to
13 percent from 15 percent now.
	   But he said not all banks were following government directives
to relax lending to productive sectors. He named the Bank of Tokyo
and Public Bank as those that did not provide satisfactory loans.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A seismic survey more than 600 miles
(1,000 kilometers) east of Australia has discovered strong
indications of gas hydrates, a potential long-term energy source,
Resources and Energy Minister Warwick Parer said Monday.
	   The discovery, the first in Australian waters, lies on the
eastern flank of the Lord Howe Rise, a sub-sea plateau about 1,000
yards (meters) deep and about 500 miles (800 kilometers) northeast
of Lord Howe Island.
	   Gas hydrates are a frozen mixture of gas and water that have
been found by remote sensing in the deep oceans in many parts of
the world.
	   The survey was conducted by the government's Australian
Geological Survey Organization, in cooperation with French
scientists.
	   Australia has until 2004 to establish its claim to a vast area
of the sea bed beyond its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic
zone, but detailed bathymetric and sediment thickness information
is required to support any claim, the survey organization said.

Premier demands ministers come clean on Securitate past 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile on Monday
gave all 26 members of his Cabinet three days to declare whether
they collaborated with the Communist secret police, the Securitate.
	   Vasile, leaving for a three-day visit to Poland, said he expects
answers by the time he returns Thursday, his aide Gabriel Piscociu
said.
	   Vasile demanded Health Minister Francisc Baranyi resign after he
admitted last week that he was a Securitate agent, saying he was
forced to cooperate and did no one any harm.
	   Baranyi's party, the main party for Romania's ethnic Hungarian
minority, agreed that he should leave his post.
	   Finance Minister Daniel Daianu admitted working for Securitate
intelliegnce abroad a few months ago. He has not been asked to
resign.
	   The center-right government, which replaced a Cabinet of
ex-communists in late 1996, has been stunned to find that
Securitate collaborators exist in its ranks, particularly in
parties such as the National Peasants' Party which was staunchly
anti-Securitate and whose senior men were tortured or often killed
by the Communist secret police.
	   Baranyi's revelation was one of several Securitate accusations
that have surfaced in the past two weeks, illustrating once again
the force of the Communist secret police that once served dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   One in four Romanian adults was said to have collaborated with
the Securitate in the Ceausescu era, and the mystery and alleged
power of its activities continues to fascinate and embroil
Romanians in intrigue almost nine years after Ceausescu was
executed and the secret police officially disbanded in December
1989.

Marshall set for comeback

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Injured All Blacks scrum-half
Justin Marshall will play his first match in four months when he
turns out for New Zealand A against Tonga on Sunday.
	   Marshall, who captained the All Blacks when Sean Fitzpatrick was
injured last year, tore his Achilles tendon while playing for
Canterbury in the Super 12 series on March 6.
	   Marshall was expected to miss the bulk of New Zealand's
international because of the injury and had set himself to return
in August.
	   ``I'm confident I'm ready, otherwise I wouldn't be playing,''
Marshall said Monday after a final fitness test. ``It wouldn't be
in my best interests to play a game of rugby if I'm not 100
percent. All I would do is make myself look silly and run the risk
of further injury.''

World Cup: Italians seek victory to avoid Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Italy-Austria match features a simple formula _
both teams need to win.
	   The ``Azzurri,'' who picked four points in two games, seek first
place in Group B to avoid a second-round clash against defending
champion Brazil which leads Group A.
	   Austria, tied with Chile at two points, shoots for its first
victory to keep its qualifying chances alive.
	   A draw could put at risk Italy's leadership in the group while
eliminating the Austrians.
	   And second place in Group B is likely to mean sudden death
against the powerful Brazilians in the next round.
	   Italian coach Cesare Maldini said he did not expect an overly
offensive game by the Austrians despite their desperate need for
points.
	   ``I'm sure they will keep their defense tight, hoping to hit
with fast counterattacks. It'll be a tough game but we are not
thinking to settle with a draw because I expect a victory of Chile
against Cameroon'' in the other group match, Maldini said.
	   Maldini was also worried by Austria's ability to score late
goals. Two injury time goals gave the Austrians draws against
Cameroon and Chile.
	   ``One good deterrent (against late goals) is to lead 2-0 by the
90th minute,'' said Maldini.
	   Italy, a three-time world champion, showed an improvement in
form and determination in its 3-0 victory against Cameroon
following a difficult start against Chile.
	   Maldini indicated he may rotate team stars Alessandro Del Piero
and Roberto Baggio during the game with newcomer Luigi Di Biagio
commanding midfield play and striker Christian Vieri leading
offense.
	   Del Piero still is not completely healed and seems unable to
endure a full match after recovering from a thigh strain which
hampered his World Cup preparation.
	   For the Austrians it looked like a psychological problem _ force
a defensive-minded team into attack.
	   ``We will have to change our style of play ... and believe we
can win,'' said midfielder Arnold Wettl.
	   Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska was expected to start veteran
striker Anton Polster in a pair with Ivica Vastic, who tallied the
equalizer against Chile coming in as a second-half substitute.
	   Prohaska, who has been performing in the Italian League as a
player before turning coach, said Austria wanted to impress against
the neighboring soccer power.
	   ``It's a vital match for us. Our big advantage is to start as
the underdogs,'' Prohaska said. ``We will have to beware of their
striking force and take advantage of Italy's possible midfield
weakness.''
	   Vieri, one goal behind Gabriel Batistuta among the World Cup
leading strikers, will be trying to score in his third consecutive
match against the Austrians.
	   Austrian midfielder Anton Pfeffer, trying to dampen tensions
ahead of Tuesday's match at St. Denis Stadium, said ``If we don't
get a win, the world won't collapse.''
	   But it could collapse for the Italians if they don't.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stock prices edge higher 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with late-afternoon dollar and bond rates
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar shot up more than 3 1/2 yen Monday
after Japan failed to offer concrete plans to save its banks and
revive its economy at a weekend finance meeting. Tokyo stock prices
edged higher.
	   The dollar bought 138.54 yen in late afternoon, up 3.57 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.10 yen on Friday.
	   The dollar rose as high as 138.70 yen at one point Monday. In
the previous four trading days in Tokyo, it had plunged a total of
11.47 yen from eight-year highs against the Japanese currency,
largely because of joint U.S.-Japan intervention in currency
markets last Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 15,309.09. On
Friday, the Nikkei had fallen 93.56 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Finance officials from around the world met in Tokyo Saturday
and urged Japan to stimulate its economy and clean up its bad loan
problem. But traders were disappointed that Japan unveiled no new
measures to accomplish those goals.
	   ``There was nothing new from the meeting,'' said Minoru Shioiri,
assistant foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The dollar traded as low as 134.97 yen in the morning session in
Tokyo after a Ministry of Finance official hinted Japan would
intervene again in currency markets to stop the yen's decline.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international
affairs, said: ``When Japan has to do what it has to do, it has the
ability to do it.''
	   Expectations that the United States might again intervene in
currency markets were high ahead of President Bill Clinton's visit
to China later this week. China has complained that the weak yen
was putting pressure on its economy, and traders calculated that
the United States would try to keep the yen from falling until the
high-profile visit was over.
	   The yen's slide in recent weeks roiled Asian financial markets
by stirring concerns about a possible new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic
turmoil last year.
	   Meanwhile, the governing Liberal Democratic Party's
secretary-general, Koichi Kato, said Monday the government will
make a final decision by July 8 regarding the formation of a public
``bridge bank'' to dispose of banks' bad debts.
	   The new bank would likely take over loans of failed banks and
sell any remaining collateral while continuing to provide credit to
any healthy clients.
	   On the stock market, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section rose 0.04 points, insignificant
in percentage terms, to 1,187.31. It had declined 11.57 points, or
0.87 percent, on Friday.
	   Attention focused on a dramatic decline in shares of Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan amid rumors, which LTCB denied, about the
bank's health and a possible merger with other institutions.
	   The main trigger for its plunge, though, was expectation that
more aggressive efforts by Japan to clean up bad debt would mean
letting weak banks fail.
	   LTCB plunged by 50 yen, the limit allowed under exchange rules,
to a record low of 62. It was the most actively traded stock, with
some 47 million shares changing hands.
	   Overall, trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at
360 million shares, down from 482 million Friday. Advances
outnumbered declines 566 to 502, while 193 issues were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from Friday's close at 1.255 percent. Its price
edged up to 111.57 yen from 111.47 yen.

Israel explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback 
</HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's justice minister and legal advisers
Monday explored ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank troop
withdrawal, a step that would delay a pullback for many months and
was denounced by the Palestinians as a new stalling tactic.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not decided whether to
hold a referendum, which would be a first for Israel and would
require changes in the nation's basic law, which has no provision
for a referendum.
	   The dovish opposition said Israel committed itself to the
withdrawals in international agreements and that Netanyahu had no
right to submit the issue to a referendum.
	   The referendum idea also appears to run counter to appeals by
the Clinton administration for Netanyahu to quickly accept a U.S.
proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   The pullback plan was first proposed in January and has been
accepted by the Palestinians, but Netanyahu has ignored informal
deadlines set by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Ties between Israel and the United States were further strained
Sunday when the Cabinet approved a plan for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under the peace accords, the status of Jerusalem is to
be determined in negotiations with the Palestinians, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   The United States called Israel's expansion plan
``provocative.'' Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, said Monday it was concerned the plan would
``complicate the peace process at a very sensitive time.''
	   In a news conference Sunday, Netanyahu's aides said the plan
would extend Jerusalem's municipal authority over nearby Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, but not annex them.
	   However, confusion remained Monday over what exactly had been
approved by the Cabinet the day before. The Maariv daily quoted
Cabinet ministers as saying that it was decided during the session
to expand the city's territory, not just extend municipal
authority.
	   Several ministers, including Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, demanded that Jerusalem expand in all directions. In the
end, the Cabinet decided on a territorial expansion, but did not
specify whether into Israel proper, the West Bank or both, the
newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately
available for comment Monday.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman also complained that he was
misled by the prime minister. Israeli media quoted Weizman as
saying Netanyahu had given him reason to believe that a West Bank
withdrawal would be carried out, but that this was no longer the
case. Weizman abruptly canceled his participation in a major
economic conference, saying he had expected the withdrawal to be
under way by the time he was to address the conference.
	   In Sunday's meeting, the Cabinet also asked the Justice Minister
Tsahi Hanegbi to look into ways of holding a referendum. On Monday,
Hanegbi met with senior legal advisers and other ministers, and
said arranging such a vote could take weeks.
	   However, at least one legal expert _ Alon Liel, a former Israeli
diplomat, who researched the subject for a Jerusalem think tank _
said it could take up to two years to prepare for a referendum.
	   Recent surveys indicate about two-thirds of Israelis support the
U.S. plan for a 13 percent pullback.
	   In other developments Monday:
	   _ In the Palestinian village of Walajeh south of Jerusalem,
Israel destroyed the home of 37-year-old Mustafa Dadean on grounds
that he did not have a license to build. Israel has stepped up the
pace of demolition in recent weeks, prompting sharp criticism from
the United States.
	   _ Jewish settlers took possession of a home in Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhood of Silwan, just outside the walled Old City. The
settlement movement Elad said it bought the home, and that it
planned to move into four others in the area in the next few days.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares in Hong Kong tumbled Monday, sending the
key index down 4.5 percent, as investors dumped stocks in the
absence of a firm plan by Japan to bolster its economy.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 387.70 points, closing at 8,204.21.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.65 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
724 million), down from Friday's 6.44 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 825 million).
	   Brokers said investors were disappointed that Japan had not come
up with any measures to boost its faltering currency and economy
after world finance officials, including Deputy U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, met in Tokyo over the weekend.
	   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen on Monday. The
dollar was quoted at 138.54 yen at late afternoon, up 3.57 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.10 yen Friday.
	   Shares fell ``mainly because the yen has become weaker again,''
said Emerald Yuen, dealing director at MeesPierson Securities
(Asia) Ltd.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 3.30 Hong Kong
dollars to 31.20, and Cheung Kong fell 2.30 dollars to 36.30.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 7.00 dollars to
180.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 3.60 dollars to 43.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.40 dollars to 37.80, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 30 cents to 28.10.

Poor farmers vow to carry out anti-government protest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Tens of thousands of poor farmers plan
to march on the Thai capital Wednesday to demand that Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai's government ease their dire financial
problems, their leaders said Monday.
	   If the planned 20,000 demonstrators actually reach Bangkok, the
protest will be the biggest against Chuan since he took office last
November to grapple with Thailand's economic crisis.
	   Leaders of the dozen groups arranging the protest, grouping
together the rural poor from Thailand's poverty-stricken northeast,
accused authorities Monday of obstructing their plans but vowed the
protest would go ahead.
	   Local authorities were said to be convoking farm leaders for
audits on the day of the protest in efforts to keep them at home,
or organizing last-minute markets to take up public meeting grounds
where protesters were to gather before leaving the provinces.
	   The government attempted to defuse tensions with the farmers by
broadcasting live negotiations with their leaders over the weekend,
but the talks produced nothing. Among other things, the farmers
want a five-year moratorium on repaying their debts.
	   Chuan has adhered to economic demands laid down by the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for the IMF-organized dlrs
17.2 billion bailout of the Thai economy, the first to fall in
Asia's yearlong financial crisis.
	   Thailand's farmers, especially from the rain-starved northeast,
have been suffering for years. But the economic crisis has led to a
loss of city jobs for family members who regularly sent home money,
and the pain of farmers has increased.

Eds: ADDS dissident's appeal for meeting with Clinton in grafs
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton should use this week's summit
to urge China to release all political prisoners and recognize
international human rights standards, a rights group said in a
letter to Clinton released Monday.
	   Human Rights in China also appealed to Clinton to condemn the
1989 military crackdown that killed hundreds of people when Beijing
crushed democracy protests at Tiananmen Square.
	   In another appeal, Amnesty International urged Clinton to meet
dissidents and relatives of those killed in the crackdown, and to
seek the release of protesters still in prison.
	   Clinton, the first American president to visit since the
crackdown, will be officially welcomed at Tiananmen Square on
Saturday before meeting President Jiang Zemin.
	   New York-based Human Rights in China included with its letter a
list of 158 Beijing citizens who remain in prison for participating
in the 1989 protests.
	   ``Their only crime consisted of standing up for democracy and
respect for human rights,'' the letter said.
	   The group urged Clinton to ask Jiang for the release of all 158
and particularly of Li Hai, a Beijing philosophy student who was
sentenced to nine years in prison in 1996 for divulging state
secrets after he compiled a list of prisoners.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that
Clinton would speak directly about the Tiananmen crackdown and
criticize China's human rights record.
	   The administration has said, however, that Clinton does not plan
to meet dissidents for fear that Chinese authorities might harass
them after he leaves.
	   But Beijing-based dissident Xu Wenli rejected that argument,
saying Monday he wanted to meet the U.S. president and would ask
for official Chinese approval if invited to do so.
	   ``We're not worried or scared about meeting Clinton,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
	   Last Friday, a group of 57 dissidents appealed to Clinton to
meet Xu after his summit with Jiang.
 &UR; _____
	   Eds: The following material is embargoed until 1501 GMT Monday
	   Closed-door discussions on human rights by foreign diplomats and
Chinese officials have so far yielded few improvements in China,
Human Rights Watch argued in a report released Tuesday.
	   It recommended that quiet diplomacy should insist on
international human rights standards, include experts and activists
along with diplomats and be backed up with pressure such as
criticism of China before the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
	   Many Western countries have dropped public pressure on China and
instead hold private meetings with Chinese officials to discuss
human rights.
	   Too often this approach reduces human rights concerns to
``differences'' between countries, the report said. China should be
held to the same internationally recognized human rights standards
applied to all other countries, it said.
	   ``Excuses should never be made for systematic violations of
basic rights,'' it said.
	   Restricting international efforts on behalf of human rights to
closed-door diplomatic meetings is a ``serious challenge to the
already tarnished credibility of the international human rights
monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations.''
	   The report added that turning the rights of Chinese citizens
into ``one of a number of bargaining chips'' in diplomacy degrades
international human rights norms in the eyes of ordinary Chinese
citizens.
	   End of embargoed material.
 &UR; _____
	   London-based Amnesty International wrote that that by raising
the cases of little-known political prisoners and demanding
releases, Clinton ``can send a clear signal that China must clean
up its act if it wants to play on the world stage.''
	   It also asked him to urge Chinese authorities not to intimidate
dissidents.
	   Amnesty released a list of 50 dissidents who have been harassed
since the beginning of the year, and said 15 of them are still
detained or otherwise restricted. It warned some may be sentenced
to prison ``when the publicity surrounding the summit has died
down.''
	   Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Tang Wenchang on Monday
submitted the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for deliberation and approval, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   China has signed the agreement, but the legislature has not yet
ratified it.

U.S. and other diplomats leave Belarus for consultations 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from the United States and six
other nations prepared to leave Belarus on Monday after being
recalled to their capitals for consultations over the government's
attempt to evict them from a diplomatic compound.
	   The dispute is the latest sign of conflict in Belarus' relations
with the West and, increasingly, its onetime allies in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
	   In addition to U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, the ambassadors
from Britain, France, Greece, Italy, Germany and Poland were
leaving on Monday afternoon.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it has sent
Boris Berezovsky, a Kremlin emissary responsible for relations with
the former Soviet republics, to Minsk to meet with Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
It did not say what was on Berezovsky's agenda.
	   Belarusian authorities have been trying to force ambassadors out
of their homes in a wooded compound on the outskirts of Minsk,
claiming the residences are badly in need of sewer and plumbing
repairs.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
compound to force the ambassadors out and had ditches dug inside
the compound's gates, which prevented cars from entering.
	   The ambassadors say the order to leave violates the Vienna
Convention, which designates homes of ambassadors as territory of
their countries.
	   Lukashenko has claimed the diplomatic residences as his own
property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or plots on which
to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko has canceled a trip to Switzerland that had been
scheduled for Thursday, the Interfax news agency said. It did not
say why he had decided not to travel.

General, four other officers arrested in Korean draft scandal 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The South Korean army's adjutant
general and three other officers have been arrested in a burgeoning
draft scandal that has rocked the nation, the Defense Ministry said
Monday.
	   In announcing the arrests, the ministry released a list 400
people it said were under investigation on suspicion of taking or
giving bribes to keep the sons of wealthy or influential parents
out of the military.
	   The list named 267 civilians and 133 army officers, including
seven active-service army generals and six retired generals.
	   The seven included Kil Hyong-bo, a four-star general in charge
of an army corps defending Seoul, and Lee Nam-sin, head of the
military spy agency, the Defense Security Command.
	   The ministry's chief legal officer, Park Sun-ki, said the
disclosure of the list was ordered by President Kim Dae-jung to
``root out widespread draft-related corruption.''
	   The scandal surfaced in early May when warrant officer Won
Yong-su, 53, an army recruiter assigned to the Military Manpower
Administration, was arrested on bribery charges.
	   The ministry said Won accepted bribes to either exempt draftees
from service or find them cushy jobs in the military, then passed
some of the money on to superiors.
	   A subsequent investigation found that Brig. Gen. Ha Young-po,
the army's adjutant general, and three field-grade officers who
served as Won's supervisors had received bribes from Won. All have
been arrested in recent days.
	   The adjutant general admitted receiving 15 million won (dlrs
10,700) from Won, ministry officials said.
	   Several memo books seized from Won name 400 army officers,
former legislators, lawyers, college professors and other wealthy
people who allegedly took or gave bribes between January 1995 and
March 1998, they said.
	   A check on Won's 225 bank accounts found that a total of 4.04
billion won (dlrs 2.8 million) were deposited in his name during
the period, ministry officials said.
	   One civilian, identified by local newspapers as a college
professor, allegedly gave Won 42 million won (dlrs 30,000) in
bribes to get his son exempted from military service.
	   Avoidance of the draft by well-connected sons of politicians or
business leaders is sharply resented by most Koreans, many of whom
retain vivid memories of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   All able-bodied South Korean men above the age of 20 must serve
in the military for 26 months. Many view the service as one of
their constitutionally required ``sacred national duties.''
	   But there have been widespread suspicions that wealthy and
influential upper-class people put pressure or pay bribes to keep
their sons out of the military.
	   In the 1992 presidential campaign, the then ruling party
candidate, Lee Hoi-chang, saw his popularity nose dive after
opponents alleged that his two sons had dodged the draft. He lost
the election by a narrow margin.
	   According to ministry officials, the warrant officer, in many
cases, gave part of his bribes to military doctors to disqualify
able-bodied draftees.
	   Military doctors either altered medical records or even
fabricated or swapped X-ray films to disqualify certain draftees,
they said.

Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Russian deputy foreign minister in
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russia pressed Monday for an end to
Kosovo violence, but heavy fighting has broken out for control of
two key roads in the secessionist province, where the Yugoslav army
seems to be playing an increasing part in the violence.
	   Russia's foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed in Moscow to
fellow members of the five-nation Contact Group to give Serbia more
time to pull back its estimated 45,000 to 50,000 security forces in
Kosovo and to resume negotiations with ethnic Albanians, who
outnumber Serbs in the province nine to one.
	   A Primakov deputy, Nikolai Afanyevsky, met in Pristina Monday
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged he would resume
talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his forces, saying they
battle terrorists.
	   The Albanians say they cannot negotiate while soldiers and
police loyal to Milosevic crack down on the militant separatists of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the process killing civilians and
driving tens of thousands of Albanians from home.
	   ``We, as well as the European Union, condemn terrorism,''
Afanyevsky said, urging Serbia also to do what it can to create
safety for refugees to return to their houses.
	   ``It's not enough to bring in bricks and cement,'' he said.
``You have to create secure conditions.''
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians.
	   Soldiers of the Serb-led Yugoslav army seem to be playing an
increasing role, not only securing Kosovo's border with Albania to
prevent guns being smuggled in to KLA militants, but also
supporting police battling the separatists in Kosovo's interior.
	   Associated Press reporter Paul Geitner saw an army tank and two
anti-aircraft guns parked right on the road from Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, to the southwestern city of Prizren Sunday. There was no
sign of actual fighting, but the road showed track marks of heavy
equipment passing recently.
	   Two Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro,
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation _ said they
defected from the army because of orders to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' Fahrudin Muric, one of the two, told Associated
Press Television when interviewed in the northeastern Albanian town
of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We were told to catch everyone who could not defend themselves
and then either kill them or take them to prison,'' said the other
defector, Fahrudin Avdic.
	   Bill Foxton, Bajram Curri reprenstative for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the two would be taken to
Tirana ``very soon,'' and their request for asylum, in a neutral
country, considered.
	   Sources affiliated with both Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants said the two sides were battling for control of the main
east-west and north-south arteries.
	   Fighting reportedly raged near the east-west road Sunday 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. The
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said four Albanians were
wounded. The Serbs said Albanians killed an 18-year-old Serb
villager.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army forces
had opened fire on three villages in the south, sending civilians
fleeing to nearby woods.
	   ``It's a veritable state of war,'' spokesman Ali Sadriu said of
the situation along the north-south road near Stimlje, linking
Pristina to Prizren.
	   The reports could not be independently verified.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille. Hospital officials said Monday his condition had not
changed.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard told reporters. ``He is
still in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German and had been arrested. In all, 93 Germans and
three French were detained by police, the Interior Ministry said
Monday.
	   Six Germans detained during the clashes with police before and
after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   But the vast majority were detained for drunkenness, the
ministry said, and would be released later Monday.
	   Bruno Travade, spokesman for the French World Cup organizing
committee, described Sunday's violence as ``cold and gratuitous.''
	   ``For the organized groups that struck in Lens in a premeditated
and calculated manner the World Cup is only a pretext. The true
fans are in the stadium,'' he said at a news conference Monday in
Paris.
	   FIFA's World Cup organizing committee was holding an emergency
meeting in Paris to discuss security in the wake of the violence.

Myanmar university where 1996 unrest began resumes some classes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Classes have resumed after a 1 1/2-year
suspension at the engineering institute where student unrest in
1996 led to the closing of the country's universities, students
said Monday.
	   Classes for final-year students at the Yangon Institute of
Technology resumed last Thursday after authorities mailed notices
of the reopening to students. More than 700 students there are
expected to sit for their final examinations in July.
	   Classes for final-year medical students in the capital resumed
in May, and they are now taking their final exams.
	   It was not known when other educational activities would resume.
	   All universities and colleges in Yangon were closed indefinitely
during the December 1996 unrest.
	   Educational institutions in other parts of the country,
unaffected by the unrest, continued their classes and held their
1997 final examinations.
	   They did not, however, reopen for the following school year.
	   In February, a spokesman for the military government of Myanmar,
also called Burma, said it might reopen universities within six
months.
	   Reopening the universities would be important to Myanmar's
struggling economy and the government's image abroad, where its
military regime has been widely condemned for human rights abuses
and the stifling of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi's
pro-democracy movement.
	   However, students have spearheaded most political protest
movements in Myanmar since before World War II, when it was a
British colony, and the government highly values stability and
order.
	   The 1996 protests began when police reportedly beat some
students from the Rangoon Institute of Technology involved in a
dispute with a restaurant owner.
	   The demonstrators demanded more civil liberties and took their
protests to the streets, where they eventually clashed with riot
police.
	   Suu Kyi denied any involvement with the student leaders, though
the government said several had contacts with her lieutenants.
	   The closure has further delayed the education of the generation
of students who followed the street protests of 1988, which were
bloodily crushed by troops and resulted in the closure of
universities and high schools from 1988 to 1991. Many of the
students involved in the 1996 unrest were in their first or second
year of university and already in their mid-20s.
	   The government official who spoke in February said the
universities were being ``upgraded'' to handle the expected
doubling of the normal student population due to the closure.

Philippine shares, peso close lower on Japan woes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with peso weakening further in afternoon trading
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell Monday,
dragged down by continuing concerns over the faltering Japanese
economy, analysts said.
	   The peso also fell against the dollar on strong demand for the
U.S. currency after the disappointing results of a weekend meeting
of officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations and
Asian nations, dealers said.
	   The absence of a concrete plan to bolster the sagging Japanese
economy after the meeting worried investors, analysts said.
	   ``We were expecting significant news from Japan over the
weekend. But no complete plan to revive the Japanese economy was
introduced,'' said Astro del Castillo, analyst for A and A
Securities.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.02 points,
or 3 percent, to 1,689.69 after slumping 4.8 percent Friday.
	   On Thursday, it had risen 6.6 percent, its heftiest gain in four
months, after the United States and Japan sold dollars to halt the
yen's recent decline.
	   ``There was no turnaround in sentiment'' since Friday's fall,
said Ramon Lucas, trader for Kim Eng Securities. ``The economic
policies people were waiting for to restrain the recession in Japan
were nowhere in sight.''
	   Lucas said trading was lackluster, with most investors keeping
to the sidelines until stronger steps are taken by Japan to
jump-start its economy.
	   Del Castillo said another concern is the ability of the incoming
administration of President-elect Joseph Estrada to deal with
worsening economic problems at home.
	   Estrada, who assumes the presidency on June 30, admits he isn't
well versed in economics and says he will rely heavily on his team
of economic managers to steer the economy.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.235 pesos compared
to 40.898 pesos on Friday.
	   The peso's weakening accelerated in the last 30 minutes of
trading, with the local currency hitting its intra-day low of 41.70
pesos per dollar in the last 10 minutes.
	   The peso's steeper decline in afternoon trading was attributed
to dollar demand from foreign fund managers covering their short,
or oversold, positions.
	   The peso is expected to continue to follow the yen's direction
in coming days, traders said.

German hooligans riot in northern France; policeman in coma French organizers, FIFA holding emergency meeting 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with hospital statement on policeman, reaction from
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille. Hospital officials said Monday his condition had not
changed.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard told reporters. ``He is
still in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German and had been arrested. In all, 93 Germans and
three French were detained by police, the Interior Ministry said
Monday.
	   Six Germans detained during the clashes with police before and
after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   But the vast majority were detained for drunkenness, the
ministry said, and would be released later Monday.
	   Bruno Travade, spokesman for the French World Cup organizing
committee, described Sunday's violence as ``cold and gratuitous.''
	   ``For the organized groups that struck in Lens in a premeditated
and calculated manner the World Cup is only a pretext. The true
fans are in the stadium,'' he said at a news conference Monday in
Paris.
	   FIFA's World Cup organizing committee was holding an emergency
meeting in Paris to discuss security in the wake of the violence.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ One worker died and another was seriously
injured when an elevator cable snapped and they fell from the fifth
floor of the former U.S. Embassy in Ho Chi Minh City, the newspaper

Taiwan closes pools to check virus' spread 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Health authorities closed school swimming
pools Monday in hopes it would help curb an intestinal virus that
has already killed 50 children.
	   Authorities will consider whether to reopen the pools on July 1,
and are still debating whether to cancel summer camps and swimming
programs, said Health Department official Hsu Kuo-hsiung.
	   Operators of commercial swimming pools were being asked to bar
children under 12 years old, who are particularly vulnerable to the
enterovirus 71 that has swept through much of the island since
mid-May.
	   In eastern Ilan County, the local government decided to cancel
an international festival of children's arts as a precautionary
measure.
	   Health Department authorities also held a special briefing for
foreign diplomats in Taiwan to assuage the foreign community's
fears about the virus.
	   Parts of the European expatriate school were closed a week early
as a precautionary measure, but other parents opted to keep their
children in classes, a school spokesman said.
	   Anne Breiter, a spokeswoman for the American Institute in
Taiwan, Washington's de facto embassy here, said no special health
advisory has been issued to Americans in Taiwan. American children
leaving the island are going on summer holiday as usual rather than
fleeing the virus, she said.
	   No foreigners have been diagnosed with the virus.
	   A particularly virulent strain of the intestinal virus that
strikes Taiwan each summer, enterovirus 71 has left another 241
children hospitalized in serious condition, the Health Department
said.
	   Parents have been advised to avoid taking children out in public
and to ensure they wash often to fend off the virus, whose early
symptoms resemble the flu, with fever, headache or vomiting.
	   Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet
can also develop. Later, possible deadly complications can include
encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflammation of the heart
muscle.

U.S. sanctions likely to hit Indian power sector 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ U.S. anti-nuclear sanctions will make
credit more expensive for entrepreneurs in the Indian power sector
and perhaps force them to look for non-American business partners,
according to news reports Monday.
	   The sanctions imposed on both India and Pakistan because of the
countries' nuclear weapons tests last month officially came into
force last Friday. Among other steps, the Export-Import Bank of the
United States is banned from issuing loans and other financing help
to Indian and Pakistani companies who want to buy from U.S.
exporters.
	   U.S. exports make up 70 to 80 percent of all the equipment being
used in Indian power plants, and much of the sales are financed by
the Export-Import Bank, Harry Dhaul, director general of the
Independent Power Producers Association of India, was quoted as
telling Dow Jones News Wires.
	   Export-Import projects approved before May 13, when the
sanctions were first announced, were not affected, but the bank
cannot do any new business until the U.S. Congress lifts the
sanctions. India was one of the top five countries receiving U.S.
investment guarantees, benefiting from an average of dlrs 300
million annually in such support.
	   Alternative funding may not be easy to find, Dhaul said. Private
institutions will charge higher interest, and expenses also are
likely to go up as projects are delayed while new sources of money
are sought.
	   ``If they do it fast, it may not cost much, but if there are
delays, there will be cost escalation and this will have to be
passed on to consumers,'' Dhaul said.
	   India's Economic Times newspaper reported that Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Cogentrix is planning to replace its U.S.-based
boiler supplier with a European supplier, believing it would be
easier to arrange financing.
	   Cogentrix officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Cogentrix's 1,000 megawatt power project in Mangalore, 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) south of New Delhi, is one of seven
fast-tract private power projects initiated by India in 1992.

Report: Provincial leader speaks of effort to oust prime minister 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A provincial leader of Malaysia's
governing party has spoken of a move within the party to organize
street protests to demand Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ouster,
a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Chief Minister Sanusi Junid of northern Kedah state told an
annual convention of the United Malays National Organization on
Sunday that a leader had spoken of plans for party lawmakers to
meet Mahathir soon to demand his resignation, the Star daily said.
	   ``The UMNO leader who is in this hall right now also said 30
members of Parliament would soon meet Dr. Mahathir to ask him to
step down,'' Sanusi was quoted as saying in his speech. He later
looked around and said that the leader he was referring to was
absent, the Star said.
	   Sanusi said that would have been followed by protests by
university students. He did not name the leader who had spoken
about it, nor was it clear how he knew about these plans.
	   Sanusi could not be reached for comment.
	   During the convention that ended Sunday, Mahathir staved off
criticisms of government corruption and attempted to douse
speculation that there were differences between him and his
anointed deputy, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir, 72, has led Malaysia for 17 years and his UMNO party
has overwhelming popular support in the absence of an effective
parliamentary opposition.
	   While Mahathir is not facing a direct leadership challenge, he
was dogged by accusations of government corruption, nepotism and
cronyism at the party convention.

Warsaw's main station closed as broken water pipe floods tracks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw's Central Station was closed Monday
and all trains were rerouted after a leak in the city water system
flooded rail tracks.
	   A 90-centimeter (37 inch) water pipe broke Sunday night,
flooding and damaging the tracks about a kilometer (a mile)
southwest of the busy station.
	   All inter-city and local trains were rerouted to other Warsaw
stations and the railroad provided buses to transport passengers
there. The damage caused traffic disruption and train delays of up
to 30 minutes, the state railroad said.
	   Railroad officials issued a statement Monday saying full traffic
at the Central Station should be restored by next Sunday.
	   The damage occurred a day after train engineers ended a four-day
strike that had idled more than half the nation's trains.

Complicated coalition talks begin at Prague Castle 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led after talks begin at 1200GMT
By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel will
probably ask Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman to try and form the
next government when coalition talks open at Prague Castle Monday,
the president's spokesman said.
	   Zeman's party came out on top in the weekend's early
parliamentary elections with 32.3 percent of the vote. But this
leaves them far short of a parliamentary majority necessary to form
a government, and looking for partners on a bitterly deadlocked and
divided political scene.
	   Beginning at 2 p.m. (1200GMT) Monday, Havel was scheduled to
meet individually with Zeman, as well as ex-premier Vaclav Klaus,
who leads the Civic Democratic Party that placed second in the
vote. Also invited were Jan Ruml, leader of the Freedom Union, and
Josef Lux, who heads the Christian Demcorats.
	   The Communist party, which also cleared the 5 percent hurdle
necessary for representation in the lower house of parliament was
not invited to Havel's coalition negotiations.
	   Talks between party leaders late into Sunday night produced no
indicators of what a future coalition might look like.
	   Ladislav Spacek, spokesman for Havel, told Czech radio Monday
the president planned to ask the Social Democrats to try and form a
government.
	   It will be tough. Zeman's party earned 74 of the 200 seats in
the lower house of parliament. His bitter rival Klaus controls 63
seats, after winning 27.7 percent of the vote in a strong comeback
from his ouster over a party finance scandal last winter.
	   Both Klaus and Zeman have said they rule out a ``grand
coalition'' between their parties. This leaves the Freedom Union
and the Christian Democrats as possible partners for the Social
Democrats.
	   To tangle things more, Zeman has said he won't join up with the
Freedom Union.
	   Overnight Sunday, the leaders of the Freedom Union and the
Christian Democrats met.
	   ``We have many things in common with Mr. Lux, except for one _
we will not go into a government with the Social Democrats,'' CTK
news agency quoted Ruml as saying afterwards.
	   This would leave only the Christian Democrats to join with
Zeman's party in a minority coalition _ an option Zeman seems to
favor, but which would leave the Czech Republic with the same weak
government it had after the last elections in 1996, when Klaus'
three-party center-right coalition fell one short of a majority.
	   ``A two-party coalition of the Social Democrats and the
Christian Democrats would be a solution that would bring stability
to the country,'' Zeman said late Sunday.
	   The weekend's elections were called two years ahead of schedule,
Klaus' government collapsed in December 1997, triggered by the
departure of the Christian Democrats, and a cabinet of technocrats,
led by banker Jozef Tosovsky, had ruled since.
	   Should the Social Demcorats fail to form a government, Klaus
could be asked to do so. But a center-right coalition would require
Lux and Klaus putting aside personal animosities.
	   ``I think that with the current Civic Democratic Party and its
current policy, it would be very difficult,'' Lux told Pravo daily.

its slipping currency for the sake of stability in Asia, as the yen
weakened against the U.S. dollar.
	   Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng urged Japan and the United
States to prop up the yen, warning that failure to do so could
cause renewed upheaval in the economically shaky region.
	   ``We hope to see Japan and the United States making continual
efforts to prevent the yen from falling further,'' Shi said. ``We
hope Japan as a big country will take a responsible attitude and
play a stabilizing rather than destabilizing role.''
	   The comments, made at a news conference, came as last week's
market intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Japanese
central bank appeared to be wearing off. The dollar traded at
138.54 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market late Monday, up
3.57 yen from late Friday.
	   China's policy of maintaining the value of its currency, the
yuan, at a stable rate has given its leaders the opportunity to
criticize Japan and to portray Beijing as the more responsible
power in Asia.
	   Shi said Chinese leaders hoped that decision would be rewarded
during President Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week,
perhaps by an easing of U.S. conditions for China's long-sought
entry into the World Trade Organization.
	   He reiterated his government's pledge not to devalue the yuan to
make Chinese exports more competitive.
	   Yuan stability, he said, ``is a precondition for future growth''
and crucial for the health of Hong Kong's economy.
	   Sun Zhenyu, trade vice minister, denied that China had
threatened to devalue the yuan to force Japan and the United States
to take action.
	   The dollar's surge to a peak value of 146 yen last week, before
the U.S. and Japanese central banks intervened, came amid signs
that China's economy was slowing further.
	   China's exports grew 8.6 percent in the first five months of
1998, but declined 1.5 percent in May _ the first fall in 22
months. Actually realized foreign investment in the January-May
period dipped 1.5 percent.
	   Despite the difficulty in maintaining growth in exports and
foreign investment, Shi was confident China would achieve its
target of 8 percent economic growth this year, mainly through its
own efforts.
	   The government has called for about dlrs 1 trillion in
investment over the next three years in new projects to spur job
creation and consumer spending. On Sunday, the government announced
it would increase export tax rebates to help boost exports.
	   Shi said China hoped Clinton's visit would lead to some
agreements on trade and financing _ perhaps for aircraft and power
plants.
	   China would like to see Clinton relax or gradually phase out
restrictions on U.S. exports of sensitive technology. Beijing
argues that those limits have driven up its trade surplus with the
United States to dlrs 49.7 billion in 1997, second only to Japan's.
	   At the same time, Shi said, ``we want to emphasize that the
Chinese government acknowledges the political sensitivity of the
trade deficit in the United States and that it is working to
increase imports.''

Indian prime minister wants talks on Kashmir, but one-on-one 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee renewed calls to discuss Kashmir with neighbor and rival
Pakistan, but said Monday he wanted no outside interference in the
territorial dispute that some fear could spark nuclear war in South
Asia.
	   ``Voices for third-party mediation are being heard,'' he was
quoted by local news agency United News of India as saying in the
northern town of Shimla. ``With our common experience of
colonialism, we should be cautious of such attempts to
internationalize problems in the region.''
	   While India fears being pressured by outsiders, Pakistan wants
mediation to overcome a perceived disadvantage in one-one-one talks
with its larger and more powerful neighbor.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
gained independence from Britain in 1947. The Himalayan territory
is divided between them, and both claim it in its entirety.
	   A series of nuclear weapons tests by both nations last month
sparked concern that their long-standing rivalry would lead to
nuclear war. Both sides have stressed the need for conciliation and
negotiation in recent days, but have been unable to agree on a time
and place for talks.
	   ``We view the bilateral framework of dialogue to be useful not
only for discussing Kashmir and other issues, but also all
necessary confidence-building measures to allay apprehensions of a
nuclear arms race in our region,'' Vajpayee was quoted as saying
Monday.

U.S. and other diplomats leave Belarus for consultations representatives. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from British ambassador, EU
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from the United States and six
other nations prepared to leave Belarus on Monday after being
recalled to their capitals for consultations over the government's
attempt to evict them from a diplomatic compound.
	   The dispute is the latest sign of conflict in Belarus' relations
with the West and, increasingly, with its onetime allies in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
Drozdy diplomatic compound and had ditches dug inside the
compound's gates, which prevented cars from entering.
	   British Ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce told the Foreign Ministry
on Monday that the European Union ``categorically objects to the
disconnection of the water supply, electricity and telephones, and
also the refusal to allow diplomats' vehicles to enter the Drozdy
territory,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   She informed the ministry that the EU ambassadors would be
instructed to return to Minsk ``in order to pass on in an
unambiguous way the European Union's attitude toward the Belarusian
authorities' latest actions.''
	   In addition to Pearce and U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, the
ambassadors from France, Greece, Italy, Germany and Poland were
leaving on Monday afternoon.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it has sent
Boris Berezovsky, a Kremlin emissary responsible for relations with
the former Soviet republics, to Minsk to meet with Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
It did not say what was on Berezovsky's agenda.
	   Belarusian authorities have been trying to force ambassadors out
of their homes in a wooded compound on the outskirts of Minsk,
claiming the residences badly need of sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   The ambassadors say the order to leave violates the Vienna
Convention, which designates homes of ambassadors as territory of
their countries.
	   Lukashenko has claimed the diplomatic residences as his own
property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or plots on which
to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko has canceled a trip to Switzerland that had been
scheduled for Thursday, the Interfax news agency said. It did not
say why he had decided not to travel.

Japan economy can grow 2.5 percent a year over next 5 yrs, panel says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy will grow at an average annual rate
of 2.5 percent over the next five years, an economic advisory group
said in a report released Monday.
	   The Economic Council, which advises Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, also said Japan's unemployment rate, now above 4
percent, will stop rising in fiscal 2003, which ends in March 2004.
	   The growth estimate assumes the government will fix the bad loan
mess at Japanese banks soon and carry out planned changes in the
tax and pension systems. The forecast also assumes the government
will implement measures to boost consumer demand.
	   Hashimoto's government has promised to come up with a plan to
clean up the 76 trillion yen (dlrs 554 billion) in bad loans
dragging down the financial system by mid-July. The government has
already begun a series of reforms to its financial system designed
to make markets here more competitive, and Hashimoto has promised
to lower corporate taxes and to make income taxes more ``fair.''
	   The economic panel also forecast Japan's current account surplus
will stop expanding. The surplus is on pace to reach a record this
year as a decline in the yen against the dollar has led to falling
imports into Japan while its exporters continue to expand overseas
sales.

Chernobyl reactor restarted 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The only functioning reactor at the
Chernobyl nuclear plant was restarted Monday and will gradually be
brought to full capacity, officials said.
	   Chernobyl's No. 3 reactor was shut down on June 16 for repairs
linked to an unspecified malfunction in one of its turbine
generators. Plant officials said there were no radiation leaks.
	   The reactor was restarted before dawn Monday, said the state
Energoatom company, which runs Ukraine's nuclear power plants.
	   Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident. Another reactor was shut
down after being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not
operational.
	   Reactor No. 3, which has been undergoing repairs since last
July, was restarted in mid-May.
	   Ukraine has pledged to close the ill-fated plant by 2000, but
wants dlrs 1.2 billion in international aid first to build two new
reactors to compensate for Chernobyl's lost energy and find new
jobs for its workers.

Report: Nigeria's new military leader been meeting Abiola 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader has been
holding secret talks with the country's best-known political
prisoner, who was also the apparent winner of 1993's presidential
elections, a Lagos newspaper has reported.
	   The first meeting between Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar and Moshood
Abiola happened just hours after Abubakar was sworn in following
the death of Nigeria's former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
well-regarded Guardian newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The details of their talks were not revealed, though Abubakar
reportedly told Abiola that the issue of his detention would be
``resolved'' soon.
	   Abiola, a once-wealthy businessman whose business empire reached
across Nigeria, has been imprisoned since 1994, when he declared
himself president to commemorate the anniversary of the annulled
elections he is believed to have won.
	   Since then, his empire has largely collapsed.
	   One of Abiola's wives, Kudirat, was killed in 1996. She was an
outspoken critic of Abacha, who took power in a 1993 coup.

TV channel's uncensored debate provokes cheers and anger by Arabs

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ In the conservative oil-rich
Persian Gulf, television stations air a lot of dull footage
praising the countries' rulers and showing them shaking hands and
cutting ribbons.
	   But on one channel, Arabs can now watch fiery debates in which
Saudi Arabia is labeled oppressive and corrupt, Kuwait is described
as part of Iraq _ soon to be reunited with its fearsome neighbor _
and Islam is blamed for the Arab world's lack of progress.
	   Qatar's al-Jazeera all-news channel, which features interviews
with exiled opposition leaders and debates on touchy subjects like
Islamic fundamentalism and human rights abuses, has captivated a
growing legion of viewers but upset the region's leaders.
	   ``Al-Jazeera has shaken Arab society. It is a political and
democratic earthquake. People love it and trust it,'' says
Abdul-Bari Atwan, editor-in-chief of the London-based
Arabic-language daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi.
	   Though the Gulf seems an odd place for such a liberal channel,
Qatar has been full of surprises since maverick Sheik Hamad bin
Khalifa Al Thani took over the tiny gas-rich state by overthrowing
his father in 1995.
	   He first dismayed his neighbors by establishing trade ties with
Israel. Then he scrapped the information ministry, which censors
the media.
	   When Kuwait's information minister was sent to Qatar last year
to complain about an al-Jazeera program in which the Kuwaiti ruling
family was insulted, he was told that the channel is autonomous _
sparking a diplomatic row between the two neighbors.
	   Since al-Jazeera opened in November 1996, it has grabbed viewers
from the Cable News Network, British Broadcasting Corp. and Arabic
channels.
	   Exact viewer figures aren't available, but the channel is
accessible to 60 percent of homes in the region, according to the
Dubai-based Pan Arab Research Center.
	   The station has not spared Qatar, despite a dlrs 137 million
grant from the Qatari government. It has shown jailed dissidents
accusing the government of torture and aired criticism of Qatar for
hosting an economic conference attended by Israel.
	   Though other satellite channels have started airing more lively
debates in an effort to win back viewers, none dare go as far as
al-Jazeera.
	   The channel's programs have debated whether Muslim militants are
justified and whether U.S. troops belong in such gulf states as
Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
	   In a recent program on democracy, a Bahraini opposition figure
in a flowing white robe described gulf governments as oppressive.
	   ``We should have elected parliaments. The opinion of 20 million
gulf Arabs ... should be heard. There is no free press here. In
fact, if I said any of these things anywhere else but on this
station, I would go to prison,'' said Majeed al-Alawi.
	   While some callers agreed with al-Alawi, others supported his
rival in the televised debate, Fahd al-Harthy, a member of the
Saudi consultative council who argued Western-style democracy is
un-Islamic.
	   Al-Jazeera has been accused of being pro-Iraqi, pro-Israeli, an
agent of the British, a pawn of Qatar's government and a host of
other sins. The channel takes the criticism as proof of its
objectivity.
	   Zaki Farsi, a Saudi engineer, last year joined many
Western-educated Arabs in switching from CNN to al-Jazeera. Now he
gets together every Tuesday night with a dozen friends to watch and
then debate al-Jazeera's most controversial show, ``The Opposite
Direction.''
	   Farsi likens the channel's impact to American television
coverage of the Vietnam war, which changed the way most Americans
viewed that conflict and led to the U.S. pullout from Vietnam.
	   ``In five years, governments will be dealing with a completely
different society. People now look differently at the world around
them. It has made a concept that is not part of our culture _
debate _ a part of our lives,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Saudi Arabia.

Japan pledges quick fix to recession-hit economy 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ With expectations focused on Japan to
revive its ailing economy and ease the regional slump, Tokyo
pledged again Monday to do its part.
	   Japanese trade minister Mitsuo Horiuchi told his U.S.
counterpart Charlene Barshefsky he hoped Japan's 16 trillion yen
(dlrs 118.5 billion) stimulus package and tax cuts would boost the
recession-hit economy, said Atsuo Shibota, a top Japanese trade
official.
	   Separately, a senior Japanese official told The Associated Press
that Japan did feel pressured to support its neighbors, ``but we
are trying to do all we can do.''
	   Horiuchi added that the fiscal measures would help reduce
Japan's surplus in trade with the United States, which has risen 41
percent since last May, Shibota told reporters after the two trade
ministers met. It also has climbed for 20 straight months.
	   Japan's overall trade surplus has surged 67 percent since May
1997. Its economy now has contracted for two consecutive quarters,
meaning it is officially considered in recession. Its banks are a
wreck and the yen has plummeted.
	   Horiuchi's closed-door session with Barshefsky was one of
several meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting that began Monday.
	   Sources said Barshefsky told Horiuchi she had ``serious
concerns'' as to whether Japan's stimulus package would be
sufficient to cure its economic ills.
	   Japan ``must, in addition, apply physical stimulus measures, as
well as dealing appropriately with the banking sector, deregulate
and open its economy,'' Barshefsky told reporters after the
meeting.
	   ``The United States has reiterated time and again Japan must be
an engine of growth for Asia,'' said Barshefsky. ``These APEC
meetings are a test of Japan's willingness to do just that.''
	   APEC's 18 members have met to discuss lifting trade barriers on
nine industries representing dlrs 1.5 trillion of world trade among
the member economies.
	   The United States and New Zealand are pushing for specific dates
and amounts of tariff reductions in all nine industries _ known as
early voluntary liberalization sectors _ while Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan are calling for more emphasis on the APEC principals of
voluntarism and flexibility in liberalizing ``sensitive''
industries, particularly fish and forests.
	   Barshefsky told Horiuchi she was ``very concerned'' about
progress in the APEC trade talks, Shibota said.
	   He said Horiuchi replied that ``EVSL depends on voluntarism.
Flexibility has to be permitted, otherwise it's going to be very
difficult for some countries to participate.''

Chancellor says violence a ``scandal for our nation'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl sharply condemned
German hooligans who fought street battles with police around
Germany's World Cup match with Yugoslavia. He said the incident was
``a scandal for our nation.''
	   A 44-year-old French police officer, Daniel Nivel, was in a coma
after being beaten by hooligans in Lens, France, minutes after
Germany's 2-2 tie with Yugoslavia.
	   The man who attacked Nivel was identified as a German, and was
in police custody. In all, 93 Germans and three French were
detained by police, French officials said. Six Germans were
immediately deported.
	   Kohl said the matter should be handed over immediately to the
courts, either French or German.
	   He called the violence ``modern vandalism'' that damaged
international tournaments.
	   ``I cannot condemn this strongly enough,'' Kohl said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin used an address to the
nation on Monday, the 57th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of
Russia, to warn of a growing neo-Nazi movement in the country.
	   The ideologues of Nazi Germany regarded Russia's people as
subhuman, suitable for nothing more than manual labor to serve the
Third Reich.
	   Yet over the last few months, Moscow has seen an increasing
number of racist attacks by skinheads, drawing attention to a small
but violent neo-fascist movement.
	   ``Half a century ago, our country saved the world from
fascism,'' Yeltsin said in his radio address. ``But today, it is
raising its head in Russia, stupefying our youth.''
	   Often poorly educated and without hope of finding good work,
some disaffected youth blame racial and religious minorities for
their troubles, and call for a ``strong hand'' to restore Russia's
prosperity.
	   ``Under the cover of fine words about the revival of Russia, of
its national spirit, they are again looking for an enemy _ to
humiliate, to lock away in prisons, to shoot,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Although figures are inconclusive, both neo-Nazis and human
rights groups estimate that Moscow has about 4,000 neo-fascists,
mostly young males. And they are becoming more active.
	   Last month, a bomb exploded at an Orthodox synagogue in the
capital, injuring two people and causing extensive damage; Jewish
leaders blamed fascist groups. A black American Marine was badly
beaten by four skinheads at an outdoor market.
	   ``I am worried that not everybody is aware of the reality of the
threat of extremism in Russia today,'' Yeltsin said. ``But it's
there. And it's very dangerous for society.''
	   ``Our common duty to the memory of the victims of fascism is not
to allow the rebirth of the `plague of the 20th century,''' he
said. ``We have no right to betray those who already defeated that
terrible evil once.''
	   In a May survey conducted among 6,000 people across Russia, the
Institute for the Sociology of Parliamentarism found that 11
percent of Russians think that fascists could come to power in
Russia in coming years. Some 5 percent of adult Russians regard the
activity of pro-fascist organizations in Russia ``more or less''
positively, the survey said, according to the Interfax news agency.
The survey had a 3 percent margin of error.
	   Earlier Monday, Yeltsin laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier near Red Square.
	   ``Looking at the eternal flame, I remembered how young boys were
running away to the front, how the mailman brought a death
notification to my neighbors,'' Yeltsin said in his radio address.
``That is difficult to forget.''
	   ``There are dates in history that are painful to remember,'' he
said. ``But they must not be forgotten.''

Most Asian markets close lower

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Monday, with the
key index in Hong Kong slumping 4.5 percent as investors dumped
stocks in the absence of a firm plan by Japan to bolster its
economy.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar soared against the Japanese yen. The
dollar was quoted at 138.54 yen in late afternoon, up 3.57 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.10 yen Friday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 387.70 points, closing at 8,204.21.
	   Brokers said investors were disappointed that Japan had not come
up with any measures to boost its faltering currency and economy
after world finance officials, including Deputy U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, met in Tokyo over the weekend.
	   The yen's slide in recent weeks rocked Asian financial markets
by stirring concerns about a possible new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic
turmoil last year.
	   Philippine stocks also tumbled Monday, dragged down by
continuing concerns over the faltering Japanese economy. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 52.02 points, or 3
percent, to 1,689.69.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.235 pesos compared
to 40.898 pesos Friday.
	   Thai shares also fell 3 percent as investors saw little hope of
a short-term recovery in the stagnant Japanese economy. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index lost 8.42 points to 275.90.
	   Malaysian shares fell 2.1 percent because of the continuing
weakness of the Japanese yen.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index lost 10.00
points to 457.61.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index
slumped 2.2 percent, or 24.48 points, to 1,098.45.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
edged up 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 15,309.09. On
Friday, the Nikkei had fallen 93.56 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Attention focused on a dramatic decline in shares of Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan amid rumors, which LTCB denied, about the
bank's health and a possible merger with other institutions.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 126.11 points, or 1.61 percent,
to 7,691.16.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
citing a weaker U.S. share market Friday and a lack of buying
interest locally. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 32.89 points, or
1.6 percent, to 1,942.31.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, supported by a
steady performance from Tokyo's stock market and by a stronger gold
price. The All Ordinaries Index rose 8.00 points, or 0.3 percent,
to 2,596.8.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on worries that the yen could
resume its plunge against the U.S. dollar. The key Korea Composite
Stock Price Index fell 4.48 points, or 1.4 percent, to 311.27.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower in directionless
trading. The Composite Index fell 4.794 points, or 1.1 percent, to
420.659.

Home Secretary condones French hooligan response 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British home secretary Jack Straw said the French
security response of expelling known serious soccer hooligans from
Toulouse before Monday's England game was ``sensible and
proportionate''.
	   Four English hooligans were expelled from France Monday in the
first use of a new World Cup security strategy allowing authorities
to remove known troublemakers without waiting for them to cause
problems.
	   The four were picked up Sunday while drinking in a Toulouse bar
after being recognized by British ``spotter'' police as Class C
hooligan leaders.
	   Speaking on a BBC radio program, Straw said the actions of the
French authorities were ``wise'' and he rejected a suggestion that
English fans were being targeted.
	   ``I think at this stage, given all that happened in Marseille,
this is a sensible and proportionate step and sends out a very
clear signal to the serious hooligans who are going to France
simply to cause trouble,'' he said.
	   The Home Secretary said the latest security measures were a good
example of cooperation between English and French authorities.
	   Straw said some of the serious hooligans had not been placed
under a special prevention order prohibiting them from travelling
abroad for soccer because they had avoided detection.
	   ``That's why the decision of the French police to go for these
Category C people, some of whom who are very serious hooligans but
don't have convictions, is very welcome,'' he said.
	   Shadow Home Secretary Sir Norman Fowler also backed the French
action.
	   ``I think the French authorities are taking action against
football hooligans and football thugs, and I think that that is
right.''
	   ``I think ... the enormity of what took place in Marseille
should not be underplayed and that we should do everything in our
power to prevent English hooligans _ a tiny minority of English
supporters _ going to France and to other overseas countries.''
	   Tim Hollis, the senior British police officer advising the
French authorities, said he strongly supported the line being taken
by the French police.
	   Hollis told the BBC that this was a very ``targeted focus''.
	   ``This is not a sort of large-scale expulsion of fans simply
because they have been drunk and they support England,'' he said.
	   ``That would be wholly unfair to the vast majority of English
fans who are law-abiding and want to support the team.''

Bosnia's first convertible currency put in circulation Monday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led by 1400GMT, after currency distribution begins
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Company bookkeepers in
Muslim-dominated areas of Bosnia were the first to line up Monday
for the mark, the country's new currency and first convertible
coinage.
	   Since Bosnia declared independence in 1992 and descended into
war, four currencies have circulated. The Bosnian Serb half of the
country, in a kind of monetary union with neighboring Yugoslavia,
uses the Yugoslav dinar.
	   Regions under Bosnian Croat control use the Croatian kuna, since
they act as part of Croatia, while areas under Muslim control use
the Bosnian Dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   So, international officials and quarreling local politicians
decided the new currency would be the Convertible Mark, locked
directly to the German mark.
	   It is supposed to improve trade and capital flows between the
Serb and Muslim-Croat halves of Bosnia, act as a uniting factor and
give the country credibility abroad.
	   The official period for exchange is two weeks, extended to three
if necessary.
	   But it was unclear Monday whether any money would be swapped in
the Serb Republic, or Croat-held parts of Bosnia, where officials
suggested hard currency _ not the non-convertible Yugoslav dinar or
Croatian kuna _ would be needed to get the new Bosnian mark.
	   In the largest Serb-held city, Banja Luka, no bookkeeper had yet
appeared Monday at the public payment office to request the new
currency.
	   Officials of Banja Luka's biggest commercial bank, the
Yugoslavia-based Vojvodjanska Banka, also said no one had asked for
the new money.
	   So only counters in Muslim-dominated areas, such as Sarajevo,
got ready to exchange the Bosnian dinar for the new mark Monday
afternoon, when distribution started.
	   Even after distribution ends, businesses can accept the Yugoslav
dinar or Croatian kuna. But taxes and duties will have to be paid
in Bosnian marks.
	   Rajko Tomas, economic adviser to Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic in Banja Luka, said he believed the quality of the new mark
would eventually edge out the dinar and kuna.
	   ``The dinar and the kuna are not convertible currencies and the
dinar is lately very unstable,'' he said.
	   So far, the Bosnian Central Bank has a 130 million (dlrs 73
million) German mark backup for the new currency.
	   The money was printed in France, which donated 7 million marks
(dlrs 3.9 million) for printing and transport.
	   Planning for the Bosnian mark has been in the works for months.
First, ethnic leaders could not agree on a design and argued
whether national symbols should be used.
	   The top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
finally imposed two neutral designs for the two halves of Bosnia.
	   The Bosnian Serb version will have portraits of well-known
Bosnian Serbs and Cyrillic script will dominate.
	   The version used in the federation will have portraits of famous
Croats and Muslims, with Latin letters above the Cyrillic.

Philippine Airlines to hire laid-off Indonesian pilots Friday and union rejecting its condition in grafs 8-10; Airbus source saying PAL will resell aircraft scheduled for delivery and adjust lease terms on other planes in grafs 14-16 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with PAL offering to accept striking pilots up to
By JIM GOMEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines is planning to
hire laid-off Indonesian pilots to replace Filipino pilots who went
on strike and brought the airline close to collapse, an official
said Monday.
	   PAL has sent officials to Jakarta to screen hundreds of pilots
laid off by at least four Indonesian carriers hurt by the
Indonesian rupiah's sharp fall, senior vice president Avelino
Zapanta said.
	   The Indonesian carriers, which together laid off more than 1,000
pilots, include national airline Garuda and Sempati Air. The latter
closed June 1 because of huge financial losses.
	   Zapanta said PAL now has 83 pilots, including some union members
who have returned to work, but needs a total of 200 to handle its
scaled-down operations following the 18-day pilots' strike.
	   He said Indonesian pilots fly the same types of aircraft used by
PAL, which would allow the airline to save on training costs and
time.
	   PAL's 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest
an airline plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years
of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age. The plan put
225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the union says.
	   On Friday, PAL flight attendants and ground personnel threatened
to join the work stoppage, which has pushed Asia's oldest airline
to the brink of closure.
	   PAL chairman and business magnate Lucio Tan urged the two unions
not to strike and pledged not to pursue sanctions against them if
they agree to suspend the terms of existing collective bargaining
agreements for five years. Both unions refused.
	   Zapanta said PAL will accept some striking pilots back this week
if they apply as new employees, an offer rejected by the pilots'
union.
	   Capt. Florendo Umali, a union spokesman, said the strikers will
return to work only if PAL guarantees there will be no sanctions
against them and suspends its plan to retire pilots. Umali said
about 20 strikers have decided to return to work on their own.
	   PAL filed a rehabilitation plan Friday with Manila's Securities
and Exchange Commission, saying it is unable to meet payments on
loans estimated at dlrs 2 billion because of drastically reduced
cash flow.
	   The pilots' strike has cost the company more than 2 billion
pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL says.
	   As part of its rehabilitation plan, the airline says it will lay
off 40 percent of its 13,000-member work force, dispose of 40 of
its 54 planes, suspend more than two-thirds of its routes and sell
some subsidiaries.
	   A source close to French-based Airbus Industrie, one of PAL's
major suppliers, said PAL has agreed to accept delivery of five
A-320 planes it previously ordered but plans to resell them to
another carrier or sell them back to Airbus.
	   The airline had ordered 28 jets from Airbus as part of a dlrs 4
billion modernization program.
	   The Airbus source also said PAL, its financing banks and Airbus
were working to adjust lease terms on the airline's four
A-340-200s.
	   The airline says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ the biggest loss in its
57-year history.

prove a great, almost unbeatable team as soon as it gets a kick of
self-confidence.
	   The 29-year-old charismatic defender, the son of Italy's coach
Cesare Maldini and the team veteran with 90 caps, said that he and
his teammates did not display their real potential in World Cup
play so far.
	   ``We are a great team of great players, with impressive physical
and technical qualities. We must only improve our self confidence
to get a boost ... we must feel great,'' Maldini said Sunday at the
team training camp before a closed-door session in preparation for
Tuesday's crucial Group B match against Austria.
	   Italy, a three-time world champion, struggled to a 2-2 draw in
the first game against Chile. It defeated Cameroon 3-0 next
overcoming a falling-off following the initial goal.
	   ``We have been in trouble against Chile and Cameroon after
failing to score a second, knockout goal. We have been struggling
despite our better technique. We must be more determined,'' the
Italian captain said.
	   Speaking about Tuesday's match against Austria at St. Denis,
Maldini said Italy will play for victory. As Group B winners, Italy
would avoid meeting Group A leader Brazil in the second round.
Chile and Austria are tied with two points with Cameroon at one.
	   ``We are looking forward to a tough match with Austria. We must
not think to be in the second round already. It would be a
dangerous attitude.''

Heroin `cure' creator arrested on drug charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A man who claimed to have developed a
treatment for heroin addiction has been arrested for using opium,
police said Monday.
	   Motivated by the deaths of his brother and father _ both opium
addicts _ Tran Khuong Dan set out to find a cure. In 1991,
confident he had been successful, he began shooting up with heroin
until he was hooked.
	   He said a course of Heantos, his homemade brew of herbs and
roots, cured him.
	   But a police officer, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said Monday that Dan was arrested with three drug
addicts when police raided a house in Hanoi last week, seizing some
600 opium ``balls'' and opium-processing equipment.
	   Heantos won the research backing last year of the United Nations
Development Program and was slated for testing at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine.
	   In December, the Vietnamese Health Ministry banned its continued
testing in private clinics outside the government's control after
an unidentified patient died, allegedly after being administered
with Heantos.
	   But Vietnam's Institute of Chemistry, working alongside Dan,
said the patient had not been given the compound.
	   The Ministry of Health, after several meetings, in February
approved testing on drug addicts but said it must follow strict
scientific procedure.
	   Heantos is a concoction of 15 different kinds of leaves, tree
barks and roots blended into a three-course treatment meant to
break physical addiction to heroin in just three days.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cleanup and repair bill from a powerful
weekend storm will be about 100 million rubles (dlrs 15 million),
city officials said Monday. The death toll rose to nine, with more
than 280 injured.
	   The city deployed thousands of workers to clean up the mess from
the storm, which struck shortly before midnight Saturday. Boris
Nikolsky, a top deputy to Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, told the Interfax
news agency that most of the work should be done within three days.
	   The thunderstorm, bearing near-hurricane force winds, raged for
about 30 minutes, uprooting tens of thousands of trees, smashing
windows and flattening small shops. The Bolshoi Theater, Kremlin
walls and Moskva Hotel near Red Square were all damaged.
	   Interfax quoted the Moscow Ambulance Center as saying that nine
people had been killed and 122 hospitalized as a result of the
storm.
	   Some 160 more people were treated and released, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Interior Ministry troops and regular soldiers were clearing the
debris on Monday, chopping up the trees with axes and and sweeping
glass, fallen branches and wayward construction materials into
piles.
	   More than 8,500 people were involved in the cleanup operation
Sunday, city officials said.
	   Luzhkov said Monday that 48,000 trees had fallen, power lines
were downed in more than 700 places and electric trolley and tram
lines in more than 500 places, and roofs were torn off 1,400 homes.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to the
Moscow weather center.

Report: Unidentified submarine found in South Korean waters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A submerged boat was found entangled
in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast Monday and the
national news agency said it was a North Korean submarine.
	   The Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report by
Yonhap, but an official at the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
said the craft ``looks like a submarine.''
	   ``They found something that looks like a submarine,'' the
official said, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity. ``We
cannot confirm its nationality or anything else.
	   ``We are trying to find out what it is.''
	   Yonhap reported without attribution that the boat was a 70-ton
Yugo class submarine, which normally carries five to six crewmen.
North Korea is known to have a number of such submarines.
	   Yonhap said the boat's periscope was caught in a fishing net
about 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of Sokcho, a coastal town just
south of the North Korean border and about 200 kilometers (125
miles) northeast of Seoul.
	   South Korean military helicopters and navy patrol boats were
sent to the scene.
	   The site is in the general area where a North Korean submarine
ran aground in September 1996, touching off a massive, 53-day
manhunt for its occupants.
	   The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans _
and sent relations between North and South Korea plunging to their
lowest level in years. One North Korean was captured and another
was believed to have escaped back across the border.

Russian presses talks in Kosovo, deserters talk of army days Pristina, deserters talking in Albania of being ordered to kill civilians. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Russian deputy foreign minister in
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russia pressed Monday for an end to
violence in the secessionist Kosovo province, where heavy fighting
has broken out for control of two key and where the Yugoslav army
seems to be playing an increasing role.
	   More than 300 people have died this year since fighting
escalated between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in
the province nine to one.
	   In Moscow, Russia's foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov urged
fellow members of the five-nation Contact Group to give Serbia more
time to pull back its security forces in Kosovo and to resume
negotiations with ethnic Albanians.
	   Primakov deputy Nikolai Afanyevsky met Monday in the provincial
capital of Pristina with a senior Serb official and then with
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to
implement ``as soon as possible'' the agreement reached last week
in Moscow.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to resume talks
with Rugova, but refused to pull back his forces, saying they are
fighting terrorists.
	   The Albanians say they cannot negotiate while soldiers and
police loyal to Milosevic crack down on the militant separatists of
the Kosovo Liberation Army _ killing civilians and driving tens of
thousands of Albanians from home in the process.
	   ``We, as well as the European Union, condemn terrorism,''
Afanyevsky said, urging Serbia also to do what it can to create a
safe environment for refugees to return.
	   ``It's not enough to bring in bricks and cement,'' he said.
``You have to create secure conditions.''
	   Soldiers of the Serb-led Yugoslav army seem to be playing an
increasing role, not only securing Kosovo's border with Albania to
prevent guns being smuggled in to KLA militants, but also
supporting police battling the separatists in Kosovo's interior.
	   Associated Press reporter Paul Geitner saw an army tank and two
anti-aircraft guns parked Sunday on the road from Pristina to the
southwestern city of Prizren. There was no sign of actual fighting,
but the road showed recent track marks of heavy equipment.
	   Two Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro,
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation _ said they
defected from the army because of orders to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' defector Fahrudin Muric told Associated Press
Television in the northeastern Albanian town of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We were told to catch everyone who could not defend themselves
and then either kill them or take them to prison,'' said the other,
Fahrudin Avdic.
	   Bill Foxton, Bajram Curri representative for the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the two would be taken
to Tirana ``very soon,'' where their request for asylum in a
neutral country would be considered.
	   Sources from both the Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants
said the two sides were battling for control of the main east-west
and north-south arteries.
	   Fighting reportedly raged near the east-west road Sunday 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina. The Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center said four Albanians were wounded. The Serbs said
Albanians killed an 18-year-old Serb villager.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army forces
had opened fire on three villages in the south, sending civilians
fleeing to nearby woods.
	   ``It's a veritable state of war,'' spokesman Ali Sadriu said of
the situation along the north-south road near Stimlje, linking
Pristina to Prizren.
	   The reports could not be independently verified.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The election of conservative challenger
Andres Pastrana ended the ruling Liberal Party's 12-year lock on
the Colombian presidency and is likely to improve the image of a
country battered by a drug corruption scandal. With 98 percent of
the vote counted in Sunday's runoff election, the 44-year-old
former Bogota mayor, in his second straight bid for Colombia's
highest office, had won 50.4 percent versus Liberal Horacio Serpa's
46.5 percent. Serpa served as interior minister under outgoing
President Ernesto Samper, who was accused of accepting campaign
contributions from the Cali drug cartel. The scandal crippled
Samper's four-year tenure and likely doomed Serpa's presidential
hopes.
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton should use this week's summit
to urge China to release all political prisoners and recognize
international human rights standards, a rights group said in a
letter to Clinton released Monday. Human Rights in China also
appealed to Clinton to condemn the 1989 military crackdown that
killed hundreds of people when Beijing crushed democracy protests
at Tiananmen Square. Amnesty International urged Clinton to meet
dissidents and relatives of those killed in the crackdown, and to
seek the release of protesters still in prison. Clinton, the first
U.S. president to visit since the crackdown, will be officially
welcomed at Tiananmen Square on Saturday before meeting President
Jiang Zemin.
	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma. Daniel Nivel, a
44-year-old French police officer, was attacked just minutes after
Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia. He was
flown by helicopter to a hospital in the city of Lille. Hospital
officials said Monday his condition had not changed. Regional
Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the officer was a
German and had been arrested. In all, 93 Germans and three French
were detained by police.
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's justice minister and legal advisers
Monday explored ways of holding a referendum on a West Bank troop
withdrawal, a step that would delay a pullback for many months and
was denounced by the Palestinians as a new stalling tactic. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not decided whether to hold a
referendum, which would be a first for Israel and would require
changes in the nation's basic law, which has no provision for a
referendum. The referendum idea appears to run counter to appeals
by the Clinton administration for Netanyahu to quickly accept a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from the United States and six
other nations prepared to leave Belarus on Monday after being
recalled to their capitals for consultations over the government's
attempt to evict them from a diplomatic compound. The dispute is
the latest sign of conflict in Belarus' relations with the West
and, increasingly, with its onetime allies in the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
Drozdy diplomatic compound and had ditches dug inside the
compound's gates, which prevented cars from entering.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Philips, PolyGram shares trading lower.
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of PolyGram, the
world's largest music company, to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs
10.4 billion.
	   The price is below the dlrs 10.6 billion agreed to earlier for
the purchase of PolyGram, the latest conquest for the Canadian
beverage giant in its quest to become an entertainment
conglomerate.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation three years
after it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.
	   Philips announced in May it intended to sell its 75 percent
stake in the Dutch entertainment group PolyGram to the Canadian
liquor giant. The electronics giant said the sale was part of its
strategy to divest non-core activities.
	   Seagram, which will purchase the stake through its subsidiary
Universal Studios Inc. as part of tender offer for all issued
shares, will pay 115 guilders, or dlrs 57, per share.
	   The final agreement, subject to the usual regulatory approval,
calls for Seagram to issue a maximum of about 47.9 million common
shares.
	   Shares of both Philips and PolyGram dropped in early trading
Monday on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Philips was down 1.2
percent to 172 guilders (dlrs 84.70), while PolyGram traded at
107.60 guilders (dlrs 53), down 0.4 percent.

Chief executive freezes land sales, moves to stabilize economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief executive froze sales in Hong Kong's
ailing property market Monday and announced steps to stimulate
business to help the territory through a looming recession.
	   Tung Chee-hwa spoke on Hong Kong TV as the stock market closed
another dismal day. The key Hang Seng index tumbled 4.5 percent and
now is 50 percent below last fall's high. Investors dumped stocks
in the absence of firm plans by regional giant Japan to boost its
economy.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.2 percent. Tung
said more difficulties were ahead this year, including further
increases in unemployment.
	   Economic contraction in the second quarter, which is considered
likely, would technically put Hong Kong's economy in recession.
	   The chief executive said Hong Kong would keep its currency, the
Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the U.S. dollar, maintaining that it
was essential for the territory to keep the confidence of outside
investors.
	   One of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy is real estate,
usually one of Hong Kong's strongest earners.
	   Tung in recent weeks has said that property prices went too high
in the euphoria following the successful transfer to Chinese rule
last year.
	   However, his decision to freeze land sales until the current
fiscal year ends at the end of next March indicated he was
concerned about instability in the property market.
	   In other measures, Hong Kong radio said the government was
returning about 4 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 517 million) to
taxpayers. Another 2 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 208 million)
will be made available to small- and medium-size businesses to help
them secure credit, and more money also will be made available to
help first-time home buyers.
	   Businesses will be able to exempt their profits from taxes if
they keep them in Hong Kong banks, Tung said. Salaries of senior
government officials were frozen.

Report: Unidentified submarine found in South Korean waters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS details
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A partially submerged boat was found
entangled in a fishing net off South Korea's east coast Monday and
the national news agency said it was a North Korean submarine.
	   The Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report by
Yonhap, but an official at the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
said the craft ``looks like a submarine.''
	   ``They found something that looks like a submarine,'' the
official said, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity. ``We

	   ``We are trying to find out what it is.''
	   A short time later, the Joint Chiefs issued a brief press
release saying ``an unidentified craft believed to be a submarine
of unknown nationality'' had been spotted and efforts were under
way to identify it.
	   Yonhap reported without attribution that the boat was a 70-ton
Yugo class submarine, which normally carries five to six crewmen.
North Korea is known to have a number of such submarines.
	   Yonhap said the boat's periscope was caught in a fishing net
about 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of Sokcho, a coastal town just
south of the North Korean border and about 200 kilometers (125
miles) northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set to drift from the stern of a South Korean
fishing vessel, which first spotted the entangled craft and radioed
maritime police and the military.
	   The state-run Korea Broadcasting System said men were seen on
the deck of the entangled craft trying to free it. Yonhap said the
boat was listing and drifting.
	   The Defense Ministry sent four warships and a helicopter to the
scene, KBS reported.
	   The site is in the general area where a North Korean submarine
ran aground in September 1996, touching off a massive, 53-day
manhunt for its occupants.
	   The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans _
and sent relations between North and South Korea plunging to their
lowest level in years. One North Korean was captured and another
was believed to have escaped back across the border.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Virtually every day this month,
along with sacks of wheat, cans of oil and cakes of soap, Red Cross
helicopters have flown a weary-looking man in tennis shoes to the
earthquake-crushed villages of northern Afghanistan.
	   For Dr. Abdul Audir, the visits are as frustrating as they are
depressing. In addition to injuries from the quake, villagers
suffer from malnutrition, worm diseases, eye and skin ailments,
respiratory infections and tuberculosis, illnesses that could be
treated _ if only medical workers could reach them.
	   Audir, a physician at the Faisabad hospital, would like to carry
in antibiotics and painkillers and spend time searching out the
sick, especially among the women sequestered out of sight.
	   But the United Nations and Red Cross have put their priority on
evacuating the very seriously injured and delivering food. Basic
health care will have to wait.
	   ``This is a big problem for me,'' Audir said with a sigh.
``These people need so much care.''
	   The May 30 earthquake struck one of the poorest regions of one
of the most impoverished countries in the world. Quakes, landslides
and floods are so frequent that entire villages have picked up and
moved every few decades to search out surer sources of water, food
and shelter.
	   The chronic want has been compounded by 20 years of war, which
have left Afghanistan with a surfeit of weapons and soldiers, and
practically no government to deal with the misery.
	   Afghanistan has the second highest infant mortality rate in the
world. One in four children dies by age 5, UNICEF says. Seventeen
of every 1,000 women die in childbirth. Few children attend school,
spending their days instead tending goats and cows.
	   ``When you grow up, that's when you learn everything,'' said
Mohamed Esan, a militiaman with four sons and four daughters.
	   And the men?
	   ``You can become a soldier or shopkeeper or subsistence farmer
or smuggler. That's about it,'' said Dr. Panna Erasmus, a child
health specialist with Medical Emergency Relief International who
is working in Faisabad.
	   Militiamen of the Northern Alliance, opponents of the Taliban
movement that controls 85 percent of the country, are in charge of
this region of northern Afghanistan.
	   ``It's been a long time since we've seen our salaries,'' said
Esan, who is commander of the rag-tag contingent guarding the
former Soviet airstrip at Faisabad. ``But the people help us,
giving us food when we need it.''
	   The few locals with trucks that can negotiate the rutted,
boulder-filled road give soldiers lifts. Usually it's enough for
the militiamen to wave the trucks down; sometimes a few shots in
the air are needed to persuade the drivers.
	   Except in the case of disasters like the earthquake,
international aid to Afghanistan has dried to a trickle. The United
Nations' annual appeal for the country has brought pledges totaling
just 13 percent of the dlrs 117 million sought this year, said
Rupert Colville, a U.N. spokesman.
	   War has made donors wary of investing much, and they have agreed
not to begin any major infrastructure projects such as
road-building until there is peace. The Taliban's rough-handed
implementation of its austere interpretation of Islamic law,
including severe restrictions on women's rights, has also dissuaded
donors.
	   The people of Faisabad do have one road to a better life. Under
painted signs reminding the few people in the area who can read
English that the fight against narcotics is an Islamic duty, neatly
tended poppy fields flourish. A 7-kilogram (15-pound) opium harvest
nets farmers about dlrs 800.
	   ``We have no choice but to grow it, because we have a lot of
problems, and who's going to help us?'' asked Nurulab, a father of
seven watching a horde of ragged children who poured into a village
street to stare at a photographer. ``Everyone is in bad shape
economically.''
	   From here, the opium is carried to the former Soviet republic of
Tajikistan, and on into the rest of Central Asia, Russia and the
West.
	   ``Afghans don't smoke it,'' said Saeed Jaylani, a soldier at the
Faisabad airstrip.
	   ``They use the money to buy a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle,
maybe a clock,'' he said, conjuring up a wish list of goods he'll
never have.

Premier demands ministers declare connections with Communist secret police 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's prime minister on Monday
gave his cabinet three days to declare whether they collaborated
with the Communist secret police during the dictatorship of Nicolae
Ceausescu.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile, leaving for a three-day visit to
Poland, said he expects all 26 cabinet members to respond by the
time he returns Thursday, his aide Gabriel Piscociu said.
	   The center-right government, which replaced a Cabinet of
ex-communists in late 1996, has been stunned to find in its ranks
collaborators _ especially from the National Peasants party and
other parties whose leaders were tortured or often killed by the
Communist secret police, also known as the Securitate.
	   Vasile demanded Health Minister Francisc Baranyi resign after he
admitted last week that he was a Securitate agent. He said he was
forced to cooperate and had harmed no one.
	   Finance Minister Daniel Daianu admitted working for Securitate
intelliegnce abroad a few months ago. He has not been asked to
resign.
	   One in four Romanian adults was said to have collaborated with
the Securitate in the Ceausescu era. The Securitate was disbanded
in December 1989 after Ceausescu was executed, but its intrigue
continues to fascinate Romanians.

China's central bank closes down Hainan Development Bank 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In the first closure of a state-owned
bank for lack of funds, China's central bank shut one down on the
southern island of Hainan after it failed to meet deposit demands,
officials said Monday.
	   A spokesman for the People's Bank of China said all assets and
debts held by the Hainan Development Bank would be guaranteed by
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, one of China's four
state-owned commercial banks.
	   Foreign debts held by the bank are also guaranteed, the official
said.
	   He declined to discuss specific problems at the bank, saying an
investigation was under way. ``We are unable to offer an
explanation of what happened at this time,'' he said.
	   Officials at Hainan Development Bank also confirmed the closure.
But they declined further comment, referring all questions to the
central bank.
	   The move marks the first time China has closed a
government-controlled bank for capital inadequacy, banking sources
said.
	   The central bank has closed down two other financial
institutions in recent years. The China Agriculture Trust and
Investment Development Corp., a financial institution originally
responsible for disbursing World Bank loans to China's agricultural
sector, was shuttered because of financial irregularities. A small
credit cooperative in southwestern Guizhou province was closed for
the same reason.
	   In both cases, the institutions' assets and liabilities were
guaranteed by the central bank.
	   The closure of the Hainan Development Bank appears to be the
first shutdown of a bank set up mainly to take individual deposits
and lend to local development projects.
	   After years of lending to unprofitable state enterprises,
China's banking system is technically insolvent. But it continues
to function because of central government guarantees that support
the entire banking system.
	   China has stepped up efforts to improve domestic financial
market regulation and avoid an Asian-style crisis caused by
reckless credit evaluation.
	   Hainan Development Bank was set up in 1995. It has a branch
office in Guangzhou in southern China, and was preparing to open a
new branch office in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, said a
central bank official based in Hainan.
	   The bank's custodian, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, is China's largest bank in terms of assets held. It is to
start disbursing deposits held at the Hainan Development Bank June
30, the central bank said.

President Weizman complains he was misled by Netanyahu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ President Ezer Weizman abruptly withdrew from a
major economic conference after complaining that he had been misled
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the timing of a West
Bank troop withdrawal, Israeli media said Monday.
	   In a meeting at the start of June, Netanyahu told Weizman that
an agreement on a pullback would be signed by mid-June, the Haaretz
daily reported. However, an agreement remains out of reach today.
	   Netanyahu's sincerity has repeatedly been questioned in the
past, with political allies complaining that he made promises he
had no intention of keeping.
	   Weizman and Netanyahu have clashed in the past over the pace of
negotiations with the Palestinians. As president, Weizman has a
largely ceremonial role, but carries great moral weight.
	   The former defense minister played a key role in negotiating the
1979 peace agreement with Egypt and has urged Netanyahu to carry
out the peace accords his predecessors signed with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu has complained that Weizman is overstepping
the authority of his office.
	   On Sunday evening, Weizman was to have opened the annual
economic conference of the Israel Democratic Institute, but decided
at the last minute to stay home.
	   Weizman did not want to deliver the speech because he felt he
would have been compelled to criticize the government over the
deadlock in the peace talks, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Israel, however, has yet to accept
the proposal and Netanyahu has ignored informal deadlines set by
Albright.
	   Just last year, the outspoken president told Albright she should
take Arafat and Netanyahu and ``crack their heads together'' to get
the peace process moving again.

Oil-rich but gas-poor Nigeria sets aside more oil for own use 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Trying to end his country's critical
shortage of gasoline, Nigeria's new military leader has approved an
increase in the amount of crude oil set aside for domestic use.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar announced Sunday that the allocation
for domestic consumption would be increased from 250,000 barrels a
day to 300,000 barrels a day.
	   The government will enter into a long-term arrangement for
offshore processing of about 50,000 barrels a day of Nigerian crude
oil. Under the arrangement, the petroleum products will be
re-imported to augment direct imports and domestic production.
	   Nigeria, the world's sixth largest oil producer, has seen its
refineries crippled by years of neglect, incompetence and
corruption, leaving gas lines sometimes lasting twelve hours or
more.
	   The country, which uses about 18 million liters of gasoline per
day, is only able to refine about 6 milllion liters.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Monday, with the
key index in Hong Kong slumping 4.5 percent as investors dumped
stocks in the absence of a firm plan by Japan to bolster its
economy. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar soared against the Japanese
yen. The dollar was quoted at 138.54 yen in late afternoon, up 3.57
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 136.10 yen Friday. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's
key indicator of blue chips, fell 387.70 points, closing at
8,204.21. Brokers said investors were disappointed that Japan had
not come up with any measures to boost its faltering currency and
economy after world finance officials, including Deputy U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, met in Tokyo over the weekend.
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ With expectations focused on Japan to
revive its ailing economy and ease the regional slump, Tokyo
pledged again Monday to do its part. Japanese trade minister Mitsuo
Horiuchi told his U.S. counterpart Charlene Barshefsky he hoped
Japan's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 118.5 billion) stimulus package and
tax cuts would boost the recession-hit economy, said Atsuo Shibota,
a top Japanese trade official. Horiuchi added that the fiscal
measures would help reduce Japan's surplus in trade with the United
States, which has risen 41 percent since last May, Shibota told
reporters after the two trade ministers met. It also has climbed
for 20 straight months. Japan's overall trade surplus has surged 67
percent since May 1997. Its economy now has contracted for two
consecutive quarters, meaning it is officially considered in
recession. Its banks are a wreck and the yen has plummeted.
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Warning that economic turmoil is
tearing apart Indonesian society, a World Bank official said Monday
that the number of Indonesians living in poverty could double to
more than 50 million. Such a setback in the Southeast Asian nation
of 200 million people would shatter much of the economic legacy of
former President Suharto, an authoritarian leader who made poverty
reduction a linchpin during 32 years in power. U.S. and German
envoys met new President B.J. Habibie to offer their support for
Indonesia's efforts to revive a once-booming economy that is now
virtually at a standstill. Recovery is likely to take years in
Indonesia, where political stability is still in doubt despite the
downfall last month of Suharto after student protests and riots
over price increases.
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief executive froze sales in Hong Kong's
ailing property market Monday and announced steps to stimulate
business to help the territory through a looming recession. Tung
Chee-hwa spoke on Hong Kong TV as the stock market closed another
dismal day. The key Hang Seng index tumbled 4.5 percent and now is
50 percent below last fall's high. Investors dumped stocks in the
absence of firm plans by regional giant Japan to boost its economy.
Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.2 percent. Tung
said more difficulties were ahead this year, including further
increases in unemployment.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines is planning to
hire laid-off Indonesian pilots to replace Filipino pilots who went
on strike and brought the airline close to collapse, an official
said Monday. PAL has sent officials to Jakarta to screen hundreds
of pilots laid off by at least four Indonesian carriers hurt by the
Indonesian rupiah's sharp fall, senior vice president Avelino
Zapanta said. The Indonesian carriers together laid off more than
1,000 pilots. Zapanta said PAL now has 83 pilots, including some
union members who have returned to work, but needs a total of 200
to handle its scaled-down operations following the 18-day pilots'
strike.

With Nazi-era trial ahead, Croatia emphasizes anti-fascist past 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia on Monday celebrated citizens who
fought fascism when the country was a Nazi puppet state during
World War II _ a dichotomous past likely to be relived in the
upcoming trial of the former commander of World War II's worst
Croatian death camp.
	   Many Croats fought fascism in World War II, but the country was
the Nazi puppet state supported by many other citizens. Tens or
hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat insurgents
were killed by that regime.
	   The first Croatian partisan brigade was formed in Sisak, central
Croatia, 57 years ago Monday, now celebrated as the Day of
Anti-Fascist Struggle.
	   The government of President Franjo Tudjman, often accused of
tolerating or fostering nationalism that harks back to the World
War II past, is now trying to distance itself from fascism.
	   Last week, the former commander of the Jasenovac death camp was
extradited from decades of exile in Argentina and likely will be
tried for atrocities.
	   Government officials, including Tudjman's chief aide Hrvoje
Sarinic, paid tribute to all Croatia's anti-fascists. Tudjman was a
partisan.
	   National television, controlled by Tudjman's party, ran a
commentary late Sunday even paying tribute to Josip Broz Tito, a
Croat who led the Communist partisans against the Nazis and
afterwards formed and led the Communist Yugoslavia Tudjman served
for many years as an army general.
	   Official Croatia usually blasts Tito for creating a state now
said to have suppressed Croatian national feelings and its Roman
Catholic religion.

One Russian policeman killed, 10 injured in Dagestan mine blast remote-controlled bomb, 10-year-old child kidnapped, security official quitting.

Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with 10 injured, explosion caused by
<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Dagestan (AP) _ A remote-controlled bomb blew up a
truck carrying Russian riot police officers near the border with
Chechnya on Monday, killing one policeman and wounding 10.
	   The explosive was planted on a road near the village of
Solnechnoye in Russia's republic of Dagestan, the police press
service said. The officers were members of a Russian riot police
force deployed to guard the border with Chechnya.
	   The Interior Ministry said that the explosive was a
remote-controlled bomb, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies
reported.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's independence war against Russia two
years ago, the separatist republic has become an epicenter of
violent crime that has spread into Dagestan and other neighboring
Russian regions. The republics' own, internal conflicts also
contribute to the unrest.
	   Kidnappings are rampant in the region. The latest victim was a
10-year-old boy, whom five gunmen on horseback seized outside the
village of Komargon in North Ossetia on Monday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In another violent incident, unidentified attackers opened fire
with grenade launchers on a Russian border guards' helicopter base
in Dagestan late Sunday night.
	   One serviceman was injured in the attack on the helicopter
squadron, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing the border
guards' command. The attackers fled in a car after the shooting.
	   No significant damage was reported, but investigators were
searching the military base, located near the town of Kaspiisk, for
explosive devices that may have been planted, ITAR-Tass and
Interfax said.
	   Officials blamed the attack on unspecified criminal groups
seeking to disrupt upcoming parliamentary elections in the
republic.
	   ``Criminal bandit gangs are again trying to exert psychological
and military pressure on Russian border guards and destabilize the
situation in the region, just as they did two years ago,'' border
guards spokesman Sergei Ivanchenko was quoted as saying by
Interfax.
	   In 1996, 56 people were killed in a bomb blast in a building
housing Russian border guard officers and their families.
	   The secretary of Dagestan's Security Council, Mahomed Tolboyev,
announced Monday that he would leave his post next week, Interfax
said.
	   He said that with the Chechen war ended, the border between
Dagestan and Chechnya beefed up, and the republic's internal
political situation brought under control, his mission was
``completed,'' Interfax said.

Ramos orders security for Marcos family after Communist threats Marcos burial in grafs 17-18

Eds: UPDATES with government lawyer asking Supreme Court to uphold
Imelda Marcos' conviction in 11th graf, Estrada sets conditions for
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos ordered tighter
security for former first lady Imelda Marcos and her children
Monday after Communist rebels threatened to seize them for ``crimes
to the people.''
	   Ramos told reporters that he had instructed government agencies
to ``monitor, preempt and counter these published threats.''
	   On Sunday, a rebel spokesman condemned President-elect Joseph
Estrada for allowing the burial of Mrs. Marcos' strongman husband,
Ferdinand, next month in a heroes' cemetery in metropolitan Manila.
	   In a statement, spokesman Gregorio Rosal said special rebel
units have been ordered to arrest the Marcoses so they could face
trial in a rebel court.
	   He did not specify any charges against the Marcoses but
mentioned human rights violations.
	   Rosal said the planned burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery
was a ``hard slap'' at the victims of Marcos' 20-year autocratic
rule.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986. He fled
to Hawaii, where he died three years later.
	   His body was only allowed to return to the country in September
1993 and has been kept in a glass coffin in an air-conditioned
mausoleum in his northern hometown.
	   Rosal said the Communist Party of the Philippines is determined
``to have the relatives and cronies of the fascist dictator answer
for their crimes to the people.''
	   The government accuses Marcos and his associates of illegally
amassing billions of dollars. Marcos' government also was accused
of torturing and murdering political dissidents.
	   Mrs. Marcos has been convicted of graft and sentenced to 12
years in prison but is free on bail pending a final Supreme Court
appeal. On Monday, the government's solicitor general urged the
Supreme Court to uphold her conviction.
	   As a former first lady, Mrs. Marcos already has at least four
police guards assigned to her.
	   Opponents say the burial of Marcos in the Heroes' Cemetery would
``desecrate'' hallowed ground.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial there is appropriate because
he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor, said burying Marcos would end the bitter conflict
between Marcos' supporters and opponents.
	   He said the former president will not be given state honors at
the burial, set for July 11.
	   Estrada said he sent a letter to Mrs. Marcos on Sunday setting
the rules for the burial, including a ban on rallies along the
route to the cemetery.
	   He said only family members, not exceeding 50 people, will be
allowed in the cemetery and no political statements can be made
during the strictly religious ceremony.

Holocaust survivors' lawyer: settle Swiss bank claims by year-end 
</HEADLINE>
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Claims that Swiss banks stole the assets of
Holocaust victims should be settled by the end of the year, before
too many more elderly survivors die, an attorney representing
thousands of survivors said Monday.
	   Edward Fagan said five to 10 of the 31,000 Holocaust survivors
represented by his class-action suit against the banks die each
day.
	   ``I want it over by the end of the year,'' he told reporters in
Jerusalem, where he held a news conference to explain his rejection
of a dlrs 600 million settlement offered last week by Switzerland's
three biggest banks.
	   ``If the banks really want to negotiate in good faith, it can be
over in a matter of months,'' Fagan said Monday.
	   If not, he said he would be in federal court in New York in
July, demanding that the banks open their records.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe, expecting to retrieve it
later. But plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and
their heirs after World War II ended, claiming they could not find
accounts or demanding non-existent death certificates.
	   Michal Schonberger, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp and a
plaintiff in the class-action suit, called the banks' offer ``a
spit in the bucket.''
	   ``It's been 55 years they're using our money _ our fathers and
mothers' money,'' the 69-year-old Schonberger told reporters in
broken English. ``This is long enough. ... We don't need charity _
we want our money.''
	   Schonberger, who lives in New York City, said his father was a
wealthy businessman and landowner in Czechoslovakia before he was
taken by the Nazis to Auschwitz, where he died.
	   Schonberger's father left ``a lot of money'' in a Swiss bank,
but Schonberger was never able to retrieve it because the bank
wanted proof of his death, he said.
	   ``They didn't give out proof in Auschwitz,'' he said bitterly.
Today, he said, his father's account would be worth ``millions.''
	   ``They're making fun of us,'' he said of the banks' offer.
``They think we'll die out and they won't have to give us
anything.''
	   Fagan refused to say what he thought would be an adequate
settlement from the Swiss banks, saying they first need to disclose
how much money they have found in dormant accounts so the survivors
can make an informed decision. He has said in the past that dlrs 1
billion would not be enough. Some groups have mentioned figures of
dlrs 4 billion or higher.
	   Fagan called on former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, who heads a panel looking for unclaimed Holocaust-era
accounts in Swiss banks, to say immediately how much money he
believes the banks are holding. Volcker has said it will take
another year and a half to audit the holdings of the largest banks,
Fagan said.

Philippine government urges court to uphold Imelda Marcos conviction 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Philippines-Marcos
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In a reversal, the Philippine
government's new chief lawyer urged the Supreme Court Monday to
uphold the conviction of former first lady Imelda Marcos on
corruption charges.
	   Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello, who was also recently made
solicitor general, told the Supreme Court that Mrs. Marcos ``beyond
doubt'' granted leases on government-owned land at improperly low
rates to benefit a hospital foundation she also headed.
	   Bello's predecessor, Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz, was
fired by President Fidel Ramos on June 5 for telling the Supreme
Court there was no strong evidence against Mrs. Marcos and asking
it to overturn her 1993 conviction.
	   Mrs. Marcos was sentenced to up to 12 years in prison and is
appealing the verdict with the Supreme Court.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he favors a pardon
or dismissal of the case against Mrs. Marcos, and some analysts
speculate that de la Cruz's abrupt recommendation to overturn the
conviction was an attempt to stay on as solicitor general in
Estrada's administration, which takes office June 30.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted on corruption charges, although she faces numerous other
criminal and civil cases related to the 20-year strongman rule of
her husband, Ferdinand Marcos.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   Mrs. Marcos insists she did not personally benefit from the
deal, and prosecutors did not challenge this, but they maintained
that the foundation should have been charged more.
	   In the new petition, Bello described the transaction as
``manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.''
	   He said the government signed a lease agreement with the
foundation at 112,000 pesos (dlrs 2,800) a month. The same property
was sublet by the foundation at 734,000 pesos (dlrs 18,350) a month
19 days later.
	   A five-judge Supreme Court panel upheld Mrs. Marcos' conviction
in January, but ruled she could appeal one more time to the entire
court before going to prison. It sentenced her to 9 to 12 years in
prison and ordered her to pay 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.9 million)
in damages to the government.

EU reports ``substantial progress'' on MCI-Worldcom merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are likely to
approve the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S. telecommunications
groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom Inc., an EU spokesman
said Monday.
	   ``We're still talking, but as it stands now, we probably have a
deal,'' said Stefan Rating, spokesman for EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert.
	   ``I can confirm that substantial progress has been made on this
case,'' Rating added at the European Commission's daily media
briefing. He declined to discuss details.
	   Rating said the merger will likely appear on the agenda of the
Commission on July 8 at the regular weekly meeting of the EU's
20-member executive body. The Commission has set a deadline of July
15 for a ruling on the case.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc and can demand changes
to, or veto those it judges to infringe European laws governing
fair competition.
	   As a condition for approval of the merger, Van Miert has said
MCI must dispose of all its Internet businesses. MCI agreed last
month to sell the bulk of its Internet operations to the
London-based Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC, but Van Miert had
continued to express doubts.
	   However, officials at the Commission and the two companies have
recently expressed increasing optimism that a deal was close. An EU
official said Friday the Commission had received fresh proposals
from the companies.
	   Rating said an advisory committee of antitrust experts from EU
member nations gave a positive recommendation Friday to the
Commission's approach to the merger.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. Their
alliance, proposed in November, would surpass Bell Atlantic's dlrs
25.6 billion 1997 takeover of Nynex and continue the global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The merger also is subject to approval by U.S. regulators who
are consulting with their European counterparts on the deal.

Complicated coalition talks begin at Prague Castle 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led after talks begin at 1200GMT
By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel will likely
ask Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman to try and form the next
government when coalition talks open at Prague Castle Monday, the
president's spokesman said.
	   Zeman's party came out on top in the weekend's early
parliamentary elections with 32.3 percent of the vote _ still far
short of a parliamentary majority necessary to form a government,
and looking for partners on a bitterly deadlocked and divided
political scene.
	   Beginning at 2 p.m. (1200GMT) Monday, Havel was scheduled to
meet individually with Zeman, as well as ex-premier Vaclav Klaus,
who leads the Civic Democratic Party that placed second in the
vote. Also invited were Jan Ruml, leader of the Freedom Union, and
Josef Lux, who heads the Christian Demcorats.
	   The Communist party, which also cleared the 5 percent hurdle
necessary for representation in the lower house of parliament was
not invited to Havel's coalition negotiations.
	   Talks between party leaders late into Sunday night produced no
indicators of what a future coalition might look like.
	   Ladislav Spacek, spokesman for Havel, told Czech radio Monday
the president planned to ask the Social Democrats to try and form a
government.
	   Zeman's party earned 74 of the 200 seats in the lower house of
parliament. His bitter rival Klaus controls 63 seats, after winning
27.7 percent of the vote in a strong comeback from his ouster over
a party finance scandal last winter.
	   Both Klaus and Zeman have said they rule out a ``grand
coalition'' between their parties. This leaves the Freedom Union
and the Christian Democrats as possible partners for the Social
Democrats. Zeman has said he won't join up with the Freedom Union.
	   This would leave only the Christian Democrats to join with
Zeman's party in a minority coalition _ an option Zeman seems to
favor, but which would leave the Czech Republic with the same weak
government it had after the last elections in 1996, when Klaus'
three-party center-right coalition fell one short of a majority.
	   ``A two-party coalition of the Social Democrats and the
Christian Democrats would be a solution that would bring stability
to the country,'' Zeman said late Sunday.
	   The weekend's elections were called two years ahead of schedule.
Klaus' government collapsed in December 1997, triggered by the
departure of the Christian Democrats, and a cabinet of technocrats,
led by banker Jozef Tosovsky, has ruled since.
	   Should the Social Demcorats fail to form a government, Klaus
could be asked to do so.

Italian chamber prepares for a showdown on NATO expansion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A vote to approve NATO expansion has divided Italy's
governing parties hours before debate was to begin on the issue
Monday in the Chamber of Deputies.
	   The government's ally, the far-left Communist Refoundation
party, opposes the expansion and has said it will vote against the
treaty.
	   But the center-right opposition, as well as a small group of
centrists, suggested they could come to the aid of Premier Romano
Prodi.
	   The government would need at least some of their votes for
approval in the Chamber of Deputies, because it depends on the
communists for a majority there. The measure was expected to be
voted on Tuesday.
	   The treaty must be ratified by all 16 NATO nations, plus the
three eastern European candidates, Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary.
	   The vote has become the subject of internal politics among
Italy's parties. The centrists are seeking sway in his government,
and the center-right opposition led by former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi is hoping to use it as a lever to bring down the
government.
	   ``No one would understand, and it would be a true insult to our
national interests, if Parliament voted against NATO's expansion
purely for motives of internal politics,'' said an editorial in the
daily La Repubblica Monday.
	   The Senate, where Prodi has a clear majority, already has
ratified the treaty.
	   Berlusconi and his allies have called for Prodi's center-left
government to resign if it fails to secure the votes of Fausto
Bertinotti's communists.
	   But if the division does prompt a vote of confidence, Bertinotti
has said he would close ranks and keep Prodi in office.

Indonesian capital not in celebrating mood on 471st birthday 
</HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shaken by riots last month, the
Indonesian capital of Jakarta marked its 471st birthday Monday with
few celebrations as thousands of soldiers patrolled the streets.
	   Unlike last year, city officials decided not to fund public
ceremonies to celebrate Jakarta's anniversary. Indonesia's economic
crisis has drained government coffers and military leaders fear big
public gatherings could lead to more unrest.
	   Residents usually celebrate Jakarta's anniversary with a night
market in the main square. Caravans of vehicles parade around the
town, which was founded by a Java Island prince in 1527.
	   ``This year, celebrations should be more simple,'' army Maj.
Gen. Sutiyoso, the governor of Jakarta, was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Kompas.
	   Riots over price increases killed as many as 1,200 people in
Jakarta last month and helped unseat authoritarian President
Suharto after 32 year in power. Inflation and unemployment show no
signs of abating, raising fears of more violence.
	   ``I will take measures against parties who undermine the safety
of the people,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Maj. Gen.
Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, the Jakarta military commander, as saying.
	   Security was tight at major roads and intersections Monday in
the city of 10 million people. At least 8,300 security personnel
were deployed in the streets in a sign that the military is growing
impatient with near-daily protests in support of a range of causes.
	   ``It's better now to concentrate on economic problems, rather
than holding lots of protests,'' said military spokesman Lt. Col.
D.J. Nachrowi.
	   The protests have created traffic jams and delayed the
distribution of staple foods in several places, he said.
	   However, about 1,000 students paid no heed, staging a peaceful
protest outside Parliament to demand that the government reduce
food prices by increasing subsidies.
	   Waving a banner that read ``People have been getting poorer,''
the students said the focus on political change had distracted the
government from tending to economic reforms.
	   About 70 students also rallied at the Justice Ministry to urge
the release of jailed separatist guerrillas from the remote
province of Irian Jaya.

With Nazi-era trial ahead, Croatia emphasizes anti-fascist past 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia on Monday celebrated citizens who
fought fascism when the country was a Nazi puppet state during
World War II _ a divisive past likely to be relived in the upcoming
trial of the former commander of World War II's worst Croatian
death camp.
	   Many Croats fought fascism in World War II, but the Nazi puppet
state was supported by many other citizens. Estimates varying
between tens and hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
Croat insurgents were killed by that regime.
	   The first Croatian partisan brigade was formed in Sisak, central
Croatia, 57 years ago Monday, now celebrated as the Day of
Anti-Fascist Struggle.
	   The government of President Franjo Tudjman, often accused of
tolerating or fostering nationalism that harks back to the World
War II past, is now trying to distance itself from fascism.
	   Last week, the former commander of the Jasenovac death camp was
extradited from decades of exile in Argentina and likely will be
tried for atrocities.
	   Government officials, including Tudjman's chief aide Hrvoje
Sarinic, paid tribute to all Croatia's anti-fascists. Tudjman was a
partisan.
	   National television, controlled by Tudjman's party, ran a
commentary late Sunday even paying tribute to Josip Broz Tito, a
Croat who led the Communist partisans against the Nazis and
afterwards formed and led the Communist Yugoslavia Tudjman served
for many years as an army general.
	   Official Croatia usually blasts Tito for creating a state now
said to have suppressed Croatian national feelings and its Roman
Catholic religion.

Oil-rich but gas-poor Nigeria sets aside more oil for own use 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Trying to end his country's critical
shortage of gasoline, Nigeria's new military leader has approved an
increase in the amount of crude oil set aside for domestic use.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar announced Sunday that the allocation
for domestic consumption would be increased from 250,000 barrels a
day to 300,000 barrels a day.
	   The government will enter into a long-term arrangement for
offshore processing of about 50,000 barrels a day of Nigerian crude
oil. Under the arrangement, the petroleum products will be
re-imported to augment direct imports and domestic production.
	   Nigeria, the world's sixth largest oil producer, has seen its
refineries crippled by years of neglect, incompetence and
corruption, leaving lines at petrol stations sometimes lasting
twelve hours or more.
	   The country, which uses about 18 million liters of gasoline per
day, is only able to refine about 6 milllion liters.

soccer team playing in the World Cup in France.
	   ``I am sorry to disappoint the people of Korea. I sincerely hope
that the Korean team will reach the goal of one victory in its
match against Belgium,'' Cha said on arrival at Kimpo airport
outside Seoul.
	   South Korea is appearing in the World Cup finals for the fifth
time. It has never won a game.
	   Cha was heavily criticized after South Korea's 3-1 loss to
Mexico and 5-0 defeat by the Netherlands. On Sunday, South Korean
soccer officials in Paris fired him.
	   ``I did my best but failed to realize the dream of reaching the
second round. I will try to use the lesson I learned for the future
of South Korean soccer,'' Cha told reporters.
	   Cha did not elaborate, but local media said Cha might return to
his past task of teaching soccer to children.
	   After a brief news conference, police escorted Cha to his home
to protect him from angry fans. Some passers-by at the airport
booed at Cha, but there was no violence.

Trial ends for commander accused of allowing rape 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from closing arguments.
By JENIFER CHAO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Muslim prisoner of war was
hauled before her captors for questioning and then, prosecutors
say, raped repeatedly as the Bosnian Croat officer in charge stood
by and watched.
	   U.N. judges heard closing arguments Monday in the first war
crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault committed
during an interrogation.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, accused paramilitary commander
Anto Furundzija became a ``direct perpetrator committing the crimes
of torture and outrages upon personal dignity,'' prosecutors
contended during the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's sixth and
fastest trial.
	   ``This case calls for a simple rendering of justice,''
prosecutor Patricia Sellers told the three-judge panel.
	   ``There was no move to stop ... what was clearly illegal. There
was no act of salvation,'' she added.
	   Furundzija, 28, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. He has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges and
has denied being present at the May 1993 rape.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
keen to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Defense lawyers sought to show that the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim, who testified in
closed session before the tribunal during the first week of the
trial.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   Furundzija was arrested in December in the central Bosnian town
of Vitez. The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was
alleged raped at the headquarters of his unit just outside Vitez,
prosecutors said.
	   Defense lawyer Luka Misetic described Witness A as a psychiatric
patient ``whose memory has failed her many times.''
	   ``How can you believe her beyond a reasonable doubt?'' asked
Misetic. ``This case cries out for an acquittal.''
	   In 1993, Furundzija's unit _ known as ``The Jokers'' _ allegedly
took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian Croat forces to drive
Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 60 people,
including Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, and has issued an
unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28 defendants in
custody.

Lull reported in Bissau fighting, Senegal brings home dead 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Senegal has begun shipping home its dead
from Guinea-Bissau, where the embattled capital was spared
overnight from the wholesale shelling that has typified its
two-week-old conflict.
	   Only sporadic gunfire crackled through the northern outskirts of
Guinea-Bissau's capital, near the airport where the country's
breakaway military faction has dug in to hold off loyalist forces,
a Senegalese military commander said Monday.
	   The bodies of several Senegalese troops, fighting on behalf of
Guinea-Bissau's President Joao Bernardo Vieira, were flown to the
southern town of Ziguinchor over the weekend, said a statement from
Senegal's military command in the capital, Dakar. No exact body
count was given.
	   At least four wounded troops were also shipped home.
	   More than 1,300 Senegalese troops were deployed in Guinea-Bissau
shortly after that country's former chief of army staff, Brig.
Ansumane Mane, staged a failed coup attempt against Vieira.
	   Two weeks of fighting has left the capital of Bissau scarred and
battered from rocket and artillery fire, it's streets virtually
deserted.
	   The vast majority of the city's 300,000 people have fled.
	   Driven from their homes, tens of thousands of displaced people
have flocked to the central towns of Mansoa and Bafata, where clean
water and food are in short supply.
	   The United Nations refugee agency has appealed to West African
nations to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Guinea-Bissau.
	   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday
warned a ``major humanitarian crisis'' could develop.
	   Sadako Ogata wrote to the presidents of Guinea-Bissau, Senegal
and Guinea on Friday calling for ``a peaceful and prompt
settlement'' to the crisis, a statement said.
	   Immediate consequences could be famine and a flood of refugees
into neighboring countries, Ogata said.
	   But there was no immediate indication the conflict was near a
resolution.
	   Guinea-Bissau's government on Sunday ruled out peace talks with
renegade forces unless they declare an immediate cease fire.
	   The rebels must also explain their motives for staging a
takeover bid, said Male Sane, Guinea-Bissau's Minister for the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers, quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the demands from the rebels.
	   Earlier attempts at peace talks failed before they got off the
ground. Mane rejected the mediation of the Gambian foreign minister
and proposed instead a Senegalese opposition legislator.
	   Also, Candjura Indjai, leader of Guinea-Bissau's opposition
party Union for Change, offered to mediate talks with Portugal's
ambassador Henriques da Silva and the Catholic bishop of Bissau,
Septimio Ferrazzetta, Lusa said.
	   Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
they recently removed 60 civilian bodies from sections of the
capital held by government forces, Portuguese radio RDP-Africa
reported.

Asian crisis impact on Australia not as bad as first thought: managers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Asia's financial meltdown was having
a limited effect on Australian companies, with only a minority
changing their business operations or their long-term investment
plans for the region, a report released Monday said.
	   About 70 percent of Australian companies surveyed said they had
either increased their business activities in Asia or kept the same
level, a Macquarie Equities research report said.
	   While sectors such as tourism and manufacturing had been
severely affected by Asia's economic upheaval, others such as
banking, insurance and finance had increased their activities and
investments in the region.
	   Macquarie Equities interviewed senior managers from 40 major
listed Australian companies from a wide range of industries.
	   ``Since the crisis began, only 5 percent of companies have
substantially scaled back their operations and investments in Asia
(by way of subsidiaries, joint ventures and representative
offices),'' report author David Rickards said.
	   ``A further 25 percent have scaled back operations only
slightly, leaving 70 percent having unchanged or increased
operations.''
	   A similar story emerged for long-term investment plans.
	   ``Only around 10 percent of companies have substantially revised
their plans for the Asia region, with the remainder having
unchanged or only slightly different plans,'' Rickards said.
	   The effect on sales had been more pronounced, but was probably
at the lower end of expectations.
	   While about 70 percent of companies said sales to Asia had
fallen, only about one-fourth said sales had fallen by more than 25
percent, the report said.
	   Companies said they were confident the long-term effect on sales
would be minimal and had therefore not pushed aggressively into
other markets such as Europe and the United States.

Bosnia's first convertible currency put in circulation Monday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led by 1400GMT, after currency distribution begins
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Company bookkeepers in
Muslim-dominated areas of Bosnia were the first to line up Monday
for the mark, the country's new currency and first convertible
coinage.
	   Since Bosnia declared independence in 1992 and descended into
war, four currencies have circulated. The Bosnian Serb half of the
country, in an unofficial of monetary union with neighboring
Yugoslavia, uses the Yugoslav dinar.
	   Regions under Bosnian Croat control use the Croatian kuna, since
they act as part of Croatia, while areas under Muslim control use
the Bosnian Dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   International officials and quarreling local politicians finally
settled on the Convertible Mark, locked directly to the German
mark.
	   It is supposed to improve trade and capital flows between the
Serb and Muslim-Croat halves of Bosnia, act as a uniting factor and
give the country credibility abroad.
	   The official period for exchange is two weeks, extended to three
if necessary.
	   Even after distribution ends, businesses can accept the Yugoslav
dinar or Croatian kuna. But taxes and duties will have to be paid
in Bosnian marks.
	   Rajko Tomas, economic adviser to Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic in Banja Luka, said he believed the quality of the new mark
would eventually edge out the dinar and kuna.
	   ``The dinar and the kuna are not convertible currencies and the
dinar is lately very unstable,'' he said.
	   So far, the Bosnian Central Bank has a 130 million (dlrs 73
million) German mark backup for the new currency.
	   The money was printed in France, which donated 7 million marks
(dlrs 3.9 million) for printing and transport.
	   Planning for the Bosnian mark has been in the works for months.
Ethnic leaders could not agree on a design and argued whether
national symbols should be used. The top international official in
Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, finally imposed two neutral designs for
the two halves of Bosnia.
	   The Bosnian Serb version will have portraits of well-known
Bosnian Serbs and Cyrillic script will dominate.
	   The version used in the federation will have portraits of famous
Croats and Muslims, with Latin letters above the Cyrillic.

Rebels attack northern Ugandan town, abduct 30 people 
</HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels have attacked a major garrison
town in northern Uganda, looted shops and abducted about 30 people,
a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The raid by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army took place
Saturday in Gulu, 360 kilometers (223 miles) from Kampala, the
state-owned New Vision reported.
	   A major military base is located about 3 kilometers (2 miles)
from the center of Gulu.
	   New Vision said the rebels attacked the main market and quoted
the local military spokesman, Lt. Kheril Magara, as saying the army
was pursuing them.
	   The LRA has been fighting for 11 years to oust President Yoweri
Museveni, but they have no articulated political program.
	   The fighting has displaced 300,000 people. Some of them are
living in so-called ``protected villages,'' but the LRA often
targets them and the army does little to repel the attacks.
	   The latest attack comes at a time when religious leaders and
members of the political opposition are calling on the government
to enter into negotiations.
	   Museveni, himself a former bush fighter who seized power in
1986, refuses to negotiate with the rebels, whom he calls ordinary
bandits.
	   ``There is no compromise with these terrorists and criminals ...
You human rights groups should instead demand that these criminals
be arrested,'' Museveni last week told groups calling for
negotiations.
	   Protestant and Muslim leaders plan to meet Wednesday in Kampala
to discuss ways of ending the northern rebellion and another in the
western part of the country.
	   The call for negotiations with various groups has gained
momentum since rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces torched
dormitories at the Kichwamba Technical Institute near Kabarole (Ft.
Portal), 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Kampala.
	   Eighty students were burned to death, and another 100
disappeared. They were apparently abducted by the rebels who
operate from bases on the slopes of Rwenzori Mountains that form
the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
	   Troops stationed in the area reportedly fled after an estimated
200 rebels overwhelmed them.
	   The government says the ADF is made up of Muslim fundamentalists
and soldiers of the former Rwandan Hutu-dominated army or FAR.
	   There are no known links between the at least four rebel groups
operating in Uganda. But the government says the are backed by
Sudan, Uganda's northern neighbor.
	   Sudan denies the claim and, in turn, accuses Uganda of helping
rebels in southern Sudan.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's most influential newspaper has
become the first in the country to go electronic.
	   Nhan Dan (People), the official Communist Party mouthpiece,
launched an Internet edition Sunday, the 73rd anniversary of
Vietnam Press Day.
	   Editor Hong Vinh told a ceremony Sunday that the move allows
Nhan Dan to integrate with the world press and serves the external
propaganda tasks of the party and the state, which are important in
Vietnam's current renovation process.
	   Nhan Dan said its electronic edition will reach more than 2
million overseas Vietnamese and foreign readers, initially in
Vietnamese only, with an English service scheduled to start in a
year.
	   In addition to four sections _ current affairs, political
affairs, social affairs and culture, science and education _ the
paper will present opinions from the party and the state on major
regional and world events.

EU reports `substantial progress' on MCI-Worldcom merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are likely to
approve the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S. telecommunications
groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom Inc., an EU spokesman
said Monday.
	   ``We're still talking, but as it stands now, we probably have a
deal,'' said Stefan Rating, spokesman for EU Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert said at the European Commission's
daily media briefing. He declined to discuss details.
	   Rating said the merger will likely appear on the agenda of the
Commission on July 8 at the regular weekly meeting of the EU's
20-member executive body. The Commission has set a deadline of July
15 for a ruling on the case.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc and can demand changes
to, or veto those it judges to infringe European laws governing
fair competition.
	   As a condition for approval of the merger, Van Miert has said
MCI must dispose of all its Internet businesses. MCI agreed last
month to sell the bulk of its Internet operations to the
London-based Cable and Wireless Communications PLC.
	   Rating said an advisory committee of antitrust experts from EU
member nations gave a positive recommendation Friday to the
Commission's approach to the merger.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. Their
alliance, proposed in November, would surpass Bell Atlantic's dlrs
25.6 billion 1997 takeover of Nynex and continue the global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   The merger also is subject to approval by U.S. regulators who
are consulting with their European counterparts on the deal.

Court frees schizophrenic man caught in president's kitchen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A paranoid schizophrenic who wandered
past heavily armed commandos into the kitchen in the presidential
palace three years ago, has been released by a Sri Lankan court, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Mohan Ravi Frugneit, 25, had been given two years hard labor by
Colombo High Court Judge Shirani Tilakawardana but the sentence was
suspended for 10 years, the Daily News reported. He will remain
free unless he commits another criminal offense in the next decade.
	   Frugneit had spent two years in jail awaiting trial before the
court released him on bail. He was seized by cooks when he entered
the kitchen on April 1, 1995. He told detectives he entered the
palace grounds with the guidance of divine birds.
	   Frugneit pleaded guilty to trespassing. Psychiatrists who
examined him at the court's request found that he was a paranoid
schizophrenic who suffered from delusions.
	   The incident led to a shakeup of soldiers and policemen guarding
President Chandrika Kumaratunga's palace.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tourism in Hong Kong has continued to slump
because of Asia's economic crisis, with arrivals in the first five
months of this year falling by 23 percent from January-May 1997,
officials reported Monday.
	   According to the Hong Kong Tourist Association, only 3,766,422
visitors arrived in Hong Kong in the five months.
	   Visitor arrivals in May fell 20.3 percent from last May to
778,718, a statement said. Tourism accounts for one in every eight
jobs and 8 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product.
	   Tourist arrivals from Japan, Hong Kong's largest market, fell
54.7 percent in the year's first five months to 340,675.
	   The number of American visitors in the same period fell by 15.1
percent to 313,116.
	   The tourist association's executive director, Amy Chan, said
Hong Kong has been hurt by the depreciation of the currencies of
many Asian countries.
	   Hong Kong's dollar, which is linked to the U.S. dollar, is the
only convertible Asian currency not to have been been devalued
since the region's economic crisis began last July.
	   The strong currency has made Hong Kong almost unaffordable for
many tourists from Southeast Asian countries.
	   About 3,000 people working in the retail or hotel industries
have lost their jobs so far in Hong Kong because of the tourism
slump.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and rebuff speculative attacks.
	   ``We're merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central
Bank,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``This will increase reliability and will make it possible to
rebuff any speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.''
	   Kiriyenko met with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the economic crisis, as a team of
IMF negotiators was headed to Moscow.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the
IMF was making some unacceptable demands. The fund has been
pressing the Russians to sharply curtail spending, boost tax
collections and reform its energy sector.
	   ``We will look at and consider the conditions, but it goes
without saying that far from all of the conditions are acceptable
to us,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that the government program to cope
with the crisis included many unpopular steps, including tightly
reining in government spending, but that the poorest Russians would
be protected.
	   Yeltsin was giving ``maximal support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said, adding that ``there hasn't been a single case when we didn't
receive such support for the measures elaborated by the
government.''
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials,
including Yeltsin, have sufficient political will to push through
an austerity program.
	   An expanded Cabinet meeting on the strategy, chaired by Yeltsin,
is scheduled Tuesday.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on the so-called gray economy.
	   He said that the poorest Russians ``pay their 12 percent in
income tax, but a very significant amount that could be paid by the
others never reaches the budget,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The essence (of the program) is straightforward: The country
cannot exist unless taxes are collected, and it cannot spend more
than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   He denied that the crisis management program would affect
Russia's long-term plans for financial development, but said that
the world financial crisis could.
	   ``Russia today is fairly closely integrated into the world
financial system,'' Kiriyenko said, according to Interfax. ``The
external threat is very high and we must ensure adequate financial
actions.''
	   Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman, confirmed earlier
reports that Russia was seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in talks with the IMF.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer and a separate team of
negotiators are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday.

Early election possible as Howard refuses compromise on native title 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A move to avoid an early election in
Australia was blocked Monday when Prime Minister John Howard stood
firm on plans to cut back Aborigines' land title rights.
	   Key independent legislator Brian Harradine offered Sunday to
reopen negotiations on Howard's so-called 10-point plan on native
title in an effort to have it passed through Parliament's upper
house, the Senate, and avoid an early national election.
	   Howard said he would listen to Harradine, but ruled out any
further compromise on his proposed legislation, which incorporates
the 10-point plan.
	   ``People should remember that our bill is not an ambit claim _
it's already a compromise,'' Howard said in a radio interview.
	   The native title legislation, which Howard says settles
uncertainty about the rights of miners, ranchers and Aborigines on
large tracts of government-owned land, would be passed in the
Senate if Harradine gave the government his vote.
	   Harradine is under pressure from government legislators to avoid
an early poll because they fear it will mean voters will desert the
government in favor of right-wing populist Pauline Hanson's One
Nation party. One Nation attracted about 23 percent of the vote in
a recent Queensland state election.
	   Harradine and others fear an election triggered by native title
would become a divisive campaign fought on race issues.
	   Howard's bill has been substantially amended twice in the
Senate, where the government does not have a majority of lawmakers.
	   Under the constitution, the prime minister can call a ``double
dissolution'' election under certain conditions if the Senate
refuses to pass the government's legislation.
	   Because of different quota arrangements for a double
dissolution, One Nation would win more seats in the Senate than at
a full-term election, if voter support in Queensland is repeated
nationally. Using the state figures, One Nation could also hold the
balance of power in the Senate, effectively having final say on the
government's bills.
	   Howard conceded Monday he had misjudged public support for the
protectionist, anti-Asian One Nation.
	   He was reminded in a television interview that he had once said
Hanson would not be around at the next election.
	   ``Well, I was wrong wasn't I?'' Howard said. ``That isn't the
first mistake I have made and it won't be the last.
	   ``I think the Australian public is sending a message to all of
us that they want us to govern better and I accept that,'' he said.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The companion of slain designer Gianni
Versace says he wants to design his own fashion label but won't try
to imitate Versace's style.
	   Antonio D'Amico, who was staying with Versace in the Miami Beach
villa when the designer was shot to death in July, was quoted as
saying in Sunday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily, that he and
a friend had started a fashion house whose label would carry
D'Amico's name.
	   ``The teaching by Gianni, an authentic artistic genius, was an
extraordinary school for me but I won't present myself as a
copier,'' D'Amico was quoted as saying. ``He was unique, and I have
my tastes and my style.''
	   D'Amico was hoping to start the collection in time for men's
fashion shows in early 1999, according to the report.
	   According to Versace's will, D'Amico is allowed to stay in the
designer's luxurious residences, including the Miami Beach mansion.
But D'Amico, while acknowledging his companion's generosity, said:
``I'll never set foot again (in the residences) because it would
only be fruitless suffering.''

Impeachment committee sets first meeting date 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Zyuganov comments.
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A commission set up to prepare an impeachment
motion against President Boris Yeltsin will hold its first meeting
on June 29, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The lower house of parliament voted Friday to set up the
commission, which would draw up formal charges against Yeltsin that
would serve as a legal foundation for impeachment.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of several
transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's
economy.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called again Monday for
Yeltsin to unequivocally renounce any intention to run for a third
term, and suggested that impeachment was the only way to alleviate
crisis in Russia.
	   ``There is no question of Yeltsin being president for a third
term,'' Zyuganov told Interfax. ``Rather, the issue is how to make
him resign in a legal way to enable the country to recover.''
	   Several attempts since 1994 to set up a panel to prepare a
formal indictment have collapsed.
	   The latest initiative, too, is unlikely to succeed. Once the
indictment is prepared, a two-thirds majority of the 450 Duma
members is needed to launch the impeachment motion. Then it would
have to win confirmation from both the Constitutional and Supreme
Courts, as well as the upper chamber of parliament, the Federation
Council.

	   In Washington, Buzek is also expected to deliver a lecture at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
	   He also will travel to Huston, Texas, to open Poland's Honorary
Consulate there and meet with American businessmen.
	   On July 11, Buzek will visit Panna Maria, Texas, a historic
Polish settlement in America, where he is to meet with leaders of

OPEC hopes to rescue oil market by cutting production AP Graphic OPEC AP Business Writer

minister, SUBBING 5th graf to add Egypt's pledge to cut oil output
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After failing to rescue the depressed oil
market by slashing production this spring, OPEC now hopes a new
round of cuts might do the trick.
	   But analysts and traders are skeptical, saying that even if the
oil producers find the willpower to follow though on all their new
promises about restraining output, it might not be enough to push
prices higher any time soon.
	   OPEC's average crude price plunged to dlrs 10.11 per barrel
early last week, less than half the group's official target of dlrs
21. Prices have not been so low since 1986, a year that brought
disaster to the global oil industry, from the palaces of the
wealthy Gulf sheiks to the small producers who had to shut down
their little wells in the U.S. oil patch.
	   The current cheap oil prices have been a bargain for consumers,
including gas-hungry vacationers preparing for summer getaways, but
they are devastating to OPEC and other producers.
	   The biggest OPEC exporters, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Iran, have joined smaller OPEC countries with pledges to cut
some 620,000 barrels of production daily, out of current output of
about 28.2 million barrels. Non-OPEC producers Mexico, Russia, Oman
and Egypt are trying to help out with promises to remove another
223,000 barrels a day from the glutted market.
	   But even if all those cuts are made and sustained, and experts
have big doubts about this, traders say more than 1 million barrels
a day need to be removed.
	   Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said Monday
that if the new production cuts don't push the market higher, OPEC
might need to discuss further restraint.
	   ``If it turns out that the reductions committed so far by
producers won't affect the prices, then there will be a need to
review this subject,'' Sheik Saud said before leaving Kuwait for
Vienna, in remarks carried by the official Kuwait News Agency.

World Cup: Defender ruled out of Monday's game 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Gareth Southgate was ruled out of
England's World Cup game against Romania Monday because of an ankle
injury he picked up in training.
	   The Aston Villa center-back, who played in last Monday's 2-0
victory over Tunisia, was expected to be replaced by Manchester
United's Gary Neville.
	   Southgate, who suffered the injury when England reported back
for training after the victory over Tunisia, had improved enough
for him to resume practice. But he was not considered 100 percent
fit to face the Romanians at the Stade Municipal.
	   Both England and Romania went into the game with three points
after victories in their first Group G games. The Romanians edged
Colombia 1-0 at Lyon.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle also was worried about the fitness of
another center-back, Arsenal's Tony Adams, who suffered blistered
feet during the game against the Tunisians. Hoddle is worried that
the hard surface at the Stade Municipal might aggravate the problem
and Adams might not last the full 90 minutes.

Report: Unidentified submarine found in South Korean waters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with subs seizure, ADDS details
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea captured a midget
submarine believed to belong to North Korea on Monday after it
became entangled in a fishing boat's net, officials said.
	   ``The Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that the boat belongs to
North Korea,'' a spokesman said, adding that a navy ship had
attached a line and begun towing the vessel ashore.
	   ``We suspect there's somebody inside, but we don't know how
many,'' said the Joint Chiefs' spokesman, speaking on the usual
condition of anonymity.
	   He described the captured boat as a ``midget submersible.''
	   The national news agency Yonhap reported without attribution
that the captured boat was a 70-ton Yugo-class submarine, which
normally carries four to five crewmen. North Korea is believed to
have a number of such craft.
	   Yonhap said the boat's periscope got caught in a fishing net
about 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of Sokcho, a coastal town just
south of the North Korean border and about 200 kilometers (125
miles) northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set to drift from the stern of a South Korean
fishing vessel, which first spotted the entangled craft and radioed
maritime police and the military.
	   South Korean military units in the Sokcho area were put on a
heightened state of alert.
	   The state-run Korea Broadcasting System said men were seen on
the deck of the entangled craft trying to free it before it was
seized by the South Korean warship. Yonhap said the boat had been
listing and drifting.
	   The Defense Ministry sent four warships and a helicopter to the
scene, KBS reported.
	   The site is in the general area where a North Korean submarine
ran aground in September 1996, touching off a massive, 53-day
manhunt for its occupants.
	   The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans _
and sent relations between North and South Korea plunging to their
lowest level in years. One North Korean was captured and another
was believed to have escaped back across the border.

Russia: Troop withdrawal from Kosovo could cause wave of refugees 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 8th graf to RESTORE U.S. as Contact Group member.
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned that a
withdrawal of Serbian police and military troops from Kosovo would
result in a flood of Serbian refugees from the ethnic
Albanian-majority province.
	   In an interview Sunday night on Russia's RTR television station,
Primakov said that the six-nation Contact Group, which is
monitoring developments in the Balkans, should postpone its meeting
scheduled for Wednesday to give the Yugoslav authorities time to
fulfill conditions.
	   ``It will be clear in a week how the obligations, which were not
simply undertaken by (Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) but
also sealed with Russia's authority, are fulfilled,'' Primakov
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
withdraw his estimated 45,000 to 50,000 police and Yugoslav army
soldiers from the province.
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has promised to try to persuade
Belgrade to ease up on its attacks but says the West must get the
Kosovo Liberation Army to halt fighting as well.
	   In a meeting in Moscow last week, Milosevic promised Yeltsin
that he would resume talks with moderate ethnic Albanians. But
Albanian negotiators have said that Milosevic's forces must first
leave the separatist province.
	   Primakov warned against pulling Serbian troops out of Kosovo
``without heeding the process of stopping the terrorist activity,
because it will result in a flow of Serbian refugees, who will
regard the move as a signal to leave.''
	   He also warned Russia's partners in the Contact Group, which
also includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy
_ against leaving Moscow out of decision-making.
	   ``I understand that constant pressure on Milosevic is sought to
make him stick to the obligations he has undertaken. But at the
same time, another motif emerges _ jealousy _ although we have
always stressed ... that this is our common position, our common
issue,'' Primakov said.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky flew to
Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital, on Sunday and met with Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Russian diplomat Alexander Avdeyev went
for talks to Yugoslavia's neighbor Albania, considered a vital
source of support to the ethnic Albanian separatists.

Trial ends for commander accused of allowing rape 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from closing arguments.
By JENIFER CHAO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Muslim prisoner of war was
hauled before her captors for questioning and then, prosecutors
say, raped repeatedly as the Bosnian Croat officer in charge stood
by and watched.
	   U.N. judges heard closing arguments Monday in the first war
crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault committed
during an interrogation.
	   By failing to stop the rapes, accused paramilitary commander
Anto Furundzija became a ``direct perpetrator committing the crimes
of torture and outrages upon personal dignity,'' prosecutors
contended during the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's sixth and
fastest trial.
	   ``This case calls for a simple rendering of justice,''
prosecutor Patricia Sellers told the three-judge panel. ``There was
no move to stop ... what was clearly illegal. There was no act of
salvation.''
	   Furundzija, 28, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. He has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges and
has denied being present at the May 1993 rape.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
keen to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Defense lawyers sought to show that the prosecution's case was
built on faulty recollections of the victim, who testified in
closed session before the tribunal during the first week of the
trial.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   Furundzija was arrested in December in the central Bosnian town
of Vitez. The victim, identified in court only as Witness A, was
alleged raped at the headquarters of his unit just outside Vitez,
prosecutors said.
	   Defense lawyer Luka Misetic described Witness A as a psychiatric
patient ``whose memory has failed her many times.''
	   ``How can you believe her beyond a reasonable doubt?'' asked
Misetic. ``This case cries out for an acquittal.''
	   In 1993, Furundzija's unit _ known as ``The Jokers'' _ allegedly
took part in a violent campaign by Bosnian Croat forces to drive
Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 60 people,
including Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, and has issued an
unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28 defendants in
custody.

Security chief: Diplomatic status used for tax-free alcohol imports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's Federal Security Service told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday that large amounts of alcohol and
tobacco were being imported into Russia by foreign diplomats who
use their privileges to avoid taxes.
	   Nikolai Kovalyov, the security service chief, told Yeltsin that
shipments intended ``supposedly for embassies' needs'' were
bringing ``commercial amounts'' of alcohol and tobacco into Russia,
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   During the past year, such shipments totaled 344 tons of alcohol
and 51 tons of tobacco from African nations, 230 tons of alcohol
from Asian nations, 90 tons of alcohol and 10 tons of tobacco from
Latin America, and 108 tons of alcohol from former Soviet
republics.
	   During the past few weeks, security service and customs
officials have detained 20 tons of bootleg tobacco, worth dlrs
360,000, that was addressed to the embassies of the Central African
Republic and Nicaragua, Yastrzhembsky quoted Kovalyov as saying.
	   ``During an inquiry, the embassies denied having ordered such
goods,'' Yastrzhembsky said.

even do.''

Holocaust survivors' lawyer: settle Swiss bank claims by year-end 
</HEADLINE>
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Claims that Swiss banks stole the assets of
Holocaust victims should be settled by the end of the year, before
too many more elderly survivors die, an attorney representing
thousands of survivors said Monday.
	   Edward Fagan said five to 10 of the 31,000 Holocaust survivors
represented by his class-action suit against the banks die each
day.
	   ``I want it over by the end of the year,'' he told reporters in
Jerusalem, where he held a news conference to explain his rejection
of a dlrs 600 million settlement offered last week by Switzerland's
three biggest banks.
	   ``If the banks really want to negotiate in good faith, it can be
over in a matter of months,'' Fagan said Monday.
	   If not, he said he would be in federal court in New York in
July, demanding that the banks open their records.
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe, expecting to retrieve it
later. But plaintiffs say bank officials stonewalled survivors and
their heirs after World War II ended, claiming they could not find
accounts or demanding non-existent death certificates.
	   Michal Schonberger, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp and a
plaintiff in the class-action suit, called the banks' offer ``a
spit in the bucket.''
	   ``It's been 55 years they're using our money _ our fathers and
mothers' money,'' the 69-year-old Schonberger told reporters in
broken English. ``This is long enough. ... We don't need charity _
we want our money.''
	   Schonberger, who lives in New York City, said his father was a
wealthy businessman and landowner in Czechoslovakia before he was
taken by the Nazis to Auschwitz, where he died.
	   Schonberger's father left ``a lot of money'' in a Swiss bank,
but Schonberger was never able to retrieve it because the bank
wanted proof of his death, he said.
	   ``They didn't give out proof in Auschwitz,'' he said bitterly.
Today, he said, his father's account would be worth ``millions.''
	   ``They're making fun of us,'' he said of the banks' offer.
``They think we'll die out and they won't have to give us
anything.''
	   Fagan refused to say what he thought would be an adequate
settlement from the Swiss banks, saying they first need to disclose
how much money they have found in dormant accounts so the survivors
can make an informed decision. He has said in the past that dlrs 1
billion would not be enough. Some groups have mentioned figures of
dlrs 4 billion or higher.
	   Fagan called on former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, who heads a panel looking for unclaimed Holocaust-era
accounts in Swiss banks, to say immediately how much money he
believes the banks are holding. Volcker has said it will take
another year and a half to audit the holdings of the largest banks,
Fagan said.

Ukrainian emergency workers combat consequences of rainstorms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Emergency workers on Monday battled the
consequences of weekend rainstorms that flooded nearly 200
settlements in western Ukraine, officials said.
	   Some 5,663 houses were flooded in 194 settlements in the Lviv,
Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, and about 3,000 people had to
be evacuated, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. Large
agricultural areas were damaged, it added.
	   Emergency workers were evacuating residents of the affected
regions and repairing power lines and other storm damage.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said that 11 people, including four
children, had died as a result of the rainstorms Friday and
Saturday in the Lviv region, including two people killed by
lightning.
	   However, the Emergency Situations Ministry and the Lviv regional
emergency headquarters did not confirm the report.

Indonesian Chinese, Muslim leaders urge guarantees for ethnic Chinese 
</HEADLINE>

By IRWAN FIRDAUS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An ethnic Chinese businessman and a
prominent Muslim leader urged the government and security forces
Monday to guarantee the security of Indonesia's Chinese minority.
	   Ethnic Chinese, only 4 percent of Indonesia's 200 million
people, are resented for their relative wealth and were targeted
during deadly riots last month in Jakarta and other cities. There
were widespread reports that rioters raped dozens of Chinese women.
	   Indonesian Chinese businessman William Soeryadjaya discussed the
ethnic tension during a visit to the Jakarta home of Abdurrahman
Wahid, leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the nation's largest Islamic
group, with 30 million members.
	   The meeting appeared to be a symbolic show of religious and
ethnic unity, since most Chinese are Buddhist or Christian in the
overwhelmingly Muslim nation.
	   ``The government should make a law that guarantees harmony
within Indonesian society,'' said Wahid. He said the government
should be obligated to protect all citizens, including ethnic
Chinese.
	   William later said that all Indonesians, including Chinese, need
assurances from the government that they can run their businesses
without fear. Thousands of homes, shops and vehicles were damaged
and looted during the riots over price increases in the Indonesian
capital.
	   ``Some (Chinese) fled overseas during the riots because they
felt insecure,'' William said. `That's why if they want to come
back to the country, they have to get assurances they can live in
peace.''
	   William is former head of the Astra Group, a business
conglomerate that produces Toyota cars in Indonesia.
	   He warned that Chinese are so economically powerful that
Indonesia's economy would plummet further if they are unable to do
business.

Slumping Sampras back `home' at Wimbledon weather, Coetzer first seed to win AP Sports Writer

By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ He's in a slump. He lacks motivation.
He's burned out.
	   Pete Sampras has heard it all and admits that much of it is
true.
	   But there's one antidote that can bring Sampras back to life:
the green lawns of Wimbledon.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity that seems to bring out the best in me,'' he
said. ``When I get onto Center Court, I'm pumped, and I think the
other guys still fear me.''
	   Sampras gets a chance to halt his slide Monday when he begins
defense of his Wimbledon title against Slovakia's Dominic Hrbaty in
the opening match of the fortnight on Center Court. A solid showing
should give some indication whether Sampras is poised to win his
fifth championship in six years.
	   ``I feel come 2 o'clock Monday, it's kind of like coming back
home,'' he said. ``It hasn't been a great year by any means, but
this is kind of where I kicked it in last year. I feel like I can
obviously do it again.''
	   In a change from last year's rainy weather, sunny skies and warm
temperatures greeted the players as the 112th edition of the
championships began Monday.
	   The first seeded player to advance was women's No. 9 Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa, who beat Kerry-Anne Guse of Australia 6-2,
6-2 in just over an hour.

Louise Woodward implies Eappens were responsible for baby's death 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UDPATES with fuller version of quotes, trims
With AP Photos LON102, 103
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States after being convicted of killing a baby
in her care, Louise Woodward implied the parents may have been
responsible for the death.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview scheduled for broadcast Monday night.
Exceprts were broadcast earlier on BBC television news.
	   Prosecutors had claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to
Britain on Thursday with a manslaughter conviction, fatally injured
8-month-old Matthew Eappen by shaking him. She has always
maintained her innocence.
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me. But like I say, you know, I didn't do
anything wrong.'' she said.
	   Woodward, 20 was allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had already
spent in prison.
	   She told the BBC she was fortunate that her sentence had not
been longer.
	   But she added: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an innocent
person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing, worry and
pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up in a prison
in a strange country _ and please remember that I was 18 when I
went into prison _ and being scared, for something that you didn't
even do.''
	   The Eappen family was not immediately available for comment late
Sunday.
	   Ms. Woodward's mother, Susan, has promised ``lots of answers''
to questions surrounding the baby's death in February 1997.
	   A photograph released by the BBC of Ms. Woodward being
interviewed by reporter Martin Bashir drew criticism Monday from
The Sun and The Mirror tabloid newspapers, which saw echoes of
Bashir's famous interview with Princess Diana in 1995, in which she
talked of the breakdown of her marriage.
	   ``Woodward seems to model herself on the princess by dressing
and sitting like her,'' The Mirror said. ``She has perfected the
coy, wide-eyed look Diana used.''
	   The BBC countered that any resemblance to the Princess Diana
interview was ``pure coincidence,'' The Mirror said.
	   ``Don't treat this killer like royalty,'' the newspaper said in
an editorial headline.
	   Although Ms. Woodward said during a press conference on Thursday
that she would receive no payment for the BBC interview and that
she would not sell her story, controversy has since broken out over
the tabloid Daily Mail's confirmation that it paid 40,000 pounds
(dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, before the
conviction was reduced. The newspaper began publishing a series on
Saturday, which it said was based on contacts with the girl and her
parents over several months.
	   In Monday's installment, the newspaper reported on Ms.
Woodward's life inside prison.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ One in four Indonesians could end up
living in poverty, victims of a yearlong economic crisis that is
tearing apart Indonesian society, a World Bank official said
Monday.
	   Such a setback in the Southeast Asian nation of 200 million
people would shatter much of the economic legacy of former
President Suharto, an authoritarian leader who made poverty
reduction a linchpin of his mandate during 32 years in power.
	   On a positive note, an official from the International Monetary
Fund said the lending agency would resume loan disbursements to
Indonesia in early July.
	   The IMF suspended a dlrs 43 billion bailout package last month
amid political turmoil that led to Suharto's downfall. Visiting
Jakarta, IMF official Hubert Neiss said increasing the amount of
aid to Indonesia was ``possible.''
	   Also Monday, U.S. and German envoys met new President B.J.
Habibie to offer their support for Indonesia's efforts to revive a
once-booming economy that is now virtually at a standstill.
	   Recovery is likely to take years in Indonesia, where political
stability is still in doubt despite the resignation of Suharto
after student protests and riots over price increases. His
successor, Habibie, has embarked on democratic reforms but foreign
investors remain wary and the rupiah is weak.
	   Dennis de Tray, the World Bank's director in Indonesia, warned
that mushrooming poverty will strip at least 20 mi1,200
people in Jakarta and left wide swaths of damage in other
Indonesian cities.
	   Shrinking family incomes will make it hard to keep children in
school, and women are likely to suffer more domestic violence and
divorce because of the economic strain, de Tray said.
	   About 28 million people currently live in poverty and that
figure could double, he said.
	   The crisis ``just does not seem to want to go away,'' de Tray
said at a news conference. Indonesia's economy, which had grown an
average of 7 percent annually in recent years, is expected to
contract by as much as 15 percent in 1998.
	   Visiting Jakarta, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers and Juergen Stark, state secretary at the German Finance
Ministry, urged Habibie in separate meetings to stick with economic
reforms.
	   ``The U.S. has an enormous interest in Indonesia, a country that
is the fourth most populous country in the world, a country that is
absolutely central in this key region,'' said Summers, who arrived
Sunday from Tokyo. There he encouraged Japanese officials to take
steps to revive their stagnant economy.
	   The United States is a big player in the IMF, which is working
with Indonesian officials to redesign the state budget to include
more subsidies for the poor.
	   De Tray said the World Bank, which pledged dlrs 4.5 billion as
part of the IMF-led bailout, has struggled to keep pace with
Indonesia's economic and political upheaval. He said the rupiah has
depreciated three times as much as currencies in Thailand, the
Philippines and other Asian countries hit by financial crisis.
	   The monopolistic business practices of Suharto's family and
associates exacerbated Indonesia's economic crisis, and public
anger over corruption allegations helped oust the former president.
	   ``The changes here have been completely unpredictable,'' de Tray
told an Indonesian reporter. ``Every time we get about ready to do
something, your country changes.''

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback members saying they will likely recommend non-binding referendum, Palestinian comment; EDITS to TRIM 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with justice minister and other Cabinet
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After consulting with legal advisers and
Cabinet colleagues, Israel's justice minister said Monday he
favored a non-binding referendum as the quickest way to gauge
public support for a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to
topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   However, Palestinian officials on Monday accused Netanyahu of
trying to waste more time and noted that Israel has already
committed to a withdrawal in U.S.-backed peace accords.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to make a
quick decision on a U.S. plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which was first
proposed in January, but Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S.
deadlines for an answer.
	   Ties between Israel and the United States were further strained
Sunday when the Cabinet approved a plan for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under the peace accords, the status of Jerusalem is to
be determined in negotiations with the Palestinians, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   The United States called Israel's expansion plan
``provocative.'' Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, said Monday it was concerned the plan would
``complicate the peace process at a very sensitive time.''
	   In a news conference Sunday, Netanyahu's aides said the plan
called for extending Jerusalem municipal authority over nearby
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but not for annexing them.
	   However, confusion remained Monday over what exactly had been
approved by the Cabinet on Sunday. The Maariv newspaper quoted
Cabinet ministers as saying that it was decided during the session
to expand the city's territory, not just extend municipal
authority.
	   Several ministers, including Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, demanded that Jerusalem expand in all directions. In the
end, the Cabinet decided on a territorial expansion, but did not
specify whether into Israel proper, the West Bank or both, the
newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately
available for comment Monday.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi on Monday convened legal advisers
and Cabinet colleagues, including Communications Minister Limor
Livnat, in his office to discuss the referendum proposal.
	   After the meeting, Hanegbi said he would probably recommend to
Netanyahu that he hold a non-binding referendum that could be
organized within 90 days. The results would not force the
government's hand, but would carry great moral weight.
	   ``The government cannot ignore the results,'' Hanegbi said. And
unlike a binding referendum, he said, ``It can be carried out in an
acceptable period of time.''
	   Israel has never held a referendum, and a binding poll would
have required changes in the country's basic laws, something akin
to a constitution. Such a process could take up to two years,
according to one researcher, former Israeli diplomat Alon Liel.
	   By making the referendum non-binding, there would only have to
be minimal legislation that could be completed within weeks,
Justice Ministry Orit Shemesh said.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said a referendum was a waste of
time, noting that Israel has already committed to the pullback in
U.S.-backed peace agreements approved by Israel's parliament.
	   ``The idea is a violation of the spirit and the letter of the
agreements,'' Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary-general of the
Palestinian Cabinet, said Monday.

Suspected North Korean submarine seized in South Korean waters 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS details
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea captured a midget
submarine believed to belong to North Korea on Monday after it
became entangled in a fishing boat's net, officials said.
	   ``The Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that the boat belongs to
North Korea,'' a spokesman said, adding that a navy ship had
attached a line and begun towing the vessel ashore.
	   ``We suspect there's somebody inside, but we don't know how
many,'' said the Joint Chiefs' spokesman, speaking on the usual
condition of anonymity.
	   He described the captured boat as a ``midget submersible.''
	   The navy said the craft was a 70-ton Yugo-class submarine, 3
meters (10 feet) wide and 18 meters (59 feet) long. North Korea is
believed to have a number of such craft, which normally carry a
crew of four or five.
	   Navy experts said North Korea usually uses Yugo-class subs for
infiltration of espionage agents and surveillance. The sub's main
weapons are machine guns.
	   The national news agency Yonhap said the boat's periscope got
caught in a fishing net about 18 kilometers (11 miles) east of
Sokcho, a coastal town just south of the North Korean border and
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set to drift from the stern of a South Korean
fishing vessel, which first spotted the entangled craft and radioed
maritime police and the military.
	   South Korean military units in the Sokcho area were put on a
heightened state of alert.
	   The state-run Korea Broadcasting System said men were seen on
the deck of the entangled craft trying to free it before it was
seized by the South Korean warship. Yonhap said the boat had been
listing and drifting.
	   The Defense Ministry sent four warships and a helicopter to the
scene, KBS reported.
	   The site is in the general area where a North Korean submarine
ran aground in September 1996, touching off a massive, 53-day
manhunt for its occupants.
	   The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans _
and sent relations between North and South Korea plunging to their
lowest level in years. One North Korean was captured and another
was believed to have escaped back across the border.
	   That submarine was almost twice as large as the one captured
Monday. It was a 325-ton Shark-class sub that measured 34 meters
(112 feet) from bow to stern.
	   South Korea will hold a national security meeting Tuesday to
review the latest incident. Officials said the matter also will be
raised when United Nations Command officials meet with North Korean
military counterparts at the border village of Panmunjom on Tuesday
for the first time in seven years.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Indian prime minister wants talks on Kashmir, but one-on-one deployed on border with Pakistan, comments on massacre. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with prime minister saying no missiles
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on Monday renewed calls to discuss Kashmir with neighbor
and rival Pakistan, but said he wanted no outside interference in
the territorial dispute some fear could spark nuclear war in South
Asia.
	   Vajpayee also denied Pakistani charges that he had deployed
short-range ballistic missiles on its borders with Pakistan, the
local news agency United News of India reported.	   Dismissing calls for third-party mediation, Vajpayee was quoted
as saying, ``With our common experience of colonialism, we should
be cautious of such attempts to internationalize problems in the
region.''
	   Pakistan wants mediation because it believes it is at a
disadvantage in one-one-one talks with its larger and more powerful
neighbor.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
gained independence from Britain in 1947. The Himalayan territory
is divided between them, and both claim it in its entirety.
	   A series of nuclear weapons tests by both nations last month
sparked concern their long-standing rivalry would lead to nuclear
war. Both sides have stressed the need for conciliation and
negotiation in recent days, but have been unable to agree on a time
and place for talks.
	   ``We view the bilateral framework of dialogue to be useful not
only for discussing Kashmir and other issues, but also all
necessary confidence-building measures to allay apprehensions of a
nuclear arms race in our region,'' Vajpayee was quoted as telling
reporters in the northern town of Shimla. .
	   Allegations of missile deployment by the Pakistani defense
minister were ``unnecessary noise,'' the report said.
	   Referring to last week's massacre of 25 Hindus by Muslim
militants in India's share of Kashmir, Vajpayee said a large number
of guerrillas were sneaking into India from Pakistan as the snow in
the Himalayas melted. Indian security forces were taking more
precautions, he said.
	   Predominately Hindu India regularly accuses officially Islamic
Pakistan of training and arming Muslim guerrillas to fight a proxy
war in Kashmir. Pakistan says it only gives them moral support.

Dirty war or political conspiracy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ One of the biggest political trials in
modern Spanish history entered its fifth week Monday with deputy
Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos denying that he conspired
against a former interior minister _ the key defendant.
	   The former cabinet member, Jose Barrionuevo, and 11 other men
are on trial for a 1983 botched kidnapping of a French businessman
that marked the debut of a death squad set up to target the armed
Basque separatist band ETA. The group identified itself as the GAL,
which is the Spanish acronym for Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups.
	   Cascos was called to the witness stand by the defense to bolster
the argument that Barrionuevo is the victim of a political
conspiracy orchestrated by the governing Popular Party.
	   The breaking of the GAL scandal in the early 1990s, and its slow
progress to trial, helped the Popular Party to electoral victory in
1996, ending 13 years of Socialist rule under Felipe Gonzalez.
	   Under oath Monday, Cascos denied that as an opposition deputy in
1994 he promised to secure pardons for two of the suspects if his
party won the elections, and if they would testify that Barrionuevo
was behind the GAL's abduction in 1983 of businessman Segundo
Marey.
	   Between 1983 and 1987 the GAL killed 27 people in its pursuit of
ETA in southern France. Most of its victims _ like Marey _ later
proved to have no connection with the separatists.
	   All of the dozen accused have already testified in the Supreme
Court trial that began May 25 and is expected to end next week.
	   Barrionuevo, along with his former chief of security Rafael
Vera, denied charges of kidnapping, belonging to an armed group and
misusing public funds that carry possible 23-year jail terms.
	   The remaining defendants, facing sentences of between eight and
21 years, admitted to involvement in the kidnapping that they said
was authorized by Barrionuevo and Vera.
	   Former Prime Minister Gonzalez is due to take the witness stand
Tuesday. He is expected to deny that the Socialists ever
overstepped the law in their fight against ETA, which has taken
responsibility for killing nearly 800 people in its
three-decade-long campaign for an independent Basque state.
	   Before the hearing began, Gonzalez said the GAL trial was the
hangover from a conspiracy to bring down his government.
	   Prosecutors are also seeking dlrs 240,000 compensation for
Marey, who had been mistaken for an ETA hitman and was released
unharmed after being held for 10 days.

Eds: UPDATES with three Serbs said kidnapped in Kosovo Polje, more
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russia pressed in vain Monday for an
end to Kosovo violence, but heavy fighting has broken out for
control of two key roads in the secessionist province, where the
Yugoslav army seems to be playing an increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, on Monday kidnapped three Serbs in Kosovo Polje, just
outside Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   Russia's foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed in Moscow to
fellow members of the six-nation Contact Group to give Serbia more
time to pull back its estimated 45,000 to 50,000 security forces in
Kosovo and to resume negotiations with ethnic Albanians, who
outnumber Serbs in the province nine to one.
	   A Primakov deputy, Nikolai Afanasyevsky, met in Pristina Monday
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged he would resume
talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his forces, saying they
battle terrorists.
	   The Albanians say they cannot negotiate while soldiers and
police loyal to Milosevic crack down on the militant separatists of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the process killing civilians and
driving tens of thousands of Albanians from home.
	   Rugova's deputy, Fehmi Agani, stressed after the meeting with
Afanasyevsky that the pullback is essential to any talks.
	   Both sides must act, the Russian insisted.
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. ``All terrorist activities should cease.''
	   For refugees to come home, ``it's not enough to bring in bricks
and cement,'' the Russian said. ``You have to create secure
conditions.''
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians.
	   Soldiers of the Serb-led Yugoslav army seem to be playing an
increasing role, not only securing Kosovo's border with Albania to
prevent guns being smuggled in to KLA militants, but also battling
the separatists in Kosovo's interior.
	   Associated Press reporter Paul Geitner saw an army tank and two
anti-aircraft guns parked right on the road from Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, to the southwestern city of Prizren Sunday. There was no
sign of actual fighting, but the road showed track marks of heavy
equipment passing recently.
	   In a letter printed in the independent Belgrade daily Nasa
Borba, a Yugoslav army soldier serving in Kosovo described daily
battles _ with dead and wounded on both sides _ between his unit
and Albanians.
	   ``All in all, it's horrible,'' the soldier wrote his mother, who
took his letter to a local newspaper in Zrenjanin 80 kilometers (50
miles) north of Belgrade. ``And don't worry _ if I were normal, I'd
go insane.''
	   Two Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro,
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation _ said they
defected from the army because of orders to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' Fahrudin Muric, one of the two, told Associated
Press Television when interviewed in the northeastern Albanian town
of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We were told to catch everyone who could not defend themselves
and then either kill them or take them to prison,'' said the other
defector, Fahrudin Avdic.
	   Bill Foxton, Bajram Curri reprenstative for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the two would be taken to
Tirana ``very soon,'' and their request for asylum, in a neutral
country, considered.
	   Sources affiliated with both Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants said the two sides were battling for control of the main
east-west and north-south arteries.
	   Fighting reportedly raged near the east-west road Sunday 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. The
Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said four Albanians were
wounded. The Serbs said Albanians killed an 18-year-old Serb
villager.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army forces
had opened fire on three villages in the south, sending civilians
fleeing to nearby woods.
	   The reports could not be independently verified.

Indian prime minister wants talks on Kashmir, but one-on-one pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RAISES denial on missiles, ADDS background. TRIMS previous. No
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on Monday dismissed Pakistani charges he had moved
missiles close to their shared border, and renewed calls for
one-on-one talks between the nuclear neighbors.
	   A series of nuclear weapons tests by both nations last month
sparked concern their long-standing rivalry could lead to nuclear
war.
	   United News of India quoted Vajpayee, speaking to reporters in
the northern town of Simla, as saying Pakistan was making
``unnecessary noise'' about the missiles.
	   During a parliamentary debate in Pakistan, Pakistani Defense
Secretary Khursheed Zaman had urged the United Nations to press New
Delhi to withdraw its missiles or ``Pakistan will be justified to
take action for our self-defense.''
	   Pakistan says India's medium-range Prithvi missiles, capable of
delivering a nuclear warhead, have been deployed at two locations
along its border with Pakistan.
	   Both countries are believed to be trying to develop the ability
to deliver nuclear weapons on their missiles.In April, Pakistan
tested its long-range Ghauri missile.
	   Vajpayee was quoted as saying he wanted to discuss Kashmir with
Pakistan, but rejected outside interference in the territorial
dispute some fear could spark nuclear war in South Asia.
	   ``With our common experience of colonialism, we should be
cautious of such attempts to internationalize problems in the
region,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Pakistan wants mediation because it believes it is at a
disadvantage in one-one-one talks with its larger and more powerful
neighbor.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
gained independence from Britain in 1947. The Himalayan territory
is divided between them, and both claim it in its entirety.
	   Both sides have stressed the need for conciliation and
negotiation in recent days, but have been unable to agree on a time
and place for talks.
	   Referring to last week's massacre of 25 Hindus by Muslim
militants in India's share of Kashmir, Vajpayee said a large number
of guerrillas were sneaking into India from Pakistan as the snow in
the Himalayas melted. Indian security forces were taking more
precautions, he said.
	   Predominately Hindu India regularly accuses officially Islamic
Pakistan of training and arming Muslim guerrillas to fight a proxy
war in Kashmir. Pakistan says it only gives them moral support.

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback on Cabinet decision 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment by Netanyahu adviser to newspaper report
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After consulting with legal advisers and
Cabinet colleagues, Israel's justice minister said Monday he
favored a non-binding referendum as the quickest way to gauge
public support for a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to
topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   However, Palestinian officials on Monday accused Netanyahu of
trying to waste more time and noted that Israel has already
committed to a withdrawal in U.S.-backed peace accords.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to make a
quick decision on a U.S. plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which was first
proposed in January, but Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S.
deadlines for an answer.
	   Ties between Israel and the United States were further strained
Sunday when the Cabinet approved a plan for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under the peace accords, the status of Jerusalem is to
be determined in negotiations with the Palestinians, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   The United States called Israel's expansion plan
``provocative.'' Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, said Monday it was concerned the plan would
``complicate the peace process at a very sensitive time.''
	   In a news conference Sunday, Netanyahu's aides said the plan
called for extending Jerusalem municipal authority over nearby
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but not for annexing them.
	   However, confusion remained Monday over what exactly had been
approved by the Cabinet on Sunday. The Maariv newspaper quoted
Cabinet ministers as saying that it was decided during the session
to expand the city's territory, not just extend municipal
authority.
	   Several ministers, including Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, demanded that Jerusalem expand in all directions, Maariv
said. In the end, the Cabinet decided on a territorial expansion,
but did not specify whether into Israel proper, the West Bank or
both, the newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the story was
baseless. ``No one is even thinking of annexation (of Jewish
settlements) at this point,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We have said we
will not touch anything affected by the Oslo (peace) agreements
which say no status changes can be made in the West Bank.''

Head of Philippine freeport to defy Estrada's order to step down 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The outspoken head of one of the
Philippines' most successful industrial estates said Monday he will
defy a plan by President-elect Joseph Estrada to remove him from
office.
	   Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority, said he would go to court to stop Estrada from removing
him from the Subic Bay freeport, a former U.S. naval base north of
Manila.
	   ``This is personal. I'm ready to debate with him in court about
this,'' Gordon said.
	   Estrada, a former senator who takes office June 30, said he
plans to fire Gordon on his first day in office.
	   Gordon's resistance is one of the few potential kinks in what
appears to be one of the most peaceful and orderly transfers of the
presidency in Philippine history.
	   Outgoing President Fidel Ramos has formed a transition committee
to oversee the turnover and incumbent officials have briefed
incoming ones on current projects and problems.
	   Gordon, former mayor of Olongapo City outside the Subic base,
had fought fiercely against Philippine senators, including Estrada,
who voted in 1991 not to extend the U.S. lease on the base. The
naval facility was closed the following year.
	   The base's closure caused more than 44,000 Filipinos to lose
their jobs and dealt a severe blow to the economy of surrounding
towns, including Olongapo, which provided services and
entertainment for U.S. servicemen.
	   Subic had been the largest U.S. naval base outside the United
States and was a major supply and training base for U.S. naval
forces in the western Pacific.
	   After the U.S. departure, Gordon, backed by hundreds of
volunteers, worked to transform the 62,000-acre (25,000-hectare)
base into one of the Philippines' most successful industrial hubs.
	   Ramos reappointed Gordon early this year to another six-year
term as the authority's chairman. Since a Philippine law created
the authority, Gordon argued the courts should decide whether
Estrada can tamper with its charter, which states the chairman is
appointed for six-year terms.
	   Estrada plans to replace Gordon with former congressman Felicito
Payumo, a long-time critic of Gordon.

U.S. and other diplomats leave Belarus for consultations UPGRADES attribution and Pearce quotes, CORRECTS that Polish ambassador not among those leaving.

Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with ambassadors leaving,
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from the United States and
five European countries left Belarus on Monday after being recalled
to their capitals for consultations over the government's attempt
to evict them from a diplomatic compound.
	   The dispute is the latest sign of conflict in Belarus' relations
with the West and, increasingly, with its onetime allies in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
Drozdy diplomatic compound and had ditches dug inside the
compound's gates, which prevented cars from entering.
	   British Ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce told the Foreign Ministry
on Monday that the European Union ``objected in the strongest terms
to the cut-off of water, electricity and telephone utilities, and
refusal to allow ambassadors' vehicles to enter the residential
complex.''
	   She informed the ministry that Belarus' ambassadors to EU
countries would be instructed to return to Minsk ``to convey in the
strongest terms the disapproval of EU governments of the latest
Belarusian actions.''
	   Germany has already asked the Belarusian ambassador to Bonn to
return home.
	   In addition to Pearce and U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, the
ambassadors from France, Greece, Italy and Germany left on a flight
to Frankfurt, Germany, on Monday afternoon.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it has sent
Boris Berezovsky, a Kremlin emissary responsible for relations with
the former Soviet republics, to Minsk to meet with Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
It did not say what was on Berezovsky's agenda.
	   Belarusian authorities have been trying to force ambassadors out
of their homes in a wooded compound on the outskirts of Minsk,
claiming the residences badly need of sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   The ambassadors say the order to leave violates the Vienna
Convention, which designates homes of ambassadors as territory of
their countries.
	   Lukashenko has claimed the diplomatic residences as his own
property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or plots on which
to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko has canceled a trip to Switzerland that had been
scheduled for Thursday, the Interfax news agency said. It did not
say why he had decided not to travel.

World Cup: Chile relying on key change to get it into the second round 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGIO CARRASCO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) - Needing a win to secure a berth in the
World Cup's second round, Chile is relying on a key change at
midfield to bolster the attack led by the explosive duo of Ivan
Zamorano and Marcelo Salas.
	   Chile meets Cameroon tomorrow in Nantes in the final day of
Group B action, and will advance to the round of 16 with a victory.
A tie also could put it through, depending on the result of the
Italy-Austria game in Saint-Denis.
	   Italy leads the group with four points from a 2-2 draw with
Chile and a win against Cameroon. Austria and Chile have 2 points
each, followed by Cameroon with one.
	   After two heartbreaking ties in which it gave an 84th minute
goal to Italy and an injury-time goal to Austria, Chile is looking
for a comfortable margin against Cameroon to vault it to first
place should Austria beat Italy. The group's second place team goes
on to face world champion Brazil in the second round.
	   So far, Salas has been his brilliant self, scoring all three
Chilean goals, while Zamorano has been all heart and soul of the
attack. But they need more scoring chances and head coach Nelson
Acosta hopes midfielder Jose Luis Sierra will be the key.
	   Sierra was a starter throughout Chile's Cup qualifying matches.
But Fabian Estay became the starting playmaker after an excellent
showing in the Mexican first division, where his team won the
title.
	   ``They're both reliable players, but with different traits,''
Acosta said about Estay and Sierra.
	   ``Estay moves around more and Sierra relies on long passes,'' he
said yesterday while announcing the change.
	   Sierra's task is simple enough: take charge and get the ball to
Zamorano and Salas. The rest, Acosta hopes, will take care of
itself.
	   But Cameroon, which also gave up an injury-time goal against
Austria, also needs a win in order to have a chance of making it
into the knockout round.
	   ``We have no other choice but to beat Chile,'' said midfielder
Joseph-Desire Job.
	   Head coach Claude Leroy, from France, has been reminding his
players they ``have to finally do something against Chile, which
would open a door to the second round.''
	   Leroy will have to do without defender Raymond Kalla Nkongo, who
was suspended by FIFA for two games for ``serious foul play'' in
the match against Austria.
	   His absence may contribute to what Salas sees as Cameroon's
weakest feature, ``a poorly organized defense, something we can
take advantage of.''
	   Likely starters:
	   CHILE: Nelson Tapia, Ronald Fuentes, Pedro Reyes, Javier Margas,
Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence
Acuna, Jose Luis Sierra, Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   CAMEROON: Jacques Songo'o; Pierre Wome, Rigobert Song, Samuel
Eto'o, Pierre Njanka, Joseph Ndo; Salomon Olembe, Patrick Mboma,
Didier Angibeau, Samuel Ipoua, Francois Omam Biyick.

General Motors signs dlrs 230 million venture in China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ General Motors Corp. has signed a dlrs 230
million joint venture agreement with China's FAW-Jinbei Automotive
Co. to manufacture pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, GM
said Monday.
	   The 50-50 joint venture, known as Jinbei GM Automotive Co., will
be located in Shenyang, Liaoning province, in northeast China. The
company will manufacture the Chevrolet Blazer four-door sport
utility vehicle and the Chevrolet S-10 crew cab pickup.
	   Production will begin in the year 2000, GM said. The company
plans to manufacture 4,000 vehicles during the first year of
operation and eventually produce 50,000 a year.
	   FAW-Jinbei Automotive was formed in 1995 from the merger of
Jinbei Automotive Co. and First Auto Works.
	   GM has 18 ventures in China, including those with its business
divisions Delphi Automotive Systems and Delco Electronics.
	   Monday's deal is a restructuring of an earlier joint venture
agreement with Jinbei from 1992, GM officials said. Since then,
there have been changes in China's auto industry and market,
including the merger of FAW and Jinbei in 1995.
	   With the restructured agreement, GM is boosting its investment
in the venture from dlrs 132 million and increasing its share,
originally set at 30 percent.
	   GM's joint venture plant with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.
is on schedule to open by the end of this year, said George Green,
GM China's director of sales and distribution marketing.
	   The Shanghai GM plant, which will make Buicks, will have a full
production capacity of 100,000 vehicles a year.
	   GM will initially aim to sell its Buick models to government
officials and other institutional buyers, who are estimated to
account for about 80 percent of sales.
	   The Shanghai plant will import about dlrs 1.6 billion in parts,
components and equipment from North and South America during the
first five years, while 50 percent of parts will come from domestic
sources, said Rudy Schlais, GM's president for China operations.

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback expansion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with government comment on newspaper report of
By KARIN LAUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After consulting with legal advisers and
Cabinet colleagues, Israel's justice minister said Monday he
favored a non-binding referendum as the quickest way to gauge
public support for a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to
topple him over a troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to make a
quick decision on a U.S. plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which was first
proposed in January, but Netanyahu has ignored informal U.S.
deadlines for an answer.
	   Palestinian officials accused Netanyahu of trying to waste more
time and noted that Israel has already committed to a withdrawal in
U.S.-backed peace accords.
	   Ties between Israel and the United States were further strained
Sunday when the Cabinet approved a plan for the expansion of
Jerusalem. Under the peace accords, the status of Jerusalem is to
be determined in negotiations with the Palestinians, and both sides
pledged not to make changes on the ground in the meantime.
	   The United States called Israel's expansion plan
``provocative.'' Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of
the European Union, said Monday it was concerned the plan would
``complicate the peace process at a very sensitive time.''
	   In a news conference Sunday, Netanyahu's aides said the plan
called for extending Jerusalem municipal authority over nearby
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but not for annexing them.
	   Confusion remained over what exactly had been approved by the
Cabinet on Sunday. The Maariv newspaper quoted Cabinet ministers as
saying that it was decided during the session to expand the city's
territory, not just extend municipal authority.
	   Several ministers, including Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, demanded that Jerusalem expand in all directions. In the
end, the Cabinet decided on a territorial expansion, but did not
specify whether into Israel proper, the West Bank or both, the
newspaper said.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the story was
baseless. ``No one is even thinking of annexation (of Jewish
settlements) at this point,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We have said we
will not touch anything affected by the Oslo (peace) agreements
which say no status changes can be made in the West Bank.''

State court reviews life sentence of RAF terrorist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A state court began reviewing the
prison sentence of leftist Red Army Faction terrorist Birgit
Hogefeld on Monday, three months after judges overturned her
conviction in a prison bombing.
	   That bombing, in Darmstadt in 1993, represents only part of
Hogefeld's Nov. 1996 conviction and life sentence. She was also
found guilty of murder in connection with the 1994 bombing of a
U.S. Air Force base and of attempted murder in a failed attack on
federal Finance Ministry state secretary Hans Tietmeyer in 1988.
	   In March, Germany's highest court overturned her conviction in
the prison bombing for lack of evidence. The decision did not
change her life sentence, but opened the possibility for Hogefeld
to be eligible for parole after 15 years.
	   The Hesse state court in Frankfurt was expected to decide this
week.
	   The Red Army Faction grew out of the 1960s leftist student
movement and staged numerous attacks on NATO and U.S. military
targets as well as German business leaders over more than two
decades.
	   Hogefeld, 41, has asked the court to take into consideration her
call, made during her two-year trial, for the RAF to cease its
terrorist activities. The group officially disbanded earlier this
year.

Former South African President P.W. Botha remarries 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo planned

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Just a few months ago, former
President P.W. Botha was engaged to a woman 34 years his junior. On
Monday, Botha got married _ to a different woman.
	   Nicknamed the Big Crocodile because of his snappish temper and
ruthless rule during apartheid, the 82-year-old Botha's love life
has forced journalists to scramble to keep up with the latest
development.
	   Five months after his wife, Elize, died of a heart attack last
year, Botha became engaged to Reinette Te Water Naude, a widow 34
years his junior. When Botha went to court earlier this year to
face trial for snubbing a panel investigating apartheid-era abuses,
she was by his side.
	   But Botha dumped her because she was seeing another man,
according to media reports.
	   The new woman in Botha's life is Barbara Robertson, a
57-year-old legal secretary. They met at a launch for his
autobiograpy ``Voice From the Wilderness,'' a play on the name of
Botha's hometown of Wilderness.
	   The couple were wed in Botha's home as about 14 family members
and friends looked on, according to one of the guests.
	   ``It was a very nice ceremony. It was really quite romantic,''
the guest, who declined to be named, told The Associated Press.
``He looked very happy.''
	   The guest said the couple planned a honeymoon as soon as Botha's
trial is over. He is on trial for ignoring a legal summons to
appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Final
arguments are scheduled for August 17, with a verdict expected the
following day.
	   If convicted, Botha face a possible two years in jail or an
unspecified fine.
	   Wilderness is located 240 miles (385 kilometers) east of Cape
Town.

Solana says all options open to resolve Kosovo crisis 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
By SUSAN LADIKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ NATO is ready to step in and take
whatever steps are necessary to end the crisis in Kosovo, Secretary
General Javier Solana said Monday at a NATO workshop.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' to stop the fighting in the
troubled Yugoslav province, Solana told the gathering of
high-ranking political, military and economic officials from Europe
and North America.
	   ``Political, economic and military pressure worked in Bosnia.
There's no reason why a similar approach should not have a similar
effect in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died this year in fighting between
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels. Many of those killed in the
clashes have been women, children and the elderly.
	   While the Bosnian and Kosovo conflicts are different, Solana
said, but are similar ``because there has been revival of the cruel
practice of ethnic cleansing.''
	   ``We have to put an end to this outrage,'' he added.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo.
They also form the bulk of the estimated 65,000 people who have
fled their homes in the face of fierce fighting.
	   Most refugees are within Kosovo, but more than 12,000 have fled
to neighboring Albania and thousands more to Montenegro, which with
Serbia makes up the Yugoslav federation.
	   Members of the six-nation Contact Group, comprised of the United
States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, still are pushing for
a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   NATO staged a show of force last week, with 85 aircraft flying
over Albania and Macedonia near their borders with Yugoslavia.
	   That action has done nothing to deter Yugoslavia, which has
between 45,000 and 50,000 troops in Kosovo.
	   In a Moscow meeting last week, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic promised Russian President Boris Yeltsin he would resume
talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. But separatist Albanians say
Serb forces must be withdrawn before talks can continue.
	   Milosevic's promises must be transformed into action. ``Time is
running out,'' Solana said. ``We are tired of too many words.''
	   A senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity
at a press briefing, said NATO is expected to consider whether to
send ground or air forces to the region.
	   He added NATO wants to defuse the crisis, not escalate it, and
has no interest in bombing Serbia proper.
	   NATO's objectives are to stop the fighting, get negotiations
started, and achieve a settlement, Solana said.
	   ``Our continent simply will not find lasting peace and stability
if the Balkans remains volatile,'' Solana said.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille. Hospital officials said Monday his condition had not
changed.

Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard told reporters. ``He is
still in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   The man who attacked the officer and was later arrested was
identified Monday as a 27-year-old German man from Hanover, German
police said.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained by police, the
Interior Ministry said Monday.
	   Six Germans detained during the clashes with police before and
after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   But the vast majority were detained for drunkenness, the
ministry said, and would be released later Monday.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said Monday the violence was
``unacceptable.'' German Chancellor Helmue Kohl said it was ``a
scandal for our nation.''

of the hooligans as ``fascists.''

Official in Zhirinovsky's party dies after shooting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A representative of Russian ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky has died after being shot in the former Soviet
republic of Moldova, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Alexander Saydakov, the envoy for Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic Party in Moldova's secessionist Trans-Dniestr region,
was shot in the head and chest on June 12.
	   Zhirinovsky's party said the shooting was politically motivated,
but police said it was connected to Saydakov's real estate
businesses.
	   Police said two young gunmen shot Saydakov in his office in
Tiraspol, capital of Trans-Dniester. One person has been arrested
in connection with the shooting.
	   Saydakov, who was a deputy and a transportation minister for in
Trans-Dniestr, is one of the best known businessman in the region
with prosperous building and real estate investments. He is a local
Liberal Democratic Party leader.
	   Trans-Dniestr broke away in 1990, fearing Moldova planned to
unite with Romania. Moldova was part of Romania before World War
II.

World Cup: Scots seek elusive second round; Morocco carrying hopes of Arab world AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Scotland is trying to make the
second round for the first time in eight attempts. Morocco has the
weight of the Arab world on its shoulders.
	   There seems so much depending on Tuesday's World Cup game that
the pressure is huge. Yet the odds are that both will be
disappointed and go home early.
	   The Scots and Moroccans are third and fourth in Group A behind
already-qualified Brazil and a Norwegian team which has a one-point
advantage over both.
	   If Norway beats Brazil, then the game in Geoffrey-Guichard
stadium will count for nothing, whoever wins. If the
Scotland-Morocco game is a tie, Norway can even afford to lose 1-0
to the Brazilians who top the standings with a maximum six points
from two games.
	   It's a familiar experience for the Scots.
	   They know how to play their best soccer and win their last game
when it's too late. It happened at the 1978 World Cup when they
scored a 3-2, first round group victory over the Netherlands who
went on to make the final. At the last European Championship two
years ago, the Scots beat Switzerland but went out because other
results went against them.
	   Will it happen again?
	   The Scots showed their fighting spirit against the mighty
Brazilians in the opening game and were level at 1-1 before an own
goal by Tommy Boyd, who couldn't get out of the way of a rebound
off his own goalkeeper, condemned his team to a 2-1 loss.
	   Then they hit back to tie 1-1 with the Norwegians after falling
behind.
	   The Moroccans, beaten easily by Brazil last time out, started
with a 2-2 tie with Norway and led the Norwegians twice.
	   With Saudi Arabia already out and the Tunisians losing their
opening game to England, the Moroccans said they carried the hopes
of the whole Arab world as they faced the Scots.
	   ``We're not just carrying the hopes of 30 million Moroccans, but
those of at least 150 million Arabs on our shoulders,'' Atlas Lions
striker Abdeljilil Hadda said during the buildup to the game.
``It's not an easy burden to bear.''
	   Star midfielder Moustafa Hadji warned the Scots to expect a
strong Moroccan challenge from the first whistle.
	   ``We want to take control of the match from the start,'' he
said. ``We have the aspirations of all Moroccans and Arabs on our
minds.''
	   Both teams will need to change their lineups. Scottish defender
Colin Calderwood can't play because of a broken right hand and
Darren Jackson and Morocco's Said Chiba collected yellow cards
against both Brazil and Norway so miss the game through one-match
suspensions.
	   Calderwood's injury means that Matt Elliott might get his first
World Cup game if coach Craig Brown decides against fielding David
Weir, who set up the equalizer for Craig Burley against Norway.
	   ``I chose David Weir to do a particular job in that match,''
Brown explained. ``I am not ruling out Matt Elliott for the game
against Morocco.
	   He has had a very good season for his club and has looked bright
in training. It is a straight toss-up between the two players as to
who will face Morocco and replace Calderwood.''

APEC member countries to submit individual plans for freer trade 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum will submit revised versions of their
``individual action plans'' for freer trade for review by fellow
members by Oct. 15, Malaysia's trade minister said Monday.
	   Rafidah Aziz said the grouping's 18 members stated that the
plans would also include private sector views.
	   The plans are to show what each country is willing and able to
do on its own to liberalize and promote trade and investment.
	   Rafidah said that with respect to collective action plans, more
than 30 ``trade and investment liberalization and facilitation''
programs should be realized this year.
	   APEC members not affected by the Asian slowdown should do what
they can to mitigate the effects of the crisis for all other
members, she said. In all the sessions of the current APEC meeting,
she added, ``there's always reference to the turmoil.''
	   She added that those members affected by the Asian economic
turmoil must do ``what needs to be done to get out of the
turmoil.''
	   The grouping's trade ministers also approved a program presented
by their senior trade officials to promote electronic commerce.
	   On Tuesday, the ministers plan to discuss the ``early voluntary
sectoral liberalization'' plan involving nine select sectors, the
impact of market liberalization, and consolidation of APEC
trade-barrier reduction agreements into the World Trade
Organization.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwaiti government unveiled a new draft
resolution Monday aimed at encouraging foreign investment in this
oil-rich country, the minister of commerce and industry said
	   Abdul-Aziz al-Dakheel said under the law, which has to be
approved by Parliament, foreign investors will not have to pay
taxes or customs duties for 10 years.
	   They will also be able to employ foreigners if there locals were
not available.
	   On Sunday, the government asked the Ministry of Interior and
Commerce to set up a special office at Kuwait's port and airport to
issue one-week visas to businessmen.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Some 60 experts from a consortium of
foreign consulting firms are preparing a dlrs 1.2 million viability
study on transforming Jordan's southern Red Sea port of Aqaba into
a free zone, an official said Monday.
	   Mohammed Abdo, director of tenders at the Aqaba Port Authority,
said the U.S.-based The Service Group comprises of U.S., Irish and
Malaysian consultants specialized in creating free zones worldwide.
	   He told The Associated Press that the study will be financed by
the World Bank, which recommended the study upon the Jordanian
government's wish to transform its lone sea outlet into a free
zone.
	   Abdo said the free zone will attract foreign investment in
industry, transportation and tourism, five-star hotels, houses and
factories.
	   Aqaba is 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the Jordanian
capital, Amman. It neighbors Red Sea resorts in Israel, Saudi
Arabia and Egypt.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Dubai's state-owned Emirates
Group made a record profit of 371 million dirhams (dlrs 101.6
million) from April 1997 till March this year, up 91 percent from
the previous year's profit of 194 million dirhams (dlrs 53
million), the company's chairman announced Monday.
	   ``It was the best year ever for the Emirates group, enabling us
to declare a dividend to the government of Dubai of 40 million
dirhams (dlrs 11 million),'' said Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum.
	   The group is made up of Emirates airlines and Dubai airport's
ground handling agent and travel management company DNATA.
	   The airline division posted a profit of 262 million dirhams
(dlrs 71.8 million), up 135 percent from the previous year's 111.5
million dirhams (dlrs 30.5 million). Profits from DNATA rose 32
percent to 109 million dirhams (dlrs 30 million), up from 82.7
million (dlrs 22.6 million) the previous year.
	   The company said the airline carried 3.7 million passengers and
200,000 tons of cargo during the same period.

Iranian soccer players weep after victory over US, party with fans 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - Iranian players wept in the locker room
after their World Cup victory over the United States, a game they
said they wanted to win for their nation.
	   After Sunday's 2-1 win, the team was mobbed by hundreds of
soccer fans who stormed the hotel where the players were housed
under tight security in this city in the heart of France.
	   Players and fans joked and partied into the early hours of the
morning. Though fans were clearly in party mode, they abstained
from ordering alcoholic drinks at the bar in order not to insult
players who abided by Muslim drinking restrictions.
	   Iran's coach Jalal Talebi, whose wife and three sons live in
California, joked with members of an all-Iranian team from San Jose
that he coaches in his spare time. Talebi was picked only a month
ago to head Iran in its first World Cup appearance in 20 years.
	   ``What's the matter with you kids? You never wanted my signature
before,'' he joked, as his Californian players thrust soccer balls
and T-shirts for him to sign.
	   When he said he would give them as many signatures as they want
the next time he went to California, one player quipped: ``You
ain't going nowhere coach. You think they're going to let you in
after you just whipped them in the World Cup?''
	   Talebi and his family are residents of the United States, but
don't have citizenship.
	   Soccer officials said all of the players wept with joy and
embraced in the locker room after the game. Hamid Estili got on his
knees and kissed the ground after scoring the first goal of the
game.
	   With 20 years of tense ties between Iran and the United States
that followed the overthrow of the U.S.-supported shah in 1979 and
the taking of U.S. hostages in Tehran, the match was the most
politically charged at this World Cup.
	   ``It was a big moment for us. We won our first World Cup match
in 20 years, we became the first Asian team to win a game at this
World Cup, and we won a highly sensitive match,'' said team
spokesman Khosrow Valizadeh.
	   Estili's goal in the 40th minute and Mehdi Mahdavikia's in the
84th gave Iran the win that all Iranians wanted. Brian McBride
scored the only U.S. goal in the 88th minute with a header.
	   After the game, millions of Iranians poured into the streets of
Tehran for a massive celebration. In Lyon, American and U.S. fans
partied together, oblivious to the history of bad blood between the
two countries.
	   Talebi and some of the players played down the victory over a
country many officials back home still call the ``Great Satan.''
	   ``It was a big victory for the Iranian nation, not because it
was the United States, but because it was the first in the World
Cup,'' Talebi said.
	   The United States must still play Yugoslavia, but the loss
against Iran quashed its chances of advancing to the second round.
Iran could still advance if Yugoslavia beats the United States by
at least a two goal margin, and the Iranians manage the nearly
impossible by drawing against the highly-rated Germans.
	   ``We're going in to win against Germany because we have nothing
to lose,'' said Talebi. ``But even if we lose, we will have lost to
a former world champion, and that will be no shame for us,'' he
said.
	   ``We will do to Germany just what we did to the United States,''
said Iran's diminutive striker Khodadad Azizi, who plays in the
German Bundesliga, along with fellow teammates Karim Bagheri and
Khodadad Azizi.
	   Mahdavikia, who was recognized as Iran's rising star even before
his winning goal against the United States, will be going to
Italy's Inter Milan, Iranian soccer officials said.
	   Talebi was gracious in victory, offering comforting words to
U.S. coach Steve Sampson in front of reporters after the game.
	   ``You deserve to be winning too. But in the end, one team must
win and one must lose,'' he said.

Gunmen kill daughter of mayoral candidate, wound three relatives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Gunmen have killed the daughter of
a defeated mayoral candidate and wounded three other relatives in
an ambush in the southern Philippines, police said Monday.
	   Police chief Karib Muammil said Baksi Pia, 40, a daughter of
former Sibuco Mayor Habibon Pia, was shot several times in the face
and body Sunday and died on the spot. Her 28-year-old brother
Allen, a nephew and a niece were wounded in the attack on the
outskirts of Zamboanga City.
	   The victims were visiting a family-owned flower farm when they
were ambushed by the gunmen aboard two pickup trucks, police said.
The men fled after the attack.
	   No suspects have been identified and an investigation is
continuing, Muammil said.
	   But an investigator who asked not to be named said the case may
be connected with the May 11 general elections in which Habibon Pia
lost.
	   A few days after the elections, a group of unidentified men
threw a grenade into a victory party for the winning mayoral
candidate, killing two people and injuring 26, four seriously,
police said.
	   No suspects were identified in that incident.

German hooligans riot in northern France; policeman in coma French interior minister, French and German leaders.

By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille. Hospital officials said Monday his condition had not
changed.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard told reporters. ``He is
still in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   The man who attacked the officer and was later arrested was
identified Monday as a 27-year-old German man from Hanover, German
police said.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained by police, the
Interior Ministry said Monday.
	   Six Germans detained during the clashes with police before and
after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   But the vast majority were detained for drunkenness, the
ministry said, and would be released later Monday.
	   French President Jacques Chirac said Monday the violence was
``unacceptable.'' German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said it was ``a
scandal for our nation.''
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement described some
of the hooligans as ``fascists.''

U.S. archaeologists attempt to smuggle artifacts out of Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customs and security officers seized several
hundred artifacts that a group of American archaeologists tried to
smuggle out of Russia, officials said Monday.
	   The objects, dating from the 12th to the early 20th centuries,
had been excavated near the central Russian city of Saratov, said
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The most valuable artifacts included a bronze cross and gold
coins from the Golden Horde era _ a period in the 13th and 14th
century when Russia was ruled by Mongol invaders.
	   Airport officials found several hundred artifacts hidden in the
luggage, clothes and equipment of the eight archaeologists,
Yastrzhembsky said. He did not say when they were found.
	   The head of the Russian Federal Security Service, Nikolai
Kovalyov, reported the incident to President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday, Yastrzhembsky said. Russia planned to send a protest note
to the U.S. Embassy.
	   The archaeologists were allowed to leave Russia, but will be
barred from re-entering the country, he said.
	   Saratov is located about 700 kilometers (450 miles) southeast of
Moscow.

World Cup: Milutinovic thinking big with Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Two weeks and two wins have made a world
of difference for Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic.
	   His job security was in doubt after a series of dismal World Cup
warmup outings, but the Super Eagles' boss has the team already
into the second round with a game to spare and spoke Monday of
reaching the final.
	   ``Everybody hopes to be Paris on July 12,'' Milutinovic told
reporters after putting his charges through a training session
emphasizing short passes and ball control. ``Everything about the
team convinces me. These players can beat anyone. We have a lot of
talent and confidence. There are teams that are better than us but,
like in life, anything is possible at the World Cup.''
	   He should know.
	   The native Yugoslavian is the first man to lead four different
countries into the round of 16, having done so previously with
Mexico in 1986, Costa Rica just months after being hired in 1990
and the United States four years ago.
	   By rallying twice to stun Spain 3-2 in its opener and then
holding off Bulgaria 1-0, Nigeria clinched first place in Group D.
``It's been much easier than we thought. It's great for us,''
Milutinovic said. ``I did not expect we'd have six points after two
games.''
	   Paraguay awaits Wednesday in Toulouse for a match that
Milutinovic said will allow for some fine-tuning. Nigeria's second
round match will be Sunday against the runner-up in Group C.
	   ``We have to consider our needs for Sunday,'' he said. ``It's
just great that we can depend on ourselves and don't have to rely
on anyone else now.''
	   Milutinovic could be able to rely on an extra weapon if Nwankwo
Kanu continues to improve. The Inter Milan striker, who had heart
valve surgery 19 months ago, saw his first World Cup action as a
substitute in the last 20 minutes against Bulgaria. He looked rusty
at times, though has been impressive in practice.
	   What Kanu needs, Milutinovic has said, to regain his touch is
full-speed game action, and that could happen against Paraguay.
	   ``I am very happy with all 22 players. Fortunately everyone is
healthy,'' he said. ``I think there will be some changes in the
lineup for Paraguay.''
	   One player who could make room for Kanu in the first 11 is
Victor Ikpeba, author of the winner against Bulgaria. The AS Monaco
striker also picked up a yellow card in that game, and Milutinovic
indicated he will sit out his booked players to avoid suspensions
for the second round.
	   ``I think it's good for the team to allow some other players to
play and show their qualities at the World Cup,'' Ikpeba said.
``That game next Sunday is more crucial. We're thinking more about
Sunday.''

Officials go on trial for organizing deforestation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Three local officials went on trial Monday
in the northern Vietnamese province of Lai Chau for allegedly
organizing mass deforestation, court officials said.
	   A commune chief, his deputy and a commune policeman were
arrested in March for their role in organizing a burn-off operation
on 20 hectares (50 acres) of forest in the Dien Bien district. They
face up to a year in prison if convicted.
	   Sixty families, all from the Hmong ethnic minority, participated
in the mass deforestation to facilitate their traditional
slash-and-burn cultivation practice. They were ordered to replant
the area, the official said.
	   Vietnam's forests have shrunk considerably in recent decades
because of rampant slash-and-burn activities. Officials said the
recent drought, the worst in a century, was exacerbated by
deforestation.

World Cup: France faces week without Zizou; calculations for Danish game 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes, latest info. RECASTS throughout.
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The host nation is expected to
sideline key players against the last Group C opponent Denmark on
Wednesday, knowing a draw will be enough to make its passage into
the final World Cup stages a lot easier.
	   Star playmaker Zinedine Zidane, expelled against Saudi Arabia,
is suspended for the next two games, but coach Aime Jacquet said
Monday he is also considering to protect players with a yellow card
from additional suspensions during the game in Lyon.
	   ``The yellow cards worry me the most,'' said Jacquet. Defensive
stalwarts Bixente Lizarazu and Laurent Blanc and midfield pillars
Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit already have one warning and a
second yellow would rule them out of the round-of-16 match next
Sunday.
	   Jacquet said he was convinced France would continue its great
play, even with several starters sidelined as a precaution
Wednesday.
	   ``We want to finish the first round in brilliant fashion,'' said
Jacquet.
	   After two sparkling wins over Saudi Arabia and South Africa,
France has confirmed its role as tournament favorite.
	   ``We have to keep that competitive edge and winning spirit.
There should be no lapse in between,'' he said.
	   A victory or draw would let France win Group C and avoid surging
Nigeria in the round-of-16 and a potential clash with Brazil in the
quarterfinal.
	   ``It's not that we fear anyone but we should not set traps for
ourselves if we can avoid it,'' said Youri Djorkaeff, who will be
forced into a leadership role now that Zidane is suspended.
	   On top of that, there is nothing like being on a roll.
	   All eyes will be centered on how Jacquet adapts his team to
compensate for the loss of the Juventus star. Jacquet has called
Zidane the genius France cannot do without if it wants to lift the
World Cup July 12.
	   But all that has been put into question because of his two-game
suspension for deliberately planting his studs in the side of an
opponent.
	   ``The lack of Zidane is a big worry,'' said Jacquet.
	   If France keeps winning, Zidane returns to the lineup for the
July 3-4 quarterfinals.
	   Meanwhile Jacquet is expected to introduce Robert Pires of
Racing Metz to fill in the gap. At 24, Pires has led provincial
Metz into next season's European Champions League as French
runner-up to Lens. But despite 15 selections for Les Bleus, he has
yet to make a big impression on the international stage.
	   He will be able to use the help of Inter Milan's Djorkaeff, like
Zidane another battle-hardened star from Italy's Serie A.
	   ``I sometimes think the players have no confidence in me,''
Pires said.
	   Djorkaeff could be pulled into the center to provide authority
and help get balls to the two 20-year-old forwards, Thierry Henry
and David Trezeguet.
	   Henry already scored three goals in the first two games.
	   On top of that, Jacquet will be able to count of striker
Stephane Guivarc'h again. Guivarc'h was the starting World Cup
striker for France but he injured his left knee in the opening
stages of the first game.
	   If France survives the Denmark game, it will bypass Nigeria and
play either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay in the second round in
Lens.
	   Whatever happens, Zidane is convinced his World Cup role is far
from over.
	   ``I'll rejoin my colleagues in the quarterfinal,'' he said.

	   MAKHACHKALA, Dagestan (AP) _ A remote-controlled bomb blew up a
truck carrying Russian riot police officers near the border with
Chechnya on Monday, killing the driver and wounding three other
people.
	   Gunmen then opened fire on the overturned vehicle, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The explosive was planted on a road near the village of
Solnechnoye in Russia's republic of Dagestan, the police press
service said. The 10 officers in the truck were members of a
Russian riot police force deployed to guard the border with
Chechnya.
	   The Interior Ministry said that the explosive was a
remote-controlled bomb, Interfax and the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Since the end of Chechnya's independence war against Russia two
years ago, the separatist republic has become a center of violent
crime that has spread into Dagestan and other neighboring Russian
regions. The republics' own, internal conflicts also contribute to
the unrest.
	   Kidnappings are rampant in the region. The latest victim was a
10-year-old boy, who five gunmen on horseback seized outside the
village of Komargon in North Ossetia on Monday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In another violent incident, attackers opened fire with grenade
launchers on a Russian border guards' helicopter base in Dagestan
late Sunday night.
	   One serviceman was injured in the attack on the helicopter
squadron, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing the border
guards' command. The attackers fled in a car after the shooting.
	   No significant damage was reported, but investigators were
searching the military base, located near the town of Kaspiisk, for
explosive devices that may have been planted, ITAR-Tass and
Interfax said.
	   Officials blamed the attack on unspecified criminal groups
seeking to disrupt upcoming parliamentary elections in the
republic.
	   ``Criminal bandit gangs are again trying to exert psychological
and military pressure on Russian border guards and destabilize the
situation in the region, just as they did two years ago,'' border
guards spokesman Sergei Ivanchenko was quoted as saying by
Interfax.
	   The Borderguard Service issued a statement after the attack
saying it would ``use all forces and means at its disposal to
uphold Russia's state interests in the Caucasus and to stabilize
the situation there,'' ITAR-Tass reported on Monday.
	   In 1996, 56 people were killed in a bomb blast in a building
housing Russian border guard officers and their families.

Eds: UPDATES with three Serbs said kidnapped near Pristina, more
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russia pressed in vain Monday for an
end to Kosovo violence, but heavy fighting has broken out for
control of two key roads in the secessionist province, where the
Yugoslav army seems to be playing an increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants kidnapped three Serbs in
Kosovo Polje, a Serb stronghold just outside Pristina, Serbian
sources said.
	   Fighting reportedly raged near the east-west road Sunday 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital. The Albanians' Kosovo
Information Center said four Albanians were wounded. The Serbs said
Albanians killed an 18-year-old Serb villager.
	   Sources affiliated with both Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants said the two sides were battling for control of the main
east-west and north-south arteries.
	   Russian envoy Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina Monday with a
senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as possible''
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge to resume talks with
Albanian moderates, made in Moscow last week.
	   The Albanians say they cannot negotiate while soldiers and
police loyal to Milosevic crack down on the militant separatists of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the process killing civilians and
driving tens of thousands of Albanians from their homes. Rugova's
deputy, Fehmi Agani, stressed after the meeting that the pullback
is essential to any talks.
	   Milosevic has refused to pull back his forces, saying they
battle terrorists.
	   Both sides must act, the Russian insisted.
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. ``All terrorist activities should cease.''
	   For refugees to come home, ``it's not enough to bring in bricks
and cement,'' the Russian said. ``You have to create secure
conditions.''
	   Afanasyevsky's boss, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, appealed
in Moscow to fellow members of the six-nation Contact Group to give
Serbia more time to pull back its estimated 45,000 to 50,000
security forces in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
in the province nine to one.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians.
	   Soldiers of the Serb-led Yugoslav army seem to be playing an
increasing role, not only securing Kosovo's border with Albania to
prevent guns being smuggled in to KLA militants, but also battling
the separatists in Kosovo's interior.
	   In a letter printed in the independent Belgrade daily Nasa
Borba, a Yugoslav army soldier serving in Kosovo described daily
battles _ with dead and wounded on both sides _ between his unit
and Albanians.
	   ``All in all, it's horrible,'' the soldier wrote his mother, who
took his letter to a local newspaper in Zrenjanin 80 kilometers (50
miles) north of Belgrade.
	   Two Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro,
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation _ said they
defected from the army because of orders to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' Fahrudin Muric, one of the two, told Associated
Press Television when interviewed in the northeastern Albanian town
of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We were told to catch everyone who could not defend themselves
and then either kill them or take them to prison,'' said the other
defector, Fahrudin Avdic.

U.N.: Ozone-depleting chemicals start decline but no recovery yet 
</HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Chemicals that destroy the planet's protective
ozone layer are entering the atmosphere at a slower rate, but it
could be 20 years before ozone levels recover noticeably, the
United Nations said Monday.
	   ``The ozone layer is currently in its most vulnerable state,''
said World Meteorological Organization ozone expert Rumen Bojkov,
noting that chemicals already in the atmosphere take years to rise
to the stratosphere, where the destruction takes place.
	   The next two decades could see ``ozone depletion stronger than
anything else observed until now,'' he added.
	   Levels of the gases most harmful to the ozone layer will peak in
the stratosphere around the year 2000 before leveling out, he said.
	   The world body's weather agency and the U.N. Environment Program
on Monday released a summary of findings from the 1998 Scientific
Assessment of Ozone Depletion, to be published this fall.
	   Prepared by more than 200 ozone experts, it was reviewed earlier
this month by 77 scientists from 27 countries.
	   The study backed the conclusion of the last assessment in 1994
that ozone levels can be expected to return to their pre-1980s
levels around the middle of the next century.
	   But natural fluctuations mean ``we will be unable to detect the
start of the recovery of the ozone layer for probably another 20
years,'' Bojkov said.
	   Ozone blocks the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation from
reaching the earth. Scientists believe too much UV radiation can
cause skin cancer and destroy the tiny plants at the beginning of
the food chain. Among the effects of depleted levels is the
so-called ozone hole that forms annually over the Antarctic.
	   Combined levels of all ozone-depleting gases peaked in the
lowest part of the atmosphere in 1994, but ozone decline has slowed
only well away from polar areas.
	   ``The ozone hole in Antarctica ... will continue in the next one
or two decades without any changes,'' Bojkov predicted.
	   Of the main chemicals responsible for that decline, chlorine
levels are declining but levels of bromine _ largely used in
extinguishing fires _ are still increasing, the study said.
	   Their long lifespan means that the reduction will be a slow
process.
	   Countries must stick to the 1987 Montreal Protocol restricting
the production and trade of chlorofluorocarbon gases and other
ozone-destroying substances for the recovery to take place, Bojkov
said. Chlorofluorocarbon gases have been used as in air
conditioning, refrigeration and propellants in sprays.
	   But the study said additional policies to reverse the damage,
for example by setting tough targets to reduce emissions of the gas
halon, responsible for high bromine levels, would accelerate the
recovery by three years at most.
	   Methyl bromide, used as a pesticide, is now thought to be less
of a danger to the ozone layer than in 1994, it added.

Solana says all options open to resolve Kosovo crisis With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LADIKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ NATO is ready to step in and take
whatever steps are necessary to end the crisis in Kosovo, Secretary
General Javier Solana said Monday at a NATO workshop.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' to stop the fighting in the
troubled Yugoslav province, Solana told the gathering of
high-ranking political, military and economic officials from Europe
and North America.
	   ``Political, economic and military pressure worked in Bosnia.
There's no reason why a similar approach should not have a similar
effect in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died this year in fighting between
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels. Many of those killed in the
clashes have been women, children and the elderly.
	   Solana said the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts are similar to the
extent that ``there has been revival of the cruel practice of
ethnic cleansing... We have to put an end to this outrage.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo.
They also form the bulk of the estimated 65,000 people who have
fled their homes in the face of fierce fighting.
	   Most refugees are within Kosovo, but more than 12,000 have fled
to neighboring Albania and thousands more to Montenegro, which with
Serbia makes up the Yugoslav federation.
	   Members of the six-nation Contact Group, comprised of the United
States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, still are pushing for
a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   NATO staged a show of force last week, with 85 aircraft flying
over Albania and Macedonia near their borders with Yugoslavia.
	   That action has done nothing to deter Yugoslavia, which has
between 45,000 and 50,000 troops in Kosovo.
	   In a Moscow meeting last week, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic promised Russian President Boris Yeltsin he would resume
talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. But separatist Albanians say
Serb forces must be withdrawn before talks can continue.
	   Milosevic's promises must be transformed into action. ``Time is
running out,'' Solana said. ``We are tired of too many words.''
	   A senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity
at a press briefing, said NATO is expected to consider whether to
send ground or air forces to the region.
	   He added NATO wants to defuse the crisis, not escalate it, and
has no interest in bombing Serbia proper.
	   NATO's objectives are to stop the fighting, get negotiations
started, and achieve a settlement, Solana said.
	   ``Our continent simply will not find lasting peace and stability
if the Balkans remains volatile,'' Solana said.

English bowler delivers world record 38 runs in one over 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SURREY, England (AP) _ An English test prospect set cricket's
most ignominious record Sunday by conceding a world-record 38 runs
in one over.
	   Alex Tudor, touted as a future test cricketer, set the record
when he was bowling for Surrey against Lancashire at Old Trafford.
	   Tudor's former England under-19 team-mate Andy Flintoff hit
three sixes and four boundaries in one over, while the Surrey
bowler contributed by bowling two no-balls.
	   Tudor automatically conceded two runs apiece for the no-balls
and was forced to bowl two extra deliveries.
	   The batsman also entered the record books by hitting 34 runs in
one over from Tudor.
	   Only Gary Sobers and Ravi Shastri have scored more runs in a
single over than Flintoff, both hitting six sixes.
	   Flintoff's innings helped steer Lancashire to victory over
Surrey, his 61 off 24 balls an inidication of his innings.
	   He hit the first ball of the record over for six, then hit four
consecutive fours before dispatching the sixth and seventh bowls
for further sixes.
	   The Lancashire batsman, who was caught behind for 0 off Tudor in
the first innings, said he had no intention of setting any records
when he went to the crease.
	   ``When I was out there I didn't really know about any records. I
just took each ball as it came. It was only when I was out that
somebody told me it might be a record.''
	   Surrey captain Adam Hollioake led the praise for Flintoff's
innings, saying it was ``awesome''.
	   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' he said.
	   ``Alex (Tudor) is a mature lad and he's man enough to know when
somebody has played well against him. He got Flintoff for a duck in
the first innings, so I guess what goes around, comes around.''

Engineer: `chain of failures' led to fatal bridge collapse 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL BEN-TAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A ``chain of failures'' by designers and
builders led to the collapse of a footbridge during the opening
ceremony of Israel's Maccabiah Games and the deaths of four
Australian athletes, an engineer testified Monday.
	   The base of the bridge was improperly constructed, its supports
were insufficiently reinforced, and the stress points were
incorrectly located, Yitzhak Sheinman, a professor at Israel's
Technion institute, testified in Tel Aviv Magistrates Court.
	   The bridge buckled as about 100 Australian athletes crossed on
their way to the opening ceremony of the games last July 14. Dozens
were injured after being plunged into the polluted Yarkon River
below.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   The base of the bridge was not built to carry the weight of the
athletes, said Sheinman, who headed a committee of engineers that
investigated the collapse. Even if it had been properly built, the
bridge would have collapsed, he said.
	   Sheinman said the bridge's weight was not evenly spread among
its nine supporting columns, but was centered on the columns
closest to the center of the bridge. In addition, the columns were
not adequately reinforced, he said.
	   The bridge ``was susceptible to a chain of failures,'' he said.
``As an engineer, I would have strengthened it throughout.''
	   Sheinman said the bridge, which was made of metal pipes, should
have been designed so that the wooden floor of the bridge was
supported by the intersection of the pipes, rather than the pipes
themselves.
	   Sheinman said the pipe-joints used on the bridge were not
certified by safety engineers, and were the kind usually used in
building roofs, not bridges.
	   Sheinman was to continue testifying on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Another member of the engineering committee is expected to
testify that the bridge was improperly welded.

World Cup: Croatia may throw in fresh players against Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France _ Croatia may throw fresh young players at
Argentina after some of the regulars disappointed or struggled with
injuries in a narrow victory over Japan that secured Croatia's
second-round berth.
	   ``Fresh players could bring new impulses to our game,'' Croatian
soccer federation president Branko Miksa said Monday. ``We will use
very different tactics Friday against Argentina than we did against
Japan.''
	   The Argentines have also clinched a spot in the final 16, but
Friday's game for first place in Group H will decide which teams
the two-time world champion and newcomer Croatia face next.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic held two training sessions Monday with
Croatian substitute players to tune them up for possible use in the
starting lineup. The regulars had the day off, giving star striker
Davor Suker time to shoot billiards at the team's opulent spa hotel
and goalkeeper Drazen Ladic the chance for a round of golf.
	   Playmaker Zvonimir Boban, who sat out Croatia's 1-0 victory over
Japan on Saturday with a pulled leg muscle, had separate training
but will require more checks at the local hospital before Blazevic
will decide whether to field him against Argentina, Miksa said.
	   Croatia sorely missed its midfield director against the
aggressive Japanese. In addition, Suker's attack partners Mario
Stanic and Goran Vlaovic remained tame and key midfielder Robert
Prosinecki showed little of the inventive play he is known for.
	   Blazevic also has to consider that four regulars have cautions _
Stanic, Prosinecki, midfielder Dario Simic and central defender
Zvonimir Soldo _ and would be suspended for the second round if
they get a second yellow card against Argentina.
	   Players who might move into the starting lineup include
midfielders Silvio Maric and Zoran Mamic and defender Igor Tudor.
	   Miksa said he was ``very impressed'' with Argentina's 5-0
pounding of Jamaica on Sunday, though he noted that the South
Americans had a one-man advantage on the field in the second half
which Croatia did not have in its 3-1 victory.
	   With England and Romania the likely options for the next round,
Croatia would prefer England as opponent, he said.
	   The Croatians believe they would have more problems with their
counterattack passing game against Romania, which plays a similar
style. Croatian clubs have fared poorly against Romanian opponents
in recent European competition.
	   Croatia's only meeting so far with England, a warmup at Wembley
Stadium shortly before the 1996 European Championship, ended in a
goalless draw.

East German protest singer Gerhard Gundermann dead at 43 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Gerhard Gundermann, a folk singer beloved in the
former communist East Germany, has died of heart failure, his
record company said Monday. He was 43.
	   Gundermann died early Sunday at his home in Spreetal, 75
kilometers (45 miles) northeast of Dresden, according to the
Buschfunk company in Berlin. His death was unexpected, as he was a
vegetarian believed to be in good health, the company said.
	   Results of an autopsy were not yet available.
	   Gundermann's popularity soared in the eastern states with his
songs criticizing social injustice in former communist East
Germany, and later, describing the distrust between west and east
Germany after unification in 1990.

World Cup: Cha's replacement runs team through ``recovery'' training 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ In the absence of his mentor Cha
Bum-kun, but in the strongly felt presence of the South Korean
Technical Committee, newly promoted coach Kim Pyong-seok on
Saturday ran his team through a ``recovery'' training session in
the wake of its World Cup elimination.
	   ``I've been receiving a lot of help from the Technical
Committee,'' said Kim, who played for Ulsan Hyundai when Cha was at
the helm of the team from 1991-1994. ``For the World Cup here, I
was an assistant to Cha, not a real coach.''
	   The team still appeared subdued after its consecutive losses to
Mexico and the Netherlands, and the departure of Cha, fired on
Sunday following the team's crushing 5-0 defeat to the Dutch.
	   ``A big star of Korean football has fallen,'' said Kim, of his
mentor Cha. ``And the players are in the recovery stage.''
	   Cha is the most famous and successful striker in the history of
South Korean soccer, and was hired to save the faltering National
team in January 1997, after the country was eliminated in the
quarterfinals of the Asian Cup against Iran the year before.
	   If it still hopes to post its first win in five World Cup
appearances _ in time for the 2002 World Cup which it is co-hosting
with Japan _ the South Korean team will have to get over the weeks
events, and soon.
	   The Belgians, who drew with Mexico and the Netherlands, need a
win against South Korea in order to advance to the second round,
and will go into the match with all cylinders firing.
	   ``The Belgian team will be on the attack,'' said Kim. ``They've
tied two games and they need a win to advance.
	   ``We don't expect to catch the Belgians off guard. We expect
them to know our team well. We're not saying we expect to win
against them but we're not intimidated by them.''
	   Though he refused to criticize Cha's coaching strategies for
South Korea's two previous matches, Kim did say things would be run
differently for the team's game against Belgium.
	   ``It will be different against the Belgians,'' said Kim. ``Ever
team requires separate tactics.
	   ``At first, against the Netherlands, the Dutch didn't have their
system down,'' explained Kim. ``Then in the second half our players
were run down and the Dutch found their pace.
	   ``Our players will focus on defense for the first half, then in
the second half, when the Belgians tire a bit, we'll focus on the
offense.''

Chief executive freezes land sales, moves to stabilize economy 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With the economy continuing to deteriorate, the
chief executive on Monday announced a multibillion-dollar package
to help Hong Kong through a looming recession and suspended
government sales in the unstable property market.
	   The package presented by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was the
latest in a series intended to stabilize the economy.
	   Tung announced the plan in a television address, which was
followed by a televised news conference. Tung and his senior
officials, primarily either civil servants or members of a
pro-Beijing elite, also tried to reassure Hong Kong residents that
they understood their economic pain.
	   Tung spoke as the stock market closed another dismal day. The
key Hang Seng index tumbled 4.5 percent and now is 50 percent below
last fall's high. Investors dumped stocks in the absence of firm
plans by regional giant Japan to boost its economy.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and officials announced last week that unemployment was at a
15-year high of 4.2 percent. Tung said more difficulties were
ahead.
	   Economic contraction in the second quarter, which is almost
certain, would technically put Hong Kong in recession.
	   ``The rising unemployment rate at the end of May, the
continually weak economy in Japan and the drastic devaluation of
the yen have added more uncertainty to the already bleak economic
outlook for Hong Kong,'' Tung said.
	   Japan's currency plummeted in value against the U.S. dollar last
week in an indication that investors lack confidence in the
country's ability to pull itself out of its economic troubles. The
United States and the Japanese government intervened in currency
markets to halt the slide, but the yen was sinking again Monday.
	   The chief executive said Hong Kong would keep its currency, the
Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the U.S. dollar, maintaining that it
was essential to keep the confidence of outside investors.
	   One of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy is real estate,
ordinarily one of Hong Kong's strongest earners. Much of the
attention on the latest, 32 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs 4.1
billion) program was focused on the property sector.
	   Tung in recent weeks has said that property prices went too high
in the euphoria following the successful transition to Chinese rule
last year.
	   However, his decision to freeze land sales until next April
indicated he was concerned about instability. Officials said not
only large property developers, but many common people, were being
hurt by the fall in property prices.
	   The decision may put in danger Tung's plan to provide 85,000 new
apartments yearly for the next decade, an effort to make housing
more affordable for lower- and middle-income Hong Kong residents.
	   In other measures, the government is returning about 4 billion
Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 517 million) in real estate taxes. Another
2 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 208 million) will be made
available to small- and medium-size businesses to help them secure
credit, and more money also will be made available to help
first-time home buyers.
	   Businesses will be able to exempt their profits from taxes if
they keep them in Hong Kong banks, Tung said.
	   Salaries of 330 senior government officials were frozen.

Swiss okay sale of Viagra 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities Monday approved sale
of the potency pill Viagra, adding Switzerland to tiny San Marino
and Andorra as European countries where the drug can be bought
legally.
	   The Intercantonal Office for the Control of Medicine said it was
requiring a prescription for the pill because it is necessary to
follow directions carefully to limit problems with side effects.
	   As elsewhere in Europe, Swiss news media have shown strong
interest in Viagra since it was introduced in the United States
earlier this year.
	   Demand for Viagra has far outstripped supply in San Marino, a
mountain republic in eastern Italy that approved its sale within
days of its U.S. debut in April.
	   Demand has also been high in Andorra, sandwiched between Spain
and France.
	   Manufacturer Pfizer has said it expects approval for sale in the
15-nation European Union early next year.

French, Danes win EU environment awards 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The European Union's prize for
increasing awareness of the environment was awarded Monday to
French filmmaker, Dominique Soyer, Danish filmmaker, Bente Milton,
and a four-member Danish multimedia group.
	   Soyer won the Princes' Award in the drama category for an
animated film that relates how the Earth develops into a
destructive northern hemisphere and an exploited south.
	   Milton was awarded the prize for a documentary which claims that
an earthquake took place 20 seconds before the destructive
explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. It is based on
footage and documents from the former Soviet Union's KGB
intelligence agency.
	   The prize in the multimedia category was given to a Danish group
for creating a joint television, radio and Internet production
about global climate changes. The group members are Joergen Madsen,
Joergen Poulsen, Poul-Erik Heilbuth abd Hans Bulow.
	   The Princes' Awards _ with no money attached _ are named after
their patrons, the crown princes of Denmark and Spain. They are
distributed by the EU's Environment Agency, based in Copenhagen.

	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States demanded Monday that
Japan serve as the ``engine of growth'' for shrinking Asian
economies and prove it is committed to free trade among the
Pacific-Rim countries.
	   ``The United States has reiterated time and again Japan must be
an engine of growth for Asia,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said after closed-door talks with Japanese trade
minister Mitsuo Horiuchi.
	   ``It must, in addition to applying physical stimulus measures,
as well as dealing appropriately with the banking sector,
deregulate and open its economy,'' said Barshefsky on the first day
of talks between trade ministers of the 18 members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``These APEC meetings are a test of Japan's willingness to do
just that,'' she said.
	   The U.S. and Japanese strategies for lifting trade barriers and
lowering tariffs for some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and
services in APEC countries differ widely.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Senior-level officials say Japan is shirking its commitment to
sign on to an APEC plan to begin liberalizing trade in nine
industries by next year.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver. It was expected to be ready
for final signatures at the APEC summit of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Atsuo Shibota, a senior official in Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, said Horiuchi told Barshefsky
during their talks that fast-track liberalization must be carried
out on a voluntary basis.
	   He added that full APEC participation would ``be very
difficult'' if countries reluctant to open their markets were
denied flexibility in setting free-market schedules.
	   For Japan, six of the nine sectors _ fish, forestry, toys,
jewelry, energy and environment _ are seen as ``sensitive''
industries. In particular, the forestry and fish industries are
heavily subsidized and seen as vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   And much has changed since APEC member economies signed on to
the EVSL concept last year. Japan is now in a full-blown recession
and worries that reducing its plywood tariffs, for example, would
now lead to more paper mills closing down and lost jobs.
	   But the United States, which helped to stabilize the Japanese
currency last week by buying up dlrs 6 billion in yen, has said
Japan's signing on to the full package of nine industries was
crucial to the future of EVSL.
	   ``The critical point is that the consensus that is emerging is
that the nine sectors are the nine sectors and they move as a
package,'' Barshefsky said after talks concluded Monday.
``Flexibility should be provided, but the flexibility cannot weaken
the initiative in any respect.''
	   Barshefsky said she didn't believe the APEC members would reach
a full agreement in Kuching on the EVSL debate. But she was hopeful
they could before the November summit.
	   A senior Japanese official told The Associated Press on Sunday
that it felt the United States was bullying Tokyo into signing on
to the EVSL agreement before it was ready.
	   Malaysia, one of the APEC countries hit hard by the yearlong
Asian economic crisis, emphasized the spirit of APEC was
voluntarism, not binding contracts.
	   ``In APEC, everything is voluntary,'' said Malaysian trade
minister Rafidah Aziz. ``Although we would like to see everyone
come on board ... the basic premise is that it's voluntary,''
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

World Cup: Several Yugoslavs injured after match with Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Depressed after letting Germany slip away
with a tie, the Yugoslav World Cup team faces more problems:
injuries of several of its key players.
	   ``We could have solved all our problems with the victory which
we already had in our pocket against Germany,'' Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac said Monday.
	   Germany came back from a two-goal deficit to steal a 2-2 draw
against Yugoslavia Sunday. A victory for either team would have
meant a near-certain place in the next round from Group F.
	   But with the tie against Germany, Yugoslavia needs at least a
draw with the United States to advance.
	   Both Germany and Yugoslavia will try to be the first in the
group in order to evade the Netherlands in the next round. The
mighty Dutch are likely winners of the Group E.
	   ``Now, it's not only the battle for points, but also the battle
for a better goal difference than the Germans,'' said Yugoslav
midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic.
	   But despite being clear favorites against the U.S. on June 25 in
Nantes, the Yugoslav team could be hampered by injuries of several
of its key players.
	   Central defender Miroslav Djukic of Valencia in Spain ruptured
his calf muscle during a warmup and is likely to end his World Cup
campaign. Left back Zoran Mirkovic suffered an ankle injury in
Yugoslavia's opening 1-0 win against Iran and has not recuperated
since.
	   Darko Kovacevic, who led Yugoslav attack in the match against
Germany, suffered a hamstring injury early in the second half and
will probably miss the game against the Americans, according to
team doctors.
	   Star midfielder Dejan Savicevic, who missed both Yugoslav World
Cup matches, still refuses to play because of his knee ligament
injury. Coaches have claimed that he is fit, but has a
``psychological'' problem of facing more injuries.
	   Central defender Sinisa Mihajlovic _ who fought an
uncompromising battle with the German striking duo of Jurgen
Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff, but who scored an unfortunate own
goal that let Germany back into the game _ has had a similar injury
to Savicevic. He is likely to face the Americans, however.
	   Another defender, Nisa Saveljic of Bordeaux, has still not fully
recovered after a leg muscle injury that has prevented him from
starting in the both opening games.
	   ``In addition to our frustration over the fact that we let the
Germans slip away, we now have serious injury problems,'' said team
captain Dragan Stojkovic.
	   ``But we have 22 players here, and we all have to act as a squad
to beat the Americans,'' Stojkovic said. ``The Americans may be out
of the World Cup, but they'll try to salvage some of their pride in
the game against us.''

Floods cause billions of rubles damage in Yakutia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floods caused 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs 40 million)
damage to the Sakha-Yakutia region of northeastern Russia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   Half the 350,000 people in the region were affected by the
flooding, said regional governor Mikhail Nikolayev. He did not
elaborate.
	   ``There is no hope for a large relief or supply of material
resources from the federal structures as Russia itself is in a
profound economic and financial crisis,'' Nikolayev said.
	   The Geneva-based Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs said floods in the Sakha-Yakutia region have claimed at
least 13 lives and made 36,000 people homeless.
	   The floods were triggered by the melting of snow, which caused
the Lena and Aldan Rivers to overflow.

Korda gets off to quick start at sunny Wimbledon topped with Sampras, others AP Sports Writer

Eds: Recasts with early results, edits to conform and trim; Will be
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ With sunny skies gracing the start of
the 112th Wimbledon championships Monday, Petr Korda underlined his
status as a title contender in one of the most wide open men's
tournaments in years.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, needed less
than 90 minutes to defeat Spain's Javier Sanchez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
Looking at home on the grass, the Czech left-hander served 16 aces
and served notice he could be among the top challengers for Pete
Sampras' crown.
	   The first women's seed to advance was No. 9 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa, who beat Kerry-Anne Guse of Australia 6-2, 6-2 in
just over an hour.
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
tournament started in sunny weather and temperatures of 21 celsius
(70 f).
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has been relaid with new grass for the first
time in 40 years.
	   A solid showing against Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty should give
some indication whether Sampras is poised to win his fifth
championship in six years.
	   Sampras came into Wimbledon in a slump, lacking motivation and
talking of burnout. But there's one antidote that can bring Sampras
back to life: the green lawns of Wimbledon.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity that seems to bring out the best in me,'' he
said. ``When I get onto Center Court, I'm pumped, and I think the
other guys still fear me.''
	   With only two other former champions (Andre Agassi and Richard
Krajicek) in the field and a shortage of strong grass-court players
in the game, Sampras remains the favorite.
	   But the American has lost his aura of invincibility since
trouncing Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He
lost in the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals
of the Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles to his credit, he needs just two more to equal Roy
Emerson's record of 12.
	   Players who could stop him include Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Agassi,
Krajicek, Korda, Patrick Rafter and the two Britons _ Greg Rusedski
and Tim Henman.
	   The exceptionally wide open nature of the men's tournament is
underlined by this fact: there have been 10 different players in
the last five Grand Slam finals.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion who has zoomed back up the rankings
since dropping to 141st last November, was matched Monday against
Spain's Alex Calatrava.
	   In other featured men's matches, Kafelnikov faced big-serving
Mark Philippoussis and Henman was up against Jiri Novak.
	   Much of the focus this year will fall on the women's tournament,
where a fascinating mix of the new and the old will vye for the
title.
	   Martina Hingis, the defending champion and top seed, doesn't
play until Tuesday. Fellow 17-year-olds Venus Williams and Anna
Kournikova, recovering from a thumb injury, are also off until
Tuesday.
	   The highest women's seed in action on the opening day was No. 2
Lindsay Davenport, matched against Florencia Labat of Argentina.
	   But the spotlight Monday fell to seven-time champion Steffi
Graf, who was scheduled on Center Court against Spain's Gala Leon
Garcia.
	   The fourth-seeded German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's
her first in two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing
major knee surgery a year ago.
	   Graf's comeback has been slowed by a series of other injuries
but she looked back on track last week at the Eastbourne
tournament, where she lost to Kournikova in a tight, three-setter.
	   Another leader of the old guard, Monica Seles, was scheduled to
play Monday against Maria Sanchez Lorenzo. Seles, whose career was
disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, made an inspiring run to the
French Open final earlier this month, just three weeks after the
death of her father Karolj.

Hostage-taker surrenders after seeing pet dogs

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Taiwanese man who took four people
hostage and killed one threw out his gun and was arrested Monday
after police took his three beloved dogs to him.
	   The man, identified only ``Tony,'' locked his girlfriend, her
boss and another man and woman in a room at the offices of a health
products distributor. Some reports said he acted after a argument
with his girlfriend.
	   Police sealed off the building, while Tony began a long series
of phone calls with a popular local FM radio station, Jor Sor 100,
which were broadcast live.
	   More than an hour later, a shot was heard, and Tony shortly
afterward admitted a doctor to treat one of the men, who had been
shot in the stomach. Police later said the man died.
	   In his calls to the radio station, Tony said he was a dog lover
and would throw out his gun if his three dogs were brought to him.
He said he was not worried about himself and the prospect of going
to jail, but was concerned that someone look after his pets. He
also asked to talk to a well-known television talk show host.
	   About four hours after the incident began, police met both his
requests. The dogs were sent into the room, while the TV host urged
Tony repeatedly to surrender.
	   After spending some 20 minutes with his dogs, Tony gave himself
up. One of the woman hostages was taken away injured. Her condition
was not immediately known.

Former Swiss president Ernst Brugger dies at 84 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GOSSAU, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Swiss President Ernst Brugger
has died, it was announced Monday. He was 84.
	   Local authorities in his home town of Gossau said Brugger died
early Sunday morning at a nursing home in nearby Grueningen, where
Brugger had been since suffering a stroke two years ago. The cause
of death was unavailable.
	   Brugger was born in 1914 in the southern town of Bellinzona. He
trained as a teacher before turning to politics.
	   He served for the centrist Radical Party on Zurich's state
government before being elected in 1969 to the ruling seven-member
coalition cabinet, the Federal Council.
	   Brugger concluded a free-trade agreement between Switzerland and
the European Economic Community during his time as economics
minister, and took the rotating post of Swiss president in 1974.
	   He also became a major in the Swiss army. Swiss men are liable
to regular military service, usually until around the age of 40, as
there is no professional army.
	   Brugger retired from the Swiss government in 1978.
	   A funeral service is expected to be held next week in Gossau,
authorities in Zurich said. Brugger is survived by five sons.

Markets, rupee falter following sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with rupee, markets faltering. TRIMS previous
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Stocks, bonds and the rupee fell Monday
as traders responded to the downgrading of India's credit rating
following anti-nuclear economic sanctions.
	   The U.S. sanctions, officially came in force since last week,
have created uncertainty among business leaders, despite claims by
Indian politicians that India can withstand them.
	   The rupee closed at a record low of 42.74 to the dollar Monday,
down from 42.20 Friday as banks and importers rushed to buy
dollars.
	   Prices of most major shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange also
fell, as did Indian government securities. The sharp rise in the
dollar against the rupee prompted bankers to buy dollars rather
than invest.
	   It was the first day of trading since Moody's Investors Service
Inc., the company that publishes ratings on companies according to
its assessment of their ability to repay debts, lowered its rating
for India on Friday.
	   Moody's, acting after Washington detailed its anti-nuclear
sanctions, said the downgrade reflected its concern that the
``fractious political environment'' would make it difficult for
Indian officials to get their economy back on track.
	   India's economic growth faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year
1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years and its deficit for
1997-98 was 6.1 percent of gross domestic product, exceeding the
target of 4.5 percent.
	   Moody's lowering of India's credit rating to BA2, an inferior
classification that falls in the speculative grade, from BAA3, the
lowest classification in the one notch higher investment grade, is
likely to mean Indian companies will be charged higher interests
when borrowing from foreign banks and reduce the amount of foreign
funds being invested in Indian shares and bonds.
	   Pakistan, which responded to the nuclear tests of its neighbor
and longtime rival with its own tests, was hit with the same
sanctions.
	   Among other steps, the Export-Import Bank of the United States
is banned from issuing loans and other financing help to Indian and
Pakistani companies who want to buy from U.S. exporters.
	   U.S. exports make up 70 to 80 percent of all the equipment being
used in Indian power plants, and much of the sales are financed by
the Export-Import Bank.
	   Export-Import projects approved before May 13, when the
sanctions were first announced, were not affected, but the bank
cannot do any new business until the U.S. Congress lifts the
sanctions.
	   Private institutions are now expected to charge higher interest,
and expenses also are likely to go up as projects are delayed while
new sources of money are sought.
	   India was one of the top five countries receiving U.S.
investment guarantees, benefiting from an average of dlrs 300
million annually in such support.

Japan opposition not ready to unite against ruling party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leaders of three Japanese opposition parties
criticized Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's administration
Monday, but gave little indication they would challenge his
government anytime soon with a united front.
	   Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party of Japan and of
Parliament's largest opposition bloc, acknowledged failing to form
a multiparty alliance before upper house elections in July, which
he described as a crucial referendum on Hashimoto's rule.
	   But, as the country's leading proponent of a union of opposition
forces, he held out hope one could be created in the future.
	   ``We do want to create a framework which topples the current
administration,'' he said, blaming the government for a surge in
unemployment to record levels and a ballooning fiscal deficit.
	   The head of the Japanese Communist Party, however, played down
the likelihood of forging broad ties with other opposition parties,
even if there is some cooperation on a case-by-case basis.
	   ``I think we'll have to wait until the 21st century for more
interesting developments,'' said Tetsuzo Fuwa, the party's
chairman.
	   Masayoshi Takemura, who leads the New Party Sakigake, a small
group of lawmakers who recently ended an alliance with Hashimoto's
governing Liberal Democrats, also expressed little enthusiasm for
joining a broader coalition.
	   Public approval ratings for the Hashimoto Cabinet have slipped
due the rapid deterioration of the economy. But Japan's fragmented
opposition is not expected to be able to pose much of a threat to
the Liberal Democrats at the polls next month.
	   Takemura noted the fluid state of the mainstream opposition
compared to the entrenched Liberal Democratic and Communist
parties, rivals for most of the postwar era.
	   ``We've only been around for five years and already we're the
third-oldest party in Japan,'' he said.

World Cup: Dutch to go back to basics for Mexico match 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ After being too goal-hungry against
South Korea, the Netherlands is going back to basics as it prepares
for its clash with Mexico, coach Guus Hiddink said Monday.
	   ``I saw that instead of building up carefully, the team would
look for the killer pass too soon and as a result we lost the ball
a lot,'' Hiddink said of the South Korea match.
	   ``We have to go back to basics.''
	   In thrashing Group E whipping boy South Korea 5-0 Saturday, the
Dutch got away with some loose passing, but Hiddink knows that
Mexico will be quicker to punish such sloppiness on Thursday in
Saint-Etienne.
	   ``Our chances come from simple, disciplined, positional play.
That's how we create opportunities,'' he said.
	   At morning training Monday, the Dutch were still in euphoric
mood after the rout of South Korea in Marseille. After warming up
gently, the squad split into teams of four and played a
soccer-volleyball tournament _ a game similar to volleyball in
which players use their feet and heads to pass the ball instead of
their hands.
	   In the hard-fought but lighthearted contest, four-man team of
Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp, Winston Bogarde and Andre Ooijer
beat Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Wim Jonk and
Jaap Stam 5-1 in the final.
	   Midfielder-turned-striker Phillip Cocu, who has a minor ankle
injury, was the only player to sit out on training, but he said
afterwards he hoped to be fit to train Tuesday.
	   The session was briefly interrupted when the players were
introduced to Monaco's sports-loving Prince Albert, who paid a
30-minute visit to Monaco's training ground in the mountains above
Monte Carlo to watch the Dutch.
	   The players were given the afternoon free by Hiddink, who said
serious training for the Mexico match would begin Tuesday.
	   ``We can combine the good points from the last match with
disciplined play and take that into the game with Mexico,'' he
said.
	   A draw Thursday against Mexico will almost certainly be enough
to earn the Dutch top spot in Group E and a second round game
against the Group F runner-up.

Newly appointed U.N. envoy meets Greek Premier 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, beginning a
visit to the volatile Balkans, met Greek officials Monday to
discuss deteriorating relations with NATO ally Turkey over the
divided island of Cyprus.
	   The talks with Premier Costas Simitis and other Greek officials
could be Holbrooke's last tour through the region as a special
American liaison. He was nominated last week to the post of U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.
	   According to government spokesman Dimitris Reppas, the crisis in
the separatist Serb province of Kosovo was also on the agenda in
the Monday talks.
	   Kosovo is also expected to be the main focus of talks between
Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj Handzinski and his Greek
counterpart Theodoros Pangalos during an expected meeting Tuesday.
Macedonia has a large ethnic Albanian minority in areas bordering
Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke is expected to discuss the same issue during meetings
in the Yugoslavian capital, Belgrade, later this week. He is
expected to return to Athens to give a commencement address at the
American College of Greece on Friday.
	   No statements were made after Holbrooke's meeting with Simitis,
underlining the private nature of the American official's visit
here.
	   But Reppas said talks would have focused on last week's crisis
between Athens and Ankara following the deployment of Greek and
Turkish jetfighters on Cyprus.
	   Until his nomination to the U.N. post, Holbrooke was President
Bill Clinton's special envoy for Cyprus. He failed to restart talks
between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
	   Tensions have been on the rise in Cyprus following a decision by
the Greek Cypriot government to deploy Russian made anti-aircraft
missiles on the island. Turkey has threatened to prevent the
deployment, an action that could lead to a war between Greece and
Turkey.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded and
occupied its northern third following an abortive Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece.

Few Thais apply to take foreigners' jobs at rice mills 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's rice milling industry,
facing a shortage of 20,000 workers because of a government policy
to expel foreigners, has been able to recruit just 30 Thais to
replace them.
	   Twenty of the 30 have already quit their jobs because they could
not stand the grueling work, such as lifting 100-kilogram
(220-pound) sacks of rice, Bumrung Kritchpakorn, honorary president
of the Thai Rice Mills Association, told Dow Jones Newswires
Monday. They had been recruited at a job fair Friday.
	   The government decided to crack down on foreign workers last
year as the economic crisis made it evident there would be many
layoffs in almost every sector of business. A estimated 2 million
people will be unemployed this year.
	   The original plan called for all foreign workers to leave their
jobs by May 1. The deadline was extended to July 10 following a
meeting between rice mill operators and the government.
	   Bumrung said rice mill operators would submit a letter to Labor
Minister Trairong Suwankiri on Wednesday, asking the government to
urgently find a way to supply laborers to the mills before July 10.
	   ``If the government can't do that, many mills will have to stop
their operations because of the labor shortage, and this situation
will affect rice exports and farmers,'' he said.
	   Only the fishing industry, also too physically rigorous to
attract many Thais, is exempt from the requirement to let foreign
workers go.
	   Bumrung said workers in Thai rice mills will be paid 5,000 baht
(dlrs 119) a month, plus overtime and 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of
rice as a bonus for good work.
	   Only about 500 people, mostly from the poor northeastern
provinces of Thailand, attended Friday's job fair in Saraburi
province, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Bangkok.

Former Swiss president Ernst Brugger dies at 84 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GOSSAU, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Swiss President Ernst Brugger
has died, it was announced Monday. He was 84.
	   Local authorities in his home town of Gossau said Brugger died
early Sunday morning at a nursing home in nearby Grueningen, where
Brugger had been since suffering a stroke two years ago. The cause
of death was unavailable.
	   Brugger was born in 1914 in the southern town of Bellinzona. He
trained as a teacher before turning to politics.
	   He served for the centrist Radical Party on Zurich's state
government before being elected in 1969 to the ruling seven-member
coalition cabinet, the Federal Council.
	   Brugger concluded a free-trade agreement between Switzerland and
the European Economic Community during his time as economics
minister, and took the rotating post of Swiss president in 1974.
	   He was also a major in the Swiss army.
	   Brugger retired from the Swiss government in 1978.
	   A funeral service is expected to be held next week in Gossau,
authorities in Zurich said. Brugger is survived by five sons.

Hamas leader to return to Gaza Strip on Tuesday 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the
Islamic militant grou Hamas, will return to the Gaza Strip on
Tuesday after a four-month fundraising tour in the Arab world, a
Palestinian official said Monday.
	   Israeli security officials at one point considered barring
Yassin from Gaza, but in the end decided that the quadriplegic
sheikh would pose more of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his
activities can be monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin was expected to arrive at the Rafah crossing between
Eygpt and the Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon, said Mohammed
Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank.
	   Yassin had spent the last two weeks in Sudan, waiting for Egypt
to permit him entry.
	   Egypt reportedly waited until Israel officially announced it
would let Yassin return to Gaza. Egypt had feared that if Yassin
got stuck at its border with Gaza, he would be an embarrassment to
the government, which has close ties with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas' popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in
the strip, is seen as a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   During his trip, the 62-year-old Yassin raised millions of
dollars for Hamas and issued statements supporting armed struggle
against Israel.

Suspected North Korean submarine captured in South Korean waters repercussion in 8th-9th grafs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS new quotes from JCS spokesman in 3rd graf, possible
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea captured a midget
submarine believed to belong to North Korea on Monday after it
became entangled in a fishing net.
	   The vessel was seized in the area where a North Korean submarine
ran aground in 1996 _ an incident whose aftermath left 37 people
dead and sent relations between the North and South plunging to
their lowest level in years.
	   ``We're pretty much sure that it belongs to North Korea, but we
can't officially confirm at this stage that it is theirs,'' a
spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
	   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a navy
ship was towing the vessel to shore. He described it as a ``midget
submersible.''
	   ``We suspect there's somebody inside, but we don't know how
many,'' he said.
	   The navy described the captured boat as a 70-ton Yugo-class
submarine, 3 meters (10 feet) wide and 18 meters (59 feet) long.
North Korea is believed to have several such craft, which normally
carry four to five crewmen.
	   Navy experts said North Korea usually uses Yugo-class subs for
infiltration of espionage agents and surveillance. The subs are
lightly armed with machine guns.
	   The incident could set back efforts by the new government of
President Kim Dae-jung to promote a ``sunshine policy'' of engaging
communist North Korea rather than isolating it.
	   ``Indications are that it's not an accidental border crossing,''
said an official of Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles
relations with North Korea. He also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Officials said the vessel got caught in a fishing net about 18
kilometers (11 miles) east of Sokcho, a coastal town just south of
the North Korean border and about about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set to drift from the stern of a South Korean
fishing boat, which first spotted the entangled craft and radioed
maritime police and the military.
	   Kim In-yong, skipper of the fishing boat, told police his net
got caught in the sub's propeller and that he saw three or four
people on the sub's deck trying to untangle it.
	   The Defense Ministry sent four warships and a helicopter to the
area, and military units in the Sokcho area were put on a
heightened state of alert.
	   Sokcho is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from where a North Korean
submarine ran aground in September 1996, touching off a 53-day
manhunt for its occupants.
	   The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police ended with
24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead. One North
Korean was captured and another was believed to have escaped.
	   That submarine was twice as large as the one captured Monday. It
was a 325-ton Shark-class sub that measured 34 meters (112 feet)
from bow to stern.
	   South Korea will hold a national security meeting Tuesday to
review the latest incident. Officials said the matter also will be
raised when United Nations Command officials meet with North Korean
military counterparts at the border village of Panmunjom on Tuesday
for the first time in seven years.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Russia, Angola to sign agreement on diamond industry cooperation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Angola are expected to sign an
agreement on Russian investment into Angola's lucrative
diamond-mining industry, officials said Monday.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was in Moscow on a
two-day visit and planned to meet with President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   ``Angola was and remains one of Russia's most promising partners
in Africa,'' Yastrzhembsky told reporters.
	   The head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Businessmen,
Arkady Volsky, who met with dos Santos on Monday, said the two
countries' trade turnover of dlrs 48 million was well below their
potential, the ITAR-Tass new agency reported.
	   ``During my first official visit to the Russian Federation, I
deemed it necessary to meet with representatives of the emerging
class of Russian entrepreneurs in order to learn about their
interests and possible participation in the process of restoring
the Angolan economy,'' dos Santos was quoted as saying.
	   Dos Santos last was in Moscow in 1988, when Russia was still
part of the Soviet Union.
	   Other documents to be signed during the visit include a
declaration on friendship and cooperation and an agreement on
expanding trade and economic ties. Volsky mentioned fishing,
petroleum and gas industries as the most promising areas of
cooperation, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Angola's debt to Russia, estimated at dlrs 1.5 billion may also
be discussed.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria, but a slump in world oil prices has cut revenue, and
stymied its efforts to keep up with interest payments on its
foreign debt.
	   Russia, along with the United States and Portugal, is one of the
observer countries overseeing the delayed implementation of
Angola's 1994 peace agreement, which ended a two-decade civil war
with UNITA rebels.

Afghans cheer winning World Cup Iranian team 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Setting aside its relentless attacks
on Iran for allegedly supporting its enemies, the Taliban joined
residents of Kabul on Monday in cheering Iran's World Cup football
victory over the United States.
	   '''We are feeling happy because Iran beat America,'' Abdul
Shakoor Muttmayan, the chairman of the Taliban's Olympic Committee
told The Associated Press. ``Iran is an Islamic country which is
important for us.''
	   On the war-shattered streets of Kabul people congratulated each
other on Iran's 2-1 win over the United States in Paris on Sunday.
	   ``Unfortunately we have no TV any more in Kabul, so we could not
see the competition,'' said Mohammed Jawaid, who was handing out
sugar coated doughnuts on the street _ a traditional way of sharing
good news. ``When we got the news on the radio this morning that
Iran won we were very happy.''
	   In the beleaguered Afghan capital, where most forms of light
entertainment have been banned by the Taliban religious army, World
Cup fever has taken hold _ even though the ban on TV means that
most people follow the World Cup on the radio.
	   Muttmayan said ``we are not against television but we want to
restore it in Kabul under the Shariat (Islamic) law.''
	   He said the Taliban also hopes to reform participation in sports
and viewing of sports.
	   For example, Muttmayan said, ``we want people to shout
Allah-o-Akbar (God is great) instead of clapping.''
	   Afghanistan's Taliban religious army has repeatedly accused Iran
of sending money and weapons to the northern-based alliance which
is trying to stop the Taliban gaining control of the entire
country. The Taliban already controls about 85 percent of the
country.
	   The alliance is mostly made up of Afghanistan's minority ethnic
and religious groups, including Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban, whose soldiers are mostly Sunni Muslims, says
Shiite Iran is trying to gain a disproportionate amount of power
for Afghanistan's Shiite Muslim minority.

Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas' popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in
the strip, is seen as a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   During his trip, the 62-year-old Yassin raised millions of
dollars for Hamas and issued statements supporting armed struggle
against Israel.

Russian TV series aims to make heroes of tax police 
</HEADLINE>
By MITCHELL LANDSBERG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ By next winter, Russia's new television heroes may
be some of this country's most important, and least understood,
government agents: the tax police.
	   Each week, Maj. Nikita Ariol and Capt. Dmitri Rusanov will take
to the airwaves to battle the mobsters and rogue corporations
bleeding Russia's treasury dry and, many people believe, holding
back the progress of economic reform.
	   That Russia needs such heroes has become particularly clear in
the past couple of weeks. The government's inability to collect
taxes was at the root of a late May market crash that has
threatened the stability of an already weak economy.
	   One of President Boris Yeltsin's first responses to the crisis
was to fire the nation's tax chief and appoint a successor, who
promised to do whatever was needed to squeeze money out of
deadbeats.
	   For that, he'll need people like Ariol and Rusanov.
	   The fictional characters are the creations of two producers from
a Moscow advertising and television production company, VideoArt.
	   They will be an odd couple _ think ``Lethal Weapon,'' the
producers say _ who will be champions of justice in a wayward city,
the Moscow of the 1990s, often compared to the 1930s' Chicago of
gangster Al Capone.
	   ``Our rosy dream is that our characters will become everyone's
heroes,'' said Sergei Beloshnikov, the primary scriptwriter for the
series. ``They are just simple Russian guys who are doing their
jobs honestly and well enough. Sometimes they make mistakes. ...
But their motto is, `We can be defeated but we cannot be bought.'''
	   Unlike the Russian police force, widely acknowledged to be
riddled with corruption, the tax police say they are an elite group
that prides itself on its honesty. But even they acknowledge the
ever-present lure of corruption.
	   Beloshnikov and Yuri Sapronov, who have experience producing
Russia's version of ``Sesame Street,'' among other projects,
dreamed up the series in Beloshnikov's kitchen one night last year.
	   They knew it wouldn't work without the cooperation of the real
tax police, so they arranged a meeting with the agency's brass at
their headquarters in a foreboding stone building at 12 Maroseika
St. in central Moscow.
	   The police already had some experience with television: They are
well known in Russia for a series of offbeat commercials, one of
which shows a hapless tax evader whose sex life has been ruined by
nagging guilt.
	   The police loved the idea for the series _ and the producers
loved 12 Maroseika St. so much that they named the show after it.
	   It's a name that should strike fear into the hearts of tax
delinquents throughout Russia, and there are plenty of them. The
government estimates about 5 million people paid their taxes last
year _ in a country of 147 million.
	   It's an understandable problem. Until Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev liberalized the Soviet economy in the late 1980s, there
was no need for tax collection here. All salaries came from the
state. What the state wanted, it kept.
	   The tax police were established six years ago, not to collect
taxes, but to fight tax crime. The department now has a staff of
38,000, and particularly targets corporate tax dodgers and
organized crime figures. Last year, the tax police uncovered 21,000
tax crimes, sent 600 people to jail and returned several billion
dollars to the federal government, according to spokesman Nikolai
Medvedev.
	   ``The people who make these films will have a lot of material to
work with,'' he said.
	   Bootlegging, gas smuggling, international money laundering, and
internal corruption were only some of the plot ideas the producers
found while combing through police files and talking to
investigators.
	   In the premiere episode, called ``Operation Green Ice,'' the two
cops will investigate a case involving a Russian mining company
that is smuggling emeralds to the West.
	   Although the police are assisting VideoArt, they are not
financing the show. The producers say that, while they want to
encourage people to pay taxes, the point of the show will be
entertainment, not propaganda.
	   ``Our proposition will be simply that good will always win over
evil,'' said Beloshnikov.
	   ``Our main characters will be real people, who love women, who
drink vodka, who have human weaknesses,'' added Sapronov. ``But
they have ideals _ and there is light at the end of the tunnel.''

Korda gets off to quick start at sunny Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Updates with Davenport victory in grafs 3-4; edits to conform
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ With sunny skies gracing the start of
the 112th Wimbledon championships Monday, Petr Korda underlined his
status as a title contender in one of the most wide open men's
tournaments in years.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, needed less
than 90 minutes to defeat Spain's Javier Sanchez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
Looking at home on the grass, the Czech left-hander served 16 aces
and served notice he could be among the top challengers for Pete
Sampras' crown.
	   The highest women's seed in action Monday, No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory in 50 minutes over
Argentina's Florencia Labat.
	   The 22-year-old American, still looking for her first Grand Slam
title and largely overlooked amid the focus on the teen-age stars,
never faced a break point in the match and dropped only three
points on her serve in the second set.
	   The first women's seed to advance was No. 9 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa, who beat Kerry-Anne Guse of Australia 6-2, 6-2 in
just over an hour.
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
tournament started in sunny weather and temperatures of 21 celsius
(70 f).
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has been relaid with new grass for the first
time in 40 years.
	   A solid showing against Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty should give
some indication whether Sampras is poised to win his fifth
championship in six years.
	   Sampras came into Wimbledon in a slump, lacking motivation and
talking of burnout. But there's one antidote that can bring Sampras
back to life: the green lawns of Wimbledon.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity that seems to bring out the best in me,'' he
said. ``When I get onto Centre Court, I'm pumped, and I think the
other guys still fear me.''
	   With only two other former champions (Andre Agassi and Richard
Krajicek) in the field and a shortage of strong grass-court players
in the game, Sampras remains the favorite.
	   But the American has lost his aura of invincibility since
trouncing Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He
lost in the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals
of the Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles to his credit, he needs just two more to equal Roy
Emerson's record of 12.
	   Players who could stop him include Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Agassi,
Krajicek, Korda, Patrick Rafter and the two Britons _ Greg Rusedski
and Tim Henman.
	   The exceptionally wide open nature of the men's tournament is
underlined by this fact: there have been 10 different players in
the last five Grand Slam finals.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion who has zoomed back up the rankings
since dropping to 141st last November, was matched Monday against
Spain's Alex Calatrava.
	   In other featured men's matches, Kafelnikov faced big-serving
Mark Philippoussis and Henman was up against Jiri Novak.
	   Much of the focus this year will fall on the women's tournament,
where a fascinating mix of the new and the old will vie for the
title.
	   Martina Hingis, the defending champion and top seed, doesn't
play until Tuesday. Fellow 17-year-olds Venus Williams and Anna
Kournikova, recovering from a thumb injury, are also off until
Tuesday.
	   The spotlight Monday fell to seven-time champion Steffi Graf,
who was scheduled on Centre Court against Spain's Gala Leon Garcia.
	   The fourth-seeded German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's
her first in two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing
major knee surgery a year ago.
	   Graf's comeback has been slowed by a series of other injuries
but she looked back on track last week at the Eastbourne
tournament, where she lost to Kournikova in a tight, three-setter.
	   Another leader of the old guard, Monica Seles, was scheduled to
play Monday against Maria Sanchez Lorenzo. Seles, whose career was
disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, made an inspiring run to the
French Open final earlier this month, just three weeks after the
death of her father Karolj.

U.N. Bosnia chief calls for military intervention in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The head of the United Nations mission
in Bosnia, Elisabeth Rehn, said Monday that talks will not solve
the Kosovo crisis and that NATO should send in troops.
	   Rehn added, however, that any force sent to halt the bloodshed
should be authorized by the United Nations.
	   ``I personally think we should use NATO forces, which in a way
are ready, but ... they must have the blessing of the U.N. Security
Council, and the Security Council should also plan their action,''
Rehn told reporters.
	   Rehn, a former Finnish defense minister, said she did not
believe in Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's pledge to resume
talks with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, made in Moscow
last week.
	   ``I'm a bit disappointed in the fact that the Moscow meeting, in
a way, gave him (Milosevic) new impetus. I seriously doubt that
anything good will come out of talks with Rugova,'' Rehn said.
	   ``They've talked before, and all promises made were broken,''
she said. ``Milosevic should realize his time has come. We really
cannot afford another Bosnia.''
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year in Kosovo between government forces and guerrillas who
enjoy increasing support among ethnic Albanians.
	   On Monday, reports said that heavy fighting has broken out for
control of two key roads in Kosovo, where the Yugoslav army seems
to be playing an increasing role.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed in Moscow to
fellow members of the six-nation Contact Group to give Serbia more
time to pull back its estimated 45,000 to 50,000 security forces in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province nine
to one.

Four dead in fourth day of Yemen price hike protests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday on Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent hike in fuel prices in two of the country's
biggest cities, killing four people and wounding 10.
	   It was the fourth straight day of protests following the hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices on Friday.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and
three were wounded, witnesses said.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who came to power last month in Yemen, a poor
country on the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula.
	   Protesters also clashed with police in riot gear in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said.
	   Police arrested at least 20 people, they said.
	   The price hikes were scheduled for January. But the government
was forced to delay them because of conflicts over political and
economic policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem
and President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in Yemen.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than a year in office, was replaced
by al-Iryani in May.
	   A demonstration by hundreds of university students Monday was
dispersed by baton-wielding police who fired into the air. Three of
the demonstration's leaders were arrested. Authorities closed San`a
University Monday and deployed anti-riot police on campus.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram Levy, new interim chief executive appointed. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with PolyGram announcing resignation of
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of PolyGram, the
world's largest music company, to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs
10.4 billion.
	   Within hours, PolyGram announced that president and CEO Alain
Levy had resigned and chief financial officer Jan Cook would guide
the company through the transition.
	   The dlrs 10.5 billion price was below the dlrs 10.6 billion
agreed to earlier for the purchase of PolyGram, the latest conquest
for the Canadian beverage giant in its drive to become an
entertainment conglomerate.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation three years
after it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.
	   Philips announced in May it intended to sell its 75 percent
stake in the Dutch entertainment group PolyGram to the Canadian
liquor giant. Europe's largest consumer electronics group said the
sale was part of its strategy to divest non-core activities.
	   Seagram, which will purchase the stake through its subsidiary
Universal Studios Inc. as part of tender offer for all issued
shares, will pay 115 guilders, or dlrs 57, per share.
	   The final agreement, subject to the usual regulatory approval,
calls for Seagram to issue a maximum of about 47.9 million common
shares.
	   Shares of both Philips and PolyGram dropped in early trading
Monday on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Philips was down 1.2
percent to 172 guilders (dlrs 84.70), while PolyGram traded at
107.60 guilders (dlrs 53), down 0.4 percent.
	   Levy became CEO of PolyGram in 1991 and steered the company
through a period of dramatic growth and expansion to 12,000
employees.

Iraq offering farmers huge subsidies for this surplus crop 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a bid to save Iraqi farmers from
crippling losses, the government is buying their surplus crop in a
massive bailout package that could lead to inflation, officials and
traders said Monday.
	   Offering close to international prices, the government is paying
135,000 dinars (about dlrs 90) for each ton of wheat shipped to its
silos. For a ton of rice, it is offering 175,000 dinars (dlrs 130).
	   ``It is a very favorable price,'' Amir Khaleel, Baghdad director
of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization told The Associated
Press.
	   A bumper crop this year has produced a surplus of 2.2 million
tons of grain, according to the United Nations.
	   But the market had no place for so much grain. At the same time,
Iraq cannot export its crop under U.N. trade sanctions.
	   Still, the government is committed to ``buying every single
gram'' of the crop, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told The
Associated Press. He said the government will also buy the produce
of the three northern Kurdish provinces outside the control of the
central government control.
	   The rescue package will cost the cash-starved government some
375 billion dinars, a sum equivalent to dlrs 250 million that it
can raise only by printing new currency, traders said.
	   This will almost certainly fuel inflation and reduce the value
of the volatile dinar, which is now worth 1,500 to one dollar, they
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq has a steady hard currency income under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, which allows it partial oil sales. But the
revenues can only be used to import food and not to fund purchase
of domestic crops. The program stipulates that the imported food
must be distributed free to Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Since the program started in December 1996, more than 5 million
tons of food have reached Iraq.
	   However, Iraqis do not live on the dole alone and buy domestic
grains also in the market.
	   Before the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq for invading
Kuwait in 1990, the country's food import bill was about dlrs 3
billion per year.

Criminalizing prostitution makes it worse, U.N. says 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Criminalizing prostitution only makes
matters worse for women involved, especially those trafficked to
western Europe and around the world from the post-communist
countries, the U.N. Commissoner of Human Rights said Monday.
	   The United Nations should get involved in efforts to help the
thousands of women trapped abroad after arriving in western Europe,
North America, Asia or the Middle East from eastern Europe, with no
way to get back home and no authorities to turn to, said the
commissioner, former Irish President Mary Robinson.
	   Criminalizing prostitution ``adds to the burden of women who are
already victims,'' she told reporters at the start of a three-day
conference organized by a womens' group funded by the Open Society
Institute of Hungarian-born U.S. billionaire George Soros.
	   Over 100 human rights activists from 38 countries were attending
the seminar, focusing on trafficking in women from eastern Europe
since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   Women from post-communist eastern Europe are trafficked to
different parts of the world, including North America, Asia, the
Mideast, and Western Europe.
	   ``They arrive there with debt-bondage contracts, so that they
earn no money until it paid back. If they approach the local
authorities for help, they are treated as illegal migrants,''
Gillian Caldwell, Co-Director of the Global Survival Network said.
	   ``I want the United Nations to be involved, want to raise global
awareness how serious the problem is,'' Robinson said.
	   According to UN estimates, some four million people are
trafficked worldwide annually. These include women and men, who are
recruited for forced work as industrial slaves.
	   ``There is an estimated seven billion dollars annual profit in
this market,'' Caldwell said.
	   Countries involved could face pressure from western Europe and
the United States, she said, noting that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright recently raised the issue of trafficking
Ukrainian women to Israel with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Participants at the conference warned that not all women
involved are ``innocent victims.'' However, they also noted that
women willing to work as prostitutes should not live in slave-like
conditions banning them from moving freely.

Cesium thieves caught in Azerbaijan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Four people were arrested after
allegedly trying to sell radioactive material, an Azerbaijani
official said Monday.
	   The National Security Ministry seized four containers that held
``dangerous amounts'' of cesium, the ministry's deputy chief, Tofik
Babayev, said in a news release.
	   The suspects had offered to sell the material for dlrs 1.4
million, Babayev said. He did not identify the prospective buyer.
	   One of the suspects was the chief of an aluminum factory that
held the radioactive material, according to the news release.
Cesium is used in cancer research and radiation therapy.
	   Earlier this spring Russian security forces seized nearly 22
tons of alloyed steel when smugglers tried to send the material _
which can be used to build rockets _ from Russia to Iran across the
Azerbaijani border.

World Cup: Coach says two players had to go, but some disagree 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Two South African players who received the
ultimate World Cup red card left for home Monday, but the
controversy stayed with their teammates before their final Group C
clash with winless Saudi Arabia.
	   Midfielders Brendan Augustine and the aptly named Naughty
Mokoena said nothing when they left after being suspended for the
rest of South Africa's first World Cup for staying out partying
until dawn Sunday.
	   Coach Philippe Troussier, who pushed for the suspension, said it
was the right decision and supported by the rest of the team.
	   ``I cannot accept this kind of attitude,'' Troussier said after
the team trained for two hours Monday. ``I think these two players
did not deserve to play for South Africa.''
	   But some players said sending home Augustine, who started both
World Cup matches so far, and Mokoena, a reserve unlikely to play,
was too harsh.
	   ``I don't buy the idea that they should be sent home,'' said
midfielder John Moshoeu of Fenerbahce, at 31 the team's most
experienced veteran with 46 internationals. ``They are part of the
family. In life we have to deal with problems. They should find
another way to discipline them and solve the problem.''
	   Augustine, 26, of Lask Linz, was replaced in both World Cup
matches and his starting role appeared in jeopardy. He joined the
nonstarters for a practice match against a Vichy side on Saturday.
	   ``That hurt Brendan,'' said Delron Buckley of Vfl Bochum, who
may start in Augustine's place.
	   Goalkeeper Hans Vonk of Heerenveen F.C. said the suspensions
would harm South Africa's international image, but was unlikely to
distract the players.
	   ``Other countries look at South Africa and say, `What's
happening there?' '' Vonk said. ``That's bad.''
	   South Africa lost its World Cup opener to France 3-0, then tied
Denmark 1-1. To make the second round, South Africa must beat Saudi
Arabia and France must beat Denmark in the final Group C matches on
Wednesday. South Africa also must overcome Denmark's four-goal
advantage in scoring differential.
	   The Saudis have two losses and cannot advance. That might help
their cause, some players warned.
	   ``They're not under pressure,'' defender Pierre Issa of
Olympique Marseilles said. ``They're just going to try to win one
game in this World Cup.''

Merrill Lynch to buy Canada's Midland Walwyn for dlrs 1.26 billion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ U.S. brokerage giant Merrill Lynch and Co. is
buying Midland Walwyn Inc., Canada's last major independent
brokerage, for dlrs 1.26 billion (US dlrs 857 million) the two
companies announced Monday.
	   The deal marks the return of Merrill to Canada's retail
brokerage business, eight years after it sold its Canadian
subsidiary to CIBC Wood Gundy. 
	   With Midland's 3,240 employees, including 1,275 financial
advisors, and 116 retail branches, Merrill will gain a large
presence in the Canadian market.
	   Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky called the purchase a
``hat trick'' that will make the combined operation one of the
biggest in Canada in the private client brokerage business as well
as in underwriting, advising on mergers and acquisitions, plus
stock and bond trading.
	   ``It's good for our clients and employees, it's good for our
shareholders, and it's good for Canada,'' Komansky said in a
release this morning. 
	   ``We're creating an exceptional organization that will bring
Canadian investors access to global opportunities and bring
Canadian corporations broad distribution of their securities _ both
domestically and globally.''
	   Midland Walwyn chairman Robert Schultz called the transaction
``an excellent fit'' for both companies.
	   ``It will provide our clients with greatly expanded product
offerings, as well as maximizing value for shareholders and career
opportunities for our employees,'' he said in a statement. 
	   ``As consolidation proceeds in the banking sector, the Merrill
Lynch-Midland Walwyn combination will have the scale, the product
and distribution breadth, and the global capabilities to be the
premier financial services firm for Canadian investors and issuers
alike.''
	   Midland's board is urging shareholders to accept the offer,
which would give stockholders 0.24 of a share in a new company
called Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., or shares of Merrill Lynch and
Co., the biggest retail broker in the United States.
	   The deal values Midland Walwyn shares at dlrs 31.89 (US dlrs
21.69) each.
	   Monday's acquisition follows an expansion trend by Merrill
Lynch, which has been rapidly growing to keep up with its rivals.
It recently bought the assets and plans to hire 2,000 employees of
bankrupt Yamaichi Securities Co., Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage.
	   Midland Walwyn shares have been rising sharply in recent weeks
on speculation the company would be bought by a bigger rival. 
	   Midland has been the focus of takeover speculation since Royal
Bank of Canada's RBC Dominion Securities Inc. bought Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd. in 1996.

Government to decide on `bridge bank' by July 8 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Japan-Banks
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top officials intend to decide in two weeks how to
have a ``bridge bank'' take a mountain of bad loans off the hands
of Japanese banks so they can help lift Japan out of recession.
	   Koichi Kato, secretary-general of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, said Monday he and Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto have agreed to make a final decision by July 8, four days
ahead of elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   Japanese banks have an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 555
billion) in bad loans. Worried about adding to their losses, they
have been reluctant to grant new loans that could help revive the
slumping economy.
	   The United States and Japan's Asian neighbors have been urging
it to fix its economy, seen as dragging down other economies in the
region. Hashimoto has promised action, including accelerated moves
to solve the bad loan problem.
	   A ``bridge bank'' would take over loans of troubled banks and
sell any remaining collateral while continuing to provide credit to
healthy clients.
	   One option is to establish a new institution with greater scope
than the existing Resolution and Collection Bank, officials said.
	   Other options include setting up a new state-run bank, or
expanding the functions of a government-backed financial
institution to serve as a bridge bank.
	   The Liberal Democrats' Kato said his party and the government
will examine how the proposed bridge bank can be handled under the
government's financial stabilization package.
	   Under the program, up to 13 trillion yen (dlrs 94 billion) in
public funds is made available to infuse new capital into banks. It
also sets aside 17 trillion yen (dlrs 123 billion) to protect
depositors of failed banks.
	   Attention focused Monday on the financial health of Long-Term
Credit Bank, whose shares have plunged in value since Moody's
Investors Service lowered its rating for the bank last Friday.
	   The bank has denied that it is in trouble. It also has denied
various news reports that it is in merger talks with other banks in
an effort to gain help.

British Gas loans a spokesman to Queen Elizabeth II 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II is getting some help from the
gas company.
	   Centrica PLC, the holding company which controls British Gas,
will loan its corporate affairs director, Simon Lewis, to the
palace for two years.
	   Lewis, 39, will take up his assignment as communications
secretary to the monarch in September.
	   Buckingham Palace said Lewis will be working on a communications
strategy for the royal family, and will not be involved in the day
to day work of the queen's press secretary, Geoff Crawford.
	   ``The queen and senior members of the Royal Family have decided
to devote more resources to communications generally,'' said a
palace spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The position of communications secretary is a new one, and Mr.
Lewis will be responsible for helping to ensure that the role and
contribution to national life of the queen and the royal family is
communicated effectively to the general public,'' the spokeswoman
said.
	   The Royal Household publicity budget is currently 471,000 pounds
(dlrs 782,000) a year.
	   Centrica PLC will continue to pay Lewis his normal salary while
he is ``seconded'' to the palace, according to Press Association,
the British news agency. The palace will partly reimburse the
company, paying a lower amount equal to a civil service salary, the
agency said.

South Koreans seek to save Korean-language computer program maker 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A business association launched a
campaign Monday to save a Korean-language computer program, urging
people to buy stock in the South Korean company that devised it.
	   The Korean Venture Business Association, claiming 700 member
companies in the computer industry, urged its members and the
public to buy stock in Hangul and Computer Co.
	   The association's move was the latest effort by local computer
users to stop U.S. computer giant Microsoft from eliminating a
dominant, rival Korean-language program from the market.
	   But it may have come too late.
	   ``We are grateful that they are trying to save our program,''
said Kim Jung-soo, a spokeswoman for Hangul and Computer Co. `` But
we already have agreement with Microsoft. There is nothing more we
can say.''
	   Founded in 1989, Hangul and Computer Co. developed a series of
Korean-language programs, which hold about 81 percent of the dlrs
15 million market in South Korea. Microsoft has 12 percent of the
market.
	   Experts say Hangul and Computer's Korean program is superior to
Microsoft's because it recognizes more combinations of the
24-character Korean alphabet, known as Hangul, including some
archaic ones.
	   Despite its market domination, Hangul and Computer recently ran
into a serious financial trouble, largely caused by illegal copying
of its products.
	   The Korean company said only about one-tenth of users actually
bought its programs, while others illegally copied them.
	   Hangul and Computer defaulted on dlrs 180,000 in debt in May. It
began looking for an investor, but no South Korean company showed
interest.
	   Last week, the company signed a letter of intent to sell shares
worth up to dlrs 20 million to Microsoft. It declined to reveal
further details, but experts said Microsoft would own about 20
percent of the company.
	   In return for the investment, Hangul and Computer promised to
stop developing its Korean-language programs immediately and stop
selling existing products within one year.
	   The decision provoked an angry reaction from Korean computer
users, who said it would lead to a monopoly by Microsoft in the
Korean-language program market.
	   The Fair Trade Commission is investigating the deal to determine
whether Microsoft's equity participation would limit free
competition in the market in violation of Korean law.

Russian general: NATO dragging Europe back to Cold War 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian military official complained Monday
that NATO is ``nostalgically'' dragging Europe back to the Cold War
by its eastward expansion and clumsy relations with Russia, a news
agency said.
	   Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, reiterated Russian complaints
about recent NATO air exercises around the disputed Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
	   ``Fifty percent of the information we were given before the
exercises turned out to be incorrect, to put it mildly,'' he told a
news conference, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev complained last week to U.S. Gen.
Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the
handling of the exercises. Shelton said he didn't know whether
Russia had been properly notified about details of the operation.
	   Ivashov restated Russia's concerns about NATO's eastward
expansion, and said Russia ``will not remain indifferent'' if the
former Soviet republics in the Baltics _ Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania _ are invited to join NATO.
	   The general complained that there are people ``who today
nostalgically recall the Cold War times. There are more forces
within NATO that seek to bring us back into the past than there are
in Russia.''

EU formally approves tobacco advertising ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union formally approved a law
Monday to phase-out tobacco advertising in the 15 nation bloc.
	   The EU-wide ban will abolish almost all tobacco advertising by
2006. It was rubber-stamped by the 15 member nations at a meeting
of their research ministers.
	   Approval was a formality after the ban received the backing of
EU health ministers in December and a majority of legislators in
the European Parliament last month.
	   Germany and Austria voted against the ban, arguing individual EU
nations should be free to decide such public health issues. Spain
and Denmark abstained.
	   Under the directive, most tobacco advertising will be illegal
within four years and cigarette makers will have until October 2006
to end sponsorship of major sports and cultural events.
	   Tobacco advertising is already banned in Finland, France, Italy,
Portugal, and Sweden. Belgium plans to ban it next year.

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ No team could be more upbeat after
two World Cup losses.
	   The tournament will be over for Japan after its game against
fellow newcomer Jamaica Friday. But the players are proud to have
conceded only one goal each against the far more experienced
Croatian and Argentinian teams.
	   ``It's like a field trip. The World Cup isn't over until you go
home,'' said 30-year-old forward Masashi Nakayama, who almost
scored Saturday.
	   ``We have to defend and defend, then we have to move up front
and go for the goal,'' Nakayama said Monday after morning training.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada gave his players the rest of Monday off to
allow them to recharge mentally and physically.
	   ``The team is not going to change in two or three days. But
we'll do our best against Jamaica,'' Okada said, adding that he
expected to fare better in the next game.
	   Jamaica, which lost to Argentina 5-0 on Sunday, was defeated
earlier by Croatia 3-1. Japan suffered narrower losses to Argentina
and Croatia _ both 1-0.
	   ``It's not the end of the world. It's just our final game in our
first World Cup,'' Okada said with a smile.
	   Yutaka Akita, who played well in defense against two of the
world's top strikers _ Gabriel Batistuta and Davor Suker _
acknowledged he was disappointed about not advancing past the first
round.
	   ``But I don't have any regrets. I played the best that I
could,'' said Akita. ``The next game, I'm going to play with my
head held high.''
	   Defender Naoki Soma said that it will be vital to hold out when
the Jamaicans are on top, and wait for the tide to turn.
	   ``There's not that much difference between us and them in
ability. But that's not all there is to winning,'' Soma said.
``Even if we play a good game, we lose by one goal. That's the
major obstacle we have to get over.''
	   ``A near-win isn't enough,'' said midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi.
``We have one more game left.''

Philippine police seize 243 kilograms of illegal drugs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Drug enforcement agents have seized
243 kilograms (534 pounds) of drugs worth 500 million pesos (dlrs
12.5 million) abandoned by smugglers in the northern Philippines,
police said Monday.
	   National police chief Santiago Alino said the seizure of
methamphetamine hydrochloride, called ``shabu'' in the Philippines,
was the largest this year.
	   He said villagers told police that unidentified men were
unloading cargo last week from canoes in the village of Babuyan
Shara in Cagayan province.
	   The men fled when they saw a police boat approaching, leaving
their cargo behind.
	   Police seized about eight plastic sacks containing a total of
243.65 kilograms of the drug, Alino said.
	   He said police believe a foreign-registered boat brought the
drugs into the country's territorial waters and was met at sea by
canoes that carried them ashore.
	   Many isolated coastal villages are used by smugglers to bring
drugs, contraband items and even humans into the Philippines
because they are difficult to guard.
	   In May last year, police recovered 253 kilograms (556 pounds) of
shabu from a van driven by two Chinese citizens who tried to escape
after hitting a 7-year-old girl in metropolitan Manila.
	   Drug use is rising rapidly in the Philippines despite a tough
law that provides for the death penalty for possession of more than
200 grams (7 ounces) of shabu or 40 grams (1.4 ounces) of cocaine,
heroin, opium or morphine.
	   There are an estimated 1.7 million drug users in the
Philippines, most of them hooked on shabu, which is regarded as the
``poor man's cocaine.''
	   The yearly trade in drugs is estimated at 300 billion pesos
(dlrs 7.5 billion).

Jewish settlers move into home in Arab area of Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Private security guards stood on the roof and
at the entrance of a home in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood of
Silwan on Monday, a day after Jewish settlers moved into the
building.
	   The Elad settlement group has bought or taken control of 23
homes in Silwan, just outside the walled Old City, in the past six
years and is trying to purchase dozens more, said spokesman Yigal
Canaan.
	   Canaan said the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
helped pay Elad for the security guards that were posted outside
several Jewish homes in Silwan on Monday. The government ``gives us
moral support and subsidizes the security costs,'' Canaan said.
	   Elad and another settlement group, Ateret Cohanim, have in
recent years moved into dozens of homes in Arab neighborhoods in
east Jerusalem, the sector the Palestinians claim as a future
capital.
	   ``The ultimate goal is to divide and isolate the Palestinians in
Jerusalem and make the city an exclusively Jewish once,'' said
Khalil Tufakji, head cartographer at the PLO headquarters in
Jerusalem.
	   Israel has said it will never relinquish sovereignty over all of
Jerusalem, including the eastern sector it captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Israeli leaders have said they supported the goals of Elad and
Ateret Cohanim, but have portrayed the settlers' campaign as a
series of private real estate transactions.

Closing arguments in trial of commander accused of allowing rape

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes prosecutors Monday
sought justice for a Muslim woman, urging U.N. judges to convict a
Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander for ``aiding and abetting''
her rape by letting his subordinates repeatedly attack her.
	   Lawyers presented their closing arguments before the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal in the trial of Anto Furundzija, the first war
crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault committed
during an interrogation.
	   Furundzija, 28, has been charged with two war crimes for
standing by while a Muslim woman was raped and for failing to stop
it. He has pleaded innocent to these charges and faces a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Tribunal judges did not immediately set a date for their
verdict.
	   Prosecutors say Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as
``The Jokers'' which took part in a campaign by Bosnian Croat
forces to drive Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley
in 1993.
	   Prosecutor Patricia Sellers said the alleged rape victim,
identified in court only as Witness A, was taken to the Jokers'
headquarters in Vitez in May 1993, stripped naked and interrogated
before a group of Furundzija's men.
	   While Furundzija was questioning the woman, another man rubbed a
knife against her thigh and threatened to cut out her vagina.
	   She was later taken to another room and raped in the presence of
Furundzija, who did not stop the incident.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   ``There was no move to stop ... what was clearly illegal,''
Sellers told the three-judge panel. ``There was no act of
salvation.''
	   Witness A testified in a closed session before the U.N. court
during earlier hearings.
	   ``The threat to kill, the forced nudity, the threat of
mutilation, the rapes ... showed that he (Furundzija) intended to
inflict serious mental harm and commit the crime of torture,'' she
added.
	   Defense lawyer Luka Misetic rebuffed the accusations, saying
Sellers could win an award for the ``best fictional script.''
	   Misetic contended that the prosecution's entire case rests on
the alleged victim's testimony, stressing that there was no other
collaborating testimony.
	   Characterizing the alleged victim as a psychiatric patient,
Misetic said her testimony was unreliable because of her clouded
memory and her susceptibility to outside pressure.
	   ``She has gotten her facts very wrong ... Her reconstruction was
not reliable, let alone, convincing beyond a reasonable doubt,''
said Misetic.
	   ``This case cries out for an acquittal,'' he said.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
trying to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 60 people
and issued an unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28
defendants in custody.

Assassin, two others appeal conspiracy sentence to Supreme Court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yigal Amir, who is serving life in prison for
killing Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, appealed to the
Supreme Court Monday to overturn a conspiracy conviction he
received together with his brother and a friend.
	   In addition to life in prison, Amir was found guilty in a
separate trial of conspiracy to commit the murder and plotting
attacks against Arabs and was sentenced to another five years. His
brother Hagai and their friend Dror Adani were also found guilty of
those same charges and sentenced to 12 years each in October 1996.
	   All three have denied a conspiracy.
	   At Monday's court hearing, lawyers for the state responded to
the appeal by asking the court to consider stiffening the sentences
of all three convicts, a court spokesman said.
	   ``There is no decision yet. The court delayed it for a few
weeks,'' said Moshe Meroz, the attorney representing Hagai Amir.
	   Yigal Amir, an extreme right-wing religious Jew said he wanted
to put an end to Rabin's peace making policies with the
Palestinians when he fired three bullets into Rabin as he left a
peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995.

Louise Woodward says she was made a scapegoat in baby's death scapegoat, not that parents were to blame 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States, Louise Woodward said she was made a
scapegoat for the death of a baby in her care because authorities
had to find someone to blame.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview scheduled for broadcast Monday night.
Excerpts were broadcast earlier on BBC television news.
	   The baby's family was not immediately available for comment.
	   Prosecutors claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to Britain
on Thursday convicted of manslaughter, shook 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen to death in February 1997. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me. But like I say, you know, I didn't do
anything wrong,'' Ms. Woodward said in the interview, according to
excerpts broadcast by the BBC.
	   Ms. Woodward was allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentence her to the 279 days she had already spent
in prison.
	   The 20-year-old Ms. Woodward said she was fortunate her sentence
was not longer.
	   But she added: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an innocent
person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing, worry and
pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up in a prison
in a strange country _ and please remember that I was 18 when I
went into prison _ and being scared, for something that you didn't
even do.''
	   A photograph released by the BBC of Ms. Woodward being
interviewed by reporter Martin Bashir drew criticism today from The
Sun and The Mirror newspapers, which saw echoes of Bashir's famous
interview with Princess Diana in 1995. During the interview, Diana
talked of the breakdown of her marriage.
	   ``Woodward seems to model herself on the princess by dressing
and sitting like her,'' The Mirror said. ``She has perfected the
coy, wide-eyed look Diana used.'' convey 'I'm as innocent as Diana
was' or 'I'm as great a lover of children as Diana was.''
	   The BBC countered that any resemblance to the interview with
Princess Diana was ``pure coincidence,'' The Mirror said.
	   Ms. Woodward said during a news conference Thursday that she
received no payment for the BBC interview and that she would not
sell her story. But the tabloid Daily Mail confirmed it paid 40,000
pounds (dlrs 66,000) to her parents in November. The newspaper
began publishing a series on Saturday which it said was based on
contacts with the former au pair and her parents over several
months.

South Korea committed to trade liberalization 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ South Korea will stand by its
commitment to open some key industries to free trade, but wants
greater flexibility in the process of doing so, officials said
Monday.
	   South Korean trade minister Han Duck-soo said late Monday that
flexibility in free trade was expected to become a key issue in the
second day of talks among trade ministers at the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``We are still committed to trade liberalization despite our
economic problems,'' Han said.
	   ``One thing is quite certain. ... There should be a credible
(trade liberalization) package arising from this trade meeting,''
he said.
	   Han emphasized it was important that voluntarism on the part of
the 18 member countries was recognized as a crucial principle of
APEC.
	   The two-day meeting on Borneo Island is the first among trade
ministers since the APEC summit in Vancouver last November, when
APEC members agreed to undertake a fast-track liberalization
approach to trade in nine key industries.
	   The United States is pushing member nations to commit to certain
time frames and tariff reductions so that APEC nations can begin to
open up those industries by next year.
	   ``We have made it clear we will participate in the trade
liberalization process,'' said Han, though South Korea would ask
for flexibility in the fisheries and forestry industries.
	   In other words, it is not prepared to open up those markets to
free trade quite yet.
	   Korea agrees with some members that APEC should be used as a
tool to enhance trade liberalization within the framework of the
World Trade Organization. Han said it was ``natural'' to take any
trade liberalization accomplishments within APEC and go to the WTO
to enhance the process.
	   Han said the liberalization of Korea's steel and automobile
sectors was also discussed in bilateral negotiations with the U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
	   He added that the United States was seeking more information
about the restructuring of the Korean steel sector and Korea's
plans to open up its automobile market ahead of a likely meeting
between the two countries next month.
	   Han emphasized again that Japan's falling yen would continue to
have a ``dangerous'' impact on Korea's exports because 50 percent
of the country's shipments compete with the Japanese.

Foreign minister: `Details' needed before swap is concluded 
</HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Details must be worked out before remains
of an Israeli soldier are swapped for Lebanese prisoners and dead
guerrillas held by Israel, Lebanon's foreign minister said Monday.
	   The comments were the latest to mark months of tortuous
negotiations mediated by the International Committee of the Red
Cross for the exchange of the remains of Itamar Ilya, an Israeli
soldier killed in an ambush in September, for scores of Lebanese
killed in fighting or detained in southern Lebanon.
	   ``Although progress was achieved, I think these discussions
still need more details,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said
Monday.
	   The swap was expected this week, although the numbers of
prisoners and dead guerrillas to be handed over were not clear.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV, which reported Sunday that Ilya's body
would be returned at the end of this week, said Israel would
release the bodies of 60 Lebanese guerrillas killed in fighting and
buried in Israel after Ilya's body is identified.
	   Israeli sources told The Associated Press in Jerusalem on Sunday
that Israel would release 50 guerrillas for Ilya's remains.
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir said Monday a French plane
would carry the Israeli body parts from Beirut airport to Tel Aviv,
while a second plane would carry the bodies of 40 Lebanese
guerrillas from Tel Aviv to Beirut in coordination with the ICRC.
	   In addition to the remains, including those of the son of
Hezbollah guerrilla leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Israel would
release 60 prisoners from Israeli prisons and the Khiam detention
camp in an Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, As-Safir
said.
	   lya and 11 other commandos were killed Sept. 5 in a botched raid
north of the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   As-Safir said the pro-Syrian Amal faction, the Shiite Muslim
rival of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group, has not yet
given its approval to the swap.
	   Amal, which holds Ilya's scalp, has demanded the release of a
number of its fighters detained by Israel, the paper said.
	   Amal effectively torpedoed a swap earlier this month when it
refused to hand over the part it holds.

Top aide to Saudi financier of Islamic militants to stand trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top aide to Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi
billionaire and financier of Islamic extremists worldwide, has been
extradited to Egypt to stand trial, police said Monday.
	   Saeed Sayyed Salama, an Egyptian, was returned to Cairo several
days ago and has been charged with planning to overthrow the
Egyptian government, he officials said. He is also charged with
joining an illegal organization.
	   If convicted, Salama could be executed.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said Salama was extradited from an Arab country, but they wouldn't
name the country for security reasons.
	   No details were available of when and where the trial will be
held.
	   The officials said Salama confessed that he had closely worked
with Bin Laden in Afghanistan, where the billionaire lives, and was
given the task of supervising some of his economic projects.
	   Salama also confessed that he visited several Arab countries and
met with Islamic activists to convey Bin Laden's messages.
	   Salama was a member of the Egyptian extremist group, the Islamic
Jihad, which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981. He left
Egypt in the early 1990's after the government cracked down on the
Jihad.
	   His extradition was carried out according to a pan-Arab
anti-terrorism treaty signed in Cairo last April by the 22 members
of the Arab League, the police officials said.
	   A U.S. State Department report in May said Islamic extremists
from around the world continued to use Afghanistan as a training
ground and home base from which to operate.

Malaysia wants APEC to prevent full Asian recession 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-APEC
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Pacific-Rim countries must take steps
to quickly bolster their domestic economies or risk a full-blown
Asian recession, Malaysia's trade minister said Monday.
	   Opening the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers'
forum, Minister of Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said stronger
economies should understand the problems in Asia and ``assist in
the process of economic recovery.''
	   Rafidah said APEC can play a role in ``confidence and capacity
building'' and the ``deliberations (of the conference) must be in
the context of diminished economic capabilities'' in Asia.
	   She emphasized that the Kuching conference ``must be much more
forward (in its moves) than people expect it to be.'' The APEC
grouping can't be ``passive'' in its approach amid the current
turmoil in financial markets in the region, nor can it ignore the
crisis.
	   ``APEC member economies cannot just talk about all this market
liberalization and market openings in isolation, or detached from
what's happening in half the APEC region,'' said Rafidah. ``There's
no room for idealism in APEC. ... Reality must set in.''
	   APEC is an 18-member grouping comprising countries from North
and South America and Asia. Much of the discussion in recent months
in the grouping has centered on the process of trade
liberalization.

Assassin, two others appeal conspiracy sentence to Supreme Court 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yitzhak Rabin's assassin appealed to the
Supreme Court Monday to overturn a conspiracy conviction he
received together with his brother and a friend.
	   In addition to the life sentence he received for the
assassination life in prison, Yigal Amir received a separate
five-year sentence for conspiracy to commit the murder and plotting
attacks against Arabs.
	   His brother Hagai and their friend Dror Adani were also found
guilty on those charges and sentenced to 12 years each in October
1996.
	   All three have denied a conspiracy.
	   At Monday's court hearing, lawyers for the state responded to
the appeal by asking the court to consider stiffening the sentences
of all three convicts, a court spokesman said.
	   ``There is no decision yet. The court delayed it for a few
weeks,'' said Moshe Meroz, the attorney representing Hagai Amir.
	   Yigal Amir, an extreme right-wing religious Jew said he wanted
to put an end to Rabin's peace making policies with the
Palestinians when he fired three bullets into Rabin as he left a
peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995.

Bosnia's first convertible currency put in circulation Monday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new currency going into circulation, quotes
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian dinars worth 5
million German marks were exchanged within three hours Monday as
Bosnia's new common currency went into circulation.
	   Company bookkeepers in areas dominated by Bosnian Muslims were
the first to line up for the Bosnian mark, the country's new
currency and first convertible coinage. The Bosnian dinars they
turned in will no longer be distributed.
	   The afternoon was set aside for residents, and Central Bank
Governor Peter Nicholl was the first to exchange his Bosnian dinars
for Bosnian marks.
	   Then scores of people flooded the state payment office in
Sarajevo to exchange their cash, with army guards controlling the
crowds.
	   ``I expect not to worry any more whether my money will lose
value,'' said Nedzad Hodzic, 36, walking on crutches. The veteran,
who was injured during the Bosnian war, was among the first to
exchange his 13,000 Bosnian dinars (130 German marks) for 130
Bosnian marks.
	   The Bosnian mark is linked 1-to-1 to the German mark, with the
exchange rate guaranteed by the country's internationally run
Central Bank.
	   ``It's not more money, but more security,'' said Bera Hodzic, a
63-year-old pensioner waiting in line.
	   In other parts of the country, the payment bureau counters
weren't so crowded.
	   Since Bosnia declared independence in 1992 and descended into
war, four currencies have circulated. The Bosnian Serb half of the
country, in a kind of monetary union with neighboring Yugoslavia,
uses the Yugoslav dinar.
	   Regions under Bosnian Croat control use the Croatian kuna, while
areas under Muslim control use the Bosnian dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   International officials and quarreling local politicians finally
decided the new currency would be the Bosnian mark. Economic
experts have no doubt the new currency will be accepted everywhere.
	   ``This is a strong currency,'' Nicholl said. It is the only hard
currency in this corner of Europe.
	   Several local banks opened accounts for clients in the new
currency and the first transaction between two companies was made
Monday morning, said Enver Backovic, the Central Bank vice
governor.
	   Even after distribution of the new currency officially ends July
7, businesses can accept Yugoslav dinar, Bosnian dinar or Croatian
kuna. But taxes and duties will have to be paid in Bosnian marks.
	   So far, the Bosnian Central Bank has 130 million (dlrs 73
million) German marks as back-up for the new currency.
	   The money was printed in France, which donated 7 million marks
(dlrs 3.9 million) for printing and transport.

Nokia signs dlrs 30 million deal with Iowa Wireless Services 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish telecommunications group Nokia
has won a dlrs 30 million deal to supply Iowa Wireless Services
with digital mobile phone equipment, the company said Monday.
	   The multi-year contract is for a 1900 Global System of Mobile
communications network which is expected to be in operation by the
end of the year.
	   The GSM network and equipment will make the Iowa company's
Personal Communications Services available to 2.3 million people,
Nokia said.
	   GSM is the world's most widely used digital wireless
communications standard.
	   ``Our partnership with Iowa Wireless Services is another
important step in the adoption of digital wireless services in the
United States,'' said Jyrki Palo, head of Nokia's infrastructure
business group in the United States.
	   Iowa Wireless Services, headquartered in Des Moines, hold
licenses to provide PCS services in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri,
Illinois, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
	   Finland-based Nokia is a world leader in digital mobile phone
technology, and has supplied GSM equipment to 67 operators in 35
countries.
	   Last year, it had a record pretax profit of 8.4 billion markkaa
(dlrs 1.55 billion) with net sales of 52.6 billion markkaa (dlrs
9.8 billion). It employs more than 38,000 people worldwide.

Kiriyenko: Russia needs IMF funds to stabilize ruble to TRIM. 
</HEADLINE>

By JUDITH INGRAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and fend off speculative attacks.
	   ``We're merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central
Bank,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``This will increase reliability and will make it possible to
rebuff any speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.''
	   Kiriyenko met with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the economic crisis, while IMF
negotiators were headed to Moscow. An expanded Cabinet meeting on
the strategy, chaired by Yeltsin, is scheduled Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the
IMF was making some unacceptable demands. The fund has been
pressing Russia to sharply curtail spending, boost tax collections
and reform its energy sector.
	   ``We will look at and consider the conditions, but it goes
without saying that far from all of the conditions are acceptable
to us,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The ruble fell slightly Monday, closing at 6.217, down from
6.2110, as traders waited for news from the Cabinet meeting and IMF
talks.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that the government program to cope
with the crisis included many unpopular steps, including tightly
reining in government spending, but that the poorest Russians would
be protected.
	   Yeltsin was giving ``maximum support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said. ``There hasn't been a single case when we didn't receive such
support for the measures elaborated by the government.''
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials,
including Yeltsin, have sufficient political will to push through
an austerity program.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on the so-called gray economy.
	   He said that the poorest Russians ``pay their 12 percent in
income tax, but a very significant amount that could be paid by the
others never reaches the budget,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The country cannot exist unless taxes are collected, and it
cannot spend more than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   He denied that the crisis management program would affect
Russia's long-term plans for financial development, but said that
the world financial crisis could.
	   ``Russia today is fairly closely integrated into the world
financial system,'' Kiriyenko said, according to Interfax. ``The
external threat is very high and we must ensure adequate financial
actions.''
	   Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman, confirmed earlier
reports that Russia was seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in talks with the IMF.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer and a separate team of
negotiators are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday.

U.S. and other diplomats leave Belarus for consultations claiming property is his.

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Ambassadors from the United States and
five European countries left Belarus on Monday to protest the
government's attempt to evict them from a diplomatic compound.
	   The dispute is the latest sign of conflict in Belarus' relations
with the West and, increasingly, with its onetime allies in the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies to the
Drozdy diplomatic compound and had ditches dug inside the
compound's gates, which prevented cars from entering.
	   Lukashenko has claimed the diplomatic residences as his own
property. He has a residence adjacent to the compound.
	   The ambassadors say the order to leave violates the Vienna
Convention, which designates homes of ambassadors as territory of
their countries.
	   British Ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce told the Foreign Ministry
that the European Union ``objected in the strongest terms to the
cut-off of water, electricity and telephone utilities, and refusal
to allow ambassadors' vehicles to enter the residential complex.''
	   She informed the ministry that Belarus' ambassadors to EU
countries would be instructed to return to Minsk ``to convey in the
strongest terms the disapproval of EU governments of the latest
Belarusian actions.''
	   Germany has already asked the Belarusian ambassador to Bonn to
return home.
	   In addition to Pearce and U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard, the
ambassadors from France, Greece, Italy and Germany left on a flight
to Frankfurt, Germany, on Monday afternoon.
	   Officially, they were recalled by their countries for
consultations over the standoff.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it has sent
Boris Berezovsky, a Kremlin emissary responsible for relations with
the former Soviet republics, to Minsk to meet with Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
It did not say what was on Berezovsky's agenda.
	   Belarusian authorities have been trying to force ambassadors out
of their homes in a wooded compound on the outskirts of Minsk,
claiming the residences badly need of sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or plots on which
to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko has canceled a trip to Switzerland that had been
scheduled for Thursday, the Interfax news agency said. It did not
say why he had decided not to travel.

Top aide to Saudi financier of Islamic militants to stand trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top aide to an Afghanistan-based financier
of Islamic extremists worldwide has been extradited to Egypt to
stand trial, police said Monday.
	   Saeed Sayyed Salama, an Egyptian, confessed that he had closely
worked with Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, where the Saudi
billionaire is based, and was given the task of supervising some of
his economic projects, the police officials said.
	   He also confessed to meeting with Islamic activists in Arab
countries to convey Bin Laden's messages, the officials said.
	   Salama was returned to Cairo several days ago and has been
charged with planning to overthrow the Egyptian government, they
said. He is also charged with joining an illegal organization. If
convicted, Salama could be executed.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said Salama was extradited from an Arab country they would not name
for security reasons, according to a pan-Arab anti-terrorism treaty
signed in Cairo last April by the 22 members of the Arab League.
	   No details were available of when and where the trial will be
held.
	   Salama was a member of the Egyptian extremist group, the Islamic

Egypt in the early 1990's after the government cracked down on the
Jihad.

Thai Farmers Bank to take over ailing finance company 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Farmers Bank, one of Thailand's
biggest banks, announced Monday it will take over the country's
largest finance company, Phatra Thanakit.
	   Banthoon Lamsam, the bank's chairman, said at a news conference
that the bank will raise its stake in the troubled finance company
from 49 percent to 100 percent.
	   Investors have been selling off shares in Phatra Thanakit since
the company announced June 5 that it would sell a 51 percent stake
in Phatra Securities Co. to Merrill Lynch for dlrs 68 million.
	   Analysts said that without the profitable securities arm, Phatra
Thanakit was in trouble.
	   Thai financial authorities have ordered more than half the
country's finance companies into liquidation. Earnings in the
sector have collapsed amid a severe recession and mounting
non-performing loans.
	   Phatra said in a statement it expects a net loss in the year's
first half of 2.7 billion baht (dlrs 64.3 million). Operational
losses will amount to 400 million baht (dlrs 9.5 million), while
2.3 billion baht (dlrs 54.8 million) will be added to loan-loss
reserves.
	   Banthoon said Thai Farmers Bank will guarantee all 29.4 billion
baht (dlrs 700 million) in public deposits at the finance company.
	   Banyong Pongpanich, executive director of Phatra Thanakit, said
the finance company will separate its good assets from bad assets
and set up separate institutions to handle them. Both institutions
will be 100 percent owned by Thai Farmers Bank, he said.
	   Banyong said the bad asset institution will try to collect as
many debts as possible and sell bad loans to interested investors
at discounts. As of Dec. 31, Phatra Thanakit had 12.32 billion baht
(dlrs 293.3 million) in bad debts, accounting for 20.5 percent of
total loans. The company expects its non-performing loans will rise
to 36 percent of total loans, or about 20.82 billion baht (dlrs
495.7 million), by the end of June.
	   The good asset institution will continue to lend to good
customers but won't accept new clients, Banyong said.
	   Banyong said all proceeds received from selling debts will be
used to repay Phatra Thanakit's creditors. The proceeds left after
repaying all creditors will belong to Thai Farmers Bank.
	   At the same time, Phatra Thanakit will actively seek foreign
partners to invest in the good asset institution.
	   Banyong said it probably will take two to three years to sell
off all bad loans. After that Phatra Thanakit will completely
disappear from the finance sector, he said.
	   ``This is the best way to solve our problems at a time of
economic crisis,'' Banyong said. ``This way shareholders' benefits
will be protected the most and Phatra Thanakit will not become a
burden to the government and the society.''
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand suspended trading in Phatra
Thanakit shares for the Monday afternoon session at the request of
the company.

	   An immigration officer said an Indonesian-born local resident
and two Indonesian illegal immigrants had been arrested.
	   When immigration officers detained them in a house, they also
seized about 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,500) worth of equipment

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government promised it will speed
the resettlement of black peasants on farms seized from whites in a
bid to persuade squatters to leave private land they have invaded.
	   A total of 104 farms will be handed over to peasants across the
country within about two months, said David Karimanzira, governor
of a province where hundreds of peasants have camped on four
white-owned farms.
	   Most farms will be available before land preparation for the new
agricultural season begins in August, and 12 have been carved up
into plots and will be resettled ``almost immediately,''
Karimanzira said.
	   In a statement to the state-controlled Herald newspaper,
Karimanzira said the government has stepped up its program for the
urgent but ``orderly'' handover of farms.
	   He said 21 farms were available in his Mashonaland East
province.
	   Karimanzira and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai met with
peasant leaders Sunday near the provincial capital of Marondera, 80
kilometers (50 miles) east of Harare.
	   Officials said peasants from the overcrowded Svosve district
nearby agreed to leave the private farms they moved onto during the
past week.
	   Peasants accused the government of delaying land reforms and
bringing villagers from other regions to settle on farms already
seized by the state in their province.
	   Farmers' leaders estimated about 300 peasants were camped on
private land by Sunday. No violence was reported.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations envoy to Angola on
Monday flew to UNITA's central highland stronghold to urge the
leader of the former rebel movement to comply with the latest
deadline for the completion of the country's delayed peace process.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye was seeking to secure UNITA chief Jonas
Savimbi's compliance with Tuesday's deadline for the handover to
the government of four
	   key areas which are still under UNITA control, in contravention
of a 1994 peace pact.
	   The venue for the talks was Andulo, in Bie province, where
Savimbi lives,. The other so-called ``sensitive areas'' are
Nhaeria, also in Bie, and Mungo and Bailundo in Huambo province.
All four lie about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   Lingering hostility between UNITA and the government has slowed
full implementation of the peace accord, which ended a two-decade
civil war.
	   Savimbi has refused to move to the capital Luanda, saying he
fears for his safety.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said it will impose new sanctions
on UNITA,
	   banning its diamond exports and freezing its overseas bank
accounts, unless it complies with all terms of the peace accord by
Tuesday.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the 50 percent of the country it seized
during the civil war.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Municipal security officers on
Monday prevented the exhumations of the bodies of three African
National Congress guerrillas who were convicted of sabotage and
conspiracy and were executed in 1964.
	   City security staff demanded the exhumations be halted, claiming
no permission had been sought.
	   Police were called in despite the pleas of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology Deputy Minister Brigitte Mabandla, and two
of the city's mayors. Family members of the dead broke down in
tears and accused the security personnel of racism.
	   ``You took our father from us, why are you doing these things,''
one family member shouted.
	   Zinakile Mkaba, 35, Vuyisile Mini, 45 and Wilson Khayingo, 38,
were hanged on November 6, 1964.
	   The ruling ANC also hoped to exhume the bodies of three other
ANC guerrillas. The six men had stood trial together and all are to
be reburied in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on Saturday.
	   The guerrillas had fought apartheid, the system of white
dominance which ended when the ANC won the country's first all-race
elections in 1994.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The government has deployed paramilitary
police, regular police and unarmed rangers in the Maasai Mara Game
Reserve to fend off bandits and reassure visitors, according to a
local administrator quoted in Monday's Daily Nation.
	   Francis Sigei said security had been tightened up in one of
Kenya's best known game reserves, resulting in a ``boom'' of
reservations.
	   But hotel and camp operators disputed Sigei's claim. The area
has suffered from a steep decline in tourism due to banditry and
very bad roads.
	   The Maasai Mara game park is a great wedge of grassland along
the border with Tanzania. Lions, elephants, buffalo and giraffes
are commonly seen. In September and October an annual migration of
millions of wildebeest pass through from the dry plains of
Tanzania.
	   ``From last week, our bookings have gone up by five percent,
which I believe is the case with others. But it is erroneous to say
there is a boom,'' said Peter Mbugua, marketing manager with Serena
Lodges and Hotels.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Lions mauled to death and ate part of a
man found naked in their pen at a nature park, news reports said.
	   Police identified the 33-year-old man from clothing left outside
the pen at the Lion and Cheetah Park, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west
of Harare.
	   Relatives said they were called to the private park by the owner
on June 16. The man's remains were in a pen containing 10 lions
``and one of his fleshless arms was left in the corner,'' the
Zimbabwe Standard newspaper reported.
	   Police spokesman James Kawara said pathologists were preparing a
report on the man's death in an attempt to establish whether he
jumped or was forced into the lions' pen.
	   Relatives told police the man was not psychologically disturbed
and was unlikely to have taken his own life.
	   ------
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The government has suspended two
Swahili-language newspapers for publishing pornographic photographs
and cartoons, contrary to their declared editorial policy.
	   A statement from Information Ministry said Monday that Tingisha
(Shake) changed its style after the government suspended two other
publications for similar offenses June 8.
	   Watu (People), which had earlier stopped publishing on its own,
hit the streets again with pornographic photographs and cartoons
soon after other two
	   publications were suspended.
	   Tanzanian's Newspaper Act of 1972 empowers Information Minister
to suspend publication of newspapers or magazines for whatever
reasons without a court ruling.
	   Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has promised to repeal laws that
date from British rule.

Nephew of late Thai premier selected to lead party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Korn Dabaransi was selected Monday to
head Thailand's Chart Pattana party, succeeding his late uncle,
former Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.
	   Chatichai died of liver cancer in a London hospital on May 6 at
age 76. Thailand's prime minister from 1988-91, Chatichai founded
the Chart Pattana (National Development) party in 1992 after
splitting from the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party, which he helped
found in 1974.
	   Chart Pattana was represented in the previous government, but
went into opposition last year when Chuan Leekpai became prime
minister in a Democrat party-led coalition government.
	   Korn, deputy leader of Chart Pattana, was selected by the
party's executive board to succeed Chatichai after being nominated
by party Secretary-General Suwat Liptapanlop.
	   Suwat, who before Chatichai's death was also considered a
contender for the leadership, described the choice of Korn as
``effective.''

Argentinians firm in World Cup betting stakes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta and his Argentina team-mates
have firmed in the betting to win the World Cup after a 5-0 win
over Jamaica on Sunday.
	   British bookmakers Ladbrokes had offered pre-tournament odds of
12-1 for Argentina to win the World Cup and 8-1 for Batistuta to
win the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals.
	   But Batistuta's three goals against Jamaica, adding to the goal
he scored in Argentina's first game, contributed to his odds of
winning the Golden Boot fall to 2-1 on Monday.
	   Argentina is now second favorite to win the World Cup, falling
from 12-1 to 5-1 after two first round wins.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said all the clever money was on
Batistuta to win the Golden Boot.
	   Boyce said he expected the hours from before England plays
Romania until Scotland plays Morocco to be the busiest 24 hours of
soccer betting ever in Britain.
	   ``They're both crucial matches, they both offer attactive
betting possibilities and of course they're both prime time
viewing,'' he said.
	   Boyce said odds on Scotland qualifying for the next round had
shortened to 8-13.

Philips, Seagram reach agreement on sale of PolyGram Levy, new interim chief executive appointed. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with PolyGram announcing resignation of
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Philips Electronics said Monday it
has reached a definitive agreement on the sale of PolyGram, the
world's largest music company, to Canada's Seagram Co. for dlrs
10.4 billion.
	   Within hours, PolyGram announced that president and CEO Alain
Levy had resigned and chief financial officer Jan Cook would guide
the company through the transition.
	   The dlrs 10.5 billion price was below the dlrs 10.6 billion
agreed to earlier for the purchase of PolyGram, the latest conquest
for the Canadian beverage giant in its drive to become an
entertainment conglomerate.
	   Philips said the price was reduced to ``reflect the
lower-than-expected financial results of PolyGram during the second
quarter of the year.''
	   The PolyGram deal cements Seagram's transformation three years
after it bought MCA Inc., now known as Universal Studios.
Montreal-based Seagram has said the PolyGram purchase will be
completed between September and November.
	   Philips announced in May it intended to sell its 75 percent
stake in the Dutch entertainment group PolyGram to the Canadian
liquor giant. Europe's largest consumer electronics group said the
sale was part of its strategy to divest non-core activities.
	   Seagram, which will purchase the stake through its subsidiary
Universal Studios Inc. as part of tender offer for all issued
shares, will pay 115 guilders, or dlrs 57, per share.
	   The final agreement, subject to the usual regulatory approval,
calls for Seagram to issue a maximum of about 47.9 million common
shares.
	   Shares of both Philips and PolyGram dropped in early trading
Monday on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Philips was down 1.2
percent to 172 guilders (dlrs 84.70), while PolyGram traded at
107.60 guilders (dlrs 53), down 0.4 percent.
	   Levy became CEO of PolyGram in 1991 and steered the company
through a period of dramatic growth and expansion to 12,000
employees.

Thailand says Pacific Rim trade pact needs adjustments 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Thailand said Monday adjustments must
be made to a Pacific-Rim trade pact to accommodate the
``sensitivities'' of developing countries.
	   Deputy Commerce Minister Photipong Lamsam said Thailand planned
to support an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum drive to
liberalize trade in nine key industries, but the agreement needed
more flexibility.
	   Trade ministers from the 18-member APEC forum are meeting for a
two-day session to hammer out the so-called ``early voluntary
sectoral liberalization'' agreement that would begin to cut tariffs
and other trade barriers in nine industries by 1999.
	   Photipong said Thailand had ``strong concerns'' about opening
its markets in two of the nine industries _ chemicals and, to a
lesser extent, toys.
	   The other industries set for free trade under the agreement
reached at last year's APEC summit in Vancouver are environmental
products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, jewelry,
medical goods and telecommunications.
	   ``We are not going to undermine the integrity of the package as
a whole,'' Photipong told The Associated Press. ``But some
sacrifices may have to made in the way of flexibility.''
	   The United States and other Western economic powers are pushing
to have the trade pact approved as a binding package with specific
time targets for cutting tariffs.
	   Many of APEC's Asian members, hard hit by the region's economic
downturn, are pressing for a looser time frame in which to open
their markets.
	   Thailand, as well as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, have asked
that flexible time frames and tariff reductions within the sectors
be negotiable.
	   ``We believe that to overcome the present crisis in East Asia,
liberalization is one way to do it. Full liberalization must be the
goal,'' Photipong said. ``Thailand will go as far as possible to
meet that goal.''

World Cup: Croatia complains to FIFA about translator, anthem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia has protested to FIFA about the
use of a Serb translator at a news conference after its game
against Japan last weekend, the country's soccer federation
president said Monday.
	   The letter to soccer's governing body also complained that the
brass band on the field played Croatia's national anthem too slowly
before the game, Branko Miksa said.
	   ``We sent a very kind letter Sunday to FIFA complimenting them
on the organization but making these two points,'' he told
reporters at the team's World Cup camp.
	   The complaint resulted from an incident at Saturday's post-match
news conference, when a Croatian official tried to stop a Serb
woman provided by local organizers from translating for coach
Miroslav Blazevic.
	   Nationalist feeling runs high in Croatia, which won independence
from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in a 1991 war. Before that, Serbs
and Croats shared the same language _ known as Serbo-Croatian _ and
still understand each other easily.
	   The Croatian government has tried since independence to develop
a distinct language by replacing some words with archaic Slavic
terms.
	   The band at Saturday's game in Nantes apparently lacked
experience with the Croatian anthem and Croatian fans who sang
along in the stadium kept getting ahead of the dragging tempo.
	   FIFA has not officially responded to the complaint, Miksa said.

Arab League asks world to force Israel sign nuclear treaty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Monday urged the world
community to pressure Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty so that an arms race in the region can be avoided.
	   ``The world community and its active powers should force Israel
to join the treaty and open all its nuclear installations for
international inspection,'' Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said in a letter.
	   The letter was read out at the opening of a meeting of an Arab
League technical group to prepare an anti-nuclear agreement on
making the Middle East free of nuclear weapons.
	   Israel has signed a treaty on not carrying out nuclear tests but
hasn't joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which obliged
signatories to move toward disarming. Although Israel has never
publicly acknowledged its nuclear power, it is believed to have
between 100 and 200 nuclear warheads.
	   Iraq used to have a nuclear weapons program until it was
dismantled by the United Nations during the last nine years, and
there are fears that Iran and Libya are trying to develop nuclear
weapons.
	   Many Arab countries feel frustrated that the United States and
other countries imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan and India
after their recent nuclear tests, but have long ignored Israel.
	   ``What is astonishing is that the reaction on the
Indian-Pakistani nuclear conflict is not implemented on Israel
which doesn't hide its intention to conduct test and acquire
nuclear weapons,'' Abdel-Meguid said in the letter.

Foreign minister: `Details' needed before swap is concluded 
</HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ There are still details to work out
before the remains of an Israeli soldier are swapped for Lebanese
prisoners and dead guerrillas held by Israel, Lebanon's foreign
minister said Monday _ including, according to one report, the
return of the soldier's scalp.
	   The comments were the latest to mark months of tortuous
negotiations mediated by the International Committee of the Red
Cross for the exchange of the remains of Itamar Ilya, an Israeli
soldier killed in an ambush in September, for scores of Lebanese
killed in fighting or detained in southern Lebanon.
	   ``Although progress was achieved, I think these discussions
still need more details,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said
Monday.
	   The swap was expected this week, although the numbers of
prisoners and dead guerrillas to be handed over were not clear.
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir said the pro-Syrian Amal
Shiite group, which holds Ilya's scalp, has demanded the release of
a number of its fighters detained by Israel. Amal effectively
torpedoed a swap earlier this month by witholding the scalp.
	   Jewish religious law mandates that all recoverable parts of a
body be buried together.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV, which reported Sunday that Ilya's body
would be returned at the end of this week, said Israel would
release the bodies of 60 Lebanese guerrillas killed in fighting and
buried in Israel after Ilya's body is identified.
	   As-Safir said Monday a French plane would carry the Israeli body
parts from Beirut airport to Tel Aviv, while a second plane would
carry the bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas from Tel Aviv to Beirut
in coordination with the ICRC.
	   In addition to the remains, including those of the son of Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah, a leader the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Israel
would release 60 prisoners from Israeli prisons and the Khiam
detention camp in an Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon,
As-Safir said.
	   Ilya and 11 other commandos were killed Sept. 5 in a botched
raid north of the Israeli-occupied zone.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova, a semifinalist last
year at Wimbledon, withdrew Monday from the tournament with torn
ligaments in her right thumb, tournament referee Alan Mills said.
	   The 17-year-old Russian injured the thumb last Thursday at
Eastbourne during a three-set victory over seven-time Wimbledon
champion Steffi Graf.
	   Kournikova, among a half-dozen rising teen-age stars on the

	   She was seeded No. 12 and replaced in the tournament bracket by
luck loser Lilia Osterloh of the United States.

Serb soldiers' morale tested in Kosovo; desertions rise 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The conscript's letter home spoke of
worsening terror in Kosovo _ and a desperation among some Serb
forces that has begun to spread to a disquieted Yugoslav public.
	   ``All in all, it's horrible,'' the soldier wrote, in the letter
quoted Monday by the Belgrade independent daily Nasa Borba, after
his mother brought it to a local paper in the town of Zrenjanin.
	   The final words were especially chilling: ``Don't worry _ if I
were normal, I'd go insane.''
	   After months of a stepped-up offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants in Kosovo, gaping cracks are starting to show in Serb
authorities' attempt to assert control in the secessionist
province, which Serbs say is the cradle of their culture.
	   Reports of army desertions and police officers' refusal to serve
in Kosovo are growing. And the controversial nature of the conflict
has prompted parents to take to the streets this month in protests
that are small but significant in the country President Slobodan
Milosevic rules with an authoritarian hand.
	   Milosevic has said the government will fight at all costs to
hold onto the southern province, where the population is 90 percent
ethnic Albanian. But public and military discontent over Kosovo are
growing.
	   ``It's enough to read in the papers that there are many wounded
and killed. Why go there and fight?'' one unidentified army
deserter was quoted in Nasa Borba on Monday as saying.
	   ``It's a civil war there and we never took the oath to fight
against each other,'' said the soldier from Montenegro _ Serbia's
partner in the Yugoslav Federation _ who fled with a group of other
soldiers to escape a possible posting to Kosovo.
	   Two other Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro
_ said Sunday in Albania that they fled the army because of orders
to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' Fahrudin Muric told Associated Press Television
in the northeastern Albanian town of Bajram Curri.
	   Parents of young army conscripts sent to Kosovo protested for
the third time Monday in front of the army general staff
headquarters building in Belgrade.
	   Similar protests have taken place in the towns of Nis and
Kragujevac. Some parents even tried to march on two barracks in
Kosovo this weekend, demanding to see their sons, but were turned
back by army officers.

Kyrgyzstan president fears excessive uranium dumping 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said his country is
storing urainium tailings unsafely, and cautioned that the practice
could lead to environmental disaster, a news agency reported
Monday.
	   During a visit Sunday to several of Kyrgyzstan's 45 uranium
tailing dumps, Akayev said unsafe storage of the radioactive
material was a particular threat in the south, which is often hit
by landslides and mudslides, Interfax reported.
	   He also said disaster could hit the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, as
well as parts of bordering Kazakstan.
	   The former Soviet republic in Central Asia has more than 50
million cubic meters (yards) of uranium tailings. It would cost an
estimated dlrs 2.5 million to make one dump completely safe,
Interfax reported.
	   Environmenal disaster struck Kyrgyzstan on May 20 when a truck
carrying 20 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide powder veered off a
mountain road and crashed into the Barskaan River, killing four
people and partially polluting a lake filled with endangered plant
and animal species.

Arab League asks world to force Israel sign nuclear treaty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Monday urged the world
community to pressure Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty so that an arms race in the region can be avoided.
	   ``The world community and its active powers should force Israel
to join the treaty and open all its nuclear installations for
international inspection,'' Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said at the opening of a meeting to prepare an
anti-nuclear agreement on freeing the Middle East of nuclear
weapons.
	   Israel has signed a treaty on not carrying out nuclear tests but
has yet to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which obliges
signatories to move toward disarming.
	   Although Israel has never publicly acknowledged its nuclear
power, it is believed to have between 100 and 200 nuclear warheads.
	   Iraq had a nuclear weapons program until it was dismantled by
the United Nations during the last nine years, and there are fears
that Iran and Libya are trying to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Many Arab countries feel frustrated that the United States and
other countries imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan and India
after their recent nuclear tests, but have long ignored Israel.
	   ``What is astonishing is that the reaction on the
Indian-Pakistani nuclear conflict is not implemented on Israel
which doesn't hide its intention to conduct test and acquire
nuclear weapons,'' Abdel-Meguid said in the letter.

Court rejects Banana's appeal to throw out sex case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The High Court on Monday rejected an
application by former President Canaan Banana to dismiss sex
charges against him, saying his trial must continue.
	   Although Banana's lawyers had said the state lacked evidence,
Judge Godfrey Chiyausiku said the High Court was satisfied the
evidence was sufficient to require Banana to refute it in court.
	   Banana is being tried on 11 charges of sodomy and homosexual
assault.
	   Banana, 62, a Methodist minister, theology professor and former
diplomat, denies he made unwanted advances to male staffers at his
official presidential residence between 1980 and 1987.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe, where President Robert
Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against gay rights.
	   Since Banana's trial began June 1, state prosecutors alleged
Banana repeatedly lured soldiers, aides and security men to his
quarters for sex and had them punished if they rejected his
advances.
	   One former aide said he was made to watch pornographic videos
before sex sessions at State House and a cook and a gardener
testified they were sexually assaulted by Banana.
	   Banana served as titular president after independence in 1980
until 1987, when Mugabe abolished the post of prime minister and
became executive president.

Sampras, Agassi win in straight set edits to conform and trim AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with Sampras, Agassi victories; Kournikova withdrawal;
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Back at his favorite tournament, on
his favorite court and his favorite surface, Pete Sampras played
again like the man who has ruled Wimbledon for four of the last
five years.
	   The top-seeded American opened play on Centre Court Monday with
a dominant 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Slovakia's Dominik Hrbraty, a
performance that belied the poor results that have cast doubt on
Sampras' chances of defending his title.
	   Within seconds of Sampras winning his match, 1992 champion Andre
Agassi completed a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory on Court 1 over Spain's
Alex Calatrava.
	   The tournament suffered a major blow when 17-year-old Russian
star Anna Kournikova withdrew with torn ligaments in her right
thumb. Kournikova, a semifinalist last year and No. 12 seed this
year, suffered the injury during a victory over Steffi Graf at
Eastbourne last week.
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
112th championships started in sunny weather and temperatures of 21
celsius (70 f). But by mid-afternoon, dark clouds moved in and
there was the chance of showers.
	   Sampras served an ace on the first point of his match, closed
out the first set with another ace and was never troubled during
the 1 hour, 19-minute match. He finished with 17 aces and eight
double faults.
	   The most entertaining moment of the one-sided match came after
Sampras nailed Hrbaty in the thigh with a service winner in the
fourth game of the second set. Waiting to return on the next point,
Hrbaty held up his racket in front of his body as mock protection,
drawing laughter from Sampras and the spectators.
	   The 13th-seeded Agassi, who has zoomed back up the rankings
since dropping to No. 141 last November and has been troubled
recently by a shoulder injury, recorded a convincing win over the
mismatched Calatrava.
	   Wearing a long-sleeved white shirt, Agassi was in full control
from the baseline. Calatrava, who received treatment on his left
knee in the second set, ended the match with a double fault.
	   In an early match, third-seeded Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, needed less than 90 minutes to defeat Spain's Javier
Sanchez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Looking at home on the grass, the Czech
left-hander served 16 aces and showed he could be among the top
challengers for Sampras' crown.
	   The highest women's seed in action Monday, No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory in 50 minutes over
Argentina's Florencia Labat.
	   The first women's seed to advance was No. 9 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa, who beat Kerry-Anne Guse of Australia 6-2, 6-2 in
just over an hour.
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has been relaid with new grass for the first
time in 40 years.
	   Sampras came into Wimbledon in a slump, lacking motivation and
talking of burnout. But Wimbledon has always been the place where
he excels.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity that seems to bring out the best in me,'' he
said before the tournament. ``When I get onto Centre Court, I'm
pumped, and I think the other guys still fear me.''
	   The American has lost his aura of invincibility since trouncing
Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He lost in
the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals of the
Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles to his credit, he needs just two more to equal Roy
Emerson's record of 12.
	   Players who could stop him include Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Agassi,
Krajicek, Korda, Patrick Rafter and the two Britons _ Greg Rusedski
and Tim Henman.
	   The exceptionally wide open nature of the men's tournament is
underlined by this fact: there have been 10 different players in
the last five Grand Slam finals.
	   In other featured men's matches, Kafelnikov faced big-serving
Mark Philippoussis and Henman was up against Jiri Novak.
	   Much of the focus this year will fall on the women's tournament,
where a fascinating mix of the new and the old will vie for the
title.
	   Martina Hingis, the defending champion and top seed, doesn't
play until Tuesday, as does fellow 17-year-olds Venus Williams.
	   The spotlight Monday fell to seven-time champion Graf, who was
scheduled on Centre Court against Spain's Gala Leon Garcia.
	   The fourth-seeded German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's
her first in two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing
major knee surgery a year ago.
	   Graf's comeback has been slowed by a series of other injuries
but she looked back on track last week at the Eastbourne
tournament, where she lost to Kournikova in a tight, three-setter.
	   Another leader of the old guard, Monica Seles, was scheduled to
play Monday against Maria Sanchez Lorenzo. Seles, whose career was
disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, made an inspiring run to the
French Open final earlier this month, just three weeks after the
death of her father Karolj.

Louise Woodward says she was made a scapegoat in baby's death

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States, Louise Woodward said she was made a
scapegoat for the death of a baby in her care because authorities
had to find someone to blame.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview scheduled for broadcast Monday night.
Excerpts were broadcast earlier on BBC television news.
	   The baby's family was not immediately available for comment.
	   But the attorney representing the Eappens in a civil suit
against Ms. Woodward said the young woman ``already told her story
and was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, a judge
and seven justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
	   ``It is obvious she is now more interested in her celebrity
status than the truth,'' said attorney Fredric Ellis.

Egypt and Turkey sign natural gas memorandum

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey and Egypt signed a memorandum of
understanding to transport natural gas through a pipeline that will
connect the two countries underneath the Mediterranean.
	   Turkish Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer has been on a visit to
Egypt since Saturday. On Monday, he held talks with Maher Abaza,
the Egyptian electricity and energy minister. Word of the
memorandum came in a statement Monday from Ersumer's office.
	   Egypt and Turkey signed a natural gas deal in 1996.
	   The statement gave no further details.
	   Abaza and Ersumer discussed projects to connect electricity
stations among Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Turkey, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova, a semifinalist last
year at Wimbledon, withdrew Monday from the tournament with torn
ligaments in her right thumb, tournament referee Alan Mills said.
	   The 17-year-old Russian injured the thumb last Thursday at
Eastbourne during a three-set grass-court victory over seven-time
Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf.
	   The withdrawal on Wimbledon's opening day was a blow to the
tournament, which has lost one of its most marketable players.
	   Kournikova, a photogenic young woman whose pictures were splased
across British newspapers during last year's tournamemnt, is among
a half-dozen rising teen-age stars on the women's circiut.
	   She was reported to have visited a specialist over the weekend
at Wimbledon and on Sunday the WTA Tour said she would play.
	   ``It is obviously very disappointing for the player herself and
the championships, as well as many people who were looking forward
to seeing her play,'' said chief executive Chris Gorringe.
	   She was seeded No. 12 and replaced in the tournament bracket by
luck loser Lilia Osterloh of the United States.

Poland, Romania to improve insufficient economic ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Romania need to improve
economic and cultural ties, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasilie
said Monday as he began a three-day visit to Poland, his first
foreign trip since taking office.
	   Vasilie met with his Polish host, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
Both praised bilateral political ties as very good, but said the
economic and cultural relations are insufficient. During his visit,
Vasilie hopes to lay a foundation for developing economic
cooperation, to match the countries' potential.
	   Both leaders said that their countries will take efforts to
strengthen democracy and the market economy in central and eastern
Europe and will develop cooperation with Ukraine.
	   Vasilie was also to meet with President Aleksander Kwasniewski
and Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, and business
representatives.
	   On Wednesday, he is to visit the Renaissance southern city of
Krakow.

Markets, rupee falter following sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with finance minister comment
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Stocks, bonds and the rupee fell Monday
as traders responded to the downgrading of India's credit rating
following anti-nuclear economic sanctions.
	   The U.S. sanctions, officially came in force since last week,
have created uncertainty among business leaders, despite claims by
Indian politicians that India can withstand them.
	   The rupee closed at a record low of 42.74 to the dollar Monday,
down from 42.20 Friday as banks and importers rushed to buy
dollars.
	   Prices of most major shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange also
fell, as did Indian government securities. The sharp rise in the
dollar against the rupee prompted bankers to buy dollars rather
than invest.
	   ``The rupee is traded in the market as any other commodity. It
will go up and down if market forces are at play,'' Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters in Bombay.
	   It was the first day of trading since Moody's Investors Service
Inc., the company that publishes ratings on companies according to
its assessment of their ability to repay debts, lowered its rating
for India on Friday.
	   Moody's, acting after Washington detailed its anti-nuclear
sanctions, said the downgrade reflected its concern that the
``fractious political environment'' would make it difficult for
Indian officials to get their economy back on track.
	   India's economic growth faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year
1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years and its deficit for
1997-98 was 6.1 percent of gross domestic product, exceeding the
target of 4.5 percent.
	   Moody's lowering of India's credit rating to BA2, an inferior
classification that falls in the speculative grade, from BAA3, the
lowest classification in the one notch higher investment grade, is
likely to mean Indian companies will be charged higher interests
when borrowing from foreign banks and reduce the amount of foreign
funds being invested in Indian shares and bonds.
	   Finance Minister Sinha said infrastructure projects dependent on
external financing will not suffer.
	   ``For any infrastructure project dependent on external
financing, we will negotiate alternate funding or we will meet the
gap from within the country,'' Sinha said. ``India has inner
strength ... No project will be allowed to suffer.''
	   India is expected to lose dlrs 2.5 billion in international bank
loans due to the sanctions.

Bosnia's first convertible currency put in circulation Monday TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian dinars worth 5
million German marks were exchanged within three hours Monday as
Bosnia's new common currency went into circulation.
	   Company bookkeepers in areas dominated by Bosnian Muslims were
the first to line up for the Bosnian mark, the country's new
currency and first convertible coinage. The Bosnian dinars they
turned in will no longer be distributed.
	   Central Bank Governor Peter Nicholl was the first to exchange
his Bosnian dinars for Bosnian marks. Scores of people flooded the
state payment office in Sarajevo to exchange their cash, with army
guards controlling the crowds.
	   ``I expect not to worry any more whether my money will lose
value,'' said Nedzad Hodzic, 36, walking on crutches. The veteran,
who was injured during the Bosnian war, was among the first to
exchange his 13,000 Bosnian dinars (130 German marks) for 130
Bosnian marks.
	   The Bosnian mark is linked 1-to-1 to the German mark, with the
exchange rate guaranteed by the country's internationally run
Central Bank.
	   ``It's not more money, but more security,'' said Bera Hodzic, a
63-year-old pensioner waiting in line.
	   Since Bosnia declared independence in 1992 and descended into
war, four currencies have circulated. The Bosnian Serb half of the
country, in an unofiicial kind of monetary union with neighboring
Yugoslavia, uses the Yugoslav dinar.
	   Regions under Bosnian Croat control use the Croatian kuna, while
areas under Muslim control use the Bosnian dinar.
	   The German mark was the only currency accepted across the
country.
	   International officials and quarreling local politicians finally
decided the new currency would be the Bosnian mark. Economic
experts have no doubt the new currency will be accepted everywhere.
	   ``This is a strong currency,'' Nicholl said.
	   Several local banks opened accounts for clients in the new
currency and the first transaction between two companies was made
Monday morning, said Enver Backovic, the Central Bank vice
governor.
	   Even after distribution of the new currency officially ends July
7, businesses can accept Yugoslav dinar, Bosnian dinar or Croatian
kuna _ but taxes and duties must be paid in Bosnian marks.
	   So far, the Bosnian Central Bank has 130 million (dlrs 73
million) German marks as back-up for the new currency.
	   The money was printed in France, which donated 7 million marks
(dlrs 3.9 million) for printing and transport.

Italian chamber prepares for a showdown on NATO expansion ratification 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: for AMs. UPDATES throughout with foreign minister pleading for
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Monday pleaded
with lawmakers to put aside their differences and vote in favor of
NATO's expansion eastward in Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.
	   The center-left government goes into the vote uncertain if it
can muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house.
	   Its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO expansion, and
internal politics have muddied the prospects of support from other
potential allies on the issue.
	   The Senate has already ratified the expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 countries in NATO as well as the three
membership candidates. The Chamber of Deputies is expected to vote
by midday Tuesday.
	   ``Who could take on the moral responsibility, even more
important that the political one, to reject these countries, to
throw them into a condition of permanent precariousness?'' Dini
asked.
	   NATO expansion, he argued, is a ``huge strategic choice'' for
Italy and deserves approval ``by a large consensus.''
	   ``At times in parliament we've had differing visions on the
country's foreign policy, different even among members of the
majority,'' he acknowledged.
	   But, he went on, ``this has not prevented us from conducting a
strong, credible and coherent foreign policy, anchored to what we
felt were Italy' priorities.''
	   The center-right opposition, as well as a small group of
centrists, have said they might could come to the aid of Premier
Romano; the center-right opposition may try to use it as a lever to
bring down his government.
	   ``No one would understand and it would be a true insult to our
national interests if Parliament voted against NATO's expansion
purely for motives of internal politics,'' said an editorial in the
daily La Repubblica Monday.

Mandela's office denounces British newspaper report on alleged Libya deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's office
accused a British newspaper Monday of trying to sabotage its new
democracy by reporting _ falsely, the government says _ that South
Africa had made an arms-for-oil deal with Libya.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported that South Africa had
concluded a secret 300-million pound (dlrs 495 million) deal to
supply Libya with weapons and spare parts in return for oil, and
that the deal was approved by Mandela himself.
	   ``What is utterly disgusting about this article is that it is a
pure fabrication invented by the newspaper and its unnamed
sources,'' Mandela's office said in a statement.
	   The newspaper had reported that the alleged deal raised fears
that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi may acquire details of South African
chemical and biological weapons built during apartheid.
	   Mandela's office said the newspaper's journalists had not sought
comment from South African government officials before publishing
the report.
	   ``We are therefore compelled to conclude that those who elected
to peddle these untruths are either part of a massive
disinformation campaign against our new democracy, or they have
allowed themselves to be used in such a campaign,'' the statement
said.
	   Mandela's office denied he or any agencies of the government
have entered into any discussions _ let alone concluded any deals _
with Libya on any arms-for-oil transactions.
	   The conservative Sunday Telegraph said the deal was negotiated
by South African secret service officials. The report, by the
newspaper's foreign editor Con Coughlin, gave no date for the deal.
	   Any such deal would violate United Nations sanctions, imposed to
pressure Libya into surrendering two Libyan suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan American jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which
270 people were killed. Sanctions bar flights to Libya and arms
sales to the north African nation.
	   Mandela's office said South Africa abides by U.N. decisions
regarding Libya.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Striking workers and university
students clashed with riot police on the fifth day of a telephone
strike Monday, injuring at least six people.
	   Police using batons clubbed strikers who tried to keep Puerto
Rico Telephone Company managers from reporting to work in Guaynabo,
a San Juan suburb. Three protesters were seriously injured,
including one bloodied picketer who was knocked unconscious.
	   Strikers also struggled with riot police outside a telephone
company office in the Hato Rey banking district, injuring at least
two demonstrators and one officer.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo blamed ``delinquent'' students who
support the strikers for the violence.
	   Some 6,400 unionized employees are striking to stop the
government from selling control of the telephone company to private
investors for dlrs 1.9 billion. GTE Corporation, the lead investor,
has promised there will be no immediate layoffs.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale last week. The House of
Representatives is expected to vote Wednesday.
	   More than 1,000 managers are working to keep service going, but
26,000 customers _ out of a total 1.3 million _ have lost service
because of vandalized phone lines.

Sudan digs trenches along border with Eritrea to stop rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has dug a 50-kilometer (31-mile)
trench along the Sudanese-Eritrean border to prevent attacks by the
Eritrea-based Sudanese rebels, an official was reported Monday as
saying.
	   Ibrahim Hamid, the governor of Sudan's eastern state of Kassala,
was quoted by the daily Alwan newspaper as saying that Sudanese
troops dug the trench ``to halt infiltrations from inside Eritrea
to Sudan's eastern regions.''
	   He also said troops have been mobilized in Kassala, but gave no
other details, Alwan reported.
	   Sudan does not have ties with either Eritrea or Ethiopia, and
accuses both countries of giving shelter to rebels trying to
overthrow the government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Sudanese rebels frequently cross the Eritrean border to attack
government garrisons in Kassala and the latest such skirmish
occurred Thursday when the Sudanese army said it repulsed a group
of Eritrean troops.
	   But the Eritrea-based National Democratic Alliance said the
attack was carried out by its guerrillas and no Eritreans were
involved. The conflicting reports have not been reconciled.
	   The NDA is an umbrella group of Sudanese opposition parties,
including the Umma party active in eastern Sudan. Another alliance
member, the Sudan People's Liberation Army guerrilla group, is
fighting in the south.
	   The SPLA, which draws its support from the south's mainly
Christian and animist population, seeks autonomy from the Islamic
north. The Umma party wants to overthrow the Islamic government of
el-Bashir and replace it with a secular rule.

President Weizman complains he was misled by Netanyahu 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Weizman quotes
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ President Ezer Weizman abruptly withdrew from a
major economic conference after complaining that he had been misled
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the timing of a West
Bank troop withdrawal, Israeli media said Monday.
	   In a meeting at the start of June, Netanyahu told Weizman that
an agreement on a pullback would be signed by mid-June, the Haaretz
newspaper said. However, an agreement remains out of reach today.
	   Netanyahu's sincerity has repeatedly been questioned in the
past, with political allies complaining that he made promises he
had no intention of keeping.
	   ``I believe that the peace process is limping, and therefore so
is the economy,'' Weizman said on Israel Radio.
	   ``One of the things that disappoints me the most is that they
took the joy out of the peace. Today, there is no joy on this
issue.''
	   Weizman and Netanyahu have clashed in the past over the pace of
negotiations with the Palestinians. As president, Weizman has a
largely ceremonial role, but carries great moral weight.
	   The former defense minister played a key role in negotiating the
1979 peace agreement with Egypt and has urged Netanyahu to carry
out the peace accords his predecessors signed with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu has complained that Weizman is overstepping
the authority of his office.
	   On Sunday evening, Weizman was to have opened the annual
economic conference of the Israel Democratic Institute, but decided
at the last minute to stay home.
	   Weizman did not want to deliver the speech because he felt he
would have been compelled to criticize the government over the
deadlock in the peace talks, the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Israel, however, has yet to accept
the proposal and Netanyahu has ignored informal deadlines set by
Albright.
	   Just last year, the outspoken president told Albright she should
take Arafat and Netanyahu and ``crack their heads together'' to get
the peace process moving again.

Suspected hooligan confused by French expulsion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England fan Terence Coughlin says he
was arrested, handcuffed, starved for 16 hours and then expelled
from France _ all because he was arrested in 1981 for soccer
violence.
	   Coughlin, of Birmingham, was one of four Englishmen deported
from France Monday under new World Cup security laws aimed at
stamping out soccer hooliganism.
	   ``I was doing absolutely nothing wrong so obviously it was an
extremely confusing situation. I had not gone there to do any
trouble. I just wanted to enjoy the atmosphere,'' he said from his
Birmingham home Monday.
	   The 36-year-old Aston Villa season ticket holder said he and two
friends were arrested an hour after arriving in Toulouse on Sunday.
	   He was arrested by French authorities after being ``spotted'' by
English police and identified as a Class C hooligan, or known
trouble-maker.
	   ``I do not go to football for violence. I am not a football
thug,'' Coughlin said.
	   ``This was going to be the best holiday I'd had for a long time
and now it's been ruined by some silly law.''
	   Coughlin said he had not been involved in any trouble since 1981
when he was arrested during an Aston Villa versus Manchester United
match at Villa Park.
	   But he admitted he did have a series of convictions unrelated
specifically to football.
	   ``I'm absolutely gutted at what has happened to me,'' he said.
	   ``We were handcuffed and kept in a police cell for 16 hours
without even being given any food,'' he said.
	   ``We then had to come back on a plane in plastic handcuffs and
we had done absolutely nothing wrong.''
	   Coughlin had travelled to France with five other friends,
including two other Birmingham men who were also deported.
	   The six had hired a van and planned to watch England's game
against Romania and the team's remaining group qualifying match
with Colombia.
	   ``We got there (Toulouse) at about 2pm and checked into our
hotel,'' he said.
	   ``We were going down the street and I suggested we go to a bar
that was quiet as we had only just got there.
	   ``I had two bottles of Heineken and then this policeman came up
to me, arrested me and put me in handcuffs.''
	   Coughlin, who did not have a ticket for Monday's match but
planned to buy one after the game started from a tout, said he now
feared he would be ostracised by Aston Villa football club.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The number of people who are disappearing
in Rwanda has reached such high levels, their families no longer
bother to report them missing to authorities, a human rights
organization said Tuesday.
	   ``Large-scale disappearances have occurred as soldiers of the
Rwandan Patriotic Army have carried out mass arrests in the
northwest,'' Amnesty International said in a statement.
	   It urged the Rwandan government to ``recognize the true nature
of the current human rights situation'' and to publicly ``denounce
the grave abuses committed not only the armed opposition groups but
also the security forces.''
	   Amnesty cited three cases of people who were apparently taken
away by authorities and whose whereabouts is unknown and also said
another 46 people are believed to have been killed by Hutu rebels.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain a comment from Rwandan
authorities.
	   Amnesty said people have ``disappeared'' after identity checks
in the capital, Kigali.
	   ``These people may be detained in military camps, but it is
impossible to verify their whereabouts because access to these
camps is strictly denied,'' Amnesty said.
	   It said ``not all disappearances'' can be attributed to the
government, but it has ``a responsibility to investigate. Yet
investigations appear to be the exception rather than the rule.''
	   Since December, thousands of unarmed civilians have been killed
as violence has spread from Gisenyi on Rwanda's western border with
the Democratic Republic of Congo to Gitarama in central Rwanda,
Amnesty said.
	   Some parts of Gisenyi prefecture are havens for Hutu rebels who
have been attacking army units and killing civilians, mostly Tutsis
but also Hutus they consider sympathetic to the Tutsi-led
government.
	   Amnesty said international media reports have been influenced by
the government, resulting in widespread reporting of rebel killings
and little information about killings carried out by govermnment
soldiers.
	   Despite international condemnation of the proliferation of arms
in the tiny central African nation, both the Rwandan army and the
rebels continue to receive weapons from outside the country,
Amnesty said.
	   It said firms in Israel, Eastern Europe and China were
responsible for most of the arms sales to Rwanda.
	   The same companies sold arms to the Hutu extremist government
that organized the 1994 genocide in which at least 500,000 people,
mostly Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus, were slain.
	   Amnesty criticized the government for suspending the U.N. human
rights operations in May and urged that the agency be allowed to
continue with its work, ``including monitoring and reporting on
current human rights abuses.''

World Cup: FIFA head urges EU to bar soccer thugs from crossing borders from tournament AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Adds penultimate graf to UPDATE with German offer to withdraw
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of world soccer called on the European
Union Monday to do more to prevent known soccer thugs from easily
crossing borders to foment violence in other countries.
	   Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, also stressed that street
violence by followers of some teams would not affect the staging of
the rest of the World Cup.
	   Blatter spoke with reporters a day after a French policeman was
left in a coma with injuries sustained as he tried to break up a
street fight involving German supporters in a north French city of
Lens. He was hit on the head with an iron bar by a German now in
police custody.
	   That followed by one week several nights of rampages by English
fans in the old port section of Marseille. Toulouse, where England
play Romania Monday, also was braced for trouble.
	   So concerned was FIFA over the violence that it called an
emergency meeting of the ruling Bureau on Monday in Paris and
issued a five-step plan to try to quell the violence and take
long-range steps to make sure it does not recur.
	   At the heart of the plan was FIFA's pledge to ``take the
initiative of seeking greater cooperation with political
authorities, including those of the European Union, in the
continuing effort to protect the reputation of football and for the
introduction of new legal measures to achieve this.''
	   Blatter said that FIFA had not had direct contact with the EU
over the hooligan issue prior to this year's World Cup. But he
stressed that such contact would be made not only for future
tournaments, but for soccer in general.
	   Blatter also said that there had been some discussion about
expelling teams whose fans misbehaved, including an informal
proposal from a member of FIFA's board. He refused to identify the
member, but said the matter was immediately dropped.
	   ``I said no. You can't have this,'' Blatter said. ``We are not
afraid, we are concerned. We have observed it and we are
stronger.''
	   ``This World Cup can't be disturbed again. We must stay here and
play the games,'' he said.
	   A statement released by the world body thanked the French
authorities for the steps taken to protect the competition from
violence, and expressed ``every confidence'' in their ability to
maintain security in the stadiums.
	   It condemned the perpetrators of the ``barbaric violence'' in
Lens and said the ``thoughts of FIFA and all genuine football fans
are with the victim of the violence and his family.''
	   In a related development, the German soccer federation said it
had warned German authorities before the match in Lens between
Yugoslavia and Germany that people ``with a history of violence
connected to sports were coming without tickets'' urging measures
to stop them.
	   ``These hooligans are enemies of society with the intention to
harm the image of the sport and of Germany. They are criminals that
should not be mentioned in the same breath as millions of fans, who
love football and go to the stadiums for the love of the game,''
said the statement by Egidius Braun, the federation president.
	   Braun, in informal discussions with senior FIFA leadership,
mentioned the possibility of Germany withdrawing from the Cup
because of the fan violence. The plan was described as among
several ``possible options'' Braun suggested and was flatly
rejected by FIFA.
	   Braun's statement also offered assistance to the family of the
French gendarme injured in Sunday's melee.

Sudan digs trenches along border with Eritrea to stop rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has dug a 50-kilometer (31-mile)
trench along the Sudanese-Eritrean border to prevent attacks by the
Eritrea-based Sudanese rebels, an official was reported Monday as
saying.
	   Ibrahim Hamid, the governor of Sudan's eastern state of Kassala,
was quoted by the daily Alwan newspaper as saying that Sudanese
troops dug the trench ``to halt infiltrations from inside Eritrea
to Sudan's eastern regions.''
	   He also said troops have been mobilized in Kassala, but gave no
other details, Alwan reported.
	   Sudan does not have ties with either Eritrea or Ethiopia, and
accuses both countries of giving shelter to rebels trying to
overthrow the government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Sudanese rebels frequently cross the Eritrean border to attack
government garrisons in Kassala. The latest such skirmish occurred
Thursday when the Sudanese army said it repulsed a group of
Eritrean troops.
	   The Eritrea-based National Democratic Alliance said the attack
was carried out by its guerrillas and denies Eritrean troops were
involved.
	   The NDA is an umbrella group of Sudanese opposition parties,
including the Umma party active in eastern Sudan. Another alliance
member, the Sudan People's Liberation Army guerrilla group, is
fighting in the south.
	   The SPLA, which draws its support from the south's mainly
Christian and animist population, seeks autonomy from the Islamic
north. The Umma party wants to overthrow the Islamic government of
el-Bashir and replace it with secular rule.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Private security guards stood on the roof and
at the entrance of a home in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood of
Silwan on Monday, a day after Jewish settlers moved into the
building.
	   The Elad settlement group has bought or taken control of 23
homes in Silwan, just outside the walled Old City, in the past six

Norway won't cut oil production, government says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will not cut its oil production in
order to boost sagging prices, Norwegian Oil and Energy Minister
Marit Arnstad said Monday.
	   ``Norway has no plans at present to reduce production, although
we will not rule it out in the future,'' Arnstad told visiting
Venezuelan Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta.
	   Arnstad said she was worried about the oil market, including a
sharp fall in the price of crude which was down to a 12-year low.
However, she did not say how low prices would have to fall before
Norway reconsiders lowering its production.
	   Arrieta compared the current situation to the oil price crisis
of 1986. ``But today we have much more experience and are in a much
better position to contend with these challenges,'' he said.
	   Arrieta is scheduled meet other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday in Vienna, who are
expected to decide on oil production cuts.
	   In May, Norway implemented a voluntary reduction of 100,000
barrels a day in an effort to boost prices.
	   Norway, which is not an OPEC member, is the world's second
largest oil exporter.

Lebanon blames Israel for explosion near U.S. Embassy 
</HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon blamed Israel on Monday for
explosions near the U.S. Embassy compound, saying they were a
``political message'' aimed at undermining national security _ but
offered no proof.
	   Three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a detonator exploded
less than a kilometer (a half-mile) from the fortified compound in
the Christian suburb of Aukar north of Beirut. No one was hurt.
	   The motive behind the blasts was not clear, but was a setback
for the Lebanese government, which prides itself on restoring law
and order since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   ``The bombs are a political message which could not have come
except from Israel,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel, routinely blamed by
Lebanon has for seeking to destabilize the country.
	   The blasts came three days after an explosion killed two people
in a Christian neighborhood of Beirut. The motive behind Thursday's
bombing in Dora also was not known.
	   ``It is as if Israel wants to tell us that security and
stability are impossible as long as we do not submit to its
conditions regarding the implementation of (U.N.) Resolution 425,''
Bweiz said.
	   The 1978 resolution calls on Israel to withdraw its troops from
a border enclave in southern Lebanon without conditions. Israel
demands security guarantees by the Lebanese government before it
agrees to withdraw its 1,500 soldiers.
	   Lebanon has rejected Israel's demands and insists on an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal.
	   Bweiz, while offering no evidence for his assertions, said
initial investigations showed the blasts were part of a political
campaign rather than sabotage meant to cause damage or casualties.
	   Interior Minister Michel Murr also pointed the finger at Israel.
	   ``We do not have any suspicions except in the direction of
Israel,'' he said after meeting with President Elias Hrawi.
	   Bweiz said he did not believe that Sunday's bombing near the
U.S. Embassy would prompt Washington to renew restrictions on U.S.
travel to Lebanon.
	   The travel ban was imposed a decade ago at the height of attacks
against Westerners in Lebanon by Muslim extremists. The State
Department replaced it last year with an advisory.

US, Latin American countries press EU for action on bananas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers kept up the pressure on European Union countries Monday
to give further ground in a row over EU proposals to reform its
banana import policy.
	   Representatives of the countries told a trade meeting in Geneva
that the measures proposed by the union's executive commission fail
to resolve longstanding concerns and don't comply with World Trade
Organization rules. The United States said it would continue the
fight to get the proposals changed.
	   ``WTO members must do more than simply announce their support
for WTO obligations, they must abide by them,'' said a statement to
the meeting from the United States, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama and Mexico.
	   The United States and the Latin American countries complained to
the WTO last year that the EU was unfairly favoring banana imports
from colonies and ex-colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import
licenses.
	   They said the EU regime was costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   A WTO dispute settlement panel subsequently ruled in favor of
the United States and the Latin Americans and told the union to
reform the system. The EU accepted the panel's findings.
	   The EU's executive commission has proposed ending the EU's
banana import license scheme and has also mooted a new, fairer
system of quotas.
	   But on Monday, the United States and the Latin Americans
expressed concern that the European Union had wrongly interpreted
the WTO dispute settlement panel's report.
	   The case would serve as a test of the European Union's
``willingness to respect the multilateral trading system'' and
failure to produce a satisfactory response would be challenged,
they said.
	   ``The United States will not hesitate to use its full rights
under the WTO and take all available action,'' said permanent U.S.
trade representative to the WTO, Rita Hayes.
	   On Monday, EU farm ministers started a meeting in Luxembourg at
which they are expected to push for an agreement on the issue. They
must reform the system by January 1 next year.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cleanup and repair bill from a powerful
weekend storm will be about 100 million rubles (dlrs 15 million),
city officials said Monday. The death toll rose to nine, with more
than 280 injured.
	   The city deployed thousands of workers to clean up the mess from
the storm, which struck shortly before midnight Saturday. Boris
Nikolsky, a top deputy to Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, told the Interfax
news agency that most of the work should be done within three days.
	   The thunderstorm, bearing near-hurricane force winds, raged for
about 30 minutes, uprooting tens of thousands of trees, smashing
windows and flattening small shops. The Bolshoi Theater, Kremlin
walls and Moskva Hotel near Red Square were all damaged.
	   Interfax quoted the Moscow Ambulance Center as saying that nine
people had been killed and 122 hospitalized as a result of the
storm.
	   Another 160 people were treated and released, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   Interior Ministry troops and regular soldiers were clearing the
debris on Monday, chopping up the trees with axes and and sweeping
glass, fallen branches and wayward construction materials into
piles.
	   More than 8,500 people were involved in the cleanup operation
Sunday, city officials said.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said 67,650 trees were destroyed, and
that the number may rise when parks are examined. The storm knocked
down power lines in more than 700 places and electric trolley and
tram lines in more than 500 places. Roofs were torn off 1,400
homes.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to the
Moscow weather center.

By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities blamed squads of German
``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks outside a World Cup
stadium that left a policeman in a coma and on a respirator after
being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia when highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France, authorities said.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking Nivel. His name wasn't released.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault on the policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans taken into custody during clashes with police before
and after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released Monday, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the German hooligans were
``for the most part sober _ not like the ones in Marseille,''
referring to English soccer fans who rampaged in the southern
French city last Monday after a match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.

Latvia approves change in citizenship law that outraged Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Latvian parliament on Monday approved
manking a key change to the controversial citizenship law that had
sparked denunciations and threats of trade sanctions from Russia.
	   By a 54-14 vote, the Saeima approved an amendment saying that
all children born in the country since it became independent in
1991 will be granted automatic citizenship, regardless of whether
their parents are citizens.
	   When Latvia became independent as the Soviet Union collapsed, it
granted citizenship only to those who lived there before Latvia was
forcibly annexed in 1940 and to their descendants.
	   That left some 700,000 people _ about a third of the country _
as stateless people. Most of them were ethnic Russians who were
moved there under Josef Stalin's Russification drive, and their
descendants.
	   The citizenship law allowed the stateless people to apply for
naturalization, but only under a complicated schedule by which
younger people could apply first and the people who had lived in
Latvia the longest would have to wait the longest.
	   The policy was an irritant in relations between Latvia and its
giant neighbor. Moves to change the law accelerated this spring
after the Kremlin said it was preparing possible trade sanctions
and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov accused Latvia of ``genocide.''
	   The Saeima on Monday evening was continuing to discuss whether
to get rid of the application schedule.
	   Even if that change were to pass, it is unclear whether the
amendements will be enough to mollify Russia. The parliament was
not considering changing the requirement that naturalization
applicants learn Latvian.
	   That requirement is controversial because the language is
unrelated to Russian and because many ethnic Russians in Latvia
lived in communities where Latvian was not spoken.

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities blamed squads of German
``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks outside a World Cup
stadium that left a policeman in a coma and on a respirator after
being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia when highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France, authorities said.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking Nivel. His name wasn't released.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault on the policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans taken into custody during clashes with police before
and after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released Monday, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the German hooligans were
``for the most part sober _ not like the ones in Marseille,''
referring to English soccer fans who rampaged in the southern
French city last Monday after a match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova, a semifinalist last
year at Wimbledon, withdrew Monday from the tournament with
strained and torn ligaments in her right thumb.
	   The 17-year-old Russian injured the thumb last Thursday at
Eastbourne when she fell in the third set of a grass-court victory
over seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf.
	   The withdrawal on Wimbledon's opening day was a blow to the
tournament, which has lost one of its most marketable and
high-profile players.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better,''
Kournikova said. ``But this morning when I woke up it was very
difficult for me to move the finger.''
	   ``This is my favorite tournament. I feel like I could do well on
grass. I was getting ready for it the whole year, I was thinking
about coming back here again and going on Centre Court. But
hopefully I have many more Wimbledons to come.''
	   Kournikova said she would be unable to play for at least three
weeks and hadn't decided how she would spend the next two while
Wimbledon is being played.
	   ``It's not like very torn _ strained and minor torn,'' she said
describing the injury.
	   ``I haven't decided, I don't know if I'm going to stay or go
because the plans are a little bit changed,''she added.
	   Kournikova, a photogenic young woman whose pictures were splased
across British newspapers during last year's tournament and on the
eve of this one, is among a half-dozen rising teen-age stars on the
women's circiut.
	   She was reported to have visited a specialist over the weekend
at Wimbledon and on Sunday the WTA Tour said she would play.
	   ``It is obviously very disappointing for the player herself and
the championships, as well as many people who were looking forward
to seeing her play,'' said chief executive Chris Gorringe.
	   She was seeded No. 12 and replaced in the tournament bracket by
luck loser Lilia Osterloh of the United States.

	   MONACO (AP) _ Sports-mad Prince Albert of Monaco took a trip
into the mountains above Monte-Carlo on Monday to watch the Dutch
World Cup squad in training.
	   Albert, an International Olympic Committee member and Winter
Olympics bobsledder, stood for a half-hour chatting with Dutch
coach Guus Hiddink and former international Frank Rijkaard _ who
lives most of the year in this playground of the rich on the Cote
d'Azur.
	   Albert was introduced to all the players before looking on
admiringly as they juggled the ball in games of soccer-volleyball.
	   ``He didn't say much to us, just `hello.' There were a lot of
people for him to meet,'' striker Dennis Bergkamp said.
	   Albert did not speak to the press before leaving the ground, but
told a local television crew, ``It is great to have the Dutch
here.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Saudis cleaned house when they fired coach
Carlos Alberto Parreira.
	   Eight members of the World Cup delegation were sent home when
Parreira was dismissed following South Arabia's losses to Denmark
and France. The defeats guaranteed the Saudis won't repeat their
second-round performance of 1994.
	   The Saudi federation, headed by Prince Faisal bin Fahd _ son of
King Fahd _ was upset about the poor showing and replaced not only
Parreira but also delegation head Fahad Nasser al-Dahmash,
technical manager Ahmed Eid al-Harbi, two assistant coaches, a
manager, a guide, a physiotherapist and an official charged with
logistics.
	   One of Parreira's assistants, Mohammed al-Khuraishi, will take
charge of the Saudis' final first-round match Wednesday against
South Africa.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Are bangles and beads becoming the ultimate soccer
accessory?
	   With more and more soccer players wearing flashy jewelry on the
pitch, FIFA has ruled that the practice is fine as long as it
doesn't hurt anybody.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper pointed out that players can wear
whatever jewelry they want, within reason.
	   Under the world soccer body's rules, players cannot wear
anything that referees might consider dangerous to themselves and
others.
	   ``Although they might come on the field with bangles and beads,
most of it is already stripped off them in the referee's
preliminary check,'' Cooper said.
	   Things referees mostly look out for are elaborate rings that
could hurt an opponent in a collision.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONACO (AP) _ Dutch midfielder Wim Jonk was in mourning Tuesday
after learning that his best friend had been killed in a car crash
in the Netherlands.
	   Coach Guus Hiddink broke the news to the 31-year-old player, who
then left the players' training camp to join his wife at a nearby
hotel.
	   It was not immediately clear whether Jonk planned to fly home.
He was to meet Hiddink again Tuesday to discuss the situation.
	   Jonk's friend, whose name was not released, was killed in a
collision near Amsterdam early Monday.
	   PSV Eindhoven's Jonk is one of the Dutch team's most experienced
internationals and played an influential role in Saturday's 5-0
victory over South Korea.
	   The Netherlands' final Group E fixture is Thursday against
Mexico in Saint-Etienne.

US, Latin American countries press EU for action on bananas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers kept up the pressure on European Union countries Monday
to give further ground in a row over EU proposals to reform its
banana import policy.
	   Representatives of the countries told a trade meeting in Geneva
that the measures proposed by the union's executive commission fail
to resolve concerns and don't comply with World Trade Organization
rules. The United States said it would continue the fight to get
the proposals changed.
	   ``WTO members must do more than simply announce their support
for WTO obligations, they must abide by them,'' said a statement to
the meeting from the United States, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama and Mexico.
	   The United States and the Latin American countries complained to
the WTO last year that the EU was unfairly favoring banana imports
from colonies and ex-colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific via a complex system of tariffs, quotas and import
licenses.
	   They said the EU regime was costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   A WTO dispute settlement panel subsequently ruled in favor of
the United States and the Latin Americans and told the union to
reform the system. The EU accepted the panel's findings.
	   The EU's executive commission has proposed ending the EU's
banana import license scheme and has also mooted a new, fairer
system of quotas.
	   But on Monday, the United States and the Latin Americans
expressed concern that the European Union had wrongly interpreted
the WTO dispute settlement panel's report.
	   The case would serve as a test of the European Union's
``willingness to respect the multilateral trading system'' and
failure to produce a satisfactory response would be challenged,
they said.
	   ``The United States will not hesitate to use its full rights
under the WTO and take all available action,'' said permanent U.S.
trade representative to the WTO, Rita Hayes.
	   On Monday, EU farm ministers started a meeting in Luxembourg at
which they are expected to push for an agreement on the issue. They
must reform the system by January 1 next year.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ First, there was a champagne toast. Then
the ambassadors of the United States and five European countries
left Belarus on Monday in a diplomatic crisis over sewer repairs.
	   ``I propose a toast to our speedy return,'' French Ambassador
Bernard Fassier said, holding a glass aloft on the porch of the
embassy building shared by Britain and Italy.
	   With that, he and the other ambassadors drove to the airport and
boarded a plane to Frankfurt, Germany, after lodging a strongly
worded protest with the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.
	   The government has been trying for several weeks to evict the
ambassadors from their homes in a wooded suburb of Minsk that,
officials say, urgently needs repairs to its sewer and plumbing
system.
	   The ambassadors maintain that the ouster violates the
international rules of diplomacy. Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko says they're creating a tempest in a sewer.
	   ``An ordinary housing problem is being brought onto a state
level,'' he complained to reporters, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry called the ambassadors'
departure ``unjustified'' and said Belarus ``remains loyal to the
principles of international law.''
	   Besides diplomats from the United States, Britain and France,
the ambassadors of Greece, Italy and Germany left Minsk on Monday.
In a show of solidarity, the departing ambassadors were accompanied
to the airport by their counterparts from Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland
and Lithuania.
	   Both the Polish and Bulgarian ambassadors have been summoned
home, and others are expected to go as well. It is not clear how
many of the 22 ambassadors who live at the disputed Drozdy
diplomatic compound remain.
	   Led by the authoritarian Lukashenko, Belarus is perhaps the most
Soviet of all post-Soviet countries, with a penchant for stirring
trouble with the West.
	   But nothing Lukashenko has done before has created quite such a
stir in diplomatic circles as his decision to order the ambassadors
out of their homes.
	   ``He's driving his country further into isolation and is hurting
human rights and contract law,'' German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in a television interview Monday.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies and had
ditches dug inside the compound's gates, which prevented cars from
entering.
	   Before leaving Monday, British Ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce
told the Foreign Ministry that Belarus' ambassadors to EU countries
should return to Minsk ``to convey in the strongest terms the
disapproval of EU governments.''
	   Germany has already asked the Belarusian ambassador to go home.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it sent Kremlin
emissary Boris Berezovsky to Minsk to meet with Lukashenko on
Monday.
	   After the meeting, Lukashenko said he was ready to start a
dialogue with the governments that had recalled their ambassadors,
adding that he thought it was possible to reach a compromise.
	   The government has already offered the ambassadors new
apartments in downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko is not known as a master of diplomatic nuance. After
telling the ambassadors at one point that they could stay, he had
signs posted outside their homes proclaiming them to be the
property of the Belarusian president.
	   Fassier, the French ambassador, had his revenge on Monday. He
posted a sign on the door to his home containing the text, in
Russian and French, of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
protocol.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States, Louise Woodward said she was made a
scapegoat for the death of a baby in her care because authorities
had to find someone to blame.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview scheduled for broadcast Monday night.
Excerpts were broadcast earlier on BBC television news.
	   The baby's family was not immediately available for comment.
	   But the attorney representing the Eappens in a civil suit
against Ms. Woodward said the young woman ``already told her story
and was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, a judge
and seven justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
	   ``It is obvious she is now more interested in her celebrity
status than the truth,'' said attorney Fredric Ellis.
	   Prosecutors claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to Britain
on Thursday convicted of manslaughter, shook 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen to death in February 1997. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   A spokesman for Middlesex County District Attorney Thomas
Reilly, who prosecuted Ms. Woodward, declined to comment today on
the BBC interview
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me. But like I say, you know, I didn't do
anything wrong,'' Ms. Woodward said in the interview, according to
excerpts broadcast by the BBC.
	   Ms. Woodward was allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentence her to the 279 days she had already spent
in prison.
	   The 20-year-old Ms. Woodward said she was fortunate her sentence
was not longer.
	   But she added: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an innocent
person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing, worry and
pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up in a prison
in a strange country _ and please remember that I was 18 when I
went into prison _ and being scared, for something that you didn't
even do.''
	   A photograph released by the BBC of Ms. Woodward being
interviewed by reporter Martin Bashir drew criticism today from The
Sun and The Mirror newspapers, which saw echoes of Bashir's famous
interview with Princess Diana in 1995. During the interview, Diana
talked of the breakdown of her marriage.
	   ``Woodward seems to model herself on the princess by dressing
and sitting like her,'' The Mirror said. ``She has perfected the
coy, wide-eyed look Diana used to such effect.''
	   ``I can't imagine what this interview is for unless it is to
convey `I'm as innocent as Diana was' or `I'm as great a lover of
children as Diana was,''' The Mirror quoted royal expert Margaret
Holder as saying.
	   The BBC countered that any resemblance to the interview with
Princess Diana was ``pure coincidence,'' The Mirror said.
	   Ms. Woodward said during a news conference Thursday that she
received no payment for the BBC interview and that she would not
sell her story. But the tabloid Daily Mail confirmed it paid 40,000
pounds (dlrs 66,000) to her parents in November. The newspaper
began publishing a series on Saturday which it said was based on
contacts with the former au pair and her parents over several
months.

Norway won't cut oil production, government says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway will not cut its oil production in
order to boost sagging prices, Norwegian Oil and Energy Minister
Marit Arnstad said Monday.
	   ``Norway has no plans at present to reduce production, although
we will not rule it out in the future,'' Arnstad told visiting
Venezuelan Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta.
	   Arnstad said she was worried about the oil market, including a
sharp fall in the price of crude which was down to a 12-year low.
However, she did not say how low prices would have to fall before
Norway reconsiders lowering its production.
	   Arrieta compared the current situation to the oil price crisis
of 1986. ``But today we have much more experience and are in a much
better position to contend with these challenges,'' he said.
	   Arrieta is scheduled meet other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday in Vienna, who are
expected to decide on oil production cuts.
	   In May, Norway implemented a voluntary reduction of 100,000
barrels a day in an effort to boost prices.
	   Norway, which is not an OPEC member, is the world's second
largest oil exporter.

Eds: UPDATES first item from Zimbabwe with further comment
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government said Monday it will not
allow black peasants to settle illegally on private white-owned
land they have invaded.
	   Local Government Minister John Nkomo said most of hundreds of
peasants who
	   have camped on four farms east of Harare agreed to return to
their nearby tribal homes.
	   ``There will be resistance...but if we allow this behavior
countrywide it would be like a veld (bush) fire,'' he told
reporters.
	   He said the resettlement of black peasants on nationalized white
farms was
	   being speeded up and ``our policy will not be compromised.''
	   The government on Monday ordered regional officials to select
183 families to be resettled on 12 farms around the country that
have been carved up into plots, he said.
	   Earlier, eastern province governor David Karimanzira said a
total of 104 farms were targeted for an urgent but ``orderly'' hand
over to peasants by the state.
	   Karimanzira and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai met with
peasant leaders Sunday near the provincial capital of Marondera, 80
kilometers (50 miles) east of Harare.
	   Peasants accused the government of delaying land reforms and
bringing villagers from other regions to settle on farms already
seized by the state in their province.
	   Farmers' leaders estimated about 300 peasants were camped on
private land by Sunday. No violence was reported.

Kournikova withdraws, Sampras, Agassi win in straight sets AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts, updates throughout with Sampras, Agassi, Kournikova
quotes; Graf, Seles victory, Pierce defeat
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost one of its biggest
names on the opening day of the tournament Monday when 17-year-old
Russian star Anna Kournikova withdrew with a thumb injury.
	   While Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles
were among first-round winners, Kournikova announced she would be
unable to play due to torn and strained ligaments in her right
thumb.
	   Kournikova, a 1997 Wimbledon semifinalist and No. 12 seed this
year, suffered the injury last Thursday during one of the biggest
victories of her career _ a three-set win over Graf at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, whose glamorous looks and skimpy outfits have made
her the focus of tabloid coverage in Britain, withdrew from the
rest of the Eastbourne event in what was orginally described as a
``precautionary'' move. But further checks revealed the injury was
more serious than thought.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better but
this morning when I woke up it was very difficult for me to move
the finger,'' Kournikova said.
	   The Russian, who was replaced in the draw by American ``lucky
loser'' Lilia Osterloh, said she would be unable to play or
practice for at least three weeks.
	   ``I'm very sad about it,'' she said. ``This is my favorite
tournament. I feel like I could do well on grass. I was getting
ready for it the whole year.''
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
112th championships started in sunny weather and temperatures of 21
celsius (70 f). But by mid-afternoon, dark clouds moved in and
there was a chance of showers.
	   Sampras opened play on Centre Court with a dominant 6-3, 6-3,
6-2 victory over Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty, a performance that
belied the poor results that have cast doubt on Sampras' chances of
defending his title.
	   ``If you can't get up for an event like this, you shouldn't be
playing,'' said the top-seeded American, seeking his fifth
championship in six years. ``This place over the years has brought
out the best in me. You get more keyed up, more fired up, going out
there at 2 o'clock on Monday. Over the years, it's been treating me
pretty well.''
	   Sampras served an ace on the first point, closed out the first
set with another ace and was never troubled during the 1 hour,
19-minute match. He finished with 17 aces and eight double faults.
	   The most entertaining moment of the one-sided match came after
Sampras nailed Hrbaty in the thigh with a service winner in the
fourth game of the second set. Waiting to return on the next point,
Hrbaty held up his racket in front of his body as mock protection,
drawing laughter from Sampras and the spectators.
	   Within seconds of Sampras winning his match, 1992 champion
Agassi completed a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory on Court 1 over Spain's
Alex Calatrava.
	   Wearing a long-sleeved white shirt, Agassi was in full control
from the baseline. Calatrava, who received treatment on his left
knee in the second set, ended the match with a double fault.
	   It was a convincing performance by the 13th-seeded Agassi, who
has zoomed back up the rankings since dropping to No. 141 last
November and has been troubled recently by a shoulder injury.
	   Referring to his recent troubles, Agassi said, ``Even though I
was out playing I wasn't there 100 percent. I had my energy
elsewhere in a lot of cases. I need to take it up another level in
this tournament. I'm ready to do that.''
	   On the women's side, fourth-seeded Graf followed Sampras on
Centre Court and beat Spain's Gala Leon Garcia 6-4, 6-1, while No.
6 Seles was a 6-3, 6-4 winner over Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo.
	   The German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's her first in
two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing major knee
surgery a year ago.
	   Seles, whose career was disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, is
coming off her inspiring run to the French Open final earlier this
month, just three weeks after the death of her father Karolj.
	   The highest women's seed in action Monday, No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory in 50 minutes over
Argentina's Florencia Labat.
	   The first seeded player to lose was No. 11 Mary Pierce, who
suffered her latest Grand Slam flop in a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 defeat to
Elena Tatarkova of Ukraine.
	   In an early match, third-seeded Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, needed less than 90 minutes to defeat Spain's Javier
Sanchez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Looking at home on the grass, the Czech
left-hander served 16 aces and showed he could be among the top
challengers for Sampras' crown.
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has been relaid with new grass for the first
time in 40 years.
	   The American has lost his aura of invincibility since trouncing
Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He lost in
the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals of the
Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles to his credit, he needs just two more to equal Roy
Emerson's record of 12.

Lebanon blames Israel for explosion near U.S. Embassy 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with grenades found in 7th graf
By ZEINA KARAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon blamed Israel on Monday for
explosions near the U.S. Embassy compound, saying they were a
``political message'' aimed at undermining national security _ but
offered no proof.
	   Three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a detonator exploded
less than a kilometer (a half-mile) from the fortified compound in
the Christian suburb of Aukar north of Beirut. No one was hurt.
	   The motive behind the blasts was not clear, but was a setback
for the Lebanese government, which prides itself on restoring law
and order since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   ``The bombs are a political message which could not have come
except from Israel,'' Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel, routinely blamed by
Lebanon has for seeking to destabilize the country.
	   The blasts came three days after an explosion killed two people
in a Christian neighborhood of Beirut. The motive behind Thursday's
bombing in Dora also was not known.
	   On Monday, police found 22 grenades in a plastic bag placed at a
garbage dump on a busy street intersection in Dora.

Russia to cut oil handling rates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will lower oil handling rates at its
biggest terminals, Novorossiisk and Tuapse on the Black Sea, and
adopt a new rate system based on the fluctuations of world oil
prices, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
	   On July 1, the Novorossiisk rate will be cut to dlrs 2 a metric
ton from dlrs 2.30 a ton, while the rate at Tuapse will be reduced
to dlrs 2.60 a ton from dlrs 3 a ton, Interfax said, citing the
Federal Service Regulating Natural Monopolies.
	   Any dlrs 5 change in the world oil price will trigger a 10 cent
change in the Russian handling rates, said Andrei Lavrischev, a
senior official at the service.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's revenues from oil exports dropped by 24
percent to dlrs 3.75 billion for the first four months of 1998,
Interfax said Monday, citing the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
	   The volume of exports increased by 7.4 percent to 43.2 million
tons (272 million barrels) from 40 million tons (252 million
barrels), the ministry said.
	   The fall in oil revenues reflects the drop in world prices from
dlrs 20 a barrel late last year to dlrs 12.75 in June 1998, a trend
blamed on a combination of increased oil output around the world
and decreased demand because of the Asian financial crisis.
	   Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov also told the
ITAR-Tass news agency that Russia would not consider joining OPEC,
though he promised to negotiate with the body to work on raising

Mandela's office denounces British newspaper report on alleged Libya deal agency 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from head of gov't arms procurement
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's office
accused a
	   British newspaper Monday of trying to sabotage its new democracy
by reporting _ falsely, the government says _ that South Africa had
made an arms-for-oil deal with Libya.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported that South Africa had
concluded a secret 300-million pound (dlrs 495 million) deal to
supply Libya with weapons and spare parts in return for oil, and
that the deal was approved by Mandela
	   himself.
	   ``What is utterly disgusting about this article is that it is a
pure fabrication invented by the newspaper and its unnamed
sources,'' Mandela's office said in a statement.
	   The newspaper had reported that the alleged deal raised fears
that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi may acquire details of South African
chemical and biological weapons built during apartheid.
	   The head of the government arms procurement agency, Armscor,
also threw cold water on the newspaper report.
	   ``I don't think our country would be that silly to flout
international opinion,'' said Armscor chairman Ron Haywood.
	   Haywood said it was inconceiveable that Mandela would agree to
such a deal in defiance of United Nations sanctions against Libya.
	   ``I have chaired Armscor for more than two years and there has
never even been a whisper of us doing business with Libya,''
Haywood told reporters.

Burundi rebels, government question cease-fire 
</HEADLINE>
By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Burundi government officials and a major
rebel faction on Monday questioned a cease-fire that is an integral
part of a plan to settle the country's problems by peaceful means.
	   The plan was reached after a week of preliminary talks in this
northern Tanzanian town attended by Burundi's five main political
parties, three rebel groups and civic and religious organizations.
	   President Pierre Buyoya, a former army major who ousted a
civilian president in 1996, attended the talks for the first time.
	   The next phase is to begin July 20 in Arusha.
	   A Brussels-based spokesman for the National Council for the
Defense of Democracy (CNDD), the main rebel organization, called
the cease-fire agreement irrelevant.
	   ``The accord does not commit the CNDD-FDD,'' said Jerome Ndiho.
``If we are invited in the right way, we will go. Everything they
decided does not commit us.''
	   Ndiho claims that the person who signed Sunday's final
communique for the CNDD _ Leonard Nyangoma _ no longer heads the
organization and had been replaced by Col. Jean Bosco
Ndayikengurukiye.
	   However, the mediator of the talks, former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, continues to recognize Nyangoma as CNDD leader and
invited him to the talks, which had been stalled for 10 months.
	   In the Burundi capital Bujumbura, government spokesman Luc
Rukingama objected to the wording of the cease-fire accord, saying
the Burundian army is not a ``party'' and will continue defending
all citizens.
	   The communique stated that ``all parties to the conflict declare
a suspension of hostilities to take effect no later than July 20,
1998.''
	   It was not possible to determine whether CNDD fighters in
Burundi take orders from Nyangoma or Ndayikengurukiye.
	   Rukingama disagreed with Arusha as the site of the next talks.
He said it had been agreed with Nyerere that future talks would be
held elsewhere.
	   Burundi accuses Tanzania of harboring Hutu rebels and said the
security of its officials is not guaranteed in Arusha.
	   Rukingama also demanded the immediate lifting of regional
sanctions imposed on Burundi following Buyoya's July 1996 seizure
of power.
	   The communique did not mention the sanctions, and Rukingama did
not say whether failure to lift the sanctions would affect future
talks.
	   Two diplomats who attended last week's talks expressed optimism
about the Burundi peace process.
	   President Clinton's envoy to Burundi Howard Wolpe described the
communique as ``very positive and encouraging.''
	   Aldo Ajello, the European Union's special envoy to the region,
said it contained ``essential necessary ingredients for the
beginning of direct talks.''
	   Burundi's Tutsi army and Hutu rebels have been fighting for
almost five years, since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir
Ndadaye, a Hutu and the country's first democratically elected
president, in October 1993.
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died since
then.

German police say identified 614 soccer hooligans in France 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More than 600 violence-prone German
soccer hooligans were in France for the World Cup championships,
police said Monday, one day after clashes between German hooligans
and French police left an officer in a coma.
	   Police said they had identified 614 Germans at the World Cup who
were known to have previously started fights or rioted at soccer
games.
	   Police sources also said that as early as Saturday they had
given French authorities information about 180 known German
hooligans in Lens, France, where fighting broke out Sunday during
the 2-2 match between Yugoslavia and Germany.
	   French police used sticks to fight the German hooligans. The
hooligan who attacked an officer with an iron bar, leaving him
comatose, was from the northern city of Hanover. Police identified
him only as being 27 years old _ known to them but not for
violence.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were arrested. Six of the
Germans were deported and 15 were placed under formal investigation
_ one step short of being charged. Most were detained for
drunkenness, and were expected to be released later Monday.
	   German Interior Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Schumacher said
Monday in Bonn that France had not yet provided the names of those
arrested and therefore German officials did not know if any were
neo-Nazis.
	   The Hamburg constitutional protection office, which keeps tabs
on radical groups, said the neo-Nazi scene ``overlaps'' the soccer
hooligan scene in the Hamburg area.
	   The office declined to say if radical rightists were among those
in France. But it said it had notified authorities in Cologne that
German soccer rowdies were planning violence in France.
	   Government spokesman Otto Hauser said the Interior Ministry had
ordered tighter border controls for possible hooligans traveling to
France. He also said the investigation into Sunday's clash was in
the hands of the French.
	   According to German police observers in France for the World
Cup, overall the hooligans came from 30 different cities, including
60 from Hamburg, and 50 each from Hanover and Cologne.
	   Police observers said the hooligans traveled in small groups in
cars, small vans, campers, and a bus to avoid drawing the attention
of French police.
	   Previously, hooligans have coordinated their travel using mobile
phones and the Internet, a spokesman for North-Rhine Westphalia
state police said.
	   Sunday's violence, however, did not appear to be organized,
German police observers in France said.
	   The hooligans showed up in groups as large as 40. Only after a
ringleader from Hamburg threw a chair and began rioting in a bar
did about 250 Germans join in attacking French police and tried to
force their way to the stadium, police sources said.

World Cup: Colombia and Tunisia tied 0-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Both teams hit the bar and Tunisian
goalkeeper Chokri el-Oauer made an acrobatic one-handed save as
Colombia and Tunisia were tied 0-0 at halftime of their World Cup
Group G game Monday.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   But the Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from
El-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range header.
The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with a spectacular one-handed punch
over the bar.
	   Four minutes later the 'keeper raced off his line to block an
angled shot from Anthony De Avila with his foot after the Colombian
had broken clear of the Tunisian defense.
	   With Colombia showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia broke out
to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the unmarked Mehdi
Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header. Fortunately for
the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was alert and pushed
the header onto the post.
	   Adolfo Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter
shot just too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Riadh Bouazizi on the
back of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   Lineups:
	   Tunisia_Chokri el-Oauer; Tarek Thabet, Ferid Chouchane, Clayton,

Stewart faces first problems 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Soccer has monopolized English media coverage
since the World Cup started but England's distastrous 10-wicket
loss to South Africa in the second cricket test at Lord's is an
exception.
	   Major newspapers reported England's loss to South Africa as a
disgrace.
	   Stewart said after the match that he would rather congratulate
the South African players than ``have a go at ours'' but his view
was not shared in the media.
	   The critics savaged an English team which was bowled out for 110
in its first innings and lost six wickets for 11 runs as it meekly
delivered the match into South Africa's hands.
	   ``Spinelss England are Trounced'' was the Indpendent newspaper's
response, while the Sun referred to the team as the ``Dregs
Eleven''.
	   Alec Stewart faces his first crisis after just two tests as
captain.
	   Not only did his team lose, but batsman Mark Ramprakash was
fined 850 pounds (dlrs 1,411) and suspended for one match for
bodily and verbal dissent towards Australian umpire Darrell Hair on
Saturday.
	   The loss came despite Stewart's Sunday morning rally with
century-maker Nasser Hussain, which gave England some hope.
	   Their 116-run partnership put England in a better fightback
position at 222 for four in its second innings but hope was
short-lived.
	   The middle and lower order collapse meant England just scraped
past South Africa's first innings of 360, and it took the visitors
just minutes to seal a victory.
	   Stewart said he he did not think England played too many bad
shots.
	   ``We will be criticized for this display, and rightly so in many
ways, but I know that we can challenge South Africa.
	   ``Everyone's despondent now but two weeks ago we were smiling
because we had dominated the First Test at Edgbaston and but for
the last day rain might well have won it.''
	   South Africa takes a one-nil lead in the five test series and
England faces yet another team rebuilding.
	   Changes are inevitable for the third Test at Old Trafford. Fast
bowler Darren Gough and opening batsman Mark Butcher are both
expected to be recovered from injury.
	   Dean Headley and Steve James look likely to drop out to
accommodate them, while Mark Ealham's position is also under doubt.

Commons set to back anti-hooligan powers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British MPs were Monday set to back tough new
powers to stamp out soccer hooliganism in the wake of recent World
Cup violence.
	   Shadow home secretary Sir Norman Fowler urged ministers to vote
for stronger measures in the Crime and Disorder Bill, including
banning troublemakers travelling abroad for matches.
	   The House of Commons was set to consider the new powers Monday
night.
	   Fowler welcomed the Government's decision to increase the
maximum jail term from one to six months for fans who break bans on
attending overseas matches.
	   But he said stronger measures needed to be introduced to prevent
a repeat of the violence which erupted in Marseille on the eve of
England's first World Cup game against Tunisia.
	   ``The vast majority of the country felt shame at the behavior of
the so-called English supporters in Marseille,'' he said.
	   ``They were only a small number of the English people in
Marseille itself. In no way do they represent the genuine English
supporter.
	   ``Nevertheless, we saw the damage done, the violence that was
committed.
	   ``There was a genuine sense of outrage and anger in this country
to what these thugs had done and the damage done to the reputation
of this country.''
	   Fowler said no system of bans would work completely but tougher
powers were necessary because the present system was failing.
	   He said that while 20,000 people had been convicted of football
related offences over the last five years, only 71 were subject to
restriction orders preventing them travelling to overseas matches.
	   Fowler also called for a ``football behavior order'' to be
brought in to widen police powers in stopping suspected hooligans
from travelling to matches overseas.
	   This would allow police to go to court when they had
``reasonable cause to believe that an order was necessary to
prevent an individual'' creating trouble abroad.
	   Thugs convicted of criminal damage abroad should also be forced
to pay compensation for the damage done, Fowler said.

Latvia approves change in citizenship law that outraged Russia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS typo in `making' in lede.
<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Latvian parliament on Monday approved
making a key change to the controversial citizenship law that had
sparked denunciations and threats of trade sanctions from Russia.
	   By a 54-14 vote, the Saeima approved an amendment saying that
all children born in the country since it became independent in
1991 will be granted automatic citizenship, regardless of whether
their parents are citizens.
	   When Latvia became independent as the Soviet Union collapsed, it
granted citizenship only to those who lived there before Latvia was
forcibly annexed in 1940 and to their descendants.
	   That left some 700,000 people _ about a third of the country _
as stateless people. Most of them were ethnic Russians who were
moved there under Josef Stalin's Russification drive, and their
descendants.
	   The citizenship law allowed the stateless people to apply for
naturalization, but only under a complicated schedule by which
younger people could apply first and the people who had lived in
Latvia the longest would have to wait the longest.
	   The policy was an irritant in relations between Latvia and its
giant neighbor. Moves to change the law accelerated this spring
after the Kremlin said it was preparing possible trade sanctions
and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov accused Latvia of ``genocide.''
	   The Saeima on Monday evening was continuing to discuss whether
to get rid of the application schedule.
	   Even if that change were to pass, it is unclear whether the
amendements will be enough to mollify Russia. The parliament was
not considering changing the requirement that naturalization
applicants learn Latvian.
	   That requirement is controversial because the language is
unrelated to Russian and because many ethnic Russians in Latvia
lived in communities where Latvian was not spoken.

Kiriyenko: Russia needs IMF funds to stabilize ruble budget revenue short of target, edits thereafter to conform.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and fend off speculative attacks.
	   ``We're merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central
Bank,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``This will increase reliability and will make it possible to
rebuff any speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.''
	   Kiriyenko met with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the economic crisis, while IMF
negotiators were headed to Moscow. An expanded Cabinet meeting on
the strategy, chaired by Yeltsin, is scheduled Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the
IMF was making some unacceptable demands. The fund has been
pressing Russia to sharply curtail spending, boost tax collections
and reform its energy sector.
	   ``We will look at and consider the conditions, but it goes
without saying that far from all of the conditions are acceptable
to us,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The ruble fell slightly Monday, closing at 6.217, down from
6.2110, as traders waited for news from the Cabinet meeting and IMF
talks. The stock market also closed 1.3 percent lower.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that the government program to cope
with the crisis included many unpopular steps, including tightly
reining in government spending, but that the poorest Russians would
be protected.
	   Yeltsin was giving ``maximum support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said. ``There hasn't been a single case when we didn't receive such
support for the measures elaborated by the government.''
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials,
including Yeltsin, have sufficient political will to push through
an austerity program.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on the so-called gray economy.
	   He said that the poorest Russians ``pay their 12 percent in
income tax, but a very significant amount that could be paid by the
others never reaches the budget,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The country cannot exist unless taxes are collected, and it
cannot spend more than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Russia collected less than half the taxes it expected in the
first five months of 1998, said Venyamin Sokolov, auditor of the
parliament-affiliated Accounting Chamber.
	   Russia's budget revenues fell 31 percent short of target in the
same period, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kiriyenko denied that the crisis management program would affect
Russia's long-term plans for financial development, but said that
the world financial crisis could.
	   ``Russia today is fairly closely integrated into the world
financial system,'' Kiriyenko said, according to Interfax. ``The
external threat is very high and we must ensure adequate financial
actions.''
	   Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman, confirmed earlier
reports that Russia was seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in talks with the IMF.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer and a separate team of
negotiators are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday.

Trimble, Paisley battle for control of new Northern Ireland government 
</HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Thursday's election of a new
Northern Ireland government is pitting Protestant against
Protestant, with candidates committed to the peace agreement
battling hard-liners determined to break the backbone of the deal.
	   David Trimble, whose support for the agreement has badly divided
his Ulster Unionist Party, needs allegiance from a majority of
Protestant representatives for the new Belfast Assembly to work.
	   Trimble faces not only the familiar opposition of the Rev. Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionists, but also at least six potential
turncoats among his own candidates.
	   The Assembly is the linchpin of the peace agreement reached
April 10 by eight parties and the Irish and British governments and
overwhelmingly approved last month by Northern Ireland's voters.
	   On Monday, Paisley called the requirement of majority Protestant
support in the Assembly ``a weapon in our hands'' that he hopes to
wield to block joint decision-making with Catholic politicians.
	   Trimble and Paisley agree that Protestant ``unionists'' _ those
determined to maintain Northern Ireland's union with Britain _ are
likely to hold about 60 seats in the 108-seat Assembly.
	   This means that the election of about 30 anti-agreement
Protestants could be sufficient to block progress in the Assembly,
whose decisions will require majority support from both the
Protestant and Catholic blocs.
	   Trimble, a 54-year-old former law lecturer, insists that
Paisley, a 72-year-old evangelist, is a waning force in Northern
Ireland's politics.
	   He predicts that Paisley's Democratic Unionists and other
anti-agreement candidates will struggle to get 20 percent of the
vote while his own party will exceed 30 percent for a safe majority
of Protestant Assembly members.
	   But while canvassing for votes in his hometown of Lurgan _ where
someone has spray-painted ``TRAITOR'' on the doorway of his office
_ Trimble walks with understandable trepidation through the
Protestant gantlet.
	   Many men and women come forward to shake his hand and quietly
thank him for helping negotiate the agreement. But his critics are
far more bold.
	   ``You've sold us down the river. You've let the Protestant
people badly down,'' says one man, jabbing a finger in Trimble's
face and crumpling up his leaflet.
	   Six of Trimble's nine Ulster Unionist colleagues in British
Parliament oppose the agreement. Like Paisley, they reject the
provisions that would see Irish Republican Army prisoners paroled
by mid-2000 and admit the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party to the new
12-member Northern Ireland administration, to be drawn from the
Assembly.
	   Trimble, positioned as the likely leader of that administration,
blocked the dissident lawmakers from being Assembly candidates. But
six other ``no'' campaigners have been nominated by local Ulster
Unionist associations.
	   In prosperous south Belfast, the Ulster Unionists are running
three candidates _ two in favor of the agreement, one against.
	   Party canvassers hand out leaflets door to door that picture all
three candidates standing together, normal practice in an election
that allows voters to pick several candidates in order of
preference.
	   But when asked whether all three candidates should be supported,
the canvassers give an emphatic ``no,'' urging that the
anti-agreement candidate be snubbed in favor of Catholic moderates.
	   In north Belfast, Ulster Unionist candidate John Hunter returns
the favor, urging voters to back him because he's opposed to the
agreement _ but not other Ulster Unionist candidates in favor of
it.
	   ``I fundamentally believe that the agreement is unworkable,''
said Hunter _ a former Trimble supporter.

	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Without immediate food and medical relief
hundreds of thousands of war refugees inside Guinea-Bissau face
imminent famine, a United Nations refugee agency spokesman said
Monday.
	   As many as 300,000 people have fled fighting in Guinea-Bissau's
capital, and have converged on towns north of the city, where food,
clean water and medical supplies are in desperately short supply.
	   ``We talking about a matter of days before this becomes a major
crisis,'' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman
Khassim Diagne said in an interview near the Senegalese border with
Guinea-Bissau.
	   Although fighting near the capital, Bissau, was not a fierce as
in recent days, gunfire and the blast of artillery shells were
heard near the airport, where the country's breakaway military
faction has dug in to hold off loyalist forces and Senegalese
troops.
	   Senegal, fighting on behalf of President Joao Bernardo Vieira,
has about 1,500 troops inside of Guinea-Bissau and began shipping
in supplies and troop reinforcements from the southern town of
Ziguinchor.
	   Senegal also had started bringing home its dead. At least 10
Senegalese bodies were shipped over the weekend to Ziguinchor, a
military spokesman said.
	   At least four wounded troops were also shipped home.
	   The two-week-old conflict was triggered when former
Guinea-Bissau chief of army staff Brig. Ansumane Mane staged a
failed coup attempt against Vieira.
	   Heavy fighting has left the capital scarred and battered from
rocket and artillery fire, it's streets virtually deserted.
	   The vast majority of the city's 300,000 people have fled Bissau.
	   Driven from their homes, between 250,000 and 300,000 people have
flocked to the central towns of Mansoa, Bafata, and Canchungo where
clean water and food are in short supply, Diagne said.
	   ``Guinea-Bissau is already a poor country and with so many
people fleeing to these areas, it is already overburdened,'' he
said.
	   The UNHCR deputy high commissioner has proposed creating a
humanitarian corridor into the affected areas, but the
implementation has yet to be seen.
	   Portugese officials said Monday that the Bissau government had
denied a request from Portugal to land a C-130 cargo plane carrying
food supplies at Bissau's rebel-held airport, the Portugese news
agency Lusa reported. The rebels had said they were willing to
allow the landing.
	   Meanwhile, a Portuguese relief group arrived Sunday in Gabu, 200
kilometers (125 miles) east of Bissau with 20 tons of humanitarian
aid, Portugese officials.

World Cup: Olsen's lineup streak left intact AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen has never
used the same team in two straight games since taking over as
Norway's coach in 1990.
	   For his 87th match, against defending champion Brazil in
Marseille on Tuesday, Olsen apparently won't break the pattern,
announcing one change from the team that drew 1-1 with Scotland a
week ago.
	   As expected, the change came in midfield with Liverpool's Oyvind
Leonhardsen replacing Stale Solbakken, who plays for Danish side
Aalborg.
	   Leonhardsen, who played in the Group A opener against Morocco _
a 2-2 draw, will be joined by another hard-running player,
Rosenborg's Roar Strand, in Norway's five-man midfield.
	   ``This was most the difficult team selection that I ever made,''
Olsen said Monday.
	   It could also be the last one for Olsen, who will retire after
the World Cup and has been linked with the vacant manager's job at
Glasgow's Celtic.
	   Norway needs a victory against Brazil to assure itself of the
second round for the first time in three attempts.
	   If Scotland and Morocco draw in the other Group A game at
Saint-Etinne that will be played simultaneously Tuesday, Norway
could advance with a one-goal loss.
	   Norway has two points while Scotland and Morocco, each have one.
Brazil, with six points, has already qualified for a second-round
match against a yet determined opponent Saturday in Paris.
	   Olsen had two options in midfield: select an additional creative
player or a hard-running player. The latter won.
	   ``We'll see if it's enough against Brazil,'' Olsen said. ``If it
doesn't work we'll take the consequences.
	   ``I said all the time that we had a 50-50 chance to qualify for
the second round and I still believe that. It would be a great
disappointment should we fail to advance.
	   ``We're not totally satisfied with our performance so far, but
we're not so disappointed either. We had expected to play a little
bit better. If we raise our game a little bit against Brazil, we
could advance.''
	   Central midfielder Kjetil Rekdal and flankers Havard Flo and
Vidar Riseth complete what has been perhaps been the weakest
element of Norway's team during the tournament.
	   Norway's back four line will be identical for the third match in
a row: Henning Berg (Manchester United), Stig Inge Bjornebye
(Liverpool), Dan Eggen (Celta) and Ronny Johnsen (Manchester
United).
	   Frode Grodas, a third-choice keeper with Tottenham the past
year, and striker Tore-Andre Flo of European Cup Winners' Cup
champion Chelsea complete Olsen's starting lineup.
	   Norway, unbeaten in its last 16 matches, has never lost to
Brazil. A year ago, Ronaldo and company lost 4-2 a friendly in
Oslo. The only other match, also played in the Norwegian capital,
10 years ago, ended 1-1.

Turkey vows to strengthen ties with Bosnian Muslims 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel on Monday
promised Turkey's continued support for Bosnian Muslims, saying
relations would be ``taken to the most advanced stage.''
	   The pledge came after talks with Ejup Ganic, the Muslim
President of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   ``Turkey will always be by the side of its Bosnian brothers for
the protection of Bosnia's independence,'' Demirel said, according
to a statement released by his office.
	   Ganic was in Ankara for talks on the situation in Yugoslavia's
troubled Kosovo province, where 90 percent of the people are ethnic
Albanians, and on economic ties with Muslim Turkey.
	   Turkey has earmarked some dlrs 20 million aid for war-torn
Bosnia as well as dlrs 60 million in loans.
	   Demirel and Ganic worry that ethnic strife in Kosovo will spread
throughout the Balkans. More than 300 people have died there since
Serbian police began a crackdown in March against separatist
Albanian guerrillas.

Palestinian Authority requests permission for return of hard-liner 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority has asked permission
for a senior PLO official opposed to the Oslo peace accords to
enter the Palestinian territories, an Israeli official said Monday.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the Authority had requested permission for the
entrance of Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political bureau.
	   Shlomo Dror, an official with Israel's military government in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said he believed permission would be
granted for Kaddoumi's return in the next few days.
	   The Palestinians have autonomy in major cities in the West Bank
and in most of the Gaza Strip, but Israel still controls all border
crossings.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, is a fierce opponent of the
1993 and 1995 Israel-Palestinian peace agreements. There was
speculation that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat might have
invited him as a signal to the Israelis that he could might
alliances with hard-liners if the peace process does not move
forward.
	   In the past year, Kaddoumi has made somewhat more conciliatory
statements about the peace process _ calling on the United States
to pressure Israel to keep its side of the agreements and saying
that all Palestinian factions should take part in talks with
Israel.
	   Dror noted that Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1995, when the Palestinian National
Council met in the Gaza Strip. Kaddoumi boycotted that session,
however, because Gaza, which became autonomous in May 1994, is not
yet fully independent of Israel.
	   ``I don't think there is a reason not to allow him to come in,''
Dror said. ``He had no security problems. He is not against the
peace process.''

Duma takes seventh stage, Garzelli retains overall lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MORSCHACH, Switzerland (AP) _ Vladimir Duma of Ukraine narrowly
won the seventh stage of the Tour de Suisse Monday after outpacing
three other racers on the final climb of the day.
	   Italy's Stefano Garzelli finished 20th and retained the leader's
yellow jersey, increasing his lead over fellow Italian Leonardo
Piepoli to 1 minute 23 seconds.
	   Duma covered the 162.3 kilometers (100.9 miles) from Haag to
Morschach in 3 hours 54 minutes 37 seconds. He finished two seconds
in front of Switzerland's Rolf Huser, himself narrowly ahead of
last year's winner, Christophe Agnolutto of France.
	   The three were part of a group of nine riders who broke away 13
kilometers (8 miles) into the stage, the last 60 kilometers (37.3
miles) of which involved a number of ascents.
	   Some 18 kilometers (11.2 miles) from Morschach, the group split
when Huser launched an attack. Duma, Agnolutto and Italy's Diego
Ferrari joined Huser to contest the stage win.
	   France's Laurent Jalabert, the early race leader, finished 57th
and dropped a place to 26th overall. But last year's Tour de France
winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany, remained 13th overall, finishing
just over nine minutes behind Duma in 30th place.
	   Tuesday's stage of 182.1 kilometers (113.2 miles) starts in
Brunnen and finishes in Huttwil. The race finishes Thursday in the
Swiss capital, Bern.

miles) of which involved a number of ascents.
	   Some 18 kilometers (11.2 miles) from Morschach, the group split
when Huser launched an attack. Duma, Agnolutto and Italy's Diego
Ferrari joined Huser to contest the stage win.
	   France's Laurent Jalabert, the early race leader, finished 57th
and dropped a place to 26th overall. But last year's Tour de France
winner, Jan Ullrich of Germany, remained 13th overall, finishing
just over nine minutes behind Duma in 30th place.
	   Tuesday's stage of 182.1 kilometers (113.2 miles) starts in
Brunnen and finishes in Huttwil. The race finishes Thursday in the
Swiss capital, Bern.

Social Democrats picked to form new government led with Havel speech at 1730 GMT

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel was poised
to ask the center-left Social Democrats to try to form a new
government late Monday, a task complicated by personal animosities
and political divisions among party leaders.
	   In a Monday evening address, Havel was expected to give the
winner of last weekend's parliamentary elections the first chance,
in keeping with tradition. But despite his victory, Milos Zeman is
the least likely to succeed.
	   The Social Democrats captured the most votes and control 74
seats in the 200-seat legislature, but their chances to form a
majority government are hindered by a lack of allies.
	   ``We've said a resounding `no' to a grand coalition,''
ex-premier and election runner-up Vaclav Klaus said after meeting
with his arch-rival Zeman.
	   Klaus' center-right Civic Democratic Party won control of 63
seats.
	   ``I told the president we would never go into a coalition with
Social Democrats,'' Jan Ruml said after meeting with Havel. His
rightist Freedom Union won 19 seats in the new parliament.
	   That leaves Josef Lux and his small center-right Christian
Democrats as the only coalition partners for Zeman, but the two
parties combined would only have a 94-seat minority.
	   Zeman prefers a two-party government with Christian Democrats,
but Lux fears the Cabinet could then fall hostage to the old-guard
Communists, who have 24 seats.
	   ``We think the best reflection of the election result is a grand
coalition of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and the Freedom
Union,'' Lux said after his meeting with Havel Monday.
	   If Zeman fails to form a government as expected, Havel is likely
to ask one of the remaining leaders to try their luck.
	   Runner-up Klaus is the natural second choice. The ex-premier
makes it no secret he wants to resurrect the old center-right
coalition led by his Civic Democratic Party, which would have a
slim majority of 102 seats.
	   This plan is so far opposed by both Lux and Ruml, as long as
Klaus remains party chairman.
	   ``I think that with the current Civic Democratic Party and its
current policy, it (forming a coalition) would be very difficult,''
Lux said.
	   ``The Civic Democratic Party will have to change an awful lot of
things before we sit down and talk,'' said Ruml.
	   The controversy goes back to last November, when Ruml accused
Klaus' party of accepting illegal campaign donations amid
suspicions of privatization corruption.
	   Lux, then vice-premier in the Cabinet, pulled out, saying he
could no longer cooperate with the premier. This effectively forced
Klaus' coalition to collapse.
	   Klaus cried foul, accusing Lux and Ruml of betrayal. But despite
a sharp slump in the polls, he managed to lead a comeback for the
country's strongest rightist party.

Four dead in fourth day of Yemen price hike protests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire in two Yemeni cities
Monday during escalating protests against an IMF-dictated hike in
fuel prices. Four people were killed.
	   It was the fourth straight day of protests following the hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices on Friday.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and
three were wounded, witnesses said.
	   The 40 percent hikes in fuel prices were in line with
International Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on
petroleum products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who came to power last month in Yemen, a poor
country on the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula.
	   Protesters also clashed with police in riot gear in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said.
	   Police arrested at least 20 people, they said.
	   A demonstration by hundreds of university students Monday was
dispersed by baton-wielding police who fired into the air. Three of
the demonstration's leaders were arrested. Authorities closed San`a
University Monday and deployed anti-riot police on campus.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the
IMF-demanded reforms.

Kournikova withdraws, Sampras, Agassi, Graf win in straight sets
Eds: Updates with Graf quotes; edits to conform and trim
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost one of its marquee
names on the opening day of the tournament Monday when 17-year-old
Russian star Anna Kournikova withdrew with a thumb injury.
	   While Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles
were among first-round winners, Kournikova said she could not play
because of torn and strained ligaments in her right thumb.
	   Kournikova, a 1997 Wimbledon semifinalist and No. 12 seed this
year, hurt herself last Thursday during one of the biggest
victories of her career _ a three-set win over Graf at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, whose glamorous looks and skimpy outfits have made
her the focus of tabloid coverage in Britain, skipped the rest of
the Eastbourne event in what was originally described as a
``precautionary'' move. But further checks revealed a more serious
injury.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better but
this morning when I woke up it was very difficult for me to move
the finger,'' Kournikova said.
	   The Russian, who was replaced in the draw by American ``lucky
loser'' Lilia Osterloh, said she would be unable to play or
practice for at least three weeks.
	   ``I'm very sad about it,'' she said. ``This is my favorite
tournament. I feel like I could do well on grass. I was getting
ready for it the whole year.''
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
112th championships started in sunny weather and temperatures of 21
celsius (70 f). But by mid-afternoon, dark clouds moved in and
there was a chance of showers.
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has been relaid with new grass for the first
time in 40 years.
	   He enjoyed a dominant 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Slovakia's
Dominik Hrbaty, a performance that belied the poor results that
have cast doubt on Sampras' chances of defending his title.
	   Sampras served an ace on the first point, closed out the first
set with another and was never troubled during the 1 hour,
19-minute match. He finished with 17 aces and eight double faults.
	   The top-seeded American, seeking his fifth Wimbledon
championship in six years, has lost his aura of invincibility since
trouncing Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He
lost in the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals
of the Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   ``If you can't get up for an event like this, you shouldn't be
playing,'' Sampras said. ``This place over the years has brought
out the best in me. You get more keyed up, more fired up, going out
there at 2 o'clock on Monday. Over the years, it's been treating me
pretty well.''
	   Within seconds of Sampras winning his match, 1992 champion
Agassi completed a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory on Court 1 over Spain's
Alex Calatrava.
	   Wearing a long-sleeved white shirt, Agassi was in full control
from the baseline. Calatrava, who received treatment on his left
knee in the second set, ended the match with a double fault.
	   It was a convincing performance by the 13th-seeded Agassi, who
has soared in the rankings since dropping to No. 141 last November.
He has been bothered recently by a shoulder injury.
	   ``Even though I was out playing I wasn't there 100 percent,''
Agassi said. ``I had my energy elsewhere in a lot of cases. I need
to take it up another level in this tournament. I'm ready to do
that.''
	   On the women's side, fourth-seeded Graf followed Sampras on
Centre Court and beat Spain's Gala Leon Garcia 6-4, 6-1.
	   The German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's her first in
two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing major knee
surgery a year ago.
	   Graf, admitting that she thought of retiring two months ago as
injuries slowed her comeback, broke down in tears during a
post-match news conference.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' she said. ``It's just special to be here.''
	   It was also an emotional day for Seles, the No. 6 seed, who
downed Spain's Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo 6-3, 6-4.
	   Seles, whose career was disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, is
coming off her inspiring run to the French Open final earlier this
month, just three weeks after the death of her father Karolj.
	   ``Right now, for the past four weeks, for the first time in my
life, I have time to focus on tennis,'' she said. ``I enjoy just
playing again.''
	   The highest women's seed in action Monday, No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory in 50 minutes over
Argentina's Florencia Labat.
	   The first seeded player to lose was No. 11 Mary Pierce, who
suffered her latest Grand Slam flop in a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 defeat to
Elena Tatarkova of Ukraine.
	   In an early match, third-seeded Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, needed less than 90 minutes to defeat Spain's Javier
Sanchez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Looking at home on the grass, the Czech
left-hander served 16 aces and showed he could be among the top
challengers.

Six dead in Yemen protests over price hikes claiming nine deaths; EDITS to conform. No pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with two killed in Sunday's shooting; opposition
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday in two Yemeni
cities to quell escalating protests against a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices. Four people were killed and 10 injured, witnesses
said.
	   Two others were killed in similar shooting Sunday in Arhab, a
suburb of the capital, San`a, witnesses said Monday.
	   An opposition group, however, claimed at least nine people were
killed in the two days of violence, but this could not be
independently confirmed. Police refused to give any figures.
	   Monday's rioting was the fourth straight day of protests in the
poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula following Friday's hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and
three were wounded, witnesses said.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who took office last month.
	   Demonstrators also clashed with riot police in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   They said police arrested at least 20 people.
	   However, a statement by the London-based National Opposition
Front said that six people were killed in Marib.
	   It made no mention of the Taiz violence but said three people
were killed in Arhab, the capital's suburb, on Sunday. The Front's
statement was faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The price hikes were scheduled for January. But the government
was forced to delay them because of conflicts over political and
economic policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem
and President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in Yemen.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than a year in office, was replaced
by al-Iryani in May.
	   A demonstration by hundreds of university students Monday was
dispersed by club-wielding police who fired into the air. Three of
the demonstration's leaders were arrested. Authorities closed San`a
University Monday and deployed anti-riot police on campus.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

Shevardnadze to meet with Abkhazian leaders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
said Monday he will meet with the president of Abkhazia to discuss
a peace settlement with the breakaway region.
	   Shevardnadze said he and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba
will discuss the return of refugees and the possible lifting of
restrictions on the Abkhazian section of the Russian-Georgian
border.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers. Dozens of people were killed in
fighting in the Ghali region last month between Abkhazian
separatists and militia groups that support Georgia's central
government. More than 30,000 people fled during the fighting.
	   In his weekly radio address, Shevardnadze also thanked Russian
peacekeepers for helping to negotiate a settlement in the conflict
between Georgia and another breakaway province, South Ossetia.
	   Though no official settlement has been achieved on the status of
South Ossetia, relations between the two sides have calmed,
Shevardnadze said.
	   South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in 1990, when it was still
part of the Soviet Union. The region's mostly ethnic Ossetian
populace has been calling for unity with ethnic brethren in
Russia's North Ossetia.

Diana fund will continue indefinitely, trustees say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The trustees of the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund announced Monday that the fund will continue to
operate, despite earlier calls from the princess' brother to
dissolve it because of what he called ``tacky'' merchandising
decisions.
	   Earl Spencer had criticized the fund's decisions to put his late
sister's name on tubs of margarine and lottery scratchcards, and
asked the trustees to set a deadline to disband.
	   The fund issued a statement Monday _ approved by both Buckingham
Palace and Diana's family, including her brother _ saying the fund
would avoid actively raising funds but would ``continue its work
indefinitely, settling into a pattern of making grants mainly or
wholly from the income derived from its long-term capital.''
	   The statement said the fund probably would award a minimum of 4
million pounds (6.7 million dlrs) to various charities every year,
even in less profitable times.
	   Starting this fall, it said, the fund's donations will target
four groups _ ``displaced people,'' such as the homeless; ``people
at the margins,'' including the unemployed, the disabled or drug
addicts; ``survivors of conflict,'' meaning everyone from those
injured in war to those affected by family strife, and ``the dying
and the bereaved.''
	   The fund already has pledged 13 million pounds (21.7 million
dlrs) to various charities, including several that had Diana as
patron.
	   ``She brought hope to many in distress and at the margins of
society. The fund, in its own way, will attempt to do the same,''
the statement said.
	   A spokesman for Earl Spencer said he was out of the country and
not available for comment.

Six dead in Yemen protests over price hikes claiming nine deaths; EDITS to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with two killed in Sunday's shooting; opposition
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday in two Yemeni
cities to quell escalating protests against an IMF-dictated 40
percent hike in fuel prices. Four people were killed and 10
injured, witnesses said.
	   Two others were killed in similar shooting Sunday in Arhab, a
suburb of the capital, San`a, witnesses said Monday.
	   An opposition group has claimed at least nine people were killed
in the two days of violence, but this could not be independently
confirmed. Police refused to give any figures.
	   Monday's rioting was the fourth straight day of protests in the
poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula following Friday's hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and
three were wounded, witnesses said.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who took office last month.
	   Demonstrators also clashed with riot police in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity, and police arrested at least 20 people.
	   A statement by the London-based National Opposition Front said
that six people were killed in Marib.
	   It made no mention of the Taiz violence but said three people
were killed in Arhab, the capital's suburb, on Sunday. The Front's
statement was faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   A demonstration by hundreds of university students Monday was
dispersed by club-wielding police who fired into the air. Three of
the demonstration's leaders were arrested. Authorities closed San`a
University Monday and deployed anti-riot police on campus.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the IMF
reforms.

Precede JERUSALEM Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback INCORPORATES material from Israel-President; changes byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs Recast. UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, details;
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's justice minister said Monday he
would recommend that the government hold a non-binding referendum,
or giant opinion poll, on a West Bank troop withdrawal to force the
hand of far-right legislators opposed to the redeployment.
	   But as the referendum idea gained momentum, the Palestinians,
Israel's president and members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's own Cabinet called it a waste of time.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Netanyahu's far-right
coalition partners, who have threatened to topple him over a troop
withdrawal.
	   But it would also further delay Israel from carrying out a troop
withdrawal it committed to in January 1997 and hold up a stalled
peace process the United States is trying to get going again.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to make a
quick decision on a U.S. plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which was first
proposed earlier this year, but Netanyahu has not responded to the
plan.
	   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, called the referendum ``a waste of time.'' ``How can they
ask for a referendum on an agreement they already signed?''
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he didn't
understand the reasoning behind a referendum.
	   ``I think the central aim should be to protect the momentum and
advancement of the process with the Palestinians and as far as a
the referendum goes, I just don't know. In the end, does it aim to
forward the process or are there other reasons?'' he told
reporters.
	   And Israeli President Ezer Weizman dealt perhaps the most
serious blow of all Monday, coming out against a national vote and
saying that he was disappointed in Netanyahu's handling of the
peace process.
	   ``One of the things that disappoints me the most is that they
took the joy out of the peace. Today, there is no joy on this
issue,'' Weizman said, a day after he angrily pulled out of an
economic conference reportedly complaining that he had been misled
by Netanyahu about the timing of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi met Monday with legal advisers
and Cabinet colleagues to discuss the referendum proposal.
	   After the meeting, Hanegbi said he would probably recommend to
Netanyahu that he hold a non-binding referendum that could be
organized within 90 days. The results would not force the
government's hand, but would carry great moral weight.
	   ``The government cannot ignore the results,'' Hanegbi said,
adding that ministers who still opposed the public's wishes after
the vote ``will need to resign.''
	   Israel has never held a referendum, and a binding poll would
have required changes in the country's basic laws, a process that
could take up to two years, according to one researcher, former
Israeli diplomat Alon Liel.
	   By making the referendum non-binding, there would only have to
be minimal legislation that could be completed within weeks,
Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh said.

Major video piracy trial under way in Italy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ One of the largest video piracy trials in Italy
began Monday in the southern city of Naples, with 59 people accused
of illegal manufacturing and distributing.
	   The defendants include members of a Naples gang arrested in
March, said attorney Luciano Menozzi. Police found hundreds of
master tapes and sophisticated copying equipment in their hide-out.
	   Menozzi represents an Italian industry group lobbying for
stiffer penalties against piracy. The group is suing the defendants
in a civil action linked to the criminal trial.
	   The illegal video, compact disc and computer software industry
in Italy ranks second only to Russia's in Europe; by some
estimates, 20 to 33 percent of the CDs sold in Italy are pirated.
	   Experts says patent and copyright infringements in Italy last
year cost U.S. companies about dlrs 580 million. Washington has put
Italy on a ``priority watch list,'' which could mean trade
sanctions if Italy doesn't crack down.
	   A draft law with stiffer penalties is pending in parliament, but
has been watered down by amendments.

Palestinian Authority requests permission for return of hard-liner 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority has asked permission
for a senior PLO official opposed to the Oslo peace accords to
enter the Palestinian territories, an Israeli official said Monday.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the Authority had requested permission for the
entrance of Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political bureau.
	   Shlomo Dror, an official with Israel's military government in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said he believed permission would be
granted for Kaddoumi's arrival in the next few days.
	   The Palestinians have autonomy in major cities in the West Bank
and in most of the Gaza Strip, but Israel still controls all border
crossings.
	   Kaddoumi, who is based in Tunis, is a fierce opponent of the
1993 and 1995 Israel-Palestinian peace agreements. There was
speculation that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat might have
invited him as a signal to the Israelis that he might forge
alliances with hard-liners if the peace process does not move
forward.
	   In the past year, Kaddoumi has made somewhat more conciliatory
statements about the peace process _ calling on the United States
to pressure Israel to keep its side of the agreements and saying
that all Palestinian factions should take part in talks with
Israel.
	   Dror noted that Israel had granted Kaddoumi permission to enter
the Palestinian territories in 1995, when the Palestinian National
Council met in the Gaza Strip. Kaddoumi boycotted that session,
however, because Gaza, which became autonomous in May 1994, is not
yet fully independent of Israel.
	   ``I don't think there is a reason not to allow him to come in,''
Dror said. ``He had no security problems. He is not against the
peace process.''

World Cup: Spaniards begin to see red over Stoichkov's taunts 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov has a name
for provoking his opponents, and the Spaniards know it.
	   His latest taunts that Javier Clemente's crew is not up to the
task at this World Cup could prove to be the red rag the Spanish
bull needs if it is awaken and stay in this World Cup.
	   For weeks, the former FC Barcelona winger, who shared the top
goal-scoring honors in the 1994 World Cup, has appeared intent on
aggravating the Spanish squad, many of them former teammates, with
his remarks.
	   Prior to France, he laughed at the consideration of Spain as a
favorite in Group D and now _ as the two sides prepare for a
survival battle Wednesday _ he has further antagonized the
Spainiards by saying the team is paying the price for totally
overestimated itself and underestinmated others.
	   At the beginning, Clemente and his players dismissed Stoichkov,
rhetorically asking what else could be expected.
	   But as the difficulty to remain in the World Cup increases and
criticism rains down on Spain, his jibes might be used to unleash
the so-called ``Red Fury'' that Spain supposedly has but yet to
show.
	   ``Stoichkov is the one who has not shown respect,'' said Spanish
defender Rafael Alkorta, who has had to contend with Stoichkov in
domestic league play and may very well be assigned to mark him on
Wednesday. ``He's made a mistake with these statements.''
	   Spain's top-selling Sports paper, Marca, probably better
reflected the growing rage Monday when it ran a banner headline
that read: ``Stoichkov, Your Provocations Bore Us.''
	   ``He's out of control,'' the paper wrote. '' If there's one
player who specializes in heating things up it's Hristo
Stoichkov.''
	   So far, Stoichkov has been proven correct in dismissing the
Spaniards.
	   After coming into the World Cup with an almost impeccable 8-2-0
qualifiying record, Spain has done little but disappoint. It lost
its opener 3-2 to Nigeria after twice holding a one-goal lead.
Then, after promises of revenge, it managed only a dismal 0-0 draw
against lowly Paraguay in possibly the dullest match of the
tournament.
	   ``The Spanish think they're the best and have underestimated
their opponents,'' Stoichkov said this past weekend in his latest
taunt. ``Superiority has to be shown on the field, and now they're
under pressure because they have to win.''
	   Spain and Bulgaria have just one point each, and another loss
Wednesday for either means elimination. A draw for Bulgaria also
means farewell.
	   A victory would leave the winner dependent on group winner
Nigeria beating or drawing with Paraguay, which has two points.
	   ``Stoichkov's words won't affect us,'' said Spanish defender
Carlos Aguilera, who also admittted that the team was growing weary
of being criticized. ``We are not going to give him any special
treatment.... We're not obsessed with him.''
	   The 32-year-old Stoichkov rose to fame as a member of FC
Barcelona's ``Dream Team'' in the early '90s under the legendary
Johan Cruyff.
	   With Cruyff, he won several league titles and the club's first
and only European Champions Cup in 1992. He left the club earlier
this year and is expected to play in Japan after the World Cup.
	   Known for his tough cowboy image, Stoichkov is notorious for his
arguments _ and at times fisticuffs _ on and off the field.
	   ``He's a great player that symbolized an era in Spain,'' Alkorta
said. ``He's a fine left winger and his fighting spirit, in the
good sense, holds sway over his teammates.''
	   But the Bilbao defender wrapped up his praise with a subtle
warning: ``I hope he's a sensible fellow, and anyway when we meet
face to face on the field it will be a different matter.''

NBA draft echoes with buzz of trade talk AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ The NBA draft list shows the
Los Angeles Clippers selecting first and the Vancouver Grizzlies
second.
	   By the time commissioner David Stern steps to the podium
Wednesday night, those first two picks _ and several others in the
first round _ may belong to somebody else.
	   The National Basketball Asociation was buzzing with trade talk
Monday as the clock ticked toward the start of the draft. Making
matters more interesting was the uncertainty surrounding the order
of player selections _ even among the top lottery picks.
	   Unlike last year when Tim Duncan was set to be picked first
overall, the No. 1 choice is not clear this time.
	   The Clippers need a point guard, with Mike Bibby of Arizona the
best one available, as well as a center such as Michael Olawakandi
of Pacific.
	   Trouble is, the Clippers need a lot more help than any one
rookie can provide. And that's why general manager Elgin Baylor is
fielding calls, trying to find a package of players that can make
his team respectable in time for its move to a new arena in 1999.
	   All the teams in the lottery need help, which is why every pick
could be traded. Given that the second round of the playoffs
contained mostly older teams, general managers have soured on youth
and building through the draft.
	   One general manager who figured to be taking more calls than
Baylor was Stu Jackson of the Grizzlies.
	   ``What's important for us is we know what's out there and what
we will do in every eventuality,'' Jackson said. ``We want to
control what we can control.''
	   Most expect Bibby to be selected first, leaving Olawakandi to
the Grizzlies. But Vancouver already has a center, Bryant Reeves,
who is signed for the next six seasons.
	   That might prompt the Grizzlies to trade down a few spots,
letting them take Antawn Jamison or Vince Carter of North Carolina
or Raef LaFrentz of Kansas to fill needs at shooting guard and
power forward.
	   There is also talk of the Lakers sending forward Elden Campbell
and a guard, either Eddie Jones, Derek Fisher or Nick Van Exel, to
Vancouver for the No. 2 pick, according to an agent for one of
those players.
	   Toronto, at No. 4, also was said to be trying to switch places
with Vancouver. And the maneuvering doesn't end at No. 2.
	   The Denver Nuggets, choosing third, would like Olawakandi but
are unable to move up. The may end up ``settling'' for Paul Pierce,
thought by many to be the best all-around player available.
	   ``Nobody likes anybody on our roster. That's how they open every
conversation,'' general manager Dan Issel told the Los Angeles
Times. ``I mean, it's pretty pitiful when a team like Toronto, who
won 16 games, tells you there's nobody on your roster they want.
It's not like they have an abundance of talent over there.''
	   The Raptors need size and scoring even after acquiring Kevin
Willis from the Houston Rockets. They were said to be shopping Doug
Christie and the fourth pick, perhaps as a package.
	   The Golden State Warriors choose fifth, by which time they may
or may not have decided to pull the trigger on a Latrell Sprewell
trade. The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs were among the
contenders, and reports two weeks ago had the Knicks offering some
combination of Chris Mills, John Starks and Chris Childs.
	   Dallas general manager Don Nelson was pondering whether to
select 19-year-old Dirk Nowitzki of Germany with the sixth pick,
and Sacramento will take the best leftover player at No. 7. Unless,
of course, the Kings find a deal to their liking that also could
include Chris Webber, recently acquired from Washington for Mitch
Richmond and Otis Thorpe.
	   After that, it's a gamble for the rest of the first round with
four high school players available and another large crop of
underclassmen.
	   First, however, comes the reshuffling. And it doesn't figure to
slow until Stern turns over the podium to NBA vice president Rod
Thorn for the second round.

No giant screen as Wimbledon competes with World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The All England Club probably had the
only giant-screen television in the country that wasn't tuned
Monday to the soccer World Cup in France.
	   England played Romania on Monday in Toulouse, but Wimbledon
officials declined requests to show the crucial match on a giant
screen situated in the practice area near Court No. 1.
	   ``While we thoroughly appreciate and understand that many of our
visitors will be interested in the World Cup, the tennis must
remain our first priority,'' said chief executive Chris Gorringe.
	   ``It is therefore not our intention to show football matches on
the large screen although we shall try to let people know the
scores of certain matches via the general information system.''
	   In the wake of riots in Marseille just over a week ago involving
English hooligans, Gorringe also cited a safety reason.
	   ``There is a saftey issue, the question of thousands on the
terrace. And what of a penalty shootout at 10:30, 10:45 at night in
the darkness? We're not geared for that.''
	   The World Cup ends July 12 with England among the favorites to
reach at least the quarterfinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LET, ANDRE: &LR;  Andre Agassi is dead set against a proposal under
consideration by the International Tennis Federation to do away
with the let rule.
	   ``If you play (lets), I think you're just throwing in a whole
other element,'' he said. ``It just seems so random, almost
somewhat lucky.''
	   ``A lot of times in crucial serves you'll see a let. Sometimes a
couple of them in a row. I don't think they should ever play it. I
think that's ludicrous... It would be a horrific change in the
game.''
	   The rule change will be debated in July at the ITF's annual
general meeting in Ireland and could be voted on before the years
is over. Designed to speed play, the rule would mean no replay of
serves which catch the tape before going over. graf of backgroind..
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ANDRE AND BROOKE: &LR;  Andre Agassi said he was more upset than his
wife, Brooke Shields, over unfounded allegations that she had been
questioned about drugs at this year's Cannes Film Festival.
	   Earlier this month, Shields was granted what was described as
``very substantial'' libel damages from The Mail on Sunday over the
May 24 story. The newspaper ran an apology for its erroneous story.
	   ``I can take stuff a lot more toward me, more than I can toward
her,'' Agassi said. ``She's such a wonderful person. It bothers me
a little bit, but you deal with what you have to deal with.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STRAWBERRY LINE: &LR;  There's no shortage of strawberries at
Wimbledon, and no price increase either.
	   Again, a cup filled with seven or eight berries and a dollop of
cream sells for 1.85 pounds (dlrs 3.05). Officials have ordered 24
tons of strawberries for the fortnight. The healthy alternative of
yogurt and strawberries costs more _ 2.85 pounds (dlrs 4.70).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PETE IN JEOPARDY: &LR;  How's this for pressure?
	   Four-time champion Pete Sampras will lose his No. 1 ATP Tour
ranking if he fails to reach the Wimbledon final.
	   Sampras, who was ranked No. 1 for 102 straight weeks before
briefly falling to No. 2 behind Marcelo Rios this spring, could
lose his No. 1 to six possible players _ Rios, Petr Korda, Carlos
Moya, Greg Rusedski, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Patrick Rafter.
	   Sampras on Monday beat Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
The last defending champion to lose in the first round was Maunuel
Santana in 1967.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   FIRST POINT: &LR;  The first point of Wimbledon '98 _ under bright
sun on Court 6 _ went to Belgian Filip DeWulf at 12:10 p.m. in his
match with American Steve Campbell. DeWulf won 6-2, 2-6, 6-1, 6-0.
The first victory of the fortnight went to Argentina's Mariana
Diaz-Oliva, a 6-3, 6-2 winner over countrywoman Paola Suarez.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   ODDS AND ENDS: &LR;  Sixteen-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic _
playing her first Wimbledon _ is just getting over a case of
chicken pox that kept her out of the French Open... No woman seeded
below No. 4 has won Wimbledon since the Open era began in
1968....The Americans topped the men's singles field with 16
entries, with Spain next with 12 .. The United States leads the
women's singles field with 17 entries... Asked why he played in
long sleeves on a mostly sunny day, Andre Agassi cracked, ``You
don't have to wear as much sunscreen.''

With Sports-Soccer-Violence Germans deny they thought of withdrawing from World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German soccer federation officials said
Monday there were no serious considerations given to withdrawing
the team from the World Cup because of violence by German
hooligans.
	   ``It might be that in the first moments of shock, the question
of a measured reaction, possibly a withdrawal, was hinted at or
raised,'' said Michael Novak, a spokesman for the DFB, the German
federation.
	   ``But within the delegation there were no serious considerations
to withdraw the team,'' Novak said.
	   French authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics and
fascists'' for attacks outside a World Cup stadium in Lens that
left a policeman in a coma and on a respirator after being clubbed
with an iron bar. Germany and Yugoslavia drew 2-2.
	   A 27-year-old Hanover man was arrested in the attack. More than
90 other Germans were taken into custody for alleged involvement in
the violence or public drunkenness.
	   On Monday, rumors circulated that German officials had asked
during an emergency FIFA meeting whether they should withdraw their
team from the World Cup.
	   But Sepp Blatter, the new FIFA chief, told German reporters that
``no one had offered a withdrawal, it was never discussed.''
	   Chief DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said in Nice, the team's
headquarters, that the team ``cannot be held responsible for the
incidents in Lens.''
	   ``It could be that in the first moments of excitement such an
offer had been made. But there were never serious considerations
within the delegation to withdraw the team,'' Niersbach said.
	   Players also strongly condemned the violence.
	   ``We are deeply shaken,'' said goalkeeper Andreas Koepke.
	   ``The game from Sunday has become of second-rank importance.
Unfortunately there are always crazy people who want to destroy the
sport,'' Koepke said.

WTO adopts reports on computer equipment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ World Trade Organization members on Monday
formally adopted an appeal body's reversal of a WTO dispute panel
finding that the European Union wrongly earmarked computer network
equipment for higher import charges.
	   The appeal panel's decision, which overturned a finding made in
response to a U.S. complaint, represents the second time the United
States has lost a big trade case in the WTO.
	   A WTO panel in February found that the European Union was wrong
to classify Local Area Network equipment as telecommunications
apparatus rather than as automatic data processors, which attracts
lower customs duties.
	   The equipment is used to link computers in offices and other
small areas. The EU action had the effect of raising the duty on
such imports to 7.5 percent from 3.5 percent.
	   But the European Union appealed and a WTO appeal panel
subsequently found in its favor.
	   U.S. permanent trade representative to the WTO, Rita Hayes, told
a trade meeting in Geneva on Monday that the United States felt the
appeal body's report had not resolved the dispute.
	   It had left ``substantial uncertainty'' among WTO members about
the treatment they could expect to receive in similar future
disputes brought before the WTO, Hayes added.
	   At Monday's meeting, European Union representatives restated the
legal issues behind their appeal.
	   Senior U.S. trade officials had hailed the initial favorable
ruling as a victory in the largest case in dollar terms the United
States had brought before the WTO.
	   The United States put the European market for computer
networking equipment at dlrs 5 billion annually and said that U.S.
companies accounted for 50 percent of those sales.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities blamed squads of German
``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks outside a World Cup
stadium that left a policeman in a coma and on a respirator after
being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia when highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France, authorities said.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking Nivel. His name wasn't released. Police announced
late Monday that his detention had been extended for another 24
hours while charges are explored.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault on the policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans taken into custody during clashes with police before
and after the match were immediately deported.
	   Another 15 Germans were placed under formal investigation _ one
step short of being charged.
	   A German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in
connection with soccer violence, French news reports said Monday
evening. No further details were immediately available.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our
nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But he said the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounded ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''
	   FIFA issued a five-step plan to try to quell the violence. At
its heart: a pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking greater
cooperation with political authorities, including those of the
European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the reputation
of football...''
	   FIFA also flatly rejected an informal suggestion by the German
soccer federation that the team withdraw from the Cup.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the German hooligans were
``for the most part sober _ not like the ones in Marseille,''
referring to English soccer fans who rampaged in the southern
French city last Monday after a match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.

World Cup: Colombia wins 1-0 and Tunisia on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Substitute Leider Preciado fired the
winner seven minutes from the end as Colombia, who limped home in
dismay from World Cup 1994, stayed in contention for the second
round of France '98 with a nervous 1-0 victory over Tunisia.
	   Preciado took a pass from veteran Carlos Valderrama, shook off
challenges from Sami Trabelsi and Clayton, and prodded the ball
home from 12 meters (yards).
	   It was a goal that sent the Colombian players and bench into
wild celebration while the dismayed Tunisians, also beaten 2-0 by
England, looked almost certain to drop out of the championship.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   But Adolfo Valencia almost gave the South Americans the lead in
the opening when he collected a slick pass from Freddy Rincon, only
for a back-tracking Tunisian to block his 16-meter drive.
	   At the other end, Skander Souayah moved into a wide open
shooting position outside the Colombian penalty area but shot
tamely wide.
	   Souayeh had another chance in the 18th minute from a similar
position but still shot wide of the post.
	   The Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from Chokri
el-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Wilmer Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range
header. The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with an acrobatic one-handed
punch over the bar.
	   Four minutes later the 'keeper raced off his line to block an
angled shot from Anthony De Avila with his foot after the Colombian
had broken clear of the Tunisian defense.
	   With the Colombians showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia
broke out to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the
unmarked Mehdi Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header.
Fortunately for the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was
alert and pushed the header onto the post.
	   Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter shot just
too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Bouazizi on the back
of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   The Tunisians went close to taking the lead 10 minutes into the
second half when Souayah fed Ben Slimane in front of goal but
Mondragon managed to block his shot with his legs.
	   Ben Slimane wriggled through the Colombian defense again two
minutes later but Mondragon and a defender managed to scrambled the
ball for a corner.
	   The Tunisians continued to create the better chances and Bel
Slimane managed to get in a right-wing cross despite being crowded
out by three Colombian defenders in the 66th minute only for the
unmarked Zoubeir Baya to volley wide from a good position in front
of goal.
	   The Colombians hit back with a low shot from substitute Preciado
that flashed across the face of the Tunisian goal. Then Victor
Aristizabal arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a right wing
cross from Anthony De Avila only for 'keeper El-Oauer to scramble
back and palm his looping header away.
	   At the other end, Mondragon made two reflex-action saves,
blocking a header from Souayah and then a follow up effort from Ben
Slimane.

Russia `bewildered' over Swiss expulsion of diplomat for spying 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expressed ``bewilderment and regret''
Monday over the expulsion of a Russian diplomat in Switzerland, and
complained that Swiss officials had failed to keep the matter
quiet.
	   However, Russian media contained no indication that the
government denied allegations that the diplomat had been spying.
	   According to Russian news agencies, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin said the disclosure of the expulsion ``causes
amazement, in view of the fact that initial contacts with the Swiss
side indicated that the incident will not be made public.''
	   A Swiss police official acknowledged Sunday that the Swiss
government had expelled the diplomat, who was accredited to the
Russian mission to U.N. offices in Geneva. He was forced to leave
Switzerland two weeks ago.
	   The diplomat was identified only by the initials M.A. He was
alleged to have received material on NATO and Slovakia from a
Slovak diplomat.
	   Nesterushkin expressed ``bewilderment and regret,'' and said
Switzerland had not fully explained the reasons for the expulsion.
	   The action ``clearly runs counter to the positive development of
Russo-Swiss relations and, we believe, does nothing to consolidate
Switzerland's role as one of the most important centers of
multilateral diplomacy.''

Italian chamber prepares for a showdown on NATO expansion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: recasts 9th graf and restores dropped word 'Prodi'
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Monday pleaded
with lawmakers to put aside their differences and vote in favor of
NATO's expansion eastward in Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.
	   The center-left government goes into the vote uncertain if it
can muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house.
	   Its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO expansion, and
internal politics have muddied the prospects of support from other
potential allies on the issue.
	   The Senate has already ratified the expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 countries in NATO as well as the three
membership candidates. The Chamber of Deputies is expected to vote
by midday Tuesday.
	   ``Who could take on the moral responsibility, even more
important that the political one, to reject these countries, to
throw them into a condition of permanent precariousness?'' Dini
asked.
	   NATO expansion, he argued, is a ``huge strategic choice'' for
Italy and deserves approval ``by a large consensus.''
	   ``At times in parliament we've had differing visions on the
country's foreign policy, different even among members of the
majority,'' he acknowledged.
	   But, he went on, ``this has not prevented us from conducting a
strong, credible and coherent foreign policy, anchored to what we
felt were Italy' priorities.''
	   The center-right opposition, as well as a small group of
centrists, have said they might could come to the aid of Premier
Romano Prodi on NATO, but the political price could be high.
	   ``No one would understand and it would be a true insult to our
national interests if Parliament voted against NATO's expansion
purely for motives of internal politics,'' said an editorial in the
daily La Repubblica Monday.

World Cup: Colombia wins 1-0 and Tunisia on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Substitute Leider Preciado fired the
winner seven minutes from the end as Colombia, who limped home in
dismay from World Cup 1994, stayed in contention for the second
round of France '98 with a nervous 1-0 victory over Tunisia.
	   Preciado took a pass from veteran Carlos Valderrama, shook off
challenges from Sami Trabelsi and Clayton, and prodded the ball
home from 12 meters (yards).
	   It was a goal that sent the Colombian players and bench into
wild celebrations while the Tunisians, also beaten 2-0 by England,
looked almost certain to drop out of the championship.
	   They were certain to go out if Romania and England tied later
Monday.
	   The Colombians, then regarded as among the favorites, were
ousted in the opening round of the 1994 World Cup after an own goal
by Andres Escobar led to a 2-1 upset loss to the United States.
When he returned home, Escobar was shot dead in a parking lot
outside a bar at Medellin.
	   After a 1-0 loss to Romania at Lyon, things looked shaky again
for the South Americans.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   But Adolfo Valencia almost gave the South Americans the lead in
the opening when he collected a slick pass from Freddy Rincon, only
for a back-tracking Tunisian to block his 16-meter drive.
	   At the other end, Skander Souayah moved into a wide open
shooting position outside the Colombian penalty area but shot
tamely wide.
	   Souayeh had another chance in the 18th minute from a similar
position but still shot wide of the post.
	   The Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from Chokri
el-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Wilmer Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range
header. The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with an acrobatic one-handed
punch over the bar.
	   Four minutes later the 'keeper raced off his line to block an
angled shot from Anthony De Avila with his foot after the Colombian
had broken clear of the Tunisian defense.
	   With the Colombians showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia
broke out to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the
unmarked Mehdi Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header.
Fortunately for the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was
alert and pushed the header onto the post.
	   Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter shot just
too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Bouazizi on the back
of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   The Tunisians went close to taking the lead 10 minutes into the
second half when Souayah fed Ben Slimane in front of goal but
Mondragon managed to block his shot with his legs.
	   Ben Slimane wriggled through the Colombian defense again two
minutes later but Mondragon and a defender managed to scrambled the
ball for a corner.
	   The Tunisians continued to create the better chances and Bel

Lindsay Davenport: the overlooked No. 2 seed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ She's the No. 2 seed at Wimbledon, yet
her name rarely comes up in the talk about title favorites.
	   Lindsay Davenport is Miss Anonymous.
	   It's a role the 22-year-old American has grown accustomed to
playing.
	   ``I'm pretty much used to it now,'' Davenport said Monday after
a comfortable 6-2, 6-2 first-round victory over former world junior
champion Florencia Labat of Argentina. ``It's tough, but it doesn't
really bother me. I'm just going out there and trying to play well
and try not to worry about what is going on in the media.''
	   Much of the pre-Wimbledon attention has focused on veterans
Steffi Graf and Monica Seles and teen stars Martina Hingis, Anna
Kournikova (who withdrew Monday with a thumb injury) and sisters
Venus and Serena Williams.
	   ``The younger players have definitely made a name for themselves
and they love doing all the media stuff and getting the
attention,'' Davenport said. ``It's just in them and they have a
great persona and get the fans to connect with them. They're just
very public people and people have taken a huge liking to the whole
group, and they're very exciting to watch.
	   ``Then there are the older players like Graf and (Monica) Seles
who are back too, so it makes for an interesting mix. I'm kind of
in the middle and I haven't won a Grand Slam title and I'm not 16
or 17, so I get overlooked.''
	   She shouldn't. This year she's beaten Hingis to win the Pan
Pacific title in Tokyo. She's knocked off Kournikova to reach the
semifinals at Amelia Island, Fla. She outlasted Venus Williams to
reach the semifinals of the Australian Open.
	   Davenport has also made it to the semifinals of the last three
Grand Slams _ the U.S. Open, the Australian Open and the French
Open. She feels the next step isn't far away.
	   ``It's just a matter of time,'' she said. ``Obviously the U.S.
Open is where I'd like to do it. I hope it's just a matter of time
and experience. I'm not the one who goes out there and plays great
the first time like some of these girls. It takes me more time to
learn things to get comfortable and really go for it.''
	   Davenport, still looking to reach her first Grand Slam final,
had no troubles Monday.
	   Dropping only three points on serve in the second set, Davenport
won 63 percent of the points on her second serve and 67 percent of
the second serve points she returned.
	   ``I was very happy, because you never really know what to expect
coming in on grass and not playing a warm-up tournament,'' she
said. ``I thought I played very well. I served very well and I was
moving pretty well which is the key on grass.''
	   She might not have competed at the pre-Wimbledon tournaments in
Eastbourne or Rosmalen, but Davenport wasn't short of practice. Ten
days before Wimbledon she called up fellow pro Debbie Graham and
discovered someone she knew had a grass court in his back yard just
10 minutes from her home.
	   ``So I think I actually have the most practice on grass because
the weather was so nice in California and this guy had the greatest
grass court,'' Davenport said. ``It was the first time I've been
able to spend four or five hours a day on grass and really work on
things that have troubled me in the past. I feel pretty confident
now.''

Eds: UPDATES throughout with Colombia-Tunisia, other developments
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Poor results, not poor fans, will get a team sent
home early from the World Cup.
	   Proclaiming that ``we are not afraid,'' FIFA's new president on
Monday ruled out expelling any team from the Cup because of fan
violence.
	   ``I said no. You can't have this,'' Sepp Blatter said after an
emergency FIFA meeting. ``We are not afraid, we are concerned. We
have observed it and we are stronger. This World Cup can't be
disturbed again. We must stay here and play the games.''
	   Blatter words were the crest of wave of tough talk from three
nations struggling to deal with the problem before it overwhelms
the world's biggest sporting event. German hooligans were called
``rioters, fanatics, and fascists'' by French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
British government officials also condemned the violence.
	   Chevenement's comments were directed at the highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis who rampaged through Lens before and after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia game, leaving a policeman in a coma
after being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   ``If it would have meant saving the policeman from his injuries,
I would rather have lost the match,'' said German coach Berti
Vogts. The game ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   The victim is Daniel Nivel, 44, who collapsed unconscious in a
pool of blood on the sidewalk. A hospital spokeswoman said his
condition didn't improve Monday.
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking the Nivel. His name wasn't released.
	   Germany played down suggestions it was considering pulling out
of the tournament because of the Lens violence.
	   ``It might be that in the first moments of shock, the question
of a measured reaction, possibly a withdrawal, was hinted at or
raised,'' said German federation spokesman Michael Novak. ``But
within the delegation there were no serious considerations to
withdraw the team.''
	   One of the teams on the verge of an early exit because of
performance is Tunisia, which lost 1-0 Monday to Colombia on
substitute Leider Preciado's goal in the 83rd minute. A victory or
a tie for Romania against England on Monday night would erase any
chance the Tunisians had of making the second round.
	   The England-Romania match in Toulouse was another flashpoint for
potential fan trouble. English fans clashed with police over three
days surrounding the England-Tunisia game last week in Marseille.
	   French police, aided by their English counterparts, were
deporting known hooligans spotted in Toulouse before they could
cause any trouble.
	   ``I was doing absolutely nothing wrong,'' England fan Terence
Coughlin, who has a previous arrest for soccer-related violence,
said after he was handcuffed and sent home to Manchester. ``I do
not go to football for violence. I am not a football thug.''
	   After the emergency FIFA meeting, Blatter called on the European
Union to do more to prevent known soccer thugs from easily crossing
borders.
	   He said FIFA would pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking
greater cooperation with political authorities, including those of
the European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the
reputation of football and for the introduction of new legal
measures to achieve this.''

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A local newspaper headline screamed,
``Hooliganism: It's Escalating,'' and wary townsfolk scrutinized
strangers in their midst. Those English fans seemed harmless enough
partying on the Place du Capitole. Were they the hooligans?
	   In scattered outbreaks of World Cup violence, real culprits were
hard to miss. German neo-Nazis bludgeoned a policeman in Lens on
Sunday, leaving him near death. English thugs, French-Tunisians and
riot troops have fought pitched battles in Marseille.
	   But beyond the incidents themselves, the fear of potential
conflict has thrown a wet blanket over an international sporting
extravanganza meant to see out the millennium with unprecedented
merriment. Authorities are taking no chances.
	   Marseille at times resembles an armed camp, with metal barriers
closing off sections of the Old Port, where local authorities had
planned night after night of free concerts.
	   Lens, a hardscabble industrial town which lives for soccer, is
still shaken from Sunday's violence that left a policeman comatose
and on a respirator after being battered by German thugs. Lyon,
where only small incidents have been reported, is on alert.
Likewise, Montpellier, where Germany plays Iran on Thursday.
	   In Toulouse, where one in six of the 600,000 inhabitants is a
university student, the bars now close at 11 p.m. An extra 500
police, with heavy riot gear, patrol the few places where soccer
fans gather. Cars are spotchecked coming into town.
	   Two huge video screens set up so townsfolk and visitors without
tickets can watch the games were covered with tarps for Monday's
England-Romania match. Police fear a repeat performance of a rumble
on the beach at Marseille.
	   ``It's a little silly, isn't it?'' observed Brian Edwards of
Stoke, a peaceable English fan with long experience in soccer
crowds. ``The more you act like you expect trouble, the more likely
you'll provoke it. There're always a few idiots around.''
	   Many Frenchmen who waited years to welcome the world are
beginning to wish everyone would just go home.
	   ``What a mess,'' muttered Christophe Bourgan, a young French
streetsweeper whose crew crisscrossed the Place du Capitole,
picking up beer cans, bottles and half-chewed food by the ton.
``This is worse than the Fete de la Musique.''
	   And this year, even that _ the Fete _was cancelled. Every June
21, French cities and towns celebrate summer soltice with
night-long music festival. Toulouse has one of the best, usually
drawing 100,000 people. But it was called off to avoid possible
trouble.
	   The first violence erupted in Paris even before the games
started. After an elaborate parade, local delinquents got rowdy
with kilted Scots, well-lubricated for their game with Brazil. They
attacked. When police charged, dozens were hurt in a free-for-all.
	   Marseille's running battles followed a similar pattern. Youths
from the tough part of town waved Tunisian flags _ red flags _ at
drunken English fans. A fight started. Police charged, expecting
the usual flight to safety. But the English stood and fought.
	   The German invasion in Lens, with several hundred masked and
well-organized thugs giving Nazi salutes, added a new dimension to
the threat. Police, already on alert, are now tense, ready to
strike firmly and quickly at any sign of trouble.
	   It is not exactly war.
	   In Toulouse, perhaps 10,000 Britons gathered to splash in the
fountains, play football with beer cans in hand, and sing loud,
often rude songs. A favorite was ``Rule Britannia.'' Another
reminded the French that if it weren't for the English, they'd be
Germans.
	   ``C'est magnifique, it's wonderful,'' remarked Serge Miquel, a
dapper Toulouse retiree, as he walked with his wife, Mireille on
his arm. ``All of this life. These splashes of color go well with
the pink stones of Toulouse. Hooligans don't scare us.''
	   At kickoff time approached, however, they got louder, rowdier
and drunker. They pounded on the sides of passing trucks and leaped
onto trucks to wave flags. They were not violent yet it was clear
what any spark might ignite.
	   Andy Coleman and Toby Pollard, insurance brokers from London,
stood in the middle of it, sopping up ale and atmosphere.
	   ``They're just having fun,'' Coleman said, ``and you've got to
let them be.''
	   Last night, he added, lines of riot police ringed the open
square, apparently attempting to contain the fans in manageable
area.
	   ``It was antagonizing, and it was not necessary,'' he said. ``It
just increases the pressure and spoils the fun for everyone. They'd
be better off not doing it again.''

Junior coalition party names its key points for election campaign 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's centrist Free
Democrats, the junior coalition partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, on Monday named the party's key goals and plans to
rejoin Kohl in a coalition if they win in September.
	   Five days before the FDP meets to set their campaign strategy in
Leipzig, Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt said the party will push for
renewal of the German economy with large tax reforms to better the
job market.
	   Faster reconstruction of eastern Germany and more public
spending for research, science, education and apprenticeships, were
also goals of the FDP, Gerhardt said.
	   He said the party would seek to get Germany's system for gaining
citizenship ``modernized.'' Currently there are often years of
bureaucratic delays for foreign residents of Germany to become
citizens.
	   On foreign policy, Gerhardt said the FDP was for the European
Union expanding to take new eastern European states as members, as
long as those countries fulfilled democratic principles.
	   The party also supports international participation of the
German military outside Germany as long as it is done under a U.N.
mandate, Gerhardt said.
	   With German parliamentary elections on Sept. 27 and less than
100 days away, the FDP chief said he will recommend to the party in
Leipzig this weekend to restate its position on rejoining Kohl's
conservatives in another coalition.
	   Some FDP members from northern Schleswig-Holstein state have
said they are against announcing coalition intentions so early in
the campaign and want to wait until August.
	   However, Gerhardt said he wants to clear things up now to
concentrate on the election campaign.
	   Gerhardt said the party's goals should not be taken as
``prerequisites,'' for forming a coalition, but seen as needed
changes the FDP can help push through.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A local newspaper headline screamed,
``Hooliganism: It's Escalating,'' and wary townsfolk scrutinized
strangers in their midst. Those English fans seemed harmless enough
partying on the Place du Capitole. Were they the hooligans?
	   In scattered outbreaks of World Cup violence, real culprits were
hard to miss. German neo-Nazis bludgeoned a policeman in Lens on
Sunday, leaving him near death. English thugs, French-Tunisians and
riot troops have fought pitched battles in Marseille.
	   But beyond the incidents themselves, the fear of potential
conflict has thrown a wet blanket over an international sporting
extravanganza meant to see out the millennium with unprecedented
merriment. Authorities are taking no chances.
	   Marseille at times resembles an armed camp, with metal barriers
closing off sections of the Old Port, where local authorities had
planned night after night of free concerts.
	   Lens, a hardscabble industrial town which lives for soccer, is
still shaken from Sunday's violence that left a policeman comatose
and on a respirator after being battered by German thugs. Lyon,
where only small incidents have been reported, is on alert.
Likewise, Montpellier, where Germany plays Iran on Thursday.
	   In Toulouse, where one in six of the 600,000 inhabitants is a
university student, the bars now close at 11 p.m. An extra 500
police, with heavy riot gear, patrol the few places where soccer
fans gather. Cars are spotchecked coming into town.
	   Two huge video screens set up so townsfolk and visitors without
tickets can watch the games were covered with tarps for Monday's
England-Romania match. Police fear a repeat performance of a rumble
on the beach at Marseille.
	   ``It's a little silly, isn't it?'' observed Brian Edwards of
Stoke, a peaceable English fan with long experience in soccer
crowds. ``The more you act like you expect trouble, the more likely
you'll provoke it. There're always a few idiots around.''
	   Many Frenchmen who waited years to welcome the world are
beginning to wish everyone would just go home.
	   ``What a mess,'' muttered Christophe Bourgan, a young French
streetsweeper whose crew crisscrossed the Place du Capitole,
picking up beer cans, bottles and half-chewed food by the ton.
``This is worse than the Fete de la Musique.''
	   And this year, even that _ the Fete _was cancelled. Every June
21, French cities and towns celebrate summer soltice with
night-long music festival. Toulouse has one of the best, usually
drawing 100,000 people. But it was called off to avoid possible
trouble.
	   The first violence erupted in Paris even before the games
started. After an elaborate parade, local delinquents got rowdy
with kilted Scots, well-lubricated for their game with Brazil. They
attacked. When police charged, dozens were hurt in a free-for-all.
	   Marseille's running battles followed a similar pattern. Youths
from the tough part of town waved Tunisian flags _ red flags _ at
drunken English fans. A fight started. Police charged, expecting
the usual flight to safety. But the English stood and fought.
	   The German invasion in Lens, with several hundred masked and
well-organized thugs giving Nazi salutes, added a new dimension to
the threat. Police, already on alert, are now tense, ready to
strike firmly and quickly at any sign of trouble.
	   It is not exactly war.
	   In Toulouse, perhaps 10,000 Britons gathered to splash in the
fountains, play football with beer cans in hand, and sing loud,
often rude songs. A favorite was ``Rule Britannia.'' Another
reminded the French that if it weren't for the English, they'd be
Germans.
	   ``C'est magnifique, it's wonderful,'' remarked Serge Miquel, a
dapper Toulouse retiree, as he walked with his wife, Mireille on
his arm. ``All of this life. These splashes of color go well with
the pink stones of Toulouse. Hooligans don't scare us.''
	   At kickoff time approached, however, they got louder, rowdier
and drunker. They pounded on the sides of passing trucks and leaped
onto trucks to wave flags. They were not violent yet it was clear
what any spark might ignite.
	   Andy Coleman and Toby Pollard, insurance brokers from London,
stood in the middle of it, sopping up ale and atmosphere.
	   ``They're just having fun,'' Coleman said, ``and you've got to
let them be.''
	   Last night, he added, lines of riot police ringed the open
square, apparently attempting to contain the fans in manageable
area.
	   ``It was antagonizing, and it was not necessary,'' he said. ``It
just increases the pressure and spoils the fun for everyone. They'd
be better off not doing it again.''

Social Democrats picked to form new government quote 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Havel formally asking Zeman to form government,
By ONDREJ HEJMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel asked the
center-left Social Democrats to try to form a new government
Monday, a task complicated by personal animosities and political
divisions among party leaders.
	   Havel gave the winner of last weekend's parliamentary elections
the first chance as expected, in keeping with tradition. But
despite his victory, Milos Zeman is the least likely to succeed.
	   ``I have decided to ask chairman of the Social Democrats ...
Zeman to immediately start political negotiations about the future
coalition,'' Havel told Czech television.

Poppies destroyed in Uzbekistan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly two hectares (five acres) of poppies were
destroyed and 500 criminal cases opened during a two-month
crackdown on drugs in the Central Asian country of Uzbekistan, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Eight hundred civil servants have been disciplined for failing
to have seven hectares (17 acres) of wild hemp destroyed, said
Sergei Kopenkin, head of the anti-drug squad in Uzbekistan's
Interior Ministry.
	   He said that 250 foreigners have been detained for drug-related
crimes during the crackdown known as ``Black Poppy 98.''
	   The former Soviet republics of Central Asia have become a key
route for drug traffickers traveling from Afghanistan to Russia and
Western Europe.

Serb soldiers' morale tested in Kosovo; desertions rise With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The conscript's letter home spoke of
worsening terror in Kosovo _ and a desperation among some Serb
forces that has begun to spread to a disquieted Yugoslav public.
	   ``All in all, it's horrible,'' the soldier wrote, in the letter
quoted Monday by the Belgrade independent daily Nasa Borba, after
his mother brought it to a local paper in the town of Zrenjanin.
	   The final words were especially chilling: ``Don't worry _ if I
were normal, I'd go insane.''
	   After months of a stepped-up offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants in Kosovo, gaping cracks are starting to show in Serb
authorities' attempt to assert control in the secessionist
province, which Serbs call the cradle of their culture.
	   Reports of army desertions and police officers' refusal to serve
in Kosovo are growing. And the controversial nature of the conflict
has prompted parents to take to the streets this month in protests
that are small but significant in the country President Slobodan
Milosevic rules with an authoritarian hand.
	   Milosevic has said the government will fight at all costs to
hold onto the southern province, where the population is 90 percent
ethnic Albanian. But public and military discontent over Kosovo are
growing.
	   ``It's enough to read in the papers that there are many wounded
and killed. Why go there and fight?'' one unidentified army
deserter was quoted in Nasa Borba on Monday as saying.
	   ``It's a civil war there and we never took the oath to fight
against each other,'' said the soldier from Montenegro _ Serbia's
partner in the Yugoslav Federation _ who fled with a group of other
soldiers to escape a possible posting to Kosovo.
	   Two other Yugoslav army soldiers _ both Muslims from Montenegro
_ said Sunday in Albania that they fled the army because of orders
to kill civilians.
	   ``I decided to desert because I didn't want to kill people on
their doorsteps,'' Fahrudin Muric told Associated Press Television
in the northeastern Albanian town of Bajram Curri.
	   Parents of young army conscripts sent to Kosovo protested for
the third time Monday in front of the army general staff
headquarters building in Belgrade.
	   Similar protests have taken place in the towns of Nis and
Kragujevac. Some parents even tried to march on two barracks in
Kosovo this weekend, demanding to see their sons, but were turned
back by army officers.

Iraq's top diplomat lobbies against sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Iraq's top diplomat, Tarik Aziz, lobbied
Monday for Spain's support for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
imposed after the Gulf War .
	   In an interview with the Spanish daily El Pais, Aziz blamed the
United States and Great Britain for blocking world awareness that
Iraq has fulfilled the conditions set by the U.N. for lifting the
sanctions prompted by the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Calling on Spain to ``act independently,'' Aziz said, ``The
United States continues to deny it, but gradually the Security
Council, the European Union and the entire international community
is beginning to understand that Iraq has kept its word.''
	   The United Nations has taken the position it will only lift the
sanctions when Iraq proves it has eliminated all its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi deputy prime minister met Monday with a group of
deputies supportive of his cause, and was due to meet Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar later in the day.
	   Tuesday's schedule includes a meeting with Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes and Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato.
	   In the El Pais interview, Aziz said Spain, Italy and France had
also been hurt by the damage the sanctions caused to trading
relations with Iraq.
	   Spain's Repsol _ along with other oil companies from France,
Italy, Russia and China _ have all been busy planning projects to
develop Iraq's oil fields that they could only pursue if sanctions
were lifted.
	   Wednesday's agenda is dedicated to meetings with other Spanish
political leaders and Arab ambassadors to Spain.
	   Aziz arrived in Madrid from Jordan on Sunday. He was due to
return to Baghdad Thursday, an embassy spokesman here said.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has also sent envoys to Arab,
African and Asia on similar missions.

Eds: UPDATES South Africa item with exhumations completed
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government promised it will speed
the resettlement of black peasants on farms seized from whites in a
bid to persuade squatters to leave private land they have invaded.
	   A total of 104 farms will be handed over to peasants across the
country within about two months, said David Karimanzira, governor
of a province where hundreds of peasants have camped on four
white-owned farms.
	   Most farms will be available before land preparation for the new
agricultural season begins in August, and 12 have been carved up
into plots and will be resettled ``almost immediately,''
Karimanzira said.
	   In a statement to the state-controlled Herald newspaper,
Karimanzira said the government has stepped up its program for the
urgent but ``orderly'' handover of farms.
	   He said 21 farms were available in his Mashonaland East
province.
	   Karimanzira and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai met with
peasant leaders Sunday near the provincial capital of Marondera, 80
kilometers (50 miles) east of Harare.
	   Officials said peasants from the overcrowded Svosve district
nearby agreed to leave the private farms they moved onto during the
past week.
	   Peasants accused the government of delaying land reforms and
bringing villagers from other regions to settle on farms already
seized by the state in their province.
	   Farmers' leaders estimated about 300 peasants were camped on
private land by Sunday. No violence was reported.
	   ------
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations envoy to Angola on
Monday flew to UNITA's central highland stronghold to urge the
leader of the former rebel movement to comply with the latest
deadline for the completion of the country's delayed peace process.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye was seeking to secure UNITA chief Jonas
Savimbi's compliance with Tuesday's deadline for the handover to
the government of four
	   key areas which are still under UNITA control, in contravention
of a 1994 peace pact.
	   The venue for the talks was Andulo, in Bie province, where
Savimbi lives,. The other so-called ``sensitive areas'' are
Nhaeria, also in Bie, and Mungo and Bailundo in Huambo province.
All four lie about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   Lingering hostility between UNITA and the government has slowed
full implementation of the peace accord, which ended a two-decade
civil war.
	   Savimbi has refused to move to the capital Luanda, saying he
fears for his safety.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said it will impose new sanctions
on UNITA,
	   banning its diamond exports and freezing its overseas bank
accounts, unless it complies with all terms of the peace accord by
Tuesday.
	   Under the 1994 agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the 50 percent of the country it seized
during the civil war.
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Municipal security officers on
Monday initially prevented the exhumations of the bodies of three
African National Congress guerrillas who were convicted of sabotage
and conspiracy and were executed in 1964.
	   City security staff demanded the exhumations be halted, claiming
no permission had been sought.
	   Police were called in despite the pleas of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology Deputy Minister Brigitte Mabandla, and two
of the city's mayors. Family members of the dead broke down in
tears and accused the security personnel of racism.
	   ``You took our father from us, why are you doing these things,''
one family member shouted.
	   Later Monday, the exhumations proceeded, with city officials
saying there had been a mixup in communications.
	   Zinakile Mkaba, 35, Vuyisile Mini, 45 and Wilson Khayingo, 38,
were hanged on November 6, 1964.
	   Mini's daughter Nkosazana Mini, 42, said she felt very hurt by
the security staff's actions.
	   She was very young when her father died and the family had
lately been unable to visit his grave due to financial constraints.
	   ``I am so happy that his remains will now be near to home so
that we can visit him often, but I feel so bad about what has
happened. We wanted to do it in a dignified manner,'' she said.
	   The ruling ANC also exhumed the bodies of three other ANC
guerrillas. The six men had stood trial together and all are to be
reburied in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on Saturday.
	   The guerrillas had fought apartheid, the system of white
dominance which ended when the ANC won the country's first all-race
elections in 1994.

Precede JERUSALEM Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback CHANGES byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, details;
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's justice minister says a
non-binding referendum on a West Bank troop withdrawal would force
the hand of opponents to the redeployment _ but the Palestinians
and leading Israelis who back a withdrawal call it a waste of time.
	   Tsahi Hanegbi met Monday with legal advisers and Cabinet
colleagues to discuss the referendum proposal.
	   After the meeting, Hanegbi said he would probably recommend to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he hold a non-binding
referendum that could be organized within 90 days.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Netanyahu's far-right
coalition partners, who have threatened to topple him over a troop
withdrawal.
	   ``The government cannot ignore the results,'' Hanegbi said,
adding that ministers who still opposed the public's wishes after
the vote ``will need to resign.''
	   But the referendum would also further delay Israel from carrying
out a troop withdrawal it committed to in January 1997 and hold up
a peace process the United States is trying to revive.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure to make a quick decision on a U.S.
plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians have accepted the plan.
	   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, called the referendum ``a waste of time.'' ``How can they
ask for a referendum on an agreement they already signed?''
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, also dismissed the referendum as
a stall.
	   ``One of the things that disappoints me the most is that they
took the joy out of the peace,'' Weizman said, a day after he
angrily pulled out of an economic conference reportedly complaining
that he had been misled by Netanyahu about the timing of the
withdrawal.
	   Weizman has little legislative power, but his word carries moral
weight.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a Cabinet moderate,
said he didn't understand the reasoning behind a referendum.
	   ``I think the central aim should be to protect the momentum and
advancement of the process with the Palestinians and as far as a
the referendum goes, I just don't know. In the end, does it aim to
forward the process or are there other reasons?'' he told
reporters.

Ukrainian president cancels trip to Austria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma canceled a trip
to Austria because of political problems at home, the Interfax news
agency reported Monday.
	   Kuchma had been scheduled to attend an economic summit in
Salzburg, where he planned to meet other European leaders.
	   The presidential press service said Kuchma decided to remain in
Kiev, where the Communist-dominated Ukrainian parliament has tried
and failed 10 times to elect a speaker.
	   Various factions have proposed candidates for the post since the
new Verkhovna Rada, elected in March, started its work last month.
But the votes have been blocked by three centrist opposition groups
and the pro-government faction.
	   These factions demand that the entire parliamentary leadership
be elected at once _ an idea rejected by other lawmakers.

World Cup: Colombia wins 1-0 and Tunisia on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Preciado quote
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Substitute Leider Preciado fired the
winner seven minutes from the end as Colombia, who limped home in
dismay from World Cup 1994, stayed in contention for the second
round of France '98 with a nervous 1-0 victory over Tunisia.
	   Preciado took a pass from veteran Carlos Valderrama, shook off
challenges from Sami Trabelsi and Clayton, and prodded the ball
home from 12 meters (yards).
	   The Tunisians, also beaten 2-0 by England, looked almost certain
to drop out of the championship and were certain to go out if
Romania and England tied later Monday.
	   But the late goal sent the Colombian players and bench into wild
celebrations.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' Preciado said. ``Finally we did it. This
victory is important and shows we are doing things well.''
	   The Colombians, then regarded as among the favorites, were
ousted in the opening round of the 1994 World Cup after an own goal
by Andres Escobar led to a 2-1 upset loss to the United States.
When he returned home, Escobar was shot dead in a parking lot
outside a bar at Medellin.
	   After a 1-0 loss to Romania at Lyon, things looked shaky again
for the South Americans.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   But Adolfo Valencia almost gave the South Americans the lead in
the opening when he collected a slick pass from Freddy Rincon, only
for a back-tracking Tunisian to block his 16-meter drive.
	   At the other end, Skander Souayah moved into a wide open
shooting position outside the Colombian penalty area but shot
tamely wide.
	   Souayah had another chance in the 18th minute from a similar
position but still shot wide of the post.
	   The Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from Chokri
el-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Wilmer Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range
header. The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with an acrobatic one-handed
punch over the bar.
	   Four minutes later the 'keeper raced off his line to block an
angled shot from Anthony De Avila with his foot after the Colombian
had broken clear of the Tunisian defense.
	   With the Colombians showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia
broke out to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the
unmarked Mehdi Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header.
Fortunately for the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was
alert and pushed the header onto the post.
	   Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter shot just
too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Bouazizi on the back
of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   The Tunisians went close to taking the lead 10 minutes into the
second half when Souayah fed Ben Slimane in front of goal but
Mondragon managed to block his shot with his legs.
	   Ben Slimane wriggled through the Colombian defense again two
minutes later but Mondragon and a defender managed to scrambled the
ball for a corner.
	   The Tunisians continued to create the better chances and Bel
Slimane managed to get in a right-wing cross despite being crowded
out by three Colombian defenders in the 66th minute only for the
unmarked Zoubeir Baya to volley wide from a good position in front
of goal.
	   The Colombians hit back with a low shot from substitute Preciado
that flashed across the face of the Tunisian goal. Then Victor
Aristizabal arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a right wing
cross from De Avila only for 'keeper El-Oauer to scramble back and
palm his looping header away.
	   At the other end, Mondragon made two reflex-action saves,
blocking a header from Souayah and then a follow up effort from Ben
Slimane.

German police say identified 614 soccer hooligans in France

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More than 600 violence-prone German
soccer hooligans were in France for the World Cup championships,
police said Monday, one day after clashes between German hooligans
and French police left an officer in a coma.
	   Police said they had identified 614 Germans at the World Cup who
were known to have previously started fights or rioted at soccer
games.
	   Police sources also said that as early as Saturday they had
given French authorities information about 180 known German
hooligans in Lens, France, where fighting broke out Sunday during
the 2-2 match between Yugoslavia and Germany.
	   French police used sticks to fight the German hooligans. The
hooligan who attacked an officer with an iron bar, leaving him
comatose, was from the northern city of Hanover. Police identified
him only as being 27 years old _ known to them but not for
violence.
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were arrested. Six of the
Germans were deported and 15 were placed under formal investigation
one step short of being charged. Most were detained for
drunkenness, and were expected to be released later Monday.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the hooligans ``a shame, a real
shame for our entire country.'' He also phoned French President
Jacques Chirac to express ``deepest regret,'' government spokesman
Otto Hauser said.
	   German Interior Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Schumacher said
Monday in Bonn that France had not yet provided the names of those
arrested and therefore German officials did not know if any were
neo-Nazis.
	   The Hamburg constitutional protection office, which keeps tabs
on radical groups, said the neo-Nazi scene ``overlaps'' the soccer
hooligan scene in the Hamburg area.
	   The office declined to say if radical rightists were among those
in France. But it said it had notified authorities in Cologne that
German soccer rowdies were planning violence in France.
	   According to German police observers in France for the World
Cup, overall the hooligans came from 30 different cities, including
60 from Hamburg, and 50 each from Hanover and Cologne.
	   Police observers said the hooligans traveled in small groups in
cars, small vans, campers, and a bus to avoid drawing the attention
of French police.
	   Previously, hooligans have coordinated their travel using mobile
phones and the Internet, a spokesman for North-Rhine Westphalia
state police said.
	   Sunday's violence, however, did not appear to be organized,
German police observers in France said.
	   The hooligans showed up in groups as large as 40. Only after a
ringleader from Hamburg threw a chair and began rioting in a bar
did about 250 Germans join in attacking French police and tried to
force their way to the stadium, police sources said.

British boxing grants first professional licence for women

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ Jane Couch won her three year fight for
recognition by the British Boxing Board of Control on Monday when
she was granted a licence to fight in Britain.
	   The 27-year-old Bristol boxer received her licence after a
battle with the BBBC for professional status which included a
hearing in the sex descrimination tribunal.
	   ``It's just a relief and I'm glad I can now show everyone in
this country what a good fighter I am and let people judge for
themselves,'' she said.
	   Couch, who has been forced to fight in America and on the
European mainland, has attracted interest from several promoters
and could defend her world welterweight title in Britain.
	   With a professional licence now in her hands, she is free to box
on top British bills.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Romania need to improve
economic and cultural ties, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasilie
said Monday as he began a three-day visit to Poland, his first
foreign trip since taking office.
	   Vasilie met with his Polish host, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   Poland, invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
in April 1999, will support aspiration of other countries to do so,
Buzek said.
	   Vasilie said NATO should remain open to more new members,
including Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia.
	   The two countries also plan to cooperate in efforts to join the
European Union. Poland opened access negotiations on March 31.
	   Both leaders praised bilateral political ties as very good, but
said the economic and cultural relations are insufficient. During
his visit, Vasilie hopes to lay a foundation for developing
economic cooperation, to match the countries' potential.
	   Both leaders said that their countries will take efforts to
strengthen democracy and the market economy in central and eastern
Europe and will develop cooperation with Ukraine.
	   Vasilie was also to meet with President Aleksander Kwasniewski,
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and business representatives.
	   On Wednesday, he is to visit the Renaissance southern city of
Krakow.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled into Kosovo _ the latest evidence of the army's
apparently increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, kidnapped three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje just outside the capital Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces trying to crush
secessionist forces in the predominantly Albanian province and
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. On the other side, all terrorist activities
should cease.''
	   Rugova said dialogue is ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   There was no indication Yugoslav officials intended to change
their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials who held separate talks in
Albania's capital Tirana had no comment after their meeting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was similarly mum
after a 30-minute meeting about Kosovo with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel in Denmark, where both were attending the Council of
the Baltic Sea States.
	   Moscow has been appealing to fellow members of the six-nation
Contact Group to give Serbia more time to pull back its estimated
45,000 to 50,000 security forces in Kosovo and to resume
negotiations with ethnic Albanians.
	   But the West is growing increasingly impatient. The U.N.
Security Council planned to discuss Kosovo later Monday. Diplomats
said they were waiting to see whether Russia could squeeze
concessions out of Belgrade.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Vienna, emphasizing that the alliance is determined
to take whatever steps are necessary to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the new U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is expected in the region Tuesday for separate talks with
Milosevic and Rugova.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington
that Holbrooke would be delivering a stern message to Milosevic
that he must pull back his forces and also allow access to
humanitarian organizations.
	   The United States also is becoming increasingly critical of the
ethnic Albanian militants, over whom Rugova has little or no
influence.
	   ``Violence by Kosovo Albanians, with respect to suggestions that
the KLA is about to launch additional measures, only makes a bad
situation worse and perpetuates the cycle of violence,'' Rubin
said.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center quoted witnesses as
saying Albanians with bloody hands and faces and wearing handcuffs
could be seen on three buses leaving Kosovo Sunday. Ethnic
Albanians said they may have been captured in recent fighting.
	   Also, a Danish journalist said Serb police fired 12 bullets into
the armored car of a Danish television crew after the reporters
tried to enter territory dominated by the KLA. Niels Brinch of
Danish TV 2 said no one was injured in the incident near the town
of Glogovac.

Criminalizing prostitution makes it worse, U.N. says 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA KEKES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Criminalizing prostitution only makes
matters worse for women involved, especially those who come from
the post-communist countries of eastern Europe, the U.N.
Commissoner of Human Rights said Monday.
	   The United Nations should get involved in efforts to help the
thousands of eastern European women trapped abroad after arriving
in western Europe, North America, Asia or the Middle East with no
way to get back home and no authorities to turn to, said the
commissioner, former Irish President Mary Robinson.
	   Criminalizing prostitution ``adds to the burden of women who are
already victims,'' she told reporters at the start of a three-day
conference. Over 100 human rights activists from 38 countries were
attending the seminar, focusing on trafficking in women from
eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   According to U.N. estimates, some 4 million people are
trafficked worldwide each year. These include women and men
recruited for forced labor.
	   ``There is an estimated seven billion dollars annual profit in
this market,'' Caldwell said.
	   Countries involved could face pressure from western Europe and
the United States, she said, noting that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright recently raised the issue of trafficking
Ukrainian women to Israel with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

Iraq's top diplomat lobbies against sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Iraq's top diplomat lobbied Monday for
Spain's support for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after the
Gulf War .
	   In an interview with the Spanish daily El Pais, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz blamed the United States and Britain for
blocking world awareness that Iraq has fulfilled the conditions set
by the United Nations for lifting the sanctions prompted by the
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Calling on Spain to ``act independently,'' Aziz said, ``The
United States continues to deny it, but gradually the Security
Council, the European Union and the entire international community
is beginning to understand that Iraq has kept its word.''
	   The United Nations has taken the position it will only lift the
sanctions when Iraq proves it has eliminated all its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi deputy prime minister met Monday with a group of
deputies supportive of his cause, and was due to meet Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar later in the day.
	   Tuesday's schedule includes a meeting with Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes and Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato.
	   In the El Pais interview, Aziz said Spain, Italy and France had
also been hurt by the damage the sanctions caused to trading
relations with Iraq.
	   Spain's Repsol _ along with other oil companies from France,
Italy, Russia and China _ have all been busy planning projects to
develop Iraq's oil fields.
	   Aziz arrived in Madrid from Jordan on Sunday. He was due to
return to Baghdad Thursday, an embassy spokesman here said.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has sent other envoys to Arab,
African and Asian countries on similar missions.

Burundi rebels, government question cease-fire 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Commitment to a ceasefire that is the
centerpiece of a plan to settle Burundi's problems by peaceful
means was questioned Monday, a day after the agreement was reached.
	   A Brussels-based spokesman for the National Council for the
Defense of Democracy (CNDD), the main rebel organization, said the
man who signed Sunday's communique no longer heads the group.
	   Jerome Ndiho claims Leonard Nyangoma had been replaced by Col.
Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. But talks mediator, former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere, continues to recognize Nyangoma as CNDD
leader.
	   ``The accord does not commit the CNDD-FDD,'' said Ndiho. ``If we
are invited in the right way, we will go. Everything they decided
does not commit us.''
	   It was not possible to determine whether CNDD fighters in
Burundi take orders from Nyangoma or Ndayikengurukiye.
	   Officials in Bujumbura, the Burundian capital, also had problems
with the communique, which stated that ``all parties to the
conflict declare a suspension of hostilities to take effect no
later than July 20, 1998.''
	   Government spokesman Luc Rukingama said that the Burundian army
is not a ``party'' and will continue defending all citizens.
	   Rukingama also demanded the immediate lifting of regional
sanctions imposed on Burundi following President Pierre Buyoya's
July 1996 seizure of power.
	   The communique did not mention the sanctions, and Rukingama did
not say whether failure to lift the sanctions would affect future
talks.
	   The plan was reached after a week of preliminary talks in
Arusha, a northern Tanzanian town, attended by Burundi's five main
political parties, three rebel groups and civic and religious
organizations. The next phase is to begin July 20 in Arusha.
	   Buyoya, a former army major who ousted a civilian president in
1996, attended the talks for the first time.
	   Burundi's Tutsi army and Hutu rebels have been fighting for
almost five years, since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir
Ndadaye, a Hutu and the country's first democratically elected
president, in October 1993.
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died since
then.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled into Kosovo _ the latest evidence of the army's
increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, kidnapped three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje just outside the capital Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces trying to crush
secessionist forces in the predominantly Albanian province and
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. On the other side, ``all terrorist activities
should cease.''
	   Rugova said dialogue is ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   There was no indication Yugoslav officials intended to change
their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials who held separate talks in
Albania's capital Tirana had no comment after their meeting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was similarly mum
after a 30-minute meeting about Kosovo with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel in Denmark, where both were attending the Council of
the Baltic Sea States.
	   Moscow has been appealing to fellow members of the six-nation
Contact Group to give Serbia more time to pull back its estimated
45,000 to 50,000 security forces in Kosovo and to resume
negotiations with ethnic Albanians.
	   But the West is growing increasingly impatient. The U.N.
Security Council planned to discuss Kosovo later Monday. Diplomats
said they were waiting to see whether Russia could squeeze
concessions out of Belgrade.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Vienna, emphasizing that the alliance is determined
to take whatever steps are necessary to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the designated U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, is expected in the region Tuesday for separate talks with
Milosevic and Rugova.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington
that Holbrooke would be delivering a stern message to Milosevic
that he must pull back his forces and also allow access to
humanitarian organizations.
	   The United States also is becoming increasingly critical of the
ethnic Albanian militants, over whom Rugova has little or no
influence.
	   ``Violence by Kosovo Albanians, with respect to suggestions that
the KLA is about to launch additional measures, only makes a bad
situation worse and perpetuates the cycle of violence,'' Rubin
said.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center quoted witnesses as
saying Albanians with bloody hands and faces and wearing handcuffs
could be seen on three buses leaving Kosovo Sunday. Ethnic
Albanians said they may have been captured in recent fighting.

World Cup: Italians seek victory to avoid Brazil injury but expected to start; EDITS throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: FIXES dateline; UPDATES with Baggio quotes, Konsel nursing
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Italy and Austria have different
reasons for wanting to win Tuesday's Group B finale.
	   The ``Azzurri,'' who have 4 points in two games, seek first
place to avoid a second-round clash against defending champion and
Group A winner Brazil.
	   Austria, tied with Chile at 2 points, shoots for its first
victory to keep its qualifying chances realistically alive.
	   A draw wouldn't satisfy either team, because that would leave
the Chile-Cameroon game to decide the fates of everyone in the
group.
	   ``It's a vital match for us. Our big advantage is to start as
the underdogs,'' Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said. ``We will
have to beware of their striking force and take advantage of
Italy's possible midfield weakness.''
	   Italian coach Cesare Maldini said he did not expect an overly
offensive game from the Austrians, despite their desperate need for
points.
	   ``I'm sure they will keep their defense tight, hoping to hit
with fast counterattacks,'' Maldini said. ``It'll be a tough game
but we are not thinking to settle with a draw because I expect a
victory of Chile against Cameroon.''
	   Maldini is also worried by Austria's ability to score late
goals. Two second-half injury-time goals gave the Austrians draws
against Cameroon and Chile.
	   ``One good deterrent is to lead 2-0 by the 90th minute,''
Maldini said.
	   Italy, a three-time world champion, showed an improvement in
form and determination in its 3-0 victory against Cameroon
following a difficult start in a draw against Chile.
	   Maldini indicated he may rotate forwards Alessandro Del Piero
and Roberto Baggio during the game, with newcomer Luigi Di Biagio
commanding midfield play and striker Christian Vieri leading the
offense.
	   Del Piero still is not completely healthy and seems unable to
endure a full match after recovering from the thigh strain that
hampered his World Cup preparation.
	   However, he was expected to be on the starting 11 instead of
Baggio, who played all 90 minutes against Chile and 65 minutes
against Cameroon.
	   ``I feel I'll be starting on the substitutes' bench,'' Baggio
said after a late afternoon practice Monday at St. Denis stadium.
	   ``I'll be ready to enter when needed,' added the 31-year-old
veteran striker, who's competing in his third World Cup.
	   For the Austrians, it looked like a psychological problem _
force a defensive-minded team into attack.
	   ``We will have to change our style of play ... and believe we
can win,'' said midfielder Arnold Wettl.
	   Prohaska was expected to start veteran striker Anton Polster in
a partnership with Ivica Vastic, who tallied the equalizer against
Chile coming on as a second-half substitute.
	   Austria's No. 1 goalkeeper, Michael Konsel, was nursing an
Achilles tendon inflammation on the eve of the match, but Austrian
officials said he will be starting.
	   Meanwhile, Austrian midfielder Anton Pfeffer was trying to play
down expectations.
	   ``If we don't get a win,'' he said, ``the world won't
collapse.''

Closing arguments in trial of commander accused of allowing rape

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes prosecutors Monday
sought justice for a Muslim woman, urging U.N. judges to convict a
Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander for ``aiding and abetting''
her rape by letting his subordinates repeatedly attack her.
	   Lawyers presented their closing arguments before the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal in the trial of Anto Furundzija, the first war
crimes case dealing specifically with sexual assault committed
during an interrogation.
	   Furundzija, 28, has been charged with two war crimes for
standing by while a Muslim woman was raped and for failing to stop
it. He has pleaded innocent to these charges and faces a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Tribunal judges did not immediately set a date for their
verdict.
	   Prosecutors say Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as
``The Jokers'' which took part in a campaign by Bosnian Croat
forces to drive Muslims out of central Bosnia's Lasva River Valley
in 1993.
	   Prosecutor Patricia Sellers said the alleged rape victim,
identified in court only as Witness A, was taken to the Jokers'
headquarters in Vitez in May 1993, stripped naked and interrogated
before a group of Furundzija's men.
	   While Furundzija was questioning the woman, another man rubbed a
knife against her thigh and threatened to cut out her vagina.
	   She was later taken to another room and raped in the presence of
Furundzija, who did not stop the incident.
	   The alleged rapist, identified by the names Cicko and Bralo, has
been indicted but not arrested. Officials have not released the
man's real name.
	   ``There was no move to stop ... what was clearly illegal,''
Sellers told the three-judge panel. ``There was no act of
salvation.''
	   Witness A testified in a closed session before the U.N. court
during earlier hearings.
	   ``The threat to kill, the forced nudity, the threat of
mutilation, the rapes ... showed that he (Furundzija) intended to
inflict serious mental harm and commit the crime of torture,'' she
added.
	   Defense lawyer Luka Misetic rebuffed the accusations, saying
Sellers could win an award for the ``best fictional script.''
	   Misetic contended that the prosecution's entire case rests on
the alleged victim's testimony, stressing that there was no other
corroborating testimony.
	   Characterizing the alleged victim as a psychiatric patient,
Misetic said her testimony was unreliable because of her clouded
memory and her susceptibility to outside pressure.
	   ``She has gotten her facts very wrong ... Her reconstruction was
not reliable, let alone, convincing beyond a reasonable doubt,''
said Misetic.
	   ``This case cries out for an acquittal,'' he said.
	   Although Furundzija is a comparatively minor figure from the 3
1/2-year Bosnian conflict, prosecutors at the U.N. court have been
trying to establish case law involving sexual assaults as a war
crime. His trial lasted just six days and involved only eight
witnesses.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has publicly indicted 60 people
and issued an unknown number of secret indictments. There are 28
defendants in custody.

Fiat board endorses appointment of new chairman 
</HEADLINE>
With AP photos
<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Fiat's board of directors gave its official
endorsement Monday to the industrial giant's new chairman of the
board, Paolo Fresco
	   The appointment of Fresco, vice-chairman of General Electric Co,
was announced in January. He will take over at Fiat, Italy's
largest private company, on a full-time basis in October.
	   At a shareholder's meeting Monday, Fresco said that he would
work closely with Chief Executive Paolo Cantarella. He said he
expected the division of labor would be similar to the one that had
existed between Cantarella and the outgoing chairman, Cesare
Romiti.
	   Fresco said he and Cantarella would focus on the creation of
shareholder value, financial transparency and ethics and that they
would do their best to satisfy customers. To a shareholder who
asked whether he should buy Fiat shares, Fresco replied: ``Without
doubt, buy. Not because of me, but because of what Fiat is capable
of doing.''
	   Cantarella told shareholders he was optimistic about the future
of the company and said he would concentrate on strategic
development and finance. He said most of the industrial holding
company's efforts to sell non-strategic assets were complete, and
reiterated Fiat's ability to go it alone in the world car and truck
market.
	   The car division produces Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia models.

WTO adopts report ruling EU innocent of higher charges for computer equipment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ World Trade Organization members on Monday adopted
an appeal panel's decision that the European Union did not wrongly
impose higher import charges on computer network equipment.
	   The appeal panel's decision, which represents the second time
the U.S. has lost a big trade case in the WTO, reverses a finding
that resulted from U.S. complaints of incorrect customs duties.
	   A WTO panel in February had said the European Union was wrong to
classify Local Area Network equipment as telecommunications
apparatus rather than as automatic data processors, which attract
lower customs duties.
	   The equipment is used to link computers in offices and other
small areas. The EU action had the effect of raising the duty on
such imports to 7.5 percent from 3.5 percent.
	   But the European Union appealed and a WTO appeal panel
subsequently found in its favor.
	   U.S. permanent trade representative to the WTO, Rita Hayes, told
a trade meeting in Geneva on Monday that the United States felt the
appeal body's report had not resolved the dispute.
	   It had left ``substantial uncertainty'' among WTO members about
the treatment they could expect to receive in similar future
disputes brought before the WTO, Hayes added.
	   At Monday's meeting, European Union representatives restated the
legal issues behind their appeal.
	   Senior U.S. trade officials had hailed the initial favorable
ruling as a victory in the largest case in dollar terms the United
States had brought before the WTO.
	   The United States put the European market for computer
networking equipment at dlrs 5 billion annually and said that U.S.
companies accounted for 50 percent of those sales.

Precede JERUSALEM Hamas leader to return to Gaza Strip on Tuesday ADDS byline

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The return of Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
the spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, to the
Gaza Strip after four-months of fund-raising, was delayed by at
least 24 hours Monday, a Hamas official said.
	   Israeli security officials at one point considered barring
Yassin from Gaza, but in the end decided that the quadriplegic
sheikh would pose more of a threat abroad than in Gaza where his
activities can be monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Yassin was expected to arrive at the Rafah crossing between
Eygpt and the Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon, said Mohammed
Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank.
	   But Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the visit would be
delayed by at least one day.
	   ``Upon a request from the Egyptians, the return of Sheik Yassin
has been delayed for another 24 hours,'' Zahar told The Associated
Press. Zahar said the delay was in part, to arrange special
transportation and arrival preparations for the ailing Sheik.
	   Yassin had spent the last two weeks in Sudan, waiting for Egypt
to permit him entry.
	   Egypt reportedly waited until Israel officially announced it
would let Yassin return to Gaza. Egypt had feared that if Yassin
got stuck at its border with Gaza, he would be an embarrassment to
the government, which has close ties with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas' popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in
the strip, is seen as a growing threat to Arafat.
	   Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from Egypt.
	   During his trip, the 62-year-old Yassin raised millions of
dollars for Hamas and issued statements supporting armed struggle
against Israel.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled into Kosovo _ the latest evidence of the army's
increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, kidnapped three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje just outside the capital Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces trying to crush
secessionist forces in the predominantly Albanian province and
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. On the other side, ``all terrorist activities
should cease.''
	   Rugova said dialogue is ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   There was no indication Yugoslav officials intended to change
their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials held talks in Albania's capital
Tirana, but no significant developments emerged from the meeting.

Kiriyenko: Russia needs IMF funds to stabilize ruble 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and fend off speculative attacks.
	   ``We're merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central
Bank,'' Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
``This will increase reliability and will make it possible to
rebuff any speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.''
	   Kiriyenko met with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the economic crisis, while IMF
negotiators were headed to Moscow. An expanded Cabinet meeting on
the strategy, chaired by Yeltsin, is scheduled Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the
IMF was making some unacceptable demands. The fund has been
pressing Russia to sharply curtail spending, boost tax collections
and reform its energy sector.
	   ``We will look at and consider the conditions, but it goes
without saying that far from all of the conditions are acceptable
to us,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The ruble fell slightly Monday, closing at 6.217, down from
6.2110, as traders waited for news from the Cabinet meeting and IMF
talks. The stock market also closed 1.3 percent lower.
	   Kiriyenko told reporters that the government program to cope
with the crisis included many unpopular steps, including tightly
reining in government spending, but that the poorest Russians would
be protected.
	   Yeltsin was giving ``maximum support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said.
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials,
including Yeltsin, have sufficient political will to push through
an austerity program.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on the so-called gray economy.
	   He said that the poorest Russians ``pay their 12 percent in
income tax, but a very significant amount that could be paid by the
others never reaches the budget,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``The country cannot exist unless taxes are collected, and it
cannot spend more than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Russia collected less than half the taxes it expected in the
first five months of 1998, said Venyamin Sokolov, auditor of the
parliament-affiliated Accounting Chamber.
	   Russia's budget revenues fell 31 percent short of target in the
same period, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kiriyenko denied that the crisis management program would affect
Russia's long-term plans for financial development, but said that
the world financial crisis could.
	   Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman, confirmed earlier
reports that Russia was seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion
in talks with the IMF.
	   An IMF spokesman said last week that the fund was postponing the
release of a dlrs 670 million installment of an already existing
loan to Russia because the government needed to take further steps
to comply with loan program conditions.
	   In other economic news, Russia's foreign trade was dlrs 55.3
billion for the first five months of this year, down 6 percent from
the same period last year, UTAR-Tass said.
	   Imports grew by 6.5 percent to dlrs 26.3 billion, while exports
fell 15.2 percent to dlrs 29 billion, it said, quoting the
Economics Ministry.
	   Worst hit was the oil industry, suffering from higher production
costs and lower world prices.

No roar from young lions at Open AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to raise details on younger golfers; edits thruout.
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The air of anticipation going into the U.S.
Open was that this would finally be the one.
	   This would be the major championship when Tiger Woods, Ernie
Els, Justin Leonard and David Duval shoot it out down the stretch.
	   As in the three previous Opens at The Olympic Club, the course
provided a scintillating finish. But the young lions of the game
were nowhere to be seen.
	   Instead, there was Lee Janzen, 33, overtaking and then holding
off Payne Stewart, 41. That those two have each won two major
championships yet are not among the marquee names just shows how
many good golfers there are.
	   A year ago, the under-30 crowd won the Masters (Woods), U.S.
Open (Els) and British Open (Leonard).
	   But Mark O'Meara, 41, won the Masters this year. And the best of
the young crowd at Olympic was Duval and Lee Westwood of England,
who finished seven strokes behind Janzen and were never factors.
	   Phil Mickelson was eight back, Jim Furyk was nine behind, Woods
was 10 off the pace, Leonard finished 14 behind and Els, a two-time
Open winner, was 16 back.
	   ``It's very disappointing,'' Els said after his 76 on Sunday.
``I wanted to defend my championship better. I think I've had more
bogeys this week than I've had all year.''
	   Even though Els has won the tournament twice, it was clear that
of the four majors, the U.S. Open is the one in which patience and
experience mean the most.
	   ``I'm still trying to grasp it and learn about how I'm going to
approach it next year,'' said a dazed Duval.
	   Perhaps the one with the most explaining to do is Woods, who
after winning the Masters by 12 strokes last year was perhaps
unfairly expected to contend in every major, if not win them all.
	   But since his Masters win, Woods has played his last 20 rounds
in majors at 19 over par. The only time he has broken 70 was a
3-under 67 in the second round of the U.S. Open at Congressional,
and a 7-under 64 in the third round of the British Open.
	   Since that third round at Royal Troon, Woods has gone 13
straight rounds without breaking 70 at major championships.
	   The only major where he was under par through 72 holes was at
the Masters. He had four rounds in the 70s, but his 3-under 285 was
15 strokes higher than the previous year.
	   Even he seemed somewhat confused.
	   ``I played pretty good this week,'' Woods said. ``I hung in
there. I pitched out. I scrambled from the deep stuff. I just
missed some putts.'
	   But he also lost control at times and even the slightest letdown
in a U.S Open, with its ankle-deep rough, narrow fairways and
brutally fast greens can spell disaster.
	   A perfect example was on the final hole of the tournament. Woods
had a 7-foot (2.13-meter) putt for birdie and walked off the green
with a bogey.
	   Janzen and Stewart are perfect examples of the kinds of players
who do well at the Open. They never try to impose their will on the
course. They take advantage of their opportunities and accept the
consequences of their mistakes.
	   Stewart hit a perfect drive on No. 12 in the final round and
ended up in a sand-filled divot.
	   ``It was the first fairway I had hit in a while and sure enough
I was in a bunker,'' he said.
	   Janzen played the final 15 holes at 4 under par and erased a
seven-stroke deficit.
	   ``Lee Janzen shot a 68,'' Stewart said. ``No one who was in
contention in the golf tournament shot in the 60s today but Lee
Janzen. Give him credit.''
	   The young lions may not have played that well, but this Open did
produce images that will linger.
	   For the fourth consecutive year, Tom Lehman played in the final
group at the U.S. Open, adding a fifth-place finish to his third,
second and third efforts the three previous years.
	   Casey Martin and his cart finished at 291, 11 strokes behind
Janzen. Jack Nicklaus, 58 years old and playing the Open for the
42nd time, was at 295.
	   Amateur Matt Kuchar, who turned 20 on Sunday, was at 289, nine
strokes behind.
	   The last 15 majors have been won by 15 different people. Perhaps
at the British Open next month one of those young lions can break
that streak.

Kournikova withdraws, Sampras, Agassi, Graf win in straight sets
Eds: Updates with Serena Williams win in 15th graf; Corretja,
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost one of its marquee
names on opening day when Anna Kournikova withdrew because of a
thumb injury.
	   While Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles
were among first-round winners Monday, Kournikova said she could
not play because of torn and strained ligaments in her right thumb.
	   She will be unable to play or practice for at least three weeks.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better,''
she said. ``But this morning when I woke up it was very difficult
for me to move the finger.''
	   The 17-year-old Russian, a 1997 Wimbledon semifinalist and No.
12 seed this year, hurt herself last Thursday during one of her
iggest victories _ a three-set win over Graf at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, whose glamour has made her the focus of tabloid
coverage in Britain, skipped the rest of the Eastbourne event in
what was originally described as a ``precautionary'' move. But
further checks revealed a more serious injury.
	   Kournikova was replaced in the draw by American ``lucky loser''
Lilia Osterloh.
	   ``I'm very sad about it,'' she said. ``This is my favorite
tournament. I feel like I could do well on grass. I was getting
ready for it the whole year.''
	   It was also an emotionally draining day for Graf and Seles. Graf
followed Sampras on Centre Court and beat Spain's Gala Leon Garcia
6-4, 6-1. The No. 4 seed is playing her 13th Wimbledon, but her
first in two years and her first Grand Slam since major knee
surgery a year ago.
	   Graf, saying she thought of retiring two months ago as injuries
slowed her comeback, broke down in tears during her news
conference.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' she said. ``It's just special to be here.''
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, downed Spain's Maria Antonio Sanchez
Lorenzo 6-3, 6-4.
	   Seles, whose career was disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, is
coming off her inspiring run to the French Open final earlier this
month, just three weeks after the death of her father Karolj.
	   ``Right now, for the past four weeks, for the first time in my
life, I have time to focus on tennis,'' she said. ``I enjoy just
playing again.''
	   In her first Wimbledon appearance, 16-year-old Serena Williams
beat Italy's Laura Golarsa 6-4, 6-3, closing out the match with a
forehand winner. Sister Venus, the No. 7 seed, plays Tuesday
against Jana Nejedly.
	   In a change from last year, the wettest Wimbledon on record, the
112th championships started in sunshine and 70 degree (19 c)
temperatures. Dark clouds appeared in mid-afternoon but the skies
cleared again by early evening.
	   Sampras opened play on Centre Court with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory
over Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty, a performance that belied the poor
results that have cast doubt on Sampras' chances of defending his
title.
	   ``If you can't get up for an event like this, you shouldn't be
playing,'' said the top-seeded American, seeking his fifth
championship in six years. ``This place over the years has brought
out the best in me. You get more keyed up, more fired up, going out
there at 2 o'clock on Monday. Over the years, it's been treating me
pretty well.''
	   Sampras served an ace on the first point, closed the first set
with another ace and was never troubled. He finished with 17 aces
and eight double faults.
	   The most entertaining moment came after Sampras nailed Hrbaty in
the thigh with a service winner in the fourth game of the second
set. Waiting to return on the next point, Hrbaty held up his racket
in front of his body as mock protection, drawing laughter from
Sampras and the spectators.
	   Within seconds of Sampras winning his match, 1992 champion
Agassi completed a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory on Court 1 over Spain's
Alex Calatrava.
	   Wearing a long-sleeved white shirt, Agassi was in full control
from the baseline. Calatrava, who received treatment on his left
knee in the second set, ended the match with a double fault.
	   It was a convincing performance by the 13th-seeded Agassi, who
has soared in the rankings since dropping to No. 141 last November.
He has been bothered recently by a shoulder injury.
	   ``Even though I was out playing I wasn't there 100 percent,''
Agassi said. ``I had my energy elsewhere in a lot of cases. I need
to take it up another level in this tournament. I'm ready to do
that.''
	   The highest women's seed playing Monday was No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport, who cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Argentina's
Florencia Labat.
	   The first seed to lose was No. 11 Mary Pierce, with her latest
Grand Slam flop a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 defeat to Elena Tatarkova of
Ukraine.
	   The first men's seed eliminated was No. 10 Alex Corretja, the
French Open runner-up from Spain. He lost in straight sets to
American Justin Gimelstob, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 6-3.
	   In another defeat for a clay-court specialist, 1997 French Open
champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil was ousted by Australia's Jason
Stoltenberg in a five-set marathon, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 4-6, 10-8.
	   In an early match, third-seeded Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, defeated Spain's Javier Sanchez 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Looking at
home on the grass, the Czech left-hander served 16 aces and showed
he could be among the top challengers.
	   As defending champion, Sampras had the honor of starting play on
Centre Court, which has new grass for the first time in 40 years.
	   The American has lost his aura of invincibility since trouncing
Cedric Pioline in last year's final. He lost in the fourth round at
the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and
the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles he needs just two more to equal Roy Emerson's record.

FIFA says no teams will be kicked out; Romania wins AP Sports Writer

By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Poor results, not poor fans, will get a team sent
home early from the World Cup.
	   Proclaiming that ``we are not afraid,'' FIFA's new president on
Monday ruled out expelling any team from the Cup because of fan
violence.
	   ``I said no. You can't have this,'' Sepp Blatter said after an
emergency FIFA meeting. ``We are not afraid, we are concerned. We
have observed it and we are stronger. This World Cup can't be
disturbed again. We must stay here and play the games.''
	   Blatter words were the crest of wave of tough talk from three
nations struggling to deal with the problem before it overwhelms
the world's biggest sporting event.
	   German hooligans were called ``rioters, fanatics, and fascists''
by French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement while French
President Jacques Chirac called their behavior ``unacceptable''.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said they were ``a scandal for our
nation.'' British government officials also condemned the violence.
	   Chevenement's comments were directed at the highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis who rampaged through Lens before and after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia game, leaving a policeman in a coma
after being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   ``If it would have meant saving the policeman from his injuries,
I would rather have lost the match,'' said German coach Berti
Vogts. The game ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   The victim is Daniel Nivel, 44, who collapsed unconscious in a
pool of blood on the sidewalk. A hospital spokeswoman said his
condition didn't improve Monday.
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking the Nivel. His name wasn't released.
	   Germany played down suggestions it was considering pulling out
of the tournament because of the Lens violence.
	   ``It might be that in the first moments of shock, the question
of a measured reaction, possibly a withdrawal, was hinted at or
raised,'' said German federation spokesman Michael Novak. ``But
within the delegation there were no serious considerations to
withdraw the team.''
	   One of the teams on the verge of an early exit because of
performance is Tunisia, which lost 1-0 Monday to Colombia on
substitute Leider Preciado's goal in the 83rd minute. A victory or
a tie for Romania against England on Monday night would make the
Tunisians the sixth team eliminated.
	   The victory kept Colombia in the running to advance, which would
mark a huge turnaround following their first-round exit in 1994.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' Preciado said. ``Finally we did it. This
victory is important and shows we are doing things well.''
	   The England-Romania match in Toulouse was another flashpoint for
potential fan trouble. English fans clashed with police over three
days surrounding the England-Tunisia game last week in Marseille.
	   French police, aided by their English counterparts, were
deporting known hooligans spotted in Toulouse before they could
cause any trouble.
	   ``I was doing absolutely nothing wrong,'' England fan Terence
Coughlin, who has a previous arrest for soccer-related violence,
said after he was handcuffed and sent home to Manchester. ``I do
not go to football for violence. I am not a football thug.''
	   After the emergency FIFA meeting, Blatter called on the European
Union to do more to prevent known soccer thugs from easily crossing
borders.
	   He said FIFA would pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking
greater cooperation with political authorities, including those of
the European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the
reputation of football and for the introduction of new legal
measures to achieve this.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States, Louise Woodward said she was made a
scapegoat for the death of a baby in her care because authorities
had to find someone to blame.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview scheduled for broadcast Monday night.
Excerpts were broadcast earlier on BBC television news.
	   But in an e-mail sent Monday to the BBC, the Massachusetts
police officer who arrested and questioned Ms. Woodward accused her
of ``absolute child abuse.''
	   Det. Sgt. William Byrne of the Newton Police Department, who
gave several hours of testimony for the prosecution at Ms.
Woodward's trial, said he could no longer remain silent about his
belief that Ms. Woodward caused the death of 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen.
	   ``Why is it so hard for many people to realise that this is
absolute child abuse? It happens every day here in America and in
England,'' he wrote. ``If this girl (Louise Woodward) was a big
unattractive woman with no teeth and tattoos, would the public have
had a different opinion as to whether or not she was guilty?''
	   The baby's family was not immediately available for comment on
Ms. Woodward's remarks to the BBC.
	   But the attorney representing the Eappens in a civil suit
against Ms. Woodward said the young woman ``already told her story
and was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, a judge
and seven justices of the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
	   ``It is obvious she is now more interested in her celebrity
status than the truth,'' said attorney Fredric Ellis.
	   Prosecutors claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to Britain
on Thursday convicted of manslaughter, shook baby Matthew to death
in February 1997. She has always maintained her innocence.

Italian chamber prepares for vote on NATO expansion expansion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: updates throughout with center-right saying will vote for NATO
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on Monday pleaded
with lawmakers to put aside their differences and vote in favor of
NATO's expansion eastward into Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic.
	   The center-left government goes into the vote, scheduled for
Tuesday, struggling to muster a majority in the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house.
	   Its usual ally, the Communists, oppose NATO expansion, and
internal politics have muddied the prospects of support from other
potential allies on the issue.
	   On Monday night, however, the leader of the center-right
opposition, media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, told state television
that his alliance had decided to vote in favor of NATO expansion.
	   But he also said that a government that needed opposition
support to win such a crucial vote should resign.
	   The Communists have said they'll back the government if a
confidence vote is called, so the chances of the government
collapsing over the NATO spat are slim.
	   The Senate has already ratified the expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 countries in NATO as well as the three
membership candidates.
	   In his speech to the chamber, Dini called NATO expansion a
``huge strategic choice'' for Italy that deserves approval ``by a
large consensus.''
	   ``Who could take on the moral responsibility, even more
important that the political one, to reject these countries, to
throw them into a condition of permanent precariousness?'' he
asked.
	   ``At times in parliament we've had differing visions on the
country's foreign policy, different even among members of the
majority,'' he acknowledged.
	   But, he went on, ``this has not prevented us from conducting a
strong, credible and coherent foreign policy, anchored to what we
felt were Italy' priorities.''

Prime minister promises Reggae Boyz will be contenders again 
</HEADLINE>
By LLOYD WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister promised that
the national soccer team, eliminated Sunday from the World Cup
competition in France, would be a contender again.
	   The team, named the Reggae Boyz, was forced out of the running
with a 5-0 drubbing by Argentina. But Prime Minister Percival
Patterson predicted the team would improve, noting it only recently
went professional.
	   ``When the West Indies started to play cricket, we were known as
the calypso cricketers and it was not long before we became the
best in the world,'' he said in news release on Monday. ``We have
started out (in soccer) being known as the reggae team; we intend
to be the best in the world.''
	   It won't be easy _ Coach Rene Simoes, a Brazilian credited with
much of the team's success, has said he will leave the team in
October. He said he was leaving because he was angry that a local
newspaper disclosed his dlrs 220,000 salary.
	   Simoes has also been criticized for replacing native Jamaicans
with British players of Jamaican descent. On Monday, some Jamaican
sports commentators and callers on radio shows blamed the switches
for the team's loss.
	   Patterson said the team's presence had already paid off in
publicity for the island. The government based a tourism
advertising campaign around the team, complete with a theme song,
licensed sportswear and a 50-foot-high (15-meter-high) inflatable
soccer ball that toured Europe and New York.
	   The Reggae Boyz play against Japan on Friday, but a win would
not give them enough points to rejoin competition.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ First, there was a champagne toast. Then
the ambassadors of the United States and five European countries
left Belarus on Monday in a diplomatic crisis over sewer repairs.
	   ``I propose a toast to our speedy return,'' French Ambassador
Bernard Fassier said, holding a glass aloft on the porch of the
embassy building shared by Britain and Italy.
	   With that, he and the other ambassadors drove to the airport and
boarded a plane to Frankfurt, Germany, after lodging a strongly
worded protest with the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.
	   The government has been trying for several weeks to evict the
ambassadors from their homes in a wooded suburb of Minsk that,
officials say, urgently needs repairs to its sewer and plumbing
system.
	   The ambassadors maintain that the ouster violates the
international rules of diplomacy. Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko says they're creating a tempest in a sewer.
	   ``I am surprised that such a common problem of daily life is
being brought to such a high political level,'' he told reporters.
``I am an easily available person. ... I am always willing to start
a dialogue.''
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry called the ambassadors'
departure ``unjustified'' and said Belarus ``remains loyal to the
principles of international law.''
	   Besides diplomats from the United States, Britain and France,
the ambassadors of Greece, Italy and Germany left Minsk on Monday.
In a show of solidarity, the departing ambassadors were accompanied
to the airport by their counterparts from Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland
and Lithuania.
	   Both the Polish and Bulgarian ambassadors have been summoned
home, and others are expected to go as well. It is not clear how
many of the 22 ambassadors who live at the disputed Drozdy
diplomatic compound remain.
	   Led by the authoritarian Lukashenko, Belarus is perhaps the most
Soviet of all post-Soviet countries, with a penchant for stirring
trouble with the West.
	   But nothing Lukashenko has done before has created quite such a
stir in diplomatic circles as his decision to order the ambassadors
out of their homes.
	   ``He's driving his country further into isolation and is hurting
human rights and contract law,'' German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in a television interview Monday.
	   On Friday, the government cut water and power supplies and had
ditches dug inside the compound's gates, which prevented cars from
entering.
	   Before leaving Monday, British Ambassador Jessica Mary Pearce
told the Foreign Ministry that Belarus' ambassadors to EU countries
should return to Minsk ``to convey in the strongest terms the
disapproval of EU governments.''
	   Germany has already asked the Belarusian ambassador to go home.
	   Russia has not recalled its ambassador. However, it sent Kremlin
emissary Boris Berezovsky to Minsk to meet with Lukashenko on
Monday.
	   After the meeting, Lukashenko said he was ready to start a
dialogue with the governments that had recalled their ambassadors,
adding that he thought it was possible to reach a compromise.
	   The government has already offered the ambassadors new
apartments in downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or
plots on which to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko is not known as a master of diplomatic nuance. After
telling the ambassadors at one point that they could stay, he had
signs posted outside their homes proclaiming them to be the
property of the Belarusian president.
	   Fassier, the French ambassador, had his revenge on Monday. He
posted a sign on the door to his home containing the text, in
Russian and French, of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
protocol.

Facts about Kosovo With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Kosovo, the Serbian province torn by fighting:
	    &UR; ___
	   LAND: A province of southwestern Serbia, which is the dominant
republic left in Yugoslavia. It is 10,887 square kilometers (4,200
square miles), about the size of Belgium, and borders Albania and
Macedonia. The central area around the capital, Pristina, is
lowlands, with mountains elsewhere.
	   PEOPLE: About 2.2 million. Ninety percent ethnic Albanian, 10
percent Serb.
	   HISTORY: Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their history and
culture, with numerous Orthodox monasteries. Serbs lost a decisive
battle against the Turkish empire in Kosovo in 1389. Ethnic
Albanians say they are descendants of the ancient Illyrians who
were Kosovo's first inhabitants.
	   POLITICS: Kosovo was part of Serbia in the Communist-run
Yugoslav Federation. In 1974 the province won almost absolute
autonomy; but in 1989, then-Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
abolished that and introduced virtual martial law. Ethnic Albanians
responded by establishing a parallel state.
	   INDEPENDENCE DRIVE: Most ethnic Albanians advocate independence
for Kosovo, but Serbia rejects that and world powers oppose it for
fear a border change would trigger a wider Balkans war. The Kosovo
Liberation Army, a shadowy force of ethnic Albanians that emerged
in 1996, has gained strength and popularity amid growing
frustration with lack of results by political leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   VIOLENCE: More than 200 people were killed in sporadic clashes
from 1989-1997, and at least 300 more were killed this year. About
45,000-50,000 police or Serb-led Yugoslav army forces are deployed
in Kosovo.

Turkey reveals special unit to investigate radical Islam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AGRI, Turkey (AP) _ Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu revealed
on Monday that his ministry has set up a special unit to
investigate radical Islamic groups, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The group is composed of 10 investigators and has been at work
for the past six months, he said, according to Anatolia.
	   ``We have set up a special group to follow fundamentalist
activities,'' Basesgioglu was quoted as saying.
	   The powerful pro-secular military has been pressuring the
government to crack down on radical Islam, which it calls a threat
to national security.
	   On Monday, police arrested 12 people and charged them with
wearing Islamic attire. Anatolia said the arrests were sparked by a
report in the newspaper Hurriyet that radical Islamic groups were
getting weapons training.
	   The 12 suspects had guns, Anatolia said, but they turned out to
be legal air guns, so police charged them with wearing turbans,
which is illegal for laymen under Turkish law.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A labor strike against the
privatization of Puerto Rico's telephone company escalated Monday,
with students, workers and riot police clashing in the capital, San
Juan.
	   Ten people, including four police officers, were injured in
picket-line clashes.
	   ``Organized sabotage'' of phone lines cut service to 75,000
customers, said Carmen Ana Culpeper, president of the Puerto Rico
Telephone Company.
	   Some 6,400 unionized employees began striking Thursday to stop
the government from selling control of Puerto Rico Telephone, known
locally as Telefonica, to private investors for dlrs 1.9 billion.
U.S. communications giant GTE Corporation, the lead investor, has
promised there will be no immediate layoffs.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale last week. The House of
Representatives is expected to vote Wednesday.
	   On Monday, police clubbed strikers who tried to keep managers
from reporting to work in Guaynabo, a San Juan suburb. Four
protesters were injured, including one bloodied picketer who was
knocked unconscious.
	   A union delegate said police attacked without warning. Police
said officers reacted when a worker ``pulled a weapon'' as managers
tried to enter the building.
	   Four police officers and two protesters were hurt in a scuffle
in the Hato Rey banking district.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo reacted angrily, saying ``delinquent''
students started the violence to show their support of the workers.
``The abuse stops here,'' he said. ``If the unions want to
negotiate, we will negotiate. But we will not permit attacks on our
police officers.''
	   Culpeper charged that ``leftist students and other professional
strikers'' had taken over the protest from the two striking labor
unions and that strikers were harassing managers by following them
home.
	   Some managers found their electricity turned off at home,
indicating other state-owned utility workers were joining the
protest, Culpeper said.
	   State water and electricity workers blocked traffic on busy
highways Monday by slowly driving heavy equipment to Telefonica
headquarters.
	   On Friday, a bank reported that at least 130 of its 750
automated bank teller machines were not working.

Kournikova withdraws, Sampras, Agassi, Graf win in straight sets
Eds: Updates with Kafelnikov ousted
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost two title contenders on
opening day when Anna Kournikova withdrew because of a thumb injury
and Yevgeny Kafelnikov was ousted in the first round.
	   While Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles
were among winners Monday, Kournikova said she could not play
because of torn and strained ligaments in her right thumb.
	   She will be unable to play or practice for at least three weeks.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better,''
she said. ``But this morning when I woke up it was very difficult
for me to move the finger.''
	   The 17-year-old Russian, a 1997 Wimbledon semifinalist and No.
12 seed this year, hurt herself last Thursday during one of her
biggest victories _ a three-set win over Graf at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, whose glamour has made her the focus of tabloid
coverage in Britain, skipped the rest of the Eastbourne event in
what was originally described as a ``precautionary'' move. But
further checks revealed a more serious injury.
	   Kournikova was replaced in the draw by American ``lucky loser''
Lilia Osterloh.
	   ``I'm very sad about it,'' she said. ``This is my favorite
tournament. I feel like I could do well on grass. I was getting
ready for it the whole year.''
	   Another Russian, seventh-seeded Kafelnikov, lost on Centre Court
to big-serving Australian Mark Philippoussis, 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1),
6-4, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, winner of a Wimbledon warmup tournament in Germany,
posseses an all-court game that made him one of the top title
challengers. British bookmakers had rated him and Richard Krajicek
as joint second favorites at 6-1 behind Sampras.
	   Philippoussis, who had considered skipping Wimbledon after a
series of early-round defeats this year, served 21 aces and had 14
double faults. But it was Kafelnikov's serve which was the real
story _ he served 22 double faults.
	   ``I haven't had a great year but there is no reason I can't win
this tournament,'' Philippoussis said.
	   It was an emotionally draining day for Graf and Seles. Graf
followed Sampras on Centre Court and beat Spain's Gala Leon Garcia
6-4, 6-1. The No. 4 seed is playing her 13th Wimbledon, but her
first in two years and her first Grand Slam since major knee
surgery a year ago.

U.S. and other diplomats leave Belarus for consultations

return, TRIMS pvs.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ First, there was a champagne toast. Then
the ambassadors of the United States and five European countries
left Belarus on Monday in a diplomatic crisis over sewer repairs.
	   ``I propose a toast to our speedy return,'' French Ambassador
Bernard Fassier said, holding a glass aloft on the porch of the
embassy building shared by Britain and Italy.
	   With that, he and the other ambassadors drove to the airport and
boarded a plane to Frankfurt, Germany, after lodging a strongly
worded protest with the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.
	   The government has been trying for several weeks to evict the
ambassadors from their homes in a wooded suburb of Minsk that,
officials say, urgently needs repairs to its sewer and plumbing
system.
	   The ambassadors maintain that the ouster violates the
international rules of diplomacy. Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko says they're creating a tempest in a sewer.
	   ``I am surprised that such a common problem of daily life is
being brought to such a high political level,'' he told reporters.
``I am an easily available person. ... I am always willing to start
a dialogue.''
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry called the ambassadors'
departure ``unjustified'' and said Belarus ``remains loyal to the
principles of international law.''
	   Besides diplomats from the United States, Britain and France,
the ambassadors of Greece, Italy and Germany left Minsk on Monday.
In a show of solidarity, the departing ambassadors were accompanied
to the airport by their counterparts from Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland
and Lithuania.
	   Both the Polish and Bulgarian ambassadors have been summoned
home, and others are expected to go as well. It is not clear how
many of the 22 ambassadors who live at the disputed Drozdy
diplomatic compound remain.
	   Led by the authoritarian Lukashenko, Belarus is perhaps the most
Soviet of all post-Soviet countries, with a penchant for stirring
trouble with the West.
	   But nothing Lukashenko has done before has created quite such a
stir in diplomatic circles as his decision to order the ambassadors
out of their homes.
	   ``He's driving his country further into isolation and is hurting
human rights and contract law,'' German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said in a television interview Monday.
	   Germany asked the Belarusian ambassador to go home, and the
United States told Belarus not to send its ambassador back to
Washington. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
United States may take other ``proportionate responses.''
	   On Friday, the Belarusian government cut water and power
supplies and had ditches dug inside the compound's gates, which
prevented cars from entering.
	   The government has offered the ambassadors new apartments in
downtown Minsk, cottages 20 miles outside Minsk or plots on which
to build new residences.
	   Lukashenko is not known as a master of diplomatic nuance. After
telling the ambassadors at one point that they could stay, he had
signs posted outside their homes proclaiming them to be the
property of the Belarusian president.
	   Fassier, the French ambassador, had his revenge on Monday. He
posted a sign on the door to his home containing the text, in
Russian and French, of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
protocol.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities on Monday blamed squads of
German ``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks that left a
policeman in a coma and fighting for his life after being clubbed
with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   Doctors later released a statement saying the multiple fractures
in his skull showed he'd suffered ``repeated violent blows from a
massive object.'' They said they hadn't yet decided whether to
operate.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge on Tuesday afternoon.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault on the policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged.
	   A German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in
connection with soccer violence, French news reports said Monday
evening. No further details were immediately available.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, about 1,800 police were
deployed to guard against trouble during the match between England
and Romania.
	   Two huge video screens, originally meant to bring the game to
ticketless fans, were coverd over with tarps, with police fearing a
repeat of last week's scuffles in Marseille.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But he said the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounced ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''
	   FIFA issued a five-step plan to try to quell the violence. At
its heart: a pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking greater
cooperation with political authorities, including those of the
European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the reputation
of football...''
	   FIFA also flatly rejected an informal suggestion by the German
soccer federation that the team withdraw from the Cup.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the German hooligans were
``for the most part sober,'' and ``perfectly organized with means
of communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.

Six dead in Yemen protests over price hikes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with official news agency reporting three deaths
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday in two Yemeni
cities to quell escalating protests against a 40 percent hike in
fuel prices. Four people were killed and 10 injured, witnesses
said.
	   Two others were killed in similar shooting Sunday in Arhab, a
suburb of the capital, San`a, witnesses said Monday.
	   An opposition group, however, claimed at least nine people were
killed in the two days of violence, but this could not be
independently confirmed. Police confirmed three deaths in Monday's
violence, the official SABA news agency reported.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Monday's rioting was the fourth straight day of protests in the
poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula following Friday's hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and a
security personnel was injured, the SABA news agency said quoting
police. Witnesses said three people were injured.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who took office last month.
	   Demonstrators also clashed with riot police in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. SABA said two people were killed and four were injured
in Marib.
	   Witnesses said police arrested at least 20 people.
	   However, a statement by the London-based National Opposition
Front said that six people were killed in Marib.
	   It made no mention of the Taiz violence but said three people
were killed in Arhab, the capital's suburb, on Sunday. The Front's
statement was faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The price hikes were scheduled for January. But the government
was forced to delay them because of conflicts over political and
economic policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem
and President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in Yemen.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than a year in office, was replaced
by al-Iryani in May.
	   A demonstration by hundreds of university students Monday was
dispersed by club-wielding police who fired into the air. Three of
the demonstration's leaders were arrested. Authorities closed San`a
University Monday and deployed anti-riot police on campus.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

PRECEDE Chicago Jackson won't return as Bulls coach AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Jackson confirmation
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   DEERFIELD, Illinois (AP) _ Phil Jackson said his last goodbyes
to the Chicago Bulls on Monday, clearing out his office and driving
off on his red-and-black motorcycle.
	   ``I'm not going to speak about `could have, would have, should
have,' '' he said at the team's practice facility. ``It was time to
go. I've been pushing at this horn a little bit the last couple of
years about leaving and being ready to leave.
	   ``It's my time to go. It's the right time.''
	   And the coach had it in writing. He climbed on his motorcycle _
signed by all his players _ for one last ride home.
	   Jackson had said all year that this season, his ninth, was his
last. Even after the Bulls won their sixth National Basketball
Association championship in eight years, the coach turned down an
offer from Chicago chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for one more
year.
	   Despite his often strained relations with general manager Jerry
Krause, Jackson said he was leaving because it was his time and he
wanted to go out on top. He doesn't have another job, and he has no
other plans right now except to leave later this week for a
vacation in Turkey with his wife, June, and former New York Knicks
teammate and U.S. senator Bill Bradley.
	   ``I don't know if there is a basketball challenge,'' Jackson
said of his future. ``I'll have to wait and see if one presents
itself.''
	   Reinsdorf and Krause were both at the Bulls practice facility,
but neither was available. Team spokesman Tim Hallam said a
statement would be released later this afternoon.
	   Jackson's departure wasn't a surprise to his players, Bill
Wennington said. The team had dinner at Michael Jordan's restaurant
after a citywide celebration in Grant Park last Tuesday, and
Wennington said it was understood Jackson was leaving.
	   ``It was real liberating for all of us,'' Jackson said. ``One of
the things we said last week was that we were going to support each
other with whatever decisions we have to make because it's a
personal time now and people have to do that for themselves.
	   ``Whatever paths people may have to take, one thing they can't
take away from us is the bonds we've made together winning these
championships.''

World Cup: Colombia wins 1-0 and puts Tunisia on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional, recasts, ADDS more quotes
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ It wasn't the prettiest goal of the
World Cup. But it meant so much to Colombia.
	   Leider Preciado's strike seven minutes from the end lifted the
tension and eased some of the pain of a soccer tragedy four years
ago.
	   The substitute's goal gave Colombia a 1-0 victory over Tunisia
Monday to open a route to round two _ something it failed to reach
in the United States in 1994.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' said Preciado, who took a pass from veteran
Carlos Valderrama, shook off challenges from Sami Trabelsi and
Clayton, and miskicked the ball home from 12 meters (yards).
	   ``Finally we did it. This victory is important and shows we are
doing things well.''
	   Now it's down to a showdown with England on Friday and Colombia
could be in round two.
	   Regarded as among the favorites four years ago, the Colombians
were ousted in the opening round after an own goal by Andres
Escobar led to a 2-1 upset loss to the United States. When he
returned home, Escobar was shot dead in a parking lot outside a bar
at Medellin.
	   After four years in the gloom, now there's something for the
Colombians to look forward to.
	   ``We're still on course for the final,'' said an optimistic
coach, Hernan Dario Gomez.
	   ``As far as our next match against England is concerned, we're
going to do our very best. We're a very unified team.''
	   The Tunisians, also beaten 2-0 by England, looked almost certain
to drop out of the championship and were certain to go out if
Romania and England tied later Monday.
	   ``We didn't deserve to win,'' said Tunisia's Polish coach, Henry
Kasperczak. ``We had a lot of scoring chances but we didn't take
advantage of them and that's our great regret. We need players who
score when the situation presents itself.''
	   After a 1-0 loss to Romania at Lyon, things looked shaky again
for the South Americans.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   The Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from Chokri
el-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Wilmer Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range
header. The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with an acrobatic one-handed
punch over the bar.
	   With the Colombians showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia
broke out to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the
unmarked Mehdi Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header.
Fortunately for the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was
alert and pushed the header onto the post.
	   Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter shot just
too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Riadh Bouazizi on the
back of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   The Tunisians continued to create the better chances and Bel
Slimane managed to get in a right-wing cross despite being crowded
out by three Colombian defenders in the 66th minute only for the
unmarked Zoubeir Baya to volley wide from a good position in front
of goal.
	   The Colombians hit back with a low shot from substitute Preciado
that flashed across the face of the Tunisian goal. Then Victor
Aristizabal arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a right wing
cross from De Avila only for 'keeper El-Oauer to scramble back and
palm his looping header away.
	   At the other end, Mondragon made two reflex-action saves,
blocking a header from Souayah and then a follow up effort from Ben
Slimane.
	   Lineups:
	   Tunisia_Chokri el-Oauer; Tarek Thabet (Kaies Godhbane, 77th),
Ferid Chouchane, Clayton, Sami Trabelsi; Riadh Bouazizi,

World Cup: Coach says two players had to go, but some disagree 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9-10 with Augustine apology in statement
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Two South African players who received the
ultimate World Cup red card left for home Monday. Yet the
controversy stayed with their teammates before their final Group C
clash with winless Saudi Arabia.
	   Midfielders Brendan Augustine and the aptly named Naughty
Mokoena said nothing when they left after being suspended for the
rest of South Africa's first World Cup for staying out partying
until dawn Sunday.
	   Coach Philippe Troussier, who pushed for the suspension, said it
was the right decision and supported by the rest of the team.
	   ``I cannot accept this kind of attitude,'' Troussier said after
the team trained for two hours Monday. ``I think these two players
did not deserve to play for South Africa.''
	   But some players said sending home Augustine, who started both
World Cup matches so far, and Mokoena, a reserve unlikely to play,
was too harsh.
	   ``I don't buy the idea that they should be sent home,'' said
midfielder John Moshoeu of Fenerbahce, at 31 the team's most
experienced veteran with 46 internationals. ``They are part of the
family. In life we have to deal with problems. They should find
another way to discipline them and solve the problem.''
	   Augustine, 26, of Lask Linz, was replaced in both World Cup
matches and his starting role appeared in jeopardy. He joined the
nonstarters for a practice match against a Vichy side on Saturday.
	   ``That hurt Brendan,'' said Delron Buckley of Vfl Bochum, who
may start in Augustine's place.
	   In a statement released by his lawyer, Augustine apologized to
Troussier, the team, his family and the country for ``letting them
down at such a crucial stage in the World Cup.''
	   ``Although there were a number of factors that led to me
breaking the curfew, my behavior was unprofessional and unnecessary
and I sincerely regret having done this,'' his statement said.
	   Goalkeeper Hans Vonk of Heerenveen F.C. said the suspensions
would harm South Africa's international image, but was unlikely to
distract the players.
	   ``Other countries look at South Africa and say, `What's
happening there?' '' Vonk said. ``That's bad.''
	   South Africa lost its World Cup opener to France 3-0, then tied
Denmark 1-1. To make the second round, South Africa must beat Saudi
Arabia and France must beat Denmark in the final Group C matches on
Wednesday. South Africa also must overcome Denmark's four-goal
advantage in scoring differential.
	   The Saudis have two losses and cannot advance. That might help
their cause, some players warned.
	   ``They're not under pressure,'' defender Pierre Issa of
Olympique Marseilles said. ``They're just going to try to win one
game in this World Cup.''

Precede SEOUL, South Korea South Korea captures suspected North Korean submarine 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea captured a suspected
North Korean submarine and towed it gingerly to shore Tuesday,
fearing the vessel contained a crew that could commit suicide by
blowing it up.
	   The craft, described as a ``midget submersible,'' was seized in
the same area where a North Korean submarine ran aground in 1996 _
an incident that left 37 people dead and sent relations between the
two Koreas plunging to their lowest level in years.
	   The discovery of the sub Monday about 11 miles (18 kms) off
South Korea's coast threatened to chill efforts by the new
administration of President Kim Dae-jung to end years of antagonism
by engaging communist North Korea in cultural, economic and other
activities.
	   After becoming entangled in a fishing net, the submarine was
seized by the South Korean military and towed for nearly six hours
through rough seas to this east coast naval base. The vessel was
moored off the coast Tuesday, surrounded by navy gunboats.
	   Officials were being cautious because of the threat of booby
traps.
	   ``We need to take extra precautions because (the crew) might
blow it up,'' a Defense Ministry official said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Military officials said there was no noticeable activity from
inside the submarine while it was under tow, but they thought there
might be as many as a half dozen crewmen inside.
	   They described the boat as a 70-ton Yugo-class submarine, 10
feet (3 meters) wide and 60 feet (18 meters) long. A recent Defense
Ministry report says the North has 14 such subs, each manned by a
crew of four to five.
	   Navy experts said North Korea uses Yugo-class subs for
infiltration of espionage agents and surveillance. The subs are
armed with machine guns.
	   Military officials said North Korean agents are trained to
commit suicide to avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion,
11 North Koreans were said to have been shot to death by one of
their commanders, who then killed himself.
	   The submarine seized Monday had no visible markings, but South
Korean officials said they believe it belongs to North Korea.
	   ``We're pretty much sure that it belongs to North Korea, but we
can't officially confirm at this stage that it is theirs,'' said a
spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   ``We suspect there's somebody inside, but we don't know how
many,'' the spokesman said. He also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   North Korean media monitored in Seoul made no mention of the
incident.
	   South Korean officials said the vessel got caught in a fishing
net about 11 miles (18 kms) east of Sokcho, a coastal town just
south of the North Korean border and about 125 miles (200 kms)
northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set with buoys to be retrieved later. A passing
fishing boat first spotted the entangled craft and radioed maritime
police and the military.
	   Kim In-yong, skipper of the fishing boat, told police the drift
net got caught in the submarine's periscope and propeller and that
he saw three people on the vessel's deck trying to untangle it.
	   The Defense Ministry sent in four warships and a helicopter.
	   Sokcho is about five miles (eight kms) from where a North Korean
submarine ran aground in September 1996, touching off a 53-day
manhunt for its 26 occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers,
reservists and police ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and
13 South Koreans dead. One North Korean was captured and another
was believed to have escaped.
	   That submarine was twice as large as the one captured Monday.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Far-right militants get jail time in racially motivated killing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Three militants of the far-right
National Front were sentenced to jail terms Monday in the racially
charged killing of a youth from the Comoros Islands.
	   Ibrahim Ali, 17, was shot in the back as he ran to catch a bus
with his friends. All three of the accused had claimed to be acting
in self-defense, but police didn't find any weapons or dangerous
objects belonging to the victim and his friends.
	   Robert Lagier, 66, who fired the fatal shot, received a 15-year
term; Mario d'Ambrosio, 51, received 10 years, and Pierre Giglio,
41, received a two-year sentence, with one year suspended.
	   Their lawyer, Jean-Michel Pesanti, didn't raise the issue of
self-defense on Monday, but rather implicitly blamed the National
Front, a virulently anti-immigrant party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen.
	   ``I blame those who inspired the fears of these three men,'' he
said.
	   Lagier, sobbing, said he hadn't intended to kill.
	   ``I am aware of the pain of the family of Ibrahim Ali,'' he
said. ``I ask their pardon.''
	   The killing, in the racially mixed city of Marseille, took place
on Feb. 21, 1995, a few weeks before presidential elections.
	   The three defendants were putting up National Front posters when
they came across the youths, who were rap singers, running to catch
their bus after a rehearsal.
	   Lagier and d'Ambrosio opened fire in their direction. A shot
from Lagier's gun hit Ali in the back, and he died a few minutes
later.

Kournikova withdraws, Sampras, Agassi, Graf win in straight sets
Eds: Updates with Henman victory, Kafelnikov quote
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost two title contenders on
opening day when Anna Kournikova withdrew because of a thumb injury
and Yevgeny Kafelnikov was ousted in the first round.
	   While Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles
were among winners Monday, Kournikova said she could not play
because of torn and strained ligaments in her right thumb.
	   She will be unable to play or practice for at least three weeks.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better,''
she said. ``But this morning when I woke up it was very difficult
for me to move the finger.''
	   The 17-year-old Russian, a 1997 Wimbledon semifinalist and No.
12 seed this year, hurt herself last Thursday during one of her
biggest victories _ a three-set win over Graf at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, whose glamour has made her the focus of tabloid
coverage in Britain, skipped the rest of the Eastbourne event in
what was originally described as a ``precautionary'' move. But
further checks revealed a more serious injury.
	   Kournikova was replaced in the draw by American ``lucky loser''
Lilia Osterloh.
	   ``I'm very sad about it,'' she said. ``This is my favorite
tournament. I feel like I could do well on grass. I was getting
ready for it the whole year.''
	   Another Russian, seventh-seeded Kafelnikov, lost on Centre Court
to big-serving Australian Mark Philippoussis, 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1),
6-4, 6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, winner of a Wimbledon warmup tournament in Germany,
posseses an all-court game that made him one of the top title
challengers. British bookmakers had rated him and Richard Krajicek
as joint second favorites at 6-1 behind Sampras.
	   Philippoussis, who had considered skipping Wimbledon after a
series of early-round defeats this year, served 21 aces and had 14
double faults. But Kafelnikov's serve doomed him with 22 double
faults.
	   ``I haven't had a great year but there is no reason I can't win
this tournament,'' Philippoussis said.
	   Kafelnikov said his serving problems were due to the relentless
pressure put on by the Australian.
	   ``I had no other choice _ just go for both serves,'' he said.
``Mark picked up his game in the second set. Maybe I got tired
running back and forth all the time.''
	   In a late match, British hopes were raised when No. 12 Tim
Henman outlasted Jiri Novak in five sets, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, 5-7, 4-6,
6-2. Henman and Greg Rusedski, quarterfinalists last year, are
seeking to become Britain's first male champion since 1936.

Parliament votes on allowing gay sex at 16 vote is due by about 2100 GMT

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three decades after homosexual acts ceased to be a
crime in Britain, legislators on Monday considered lowering the age
of consent by two years to 16, the age for heterosexuals.
	   The move pitted Prime Minister Tony Blair, a practicing
Christian, against
	   the bishops of the Anglican Church of England, who declared the
latest proposed liberalization violated the state's duty to offer
``a vision of what is good.''
	   However, Blair and the leaders of opposition parties all
signaled support for the move, which would bring Britain in line
with most other European Union nations. And despite opinion polls
indicating most Britons oppose it, the new law looked headed for
solid endorsement in a Monday night vote.
	   Opponents rallied behind a last-minute attempt to toughen the
law by making it an offense for a teacher or other adult
supervising youths under 18 to have sex with a pupil or other
charge.
	   ``I'm not anti-homosexual _ it is to protect children from child
abuse,'' said Joe Ashton, a Labor Party member, saying the offense
would apply to sex of any kind.
	   Four years ago, Parliament narrowly rejected lowering to 16 the
consent age for homosexuals, but reduced it from 21 to 18.
	   ``It cannot be the role of the state to work out people's
sexuality for them ... nor to coerce gay men to be heterosexual,''
said Labor lawmaker Ann Keen, who initiated Monday's move, opening
the parliamentary debate.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday in two Yemeni
cities to quell escalating protests against an IMF-dictated 40
percent hike in fuel prices. Four people were killed and 10
injured, witnesses said.
	   Two others were killed in similar shooting Sunday in Arhab, a
suburb of the capital, San`a, witnesses said Monday.
	   An opposition group has claimed at least nine people were killed
in the two days of violence, but this could not be independently
confirmed. Police confirmed three deaths in Monday's violence, the
official SABA news agency reported.
	   Monday's rioting was the fourth straight day of protests in the
poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula following Friday's hikes
in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The biggest clash erupted in Taiz, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
south of the capital San`a, where police fired bullets and tear gas
at rock-throwing demonstrators. At least one man was killed and
three were wounded, witnesses said.
	   Protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iryani, who took office last month.
	   Demonstrators also clashed with riot police in Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a. Three people were killed
and seven were injured, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity, and police arrested at least 20 people. SABA said two
people were killed and four were injured in Marib.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may consolidate its air force and rocket
space forces, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   Air Force Cmdr. Anatoly Kornukov told NTV television that
``there is some sense in this and the defense minister has also
pointed this out.''
	   He gave no other details.
	   However, asked about the combat readiness of the Russian air
force, Kornukov said ``We have not downgraded combat training
during reforms'' and ``are ready to fulfill the tasks,'' although
``on a smaller scale than was planned.''

Pastrana's election likely to improve strained U.S.-Colombia ties 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Badly strained relations between
Colombia and the United States received a boost with the election
of Andres Pastrana as president, but guerrillas and an economy in
tatters will test the new leader's much-questioned abilities.
	   Pastrana, a 44-year-old former mayor of Bogota, told foreign
reporters Monday that with his election, ties with the United
States ``will now begin to change.'' He wants to ``open the agenda
to include topics other than drugs,'' Pastrana said.
	   The Conservative Party challenger beat ruling Liberal Party
candidate Horacio Serpa in a runoff vote Sunday characterized by
one of the best voter turnouts in memory. Pastrana received 50
percent of the vote, to 46 percent for Serpa.
	   ``We think there is a very good chance that the United States
and Colombia can turn over a new page in its relationship and work
more successfully in the fight against narcotics trafficking and
other matters,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday
in Washington.
	   The United States refrained from publicly endorsing either
candidate in Sunday's runoff, but U.S. administration officials
said privately that a Pastrana victory would augur much better for
relations.
	   Serpa, 55, was interior minister under outgoing President
Ernesto Samper, whose four-year tenure was crippled by allegations
his 1994 campaign took dlrs 6 million from the Cali drug cartel.
	   Serpa vigorously defended his boss, called the U.S. ambassador
to Bogota ``a nasty gringo,'' and at one point implied the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration might have been involved in a 1995
attempt to assassinate Samper's lawyer.
	   Pastrana, on the other hand, has lived and studied in the United
States, speaks fluent English and promises a new relationship based
on strong business ties. But his detractors question his leadership
ability and grasp of the issues.
	   Son of the late president Misael Pastrana, Pastrana made his
public debut as a news anchor in his family's TV station. He was
criticized for leaving the country and disappearing from public
life after losing the presidential race to Samper in 1994 and
disclosing the winner's alleged drug links.
	   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, inherits a nation mired in
crises. Violence by leftist rebels and paramilitary death squads
has soared _ along with interest rates, unemployment and the fiscal
deficit.
	   Concerned about Colombia's deteriorating security situation, the
United States this year lifted economic sanctions imposed for two
years because of dissatisfaction with Samper's drug policies. In
1996, Washington revoked Samper's U.S. visa.
	   Pastrana's election, aside from breathing new life into the
relationship, could lead to a more coherent policy toward Colombia,
said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Interamerican Dialogue
in Washington.
	   According to Shifter, that policy has been marred by mixed
signals. Some Washington policy-makers have demanded more respect
for human rights, while others called for more aid to the military.
And though the lines between anti-narcotics aid and anti-insurgency
assistance are blurred, the United States tried to fashion a policy
that ostensibly separated them.
	   And even as officials tried to marginalize Samper, they
congratulated his successful police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano.
	   ``This was a highly personalized policy. Samper was the bad guy
and Serrano was the good guy... and this sends contradictory
signals,'' Shifter said. ``I suspect that with the Pastrana
administration, all this will change.''
	   Pastrana is calling for a ``Marshall Plan'' to invest in
education, health, housing and infrastructure in the Colombian
countryside, where guerrillas have gained ground. He said the
United States and other countries should play a role in this plan
and in making peace with the rebels, which he said will be a top
priority.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Albanian premier urging NATO airstrikes, no-fly
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled into Kosovo _ the latest evidence of the army's
apparently increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, kidnapped three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje just outside the capital Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces trying to crush
secessionist forces in the predominantly Albanian province and
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. On the other side, all terrorist activities
should cease.''
	   Rugova said dialogue is ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   There was no indication Yugoslav officials intended to change
their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials held talks in Albania's capital
Tirana, but no significant developments emerged from the meeting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had no comment after a
30-minute meeting about Kosovo with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel in Denmark.
	   Moscow has been appealing to fellow members of the six-nation
Contact Group to give Serbia more time to pull back its estimated
45,000 to 50,000 security forces in Kosovo and to resume
negotiations with ethnic Albanians.
	   But the West is growing increasingly impatient. The U.N.
Security Council planned to discuss Kosovo later Monday. Diplomats
said they were waiting to see whether Russia could squeeze
concessions out of Belgrade.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Vienna, emphasizing that the alliance is determined
to take whatever steps are necessary to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Richard Holbrooke, newly designated as the next U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, is expected in the region Tuesday for
separate talks with Milosevic and Rugova.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington
that Holbrooke would be delivering a stern message to Milosevic
that he must pull back his forces and also allow access to
humanitarian organizations.
	   The United States also is becoming increasingly critical of the
ethnic Albanian militants, over whom Rugova has little or no
influence.
	   ``Violence by Kosovo Albanians, with respect to suggestions that
the KLA is about to launch additional measures, only makes a bad
situation worse and perpetuates the cycle of violence,'' Rubin
said.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center, meanwhile, quoted
witnesses as saying that bloodied ethnic Albanians wearing
handcuffs were seen Sunday on three buses leaving Kosovo _ possible
captives from the fighting.
	   Speaking in Vienna Monday night, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano urged NATO to establish a no-fly zone, and to commence air
strikes to break the ``Serb war machine.''

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Adrain Ilie's soft, looping shot that
kissed off the front of the crossbar in 27th minute was the closest
thing to a goal in the 0-0 first half of Monday night's
Romania-England game.
	   In a battle for first place in Group G, both teams were
relatively cautious in attack and neither forced the opposition's
goalkeeper into a tough save.
	   England's best scoring chance came when Darren Anderton crossed
to Alan Shearer, but goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea out-leaped Shearer
for the ball, and Paul Scholes pulled the rebound wide.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel asked the
center-left Social Democrats to try to form a new government
Monday, a task complicated by personal animosities and political
divisions among party leaders.
	   Following tradition, Havel gave the winner of last weekend's
parliamentary elections the first chance to form a government. But
despite his victory, Milos Zeman is the least likely to succeed.
	   ``I have decided to ask chairman of the Social Democrats ...
Zeman to immediately start political negotiations about the future
coalition,'' Havel told Czech television.

Kournikova withdraws with injury _ leaves Wimbledon smarting AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ It was a tossup who was the biggest
loser when Anna Kournikova withdrew Monday from Wimbledon with a
thumb injury: the player, the tournament or the tabloids.
	   The 17-year-old Russian is perhaps the most recognizable face in
women's tennis, a glamorous blonde with a stylish game who made her
mark a year ago by reaching the Wimbledon semifinals.
	   Kournikova has beaten No. 1 Martina Hingis and seven-time
Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf this year. But her victory last
Thursday over Graf at the Eastbourne tournament was costly.
	   She suffered torn and strained ligaments in her right thumb when
she fell in the third set. She'll now be out of action for at least
three weeks.
	   ``I was hoping a miracle would happen or it would get better,''
Kournikova said Monday. ``But this morning when I woke up it was
very difficult for me to move the finger.''
	   ``This is my favorite tournament. I feel like I could do well on
grass. I was getting ready for it the whole year, I was thinking
about coming back here again and going on Centre Court. But
hopefully I have many more Wimbledons to come.''
	   ``Hopefully next year I will come back stronger,'' she added.
``I lost the battle but will win the war.''
	   Although she was seeded only 12th, Kournikova loomed as a title
contender. She was replaced in the bracket by ``lucky loser'' Lilia
Osterloh of the United States.
	   ``I was Anna's age when I missed Wimbledon in '92, so it's very
difficult,'' said No. 6 seed Monica Seles. ``She was one of the
great contenders for sure.''
	   Kournikova is the darling of the British tabloid press, which
has dubbed her the ``Lobbing Lolita.'' Her mother, Alla, has said
her daughter's favorite saying is, ``I am beautiful, famous and
gorgeous.''
	   Anna was the subject of double-page spreads in several Monday
newspapers _ burying men's favorite Pete Sampras, Hingis, Graf,
Monica Seles and even the Williams sisters in the coverage derby.
	   And she wasn't even scheduled to play until Tuesday.
	   The Times, a conservative broadsheet, draped Kournikova's photo
_ bare midriff and all _ across the cover of a special supplement.
	   ``It is obviously very disappointing for the player herself and
the championships, as well as many people who were looking forward
to seeing her play,'' All England Club chief executive Chris
Gorringe said in a statement.
	   Indeed, the fans took it hard.
	   ``Obviously it is sad,'' said Tim Daysh, 29, as he sipped a
drink at the club's Long Bar. ``She is quite a good looking girl
and I would have like to see her play.''
	   ``I saw her last year and she was very impressive _ the dress
sense and the overall impression. She is very enjoyable to watch,''
said Charlie Finelater, 22, of London.

Precede JERUSALEM Hamas leader to return to Gaza Strip on Tuesday delayed; ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Hamas spokesman saying Yassin return
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The return of Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
the spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, to the
Gaza Strip after a four-month fund-raising tour in the Arab world,
has been delayed, a Hamas official said Monday.
	   Israeli security officials at one point considered barring
Yassin from Gaza, but in the end decided that the quadriplegic
sheikh would pose more of a threat abroad than in Gaza, where his
activities can be monitored by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas' popularity in the Palestinian territories, especially in
the strip, is seen as a growing threat to Arafat. During his trip,
the 62-year-old Yassin raised millions of dollars for Hamas and
issued statements supporting armed struggle against Israel.
	   Yassin was expected to arrive at the Rafah crossing between
Egypt and the Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon, said Mohammed
Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank. But Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the visit would be delayed by at least
one day.
	   ``Upon a request from the Egyptians, the return of Sheik Yassin
has been delayed for another 24 hours,'' Zahar told The Associated
Press. Zahar said the delay was in part, to arrange special
transportation and arrival preparations for the ailing sheik.
	   Yassin had spent the last two weeks in Sudan, waiting for Egypt
to permit him entry. Yassin can only enter Gaza overland from
Egypt.
	   Egypt reportedly waited until Israel officially announced it
would let Yassin return to Gaza. Egypt had feared that if Yassin
got stuck at its border with Gaza, he would be an embarrassment to
the government, which has close ties with Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.

British Columbia to require disclosure of all cigarette ingredients 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ British Columbia on Monday
became the first Canadian province with regulations forcing tobacco
companies to disclose all additives and ingredients in their
cigarettes.
	   The regulations also will require tobacco companies to test
their cigarettes for toxic chemicals, Health Minister Penny Priddy
said.
	   Some of the poisonous ingredients health agencies in Canada and
the United States have found in cigarette smoke include
formaldehyde, benzene, lead, cadmium and mercury, Priddy said.
	   Under the new regulations, tobacco companies have until Sept. 15
to disclose all additives and ingredients in each cigarette brand
as well as chemicals used to treat filters and papers.
	   By Oct. 31, tobacco companies must provide reports on 44
selected poisons found in tobacco smoke.

Grains mostly lower, soybeans mixed on more moderate forecast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain futures prices retreated and soybean
futures were mixed Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid new
hope that hot, dry weather in major growing regions will ease
before causing damage.
	   Forecasts indicate 90 degree temperatures expected early this
week in the Midwest will not linger as long as originally believed.
Forecasts also called for more rain, which should help relieve
crops from potential heat stress.
	   Futures prices were pressured early by heavy weekend farmer
selling of stored crops, as they took advantage of the highest
prices in more than a month.
	   Early sharp losses were trimmed late in the trading session on
Monday after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported grains and
soybeans inspected for export last week were stronger than the
previous week.
	   Wheat for July delivery fell 2 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.86 1-2 a
bushel; July corn fell 2 3-4 cents to dlrs 2.50 3-4 a bushel; July
oats rose 1-2 cent to dlrs 1.23 a bushel; November soybeans rose
1-2 cent to dlrs 6.22 3-4 a bushel.

Prime minister accused of improperly receiving funds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A lawyer from a conservative party filed suit
Monday against Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, saying he'd
improperly received public funds for four years before he was prime
minister, judicial officials said.
	   Jospin already has denied the claims outlined in the complaint
filed by lawyer Sylvain Garant, a member of President Jacques
Chirac's Rally for the Republic party.
	   Garant was acting on behalf of a group of French taxpayers, the
officials said on customary anonymity. He argued that Jospin had
received money from the Foreign Ministry from 1993 to 1997, when he
didn't really have a job there.
	   Garant had already told the French press of his intentions to
file the complaint. It now is up to state prosecutors whether to
follow up on the complaint and open an inquiry.
	   The issue came up in May, when two RPR deputies, Patrick
Devidjian and Christian Jacob, made the accusations at the National
Assembly.
	   Jospin answered that during the period in question, while he was
a Socialist Party official, he was also ``at the disposition'' of
the ministry, to which he'd been assigned when he entered public
service.
	   He said he'd asked several times for a posting, but that the
conservative foreign minister at the time _ Alain Juppe, later
Chirac's prime minister _ refused him.
	   ``My professional situation between 1993 and 1997 can not in any
way be described as `fictitious employment,''' he said.
	   Garant told the Liberation newspaper earlier this month that
Jospin ``had no office, no secretary at the ministry. Fees are
supposed to be paid for services performed.''

Lebanese Jews want body of loved one included in prisoner swap 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The relatives of a Lebanese Jew kidnapped from
Beirut several years ago and apparently killed, want the body to be
returned to Israel where they now live as part of an impending
prisoner swap between the two countries, a lawmaker said Monday.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has been engaged in
months of negotiations to arrange a swap of prisoners and dead
fighters between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
they are at war with in south Lebanon.
	   Israel wants back the remains of one of its soldiers, Itamar
Ilya, killed during a botched commando raid into Lebanon last fall,
in exchange for dozens of Lebanese killed in fighting or detained
in southern Lebanon.
	   The request by the family of Selim Jamouss may complicate the
swap.
	   Israeli lawmaker Yossi Katz told Israel's Channel 2 TV that the
Jamouss's family, now living in Israel, have asked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to
include Jamouss in any swap.
	   ``The family ... came to me and said that they want everything
to be done so that they can pray Kadish (Jewish mourner's prayer)
on the grave of they're loved one,'' Katz said. Channel 2 said
Jamouss's son is now serving as a soldier in the Israeli army.
	   Jamouss was among 11 Jews kidnapped during the hostage-taking
spate in the early 1980s. His body was never produced and there had
been no word on his whereabouts.
	   Most of the Jews who were kidnapped were claimed by the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a pro-Iranian extremist
faction that later abducted and killed U.S. Marine Col. William R.
Higgins, who then worked for a U.N. observer group in South
Lebanon.
	   The organization accused Jewish abductees of spying for Israel
and pronounced many of them killed in separate communiques.
	   But only the bodies of four men were produced. In addition to
Jamouss, five other Jews are still missing.
	   Of 5,000 Lebanese Jews who lived in the country before the
outbreak of civil war, only about 80 remained by late 1994.
	   It was not clear Monday when the swap would take place. Israeli
sources said it would likely take place Wednesday but in Beirut,
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said details still needed to
be worked out before it could take place.

FIFA says no teams will be kicked out; Romania wins violence AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATED with journalist attacked; more details throughout on
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Poor results, not poor fans, will get a team sent
home early from the World Cup.
	   Proclaiming that ``we are not afraid,'' FIFA's new president on
Monday ruled out expelling any team from the Cup because of fan
violence.
	   ``I said no. You can't have this,'' Sepp Blatter said after an
emergency FIFA meeting. ``We are not afraid, we are concerned. We
have observed it and we are stronger. This World Cup can't be
disturbed again. We must stay here and play the games.''
	   Blatter words were the crest of wave of tough talk from three
nations struggling to deal with the problem before it overwhelms
the world's biggest sporting event.
	   The injury tally grew Monday night when English fans attacked a
British news reporter on the way to England's game with Romania,
breaking his collar bone.
	   ``They said I was there to cause trouble and give England fans a
bad name,'' said Andrew Woodcock, who writes for the British news
agency Press Association. ``They also accused me of having a ticket
that an England fan should have had.''
	   German hooligans were called ``rioters, fanatics, and fascists''
by French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement while French
President Jacques Chirac called their behavior ``unacceptable''.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his
sorrow, said they were ``a scandal for our nation.'' British
government officials also condemned violence by English fans.
	   Chevenement's comments were directed at the highly organized
groups of neo-Nazis who rampaged through Lens before and after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia game, leaving a policeman in a coma
after being clubbed with an iron bar.
	   ``If it would have meant saving the policeman from his injuries,
I would rather have lost the match,'' said German coach Berti
Vogts. The game ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   The victim is Daniel Nivel, 44, who collapsed unconscious in a
pool of blood on the sidewalk. A hospital spokeswoman said his
condition didn't improve Monday.
	   German police said a 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested
for attacking the Nivel. The man, whose name wasn't released, was
to appear before a judge Tuesday afternoon.
	   Germany played down suggestions it was considering pulling out
of the tournament because of the Lens violence.
	   ``It might be that in the first moments of shock, the question
of a measured reaction, possibly a withdrawal, was hinted at or
raised,'' said German federation spokesman Michael Novak. ``But
within the delegation there were no serious considerations to
withdraw the team.''
	   One of the teams on the verge of an early exit because of
performance is Tunisia, which lost 1-0 Monday to Colombia on
substitute Leider Preciado's goal in the 83rd minute. A victory or
a tie for Romania against England on Monday night would make the
Tunisians the sixth team eliminated.
	   The victory kept Colombia in the running to advance, which would
mark a huge turnaround following their first-round exit in 1994.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' Preciado said. ``Finally we did it. This
victory is important and shows we are doing things well.''
	   The England-Romania match in Toulouse was another flashpoint for
potential fan trouble. English fans clashed with police over three
days surrounding the England-Tunisia game last week in Marseille.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags. The attack on the journalist was the only serious
incident reported.
	   French police, aided by their English counterparts, had already
deported known hooligans spotted in Toulouse before they could
cause any trouble.
	   ``I was doing absolutely nothing wrong,'' England fan Terence
Coughlin, who has a previous arrest for soccer-related violence,
said after he was handcuffed and sent home to Manchester. ``I do
not go to football for violence. I am not a football thug.''
	   After the emergency meeting, FIFA issued a five-step plan to try
to quell soccer violence. The centerpiece of the plan was Blatter's
call for the European Union to do more to prevent known soccer
thugs from easily crossing borders. German police say they've
identified at least 614 known German hooligans in France for the
World Cup.
	   He said FIFA would pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking
greater cooperation with political authorities, including those of
the European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the
reputation of football and for the introduction of new legal
measures to achieve this.''

	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities on Monday blamed squads of
German ``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks that left a
policeman in a coma and fighting for his life after being clubbed
with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   Doctors later released a statement saying the multiple fractures
in his skull showed he'd suffered ``repeated violent blows from a
massive object.'' They said they hadn't yet decided whether to
operate.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge on Tuesday afternoon.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, English soccer fans
attacked a British news reporter on the way to England's World Cup
game against Romania Monday, breaking his collarbone.
	   The fans accused Andrew Woodcock, who writes for the British
news agency Press Association, of giving England supporters a bad
name and threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault on the policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged.
	   A German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in
connection with soccer violence, French news reports said Monday
evening. No further details were immediately available.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   In Toulouse, about 1,800 police were deployed to guard against
trouble during the match between England and Romania.
	   Two huge video screens, originally meant to bring the game to
ticketless fans, were coverd over with tarps, with police fearing a
repeat of last week's scuffles in Marseille.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But he said the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounced ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''
	   FIFA issued a five-step plan to try to quell the violence. At
its heart: a pledge to ``take the initiative of seeking greater
cooperation with political authorities, including those of the
European Union, in the continuing effort to protect the reputation
of football...''
	   FIFA also flatly rejected an informal suggestion by the German
soccer federation that the team withdraw from the Cup.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the German hooligans were
``for the most part sober,'' and ``perfectly organized with means
of communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled into Kosovo _ the latest evidence of the army's
apparently increasing role.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants, striking into a Serb
stronghold, kidnapped three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje just outside the capital Pristina, Serbian sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces trying to crush
secessionist forces in the predominantly Albanian province and
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official and then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' the agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   ``Measures should be taken to decrease and withdraw security
forces and comply with the commitment not to use force against
civilians,'' he said. On the other side, all terrorist activities
should cease.''
	   Rugova said dialogue is ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   There was no indication Yugoslav officials intended to change
their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials held talks in Albania's capital
Tirana, but no significant developments emerged from the meeting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had no comment after a
30-minute meeting about Kosovo with German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel in Denmark.
	   Moscow has been appealing to fellow members of the six-nation
Contact Group to give Serbia more time to pull back its estimated
45,000 to 50,000 security forces in Kosovo and to resume
negotiations with ethnic Albanians.
	   But the West is growing increasingly impatient. The U.N.
Security Council planned to discuss Kosovo on June 29. Diplomats
said they were waiting to see whether Russia could squeeze
concessions out of Belgrade.

Togo must wait at least one more day for election results 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The tiny West African nation of Togo will have
to wait at least one more day to find out the results of its first
round of presidential voting.
	   The results of the Sunday voting were initially supposed to be
announced Monday, but none were forthcoming. The national electoral
commission said in a brief statement on national radio that it
would hold a briefing Tuesday morning, though it did not give any
details.
	   Former dictator President Gnassigbe Eyadema is trying to extend
his 31-year rule in the vote. Protests and technical glitches
marred the first round of voting, though no violence was reported.
	   Few doubt whether Eyadema _ with his campaign machinery and
dominance of the media _ will make it past the first round of
voting. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, he
automatically becomes president. If not, the two with the most
votes face off in the second round in July.
	   Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support in the country's south,
and Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support
among Togo's intellectual class are considered the two candidates
most likely to face Eyadema in a head-to-head second round.

to the Chicago Bulls on Monday, clearing out his office and driving
off on his red-and-black motorcycle.
	   ``I'm not going to speak about `could have, would have, should
have,' '' he said at the team's practice facility. ``It was time to
go. I've been pushing at this horn a little bit the last couple of
years about leaving and being ready to leave. It's my time to go.
It's the right time.''
	   And the coach had it in writing. He climbed on his motorcycle _
signed by all his players _ for one last ride home.
	   Jackson had said all year that this season, his ninth, was his
last. Even after the Bulls won their sixth National Basketball
Association championship in eight years, the coach turned down an
offer from Chicago chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for one more
year.
	   Despite his often strained relations with general manager Jerry
Krause, Jackson said he was leaving because it was his time and he
wanted to go out on top.
	   He doesn't have another job, and he has no other plans right now
except to leave this week for a vacation in Turkey with his wife,
June, and former New York Knicks teammate and U.S. senator Bill
Bradley.
	   ``I don't know if there is a basketball challenge,'' Jackson
said. ``I'll have to wait and see if one presents itself.''
	   Reinsdorf and Krause were both at the practice facility, but
neither was available.
	   Jackson's departure wasn't a surprise to his players, Bill
Wennington said. The team had dinner at Michael Jordan's restaurant
after a citywide celebration in Grant Park last Tuesday, and
Wennington said it was understood Jackson was leaving.
	   ``It was real liberating for all of us,'' Jackson said. ``One of
the things we said last week was that we were going to support each
other with whatever decisions we have to make because it's a
personal time now and people have to do that for themselves.
	   ``Whatever paths people may have to take, one thing they can't
take away from us is the bonds we've made together winning these
championships.''
	   Now that Jackson's made it official, what happens to the rest of
the Bulls? Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and six others on
the 12-man playoff roster are free agents.
	   Jordan once said he would play only for Jackson, though he's
retreated from that lately. Pippen, unhappy after years of being
undervalued and underpaid, has said repeatedly he would rather go
somewhere else, but he too has softened his stance. Rodman wants to
return, but only if the rest of the gang comes back.
	   In an interview with Newsweek, Jackson said he thinks Jordan,
who scored the title-winning basket as the Bulls beat the Utah Jazz
in six games, will retire.
	   ``I can't imagine him doing it again. I don't know but I
anticipate that's how he feels,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   Jordan's decision probably will hinge on who replaces Jackson.
Iowa State coach Tim Floyd is a Krause favorite, but it's unlikely
Jordan would play for him.
	   But Jordan would probably play for George Karl or Roy Williams,
both with North Carolina roots. Karl is out of a job after being
fired by the Seattle SuperSonics a few weeks ago. Williams has said
many times he's happy at Kansas.
	   Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history. He was coach of
the year in 1996.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign that talks
between the warring sides were near.
	   Serb forces rained mortar shells onto villages in western
Kosovo, and a Yugoslav army convoy bearing tanks and trucks full of
soldiers rumbled in _ the latest evidence of the army's increasing
role in putting down Kosovo's independence movement.
	   Six armed ethnic Albanian militants reached deep into Serb
territory to kidnap three Serb workers at a coal mine in Kosovo
Polje, just outside the provincial capital of Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed
this year in fighting between Serb forces and separatist fighters
in the predominantly Albanian province.
	   Russia, trying to use its influence with traditional ally Serbia
to calm the crisis, sent diplomats to both Pristina and neighboring
Albania for talks Monday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky met in Pristina
with a senior Serb official, then with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, saying he wanted to implement ``as soon as
possible'' an agreement reached in Moscow last week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged last week that he
would resume talks with Rugova, but he refused to pull back his
forces, saying they battle terrorists.
	   Afanasyevsky acknowledged that the agreement ``demands tough and
hard decisions from both sides.''
	   Rugova said dialogue was ``necessary to halt further escalation
of the conflict,'' but said Belgrade must first pull back its
forces. He reiterated his call for international intervention to
``stop the aggression and ethnic cleansing.''
	   Yugoslav officials gave no indication that they intended to
change their policies.
	   Russian and Albanian officials held talks in Albania's capital
Tirana, but no significant developments emerged from the meeting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was similarly mum
after a 30-minute meeting about Kosovo with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel in Denmark, where both were attending the Council of
the Baltic Sea States.
	   Moscow has been appealing to fellow members of the six-nation
Contact Group, which oversees the peace in Yugoslavia, to give
Serbia more time to pull back its estimated 45,000 to 50,000
security forces in Kosovo and to resume negotiations with ethnic
Albanians.
	   But the West is growing increasingly impatient. The U.N.
Security Council planned to discuss Kosovo on June 29.
	   ``No option has been ruled out,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said in Vienna, emphasizing that the alliance is determined
to take whatever steps are necessary to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Richard Holbrooke, the next U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, was expected in the region Tuesday for separate talks with
Milosevic and Rugova.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington
that Holbrooke would be delivering a stern message to Milosevic
that he must pull back his forces and allow access to humanitarian
organizations.
	   The United States also is becoming increasingly critical of the
ethnic Albanian militants, over whom Rugova has little or no
influence.
	   ``Violence by Kosovo Albanians, with respect to suggestions that
the KLA is about to launch additional measures, only makes a bad
situation worse and perpetuates the cycle of violence,'' Rubin
said.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center quoted witnesses as
saying Albanians with bloody hands and faces and wearing handcuffs
could be seen on three buses leaving Kosovo Sunday. Ethnic
Albanians said they may have been captured in recent fighting.
	   Speaking in Vienna Monday night, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano urged NATO to establish a no-fly zone and to commence air
strikes to break the ``Serb war machine.''

U.S. government confronts Internet privacy, and lack of it 
</HEADLINE>
By TED BRIDIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Buy anything on the Internet _ or just fill
out an innocent-looking questionnaire on a Web site from anywhere
in the world _ and a company or organization can learn a lot about
you: what you read, what you wear, how you vote, maybe even
information about your health.
	   Amid troubling questions about what American companies, in
particular, do with all that information and what they should be
allowed to do, the Clinton administration is organizing a two-day
Internet privacy meeting starting Tuesday in Washington.
	   Companies and the government want to encourage the growth of
fledgling Internet commerce while balancing the privacy rights of
consumers. Industry wants to develop its own rules and punishments.
Privacy advocates want the government to write tough new privacy
laws _ now.
	   So far, the Clinton administration, wary of stifling business on
the Internet with burdensome new laws, has indicated it will give
companies more time to come up with ways to regulate themselves.
	   ``They have their eyes closed and their fingers crossed that it
will all work out,'' complained Jeff Chester, executive director of
the Washington-based Center for Media Education. ``The
administration has been on its knees pleading with American
high-tech companies to come up with measures to protect online
privacy, and they've been met with a loud chorus of denials.''
	   The Internet can be a corporate candyland of personal consumer
information. Customers around the world routinely respond to
questionnaires on Web sites, providing their names, e-mail and
postal addresses and other personal data.
	   Once a person identifies himself to a Web site, companies can
easily track which Web pages he reads at that site. Until a person
identifies himself, only relatively innocuous information can be
collected behind the scenes, such as which kinds of software the
person uses.
	   ``Once an individual gives over information, that can be tied to
a whole bunch of data about what you've done at a Web site or at a
whole bunch of Web sites,'' said Deirdre Mulligan, a lawyer with
the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. ``That
might reveal your preferences, your taste in books, your taste in
politics or in clothes. It gives people the ability to create
dossiers unparalleled in the offline world.''

Bomb damages bank office; no injuries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A powerful pipe bomb damaged a downtown
bank office Monday, but there were no injuries, police said.
	   The bomb, fitted with a timer and placed in a plant holder
outside the Credit Bank office, shattered windows and destroyed
part of the building's facade.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the 11:05
p.m. (2005 GMT) blast. But police said the device was more
sophisticated than the crude firebombs used in a nearly year-long
rash of attacks by a leftist group Conscientious Arsonists, which
announced last week it was suspending its attacks while it
regrouped.
	   A host of other groups have also claimed responsibility for
bombings around Athens. Earlier this month, a group calling itself
Left-wing Cells said it placed a firebomb that damaged the offices
of a private television station.

World Cup: Petruscu wrestled Romania to 2-1 win 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Dan Petrescu put the ball in the net
while wrestling with a defender, scoring the winning goal in the
90th minute as Romania qualified for the second round of the World
Cup with a 2-1 victory over England.
	   Charging into the 6-yard box, Petrescu held back Graeme Le Saux
_ his teammate on the English club Chelsea _ by putting his right
arm across Le Saux' neck. Then Petrescu slid his left foot in front
of the defender to poke the ball between the legs of goalkeeper
David Seaman.
	   The victory put Romania in first place in Group G and left
England's fate resting on its final first-round game against
Colombia on Friday. The result also eliminates last-place Tunisia.
	   Eighteen-year-old Michael Owen, who became the youngest player
ever to score for England in a World Cup warmup against Morocco,
appeared to save his team with an 83rd minute goal. Owen, who
entered the game in the second half, also hit the left post from 30
meters in second-half injury time.
	   Gheorghe Hagi, 33 years old and playing his 112th international,
set up England-based forward Viorel Moldovan for the goal that gave
Romania the lead two minutes after halftime. Hagi chipped from the
right to the Coventry striker, who chested the ball down and
slotted it past Seaman from six meters.
	   Owen equalized by sliding to the turf to net a right-footed shot
after Paul Scholes had knocked down Alan Shearer's cross from the
right.
	   The game was a potential flashpoint for fan violence following
the riots that surrounded England's game last week against Tunisia.
	   There was only one scoring threat in the first half, when Adrain
Ilie's soft, looping shot that kissed off the front of the crossbar
in 27th minute.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags. A British journalist was attacked by five hooligans and
was hospitalized with a broken collar bone.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The tiny West African nation of Togo will have
to wait at least one more day to find out the results of its first
round of presidential voting.
	   The results of the Sunday voting were initially supposed to be
announced Monday, but none were forthcoming. The national electoral
commission said in a brief statement on national radio that it
would hold a briefing Tuesday morning, though it did not give any
details.
	   Former dictator President Gnassigbe Eyadema is trying to extend
his 31-year rule in the vote. Protests and technical glitches
marred the first round of voting, though no violence was reported.
	   Few doubt whether Eyadema _ with his campaign machinery and
dominance of the media _ will make it past the first round of
voting. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, he
automatically becomes president. If not, the two with the most
votes face off in the second round in July.
	   Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support in the country's south,
and Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support
among Togo's intellectual class are considered the two candidates
most likely to face Eyadema in a head-to-head second round.

U.N. official says reports of human rights violations decreasing

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Allegations of human rights violations in
Guatemala are on the decline, an indication of growing stability
after the country's 36-year civil war, a U.N. official said Monday.
	   ``This decrease shows the tangible impact that the end of the
armed conflict has had for the benefit of human rights,'' Jean
Arnault, chief of the U.N. mission of verification in Guatemala,
told reporters.
	   From July 1997 through March 1998, the mission recorded 1,842
accusations of human rights violations, and those generally were
not motivated by politics, showing a ``qualitative change'' for
Guatemala, Arnault said.
	   However, he added, ``this does not mean that the mission
considers that this evolution will be irreversible.''
	   Arnault said the April killing of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan
Gerardi and the recent deaths of a mayor and a city attorney
general fell under the ``specter of political violence.''
	   Gerardi, 75, was bludgeoned to death two days after presenting a
report blaming the army for most of the killings during the civil
war, which ended with peace accords in December 1996.
	   The allegations from the nine-month period cited by Arnault
included 28 extrajudicial executions, 42 attempted executions and
39 death threats. There were 83 reported violations of liberty and
personal security, including 34 cases of arbitrary detention and
two forced disappearances.
	   Arnault did not give comparable figures for previous years.

World Cup: Colombia wins 1-0 and puts Tunisia on brink of elimination 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Tunisia eliminated
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ It wasn't the prettiest goal of the
World Cup. But it meant so much to Colombia.
	   Leider Preciado's strike seven minutes from the end lifted the
tension and eased some of the pain of a soccer tragedy four years
ago.
	   The substitute's goal gave Colombia a 1-0 victory over Tunisia
Monday to open a route to round two _ something it failed to reach
in the United States in 1994.
	   ``It's fantastic,'' said Preciado, who took a pass from veteran
Carlos Valderrama, shook off challenges from Sami Trabelsi and
Clayton, and miskicked the ball home from 12 meters (yards).
	   ``Finally we did it. This victory is important and shows we are
doing things well.''
	   Now it's down to a showdown with England on Friday and Colombia
could be in round two.
	   Regarded as among the favorites four years ago, the Colombians
were ousted in the opening round after an own goal by Andres
Escobar led to a 2-1 upset loss to the United States. When he
returned home, Escobar was shot dead in a parking lot outside a bar
at Medellin.
	   After four years in the gloom, now there's something for the
Colombians to look forward to.
	   ``We're still on course for the final,'' said an optimistic
coach, Hernan Dario Gomez.
	   ``As far as our next match against England is concerned, we're
going to do our very best. We're a very unified team.''
	   The Tunisians, also beaten 2-0 by England, dropped out of the
championship. Their elimination was made certain when Romania edged
England 2-1 later Monday.
	   ``We didn't deserve to win,'' said Tunisia's Polish coach, Henry
Kasperczak. ``We had a lot of scoring chances but we didn't take
advantage of them and that's our great regret. We need players who
score when the situation presents itself.''
	   After a 1-0 loss to Romania at Lyon, things looked shaky again
for the South Americans.
	   With Faustino Asprilla no longer on the squad having been
dropped for criticizing coach Herman Dario Gomez in a radio
interview, the Colombian attack was missing one of its biggest
stars as it maintained its bid to make the second round.
	   The Colombians were denied the lead by a wonder save from Chokri
el-Oauer in the 22nd minute when Jose Santa floated over a cross
from the left and Wilmer Cabrera moved up to power in a long-range
header. The Tunisian 'keeper reacted with an acrobatic one-handed
punch over the bar.
	   With the Colombians showing signs of getting on top, Tunisia
broke out to almost take the lead in the 29th minute when the
unmarked Mehdi Ben Slimane was allowed a far post far post header.
Fortunately for the South Americans, 'keeper Farid Mondragon was
alert and pushed the header onto the post.
	   Valencia maintained the pressure by firing a 25-meter shot just
too high and then heading against the post from a corner.
	   But Tunisia also hit the bar two minutes before halftime when
Mondragon fisted away a corner, the ball hit Riadh Bouazizi on the
back of the head and rebounded onto the frame.
	   The Tunisians continued to create the better chances and Bel
Slimane managed to get in a right-wing cross despite being crowded
out by three Colombian defenders in the 66th minute only for the
unmarked Zoubeir Baya to volley wide from a good position in front
of goal.
	   The Colombians hit back with a low shot from substitute Preciado
that flashed across the face of the Tunisian goal. Then Victor
Aristizabal arrived unmarked at the far post to meet a right wing
cross from De Avila only for 'keeper El-Oauer to scramble back and
palm his looping header away.
	   At the other end, Mondragon made two reflex-action saves,
blocking a header from Souayah and then a follow up effort from Ben
Slimane.

Louise Woodward: I wasn't as gentle with Matthew as I could have been 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with interview broadcast, fresh quotes
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the much-touted first substantial interview she
has given since returning home from the United States with a
manslaughter conviction, former au pair Louise Woodward conceded
she wasn't ``as gentle as I could have been'' with the child who
died in her care.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. broadcast
Monday night, she admitted ``lightly shaking'' 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen on Feb. 4 last year in an effort to revive him after she
found him unconscious. He was rushed to hospital and died days
later.
	   But she denied being rough or causing the child's death. ``...
maybe I wasn't as gentle as I could have been. You know it was
rather rushed'' on the day he took ill, she said.
	   She said the youngster was ``always toppling over'' and could
have hit his head the day before he was hospitalized. ``There was a
time that he fell and I thought he was rather close to the steps,''
she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, looking confident and relaxed in a dark, tailored
suit and skilful make-up, said she had tried her best to revive the
baby on Feb. 4. ``I lay him on the bed and tried to get some kind
of response from him. I waved my hand in front of his face, I
clapped, I shouted his name and I just, I couldn't get any kind of
response from him,'' she said.
	   ``So I tried shaking him lightly to try and get him to regain
consciousness or to get some kind of reaction him - and there was
none, he was limp.''
	   Ms. Woodward, 20, insisted she was made a scapegoat for the
baby's death because authorities needed to blame someone.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told interviewer Martin
Bashir.
	   Prosecutors claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to Britain
on Thursday, shook Matthew to death. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   Ms. Woodward was allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentence her to the 279 days she had already spent
in prison.
	   She says she took no payment for the BBC interview, which was
heavily trailed.

Henman begins bid to end 62-year British drought AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The young voice came from high in the
stands on Court One, urging Tim Henman to close out his first-round
match Monday at Wimbledon.
	   ``C'mon!'' the boy shouted. ``We want to watch the football!''
	   Henman, trying to become the first Briton to win Wimbledon since
1936, found himself competing Monday against both Jiri Novak and
the World Cup.
	   The last part of Henman's five-set victory over Novak overlapped
the start of the English soccer team's game in France against
Romania. The result was a distraction for fans _ and Henman.
	   ``People shouted out things about the football, and to tell you
the truth, it irritated me,'' he said. ``Things like, `We want to
watch football.' Well, I agree with them, but it's not what you
want to be hearing. It doesn't help.''
	   Henman finally outlasted Novak 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, 5-7, 4-6, 6-2,
then headed for a television to watch the World Cup match, which
Romania won 2-1.
	   The men from the other side of the Atlantic, free to concentrate
on tennis, fared well on Wimbledon's first day.
	   Pete Sampras began his bid for a record-tying fifth title by
beating Dominik Hrbaty 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, while Andre Agassi eased past
Alex Calatrava 6-2, 6-4, 6-3.
	   Unseeded Justin Gimelstob upset French Open runnerup Alex
Corretja 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 6-3, and Michael Chang also won.
	   Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, regarded as a potential challenger
to Sampras' reign, lost against big-serving Australian Mark
Philippoussis, 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-2.
	   The 12th-seeded Henman, a quarterfinalist the past two years, is
also considered a title threat _ if he can hold up under the
pressure of his nation's expectations.
	   A statue of the late Fred Perry near the entrance to the All
England Club serves as a reminder that he was the last Brit to win
Wimbledon _ 62 years ago.
	   ``Henman has a good chance,'' said Sampras' coach, Paul
Annacone. ``It's hard for him because so much is made out of it.
It's amazing. People don't understand the intensity of it.
	   ``But he handles it great. He handles it so well that he has a
good chance. There's no reason he can't be around late in the
second week.''
	   The World Cup could actually benefit Henman by deflecting some
of the attention _ and pressure.
	   As the kickoff to Monday's game approached, many Henman
supporters headed for the exits, leaving the stands barely half
full by the end of his match. Only two of 40 seats were occupied in
a section reserved for members of the All England Club _ and
Henman's parents are members.
	   Henman's great grandmother, Ellen Stawell-Brown, was the first
woman to serve overhand at Wimbledon. His grandfather, Henry
Billington, reached the quarterfinals of men's doubles at Wimbledon
in 1939.
	   Those bloodlines _ and a serve-and-volley game perfectly suited
for grass _ mean perennial high hopes for Henman in the UK.
Britain's Greg Rusedski is also a title contender this year, but
because he was born in Montreal and Henman in Oxford, there's no
question which player the English would prefer to see holding the
championship trophy.
	   ``I know that playing at home in this type of tournament,
there's always going to be a lot of attention,'' Henman said. ``I
enjoy it.''
	   He enjoys it when he wins. But when Henman lost in the
quarterfinals last year to Michael Stich, it was regarded as the
greatest British tragedy since Hamlet.
	   He narrowly escaped disaster Monday, despite squandering nine
break points in the final two sets. When Novak sailed a shot long
on match point, most of the dwindling crowd erupted.
	   But a bobby behind the baseline merely folded his arms. Perhaps
because he's saving his applause until a Brit wins Wimbledon.

Goaltender Moog retires 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Goaltender Andy Moog has retired after an
18-year National Hockey League career.
	   Moog, 38, decided to forgo the final year of a two-year free
agent contract he signed last summer with the Montreal Canadiens.
	   He appeared in 42 games for the Canadiens last season, posting
an 18-17-5 record with three shutouts, a 2.49 goals-against average
and a .905 save percentage.
	   Moog and Jocelyn Thibault, with whom he split goaltending duties
during the season, struggled in the Canadiens' second-round playoff
loss to Buffalo. Young goaltender Jose Theodore ended up finishing
the series.
	   Moog, who broke in with Edmonton in 1980, won three Stanley
Cups, mainly as backup to Grant Fuhr with the Oilers, in 1984, 1985
and 1987.
	   He played for Canada at the 1988 Olympics in Calgary before he
was traded to Boston. The Bruins dealt him to Dallas in 1993.
	   Moog had a career 372-209-88 record in 713 regular season games
and a 68-56 record in 131 playoff games.

Jordan on return: Teammates may hold key AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) _ As Phil Jackson was cleaning out his office
and leaving as coach of the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan sounded
like a man who wanted to keep playing basketball.
	   As long as the Bulls don't change much more.
	   Without directly addressing whether he would play for another
coach, Jordan said his teammates would have to stay for him to put
off retirement.
	   ``I hope Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman will come back,'' said
Jordan, who was in Austin for a children's basketball clinic and
celebrity charity game. ``It will take some time for them to think
about it, but I think there's a chance they will.''
	   Before Jackson made his announcement at the Bulls' practice
facility outside Chicago, Jordan was asked about his coach not
returning.
	   ``If that's his choice, that's his choice. I respect Phil,''
Jordan said. ``But I haven't heard it from Phil yet.''
	   Asked about the matter further, Jordan declined to answer.
	   Jordan once said he would play only for Jackson, though he's
retreated from that lately. Pippen, unhappy after years of being
undervalued and underpaid, has said he would rather go somewhere
else, but he too has softened his stance. Rodman wants to return,
but only if the rest of the gang comes back.
	   Jackson's departure was no surprise to his players. The team had
dinner at Jordan's restaurant after a citywide celebration in Grant
Park last Tuesday, and backup center Bill Wennington said it was
understood Jackson was leaving.
	   Jordan repeated Monday that if the Bulls, who just won their
sixth NBA championship, change too much he would strongly consider
retiring.
	   ``The coaches may not be the same and the players may not be the
same, and that would be like starting over,'' Jordan said in
listing possible reasons to leave.
	   When asked by a child attending the clinic if he was really
going to retire, Jordan said, ``I don't know. I want to play with
the same guys I've been playing with. If that happens, great. If
not, those things happen.''
	   Asked why he would keep playing, Jordan smiled and said, ``I
still enjoy the game, and there are some young players in the
league who still need some lessons.''

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback August 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with official saying agreement may be reached by
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's justice minister said Monday he
would recommend that the government hold a non-binding referendum,
or giant opinion poll, on a West Bank troop withdrawal to force the
hand of far-right legislators opposed to the redeployment.
	   But as the referendum idea gained momentum, the Palestinians,
Israel's president and members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's own Cabinet called it a waste of time.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Netanyahu's far-right
coalition partners, who have threatened to topple him over a troop
withdrawal.
	   But it would also further delay Israel from carrying out a troop
withdrawal it committed to in January 1997 and hold up a stalled
peace process the United States is trying to get going again.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States to make a
quick decision on a U.S. plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan, which was first
proposed earlier this year, but Netanyahu has not responded to the
plan.
	   Officials in the prime ministry said Netanyahu hopes to reach a
deal on a withdrawal before parliament recesses in August. Such a
deal would be presented to the public for vote if Netanyahu decides
to hold the referendum.

Kuwait: OPEC may need deeper production cuts to save market AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: ADDS comments from ministers, tightens
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ As OPEC ministers struggle to save the
battered oil market, Kuwait gave traders a bit of encouragement
Monday by saying OPEC may need to slash production even more
sharply than promised.
	   But it is unclear whether OPEC can agree this week to reduce
output by more than the 620,000 barrels already pledged by most
members _ or whether it will take continued weak prices to push the
exporters into stronger action.
	   Analysts have their doubts about whether OPEC can find the
willpower to make the promised cutbacks, and they say even if the
producers deliver, their target isn't big enough to bring the
market back very much from its lowest levels since the oil
industry's disaster year of 1986.
	   OPEC's average oil price has plunged below dlrs 11 _ a bargain
for consumers but financially terrible for the producers.
	   Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said Monday
that if the new production cuts don't push prices higher, OPEC must
discuss further restraint. An earlier round of production cuts in
March failed to halt the supply glut and prices kept falling all
spring.
	   ``If it turns out that the reductions committed so far by
producers won't affect the prices, then there will be a need to
review this subject,'' Sheik Saud said in remarks carried by the
official Kuwait News Agency.
	   Saudi Arabia may come under pressure from the rest of OPEC to
cut back even more than the 225,000 barrels a day it has promised.
	   The Saudis have promised the biggest total amount of cuts, but
they are by far the biggest producers, pumping some 8.5 million
barrels a day out of OPEC's total daily production of 28.2 million
barrels. Others in the group can't help but notice that the
promised Saudi cuts are proportionately smaller than those being
made by everybody else who agreed to withhold oil from the market.
	   The Kuwaiti minister was asked whether the Saudis should make
more cuts. ``I'm not naming anybody,'' he replied.
	   Still, Sheik Saud's comments on the possibility of further
production cuts lifted futures prices Monday. Brent crude oil to be
delivered in August rose 39 cents to dlrs 13.24 per barrel on the
London futures market, while in New York, light sweet crude futures
for August delivery were up 48 cents at dlrs 13.65 per barrel.
	   Analysts say the outlook remains bleak for prices unless OPEC
and some non-OPEC producers including Mexico, Russia and Oman, take
at least another 1 million barrels a day out of the market.
	   So far, all the promises from OPEC and non-OPEC are falling
almost 200,000 barrels short.
	   Despite skepticism in the markets, some ministers are talking
bravely.
	   ``We hope to get a fair price for our crude _ something like
dlrs 18 to dlrs 20,'' said the United Arab Emirates oil minister,
Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri.
	   But asked how he hoped to achieve this goal, which would still
leave OPEC short of its official target of dlrs 21 per barrel,
al-Nasseri had no immediate answers.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela. They formally begin their summer meeting on Wednesday
but will hold various bilateral sessions before then.

Holmes can't lose with this pick AP Boxing Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Larry Holmes, who has gotten out of some tough
situations in the ring, showed on Monday that he can be slick out
of the ring as well.
	   The former heavyweight champion was asked by promoter Bob Arum
to pick the winner of Thursday night's fight between James
``Buster'' Douglas, also a former heavyweight champ, and Lou
Savarese
	   ``Eeenie, meenie, minie, moe,'' said Holmes, who is to fight
George Foreman, yet another former heavyweight champion, late this
year or in January.
	   ``I'm going to be rooting for you and then I'm going to be
rooting for you,'' Holmes added, looking at Douglas and Savarese,
who will meet in a 12-round match at Foxwoods Resort Casino at
Mashantucket, Conn.
	   Douglas, who upset Mike Tyson for the undisputed title in 1990,
said he would consider himself a champion should he win.
	   ``It's a title,'' said Billy Douglas, the fighter's
father-trainer. ``It's got to be won in the ring.''
	   The 38-year-old Douglas, however, knows he must keep winning if
he has a chance of a big-money rematch against Tyson or lucrative
challenges against WBC champion Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield,
the WBA-IBF champion, who won the undisputed title from Douglas in
1990.
	   ``I'm going to give it a good run this year and see what my
opportunities look like at the beginning of next year,'' Douglas
said. ``If they look promising I'd continue on.''
	   Douglas, who retired after being knocked out in the third round
by Holyfield eight years ago, got up to around 400 pounds (180
kilograms) during retirement and went into a diabetic coma.
	   ``If that had never happened, I don't think I'd ever fight
again,'' said Douglas, who got back into the gym to reduce. His
comeback record is 6-0, with three knockouts.
	   As for Savarese, a defeat would be his third in four fights. The
32-year-old lost for the first loss time after 36 wins when he was
outpointed in 12 rounds by Foreman on April 26, 1997. He then was
knocked out in the fifth round by David Izon on Nov. 5 before
stopping Jeff Lally in the second round April 23.
	   Savarese is well aware of what's at stake in the show tagged
``Now or Never.''
	   ``I want to be on top of the game,'' Savarese said. ``I don't
want to be a journeyman. They say now or never. It is for this
fight.''
	   Also on the card will be Julio Cesar Chavez, who has held titles
in three weight classes. Should the Mexican, whose record is
100-2-2, beat Ken Sigurani (22-1), he would get a Sept. 18 rematch
against WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya was
WBC super lightweight champion when he stopped Chavez on June 7,
1997.

Graf to play in New Jersey exhibition tournament
<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ Steffi Graf will play next month in
the A and P Tennis Classic, an exhibition tournament she has won a
record five times.
	   Tournament director John Korff said he traveled last weekend to
England, where Graf is trying a Wimbledon comeback following knee
surgery, to finalize an agreement bringing her to the Classic.
	   ``I am excited about coming back to Mahwah,'' Graf said in a
statement. ``I've always loved that event, the area and I've made
some great friends at the tournament over the years.''
	   Graf, 29, made her first appearance at the Classic when she was
14, and has played seven times in her 16-year career. She has won a
record five titles (1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1994) at the event.
	   Play opens this year on July 13, a week after the Wimbledon
finals, and continues through July 19.

Louise Woodward: Zobel made the right moral decision in releasing me 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS lede with fresh quotes; changes overline
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Judge Hiller Zobel made a moral decision when he
reduced her murder conviction to involuntary manslaughter for the
death of an infant in her care, former British au pair Louise
Woodward said in an interview with the British Broacasting Corp.
broadcast Monday.
	   In the much-touted, first substantial interview she has given
since returning home from the United States, Ms. Woodward said the
judge had got as close as he could to acquitting her for the death
of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen in February last year.
	   ``I believe that he believed my medical evidence'' that the
child's injuries were old and not the result of her shaking him, as
the prosecution stated, Ms. Woodward said. Reducing her conviction
from murder to manslaughter ``was as close as he could get to an
acquittal.''
	   ``I think he made a moral decision. I think he knew this was not
right, that this was a miscarriage and I think he did the best he
could under the circumstances,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, looking confident and relaxed in a dark, tailored
suit and skillful make-up, had placed no restrictions on the
questions and talked freely about a variety of subjects.
	   She said she found the Boston court's recommendation that she be
barred from working with children ``incredibly hurtful.''
	   ``And there is a little bit of a stigma to it that I feel almost
that I've lost the right to look at a child, that I've lost the
right to tell a mother that her child is beautiful, or to coo at a
baby,'' she said. ``And I do feel a stigma, but that's something
personally that I'll have to get over,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, 20, insisted she was made a scapegoat for the
baby's death because authorities needed to blame someone.
	   ``The mentality is that somebody has to pay. You know, and that
seemed to be the problem, that, well, if the parents didn't do it,
who did? There's only you left,'' she told interviewer Martin
Bashir.
	   Ms. Woodward, who returned to Britain on Thursday, has always
denied prosecution claims that she shook Matthew to death.
	   She says she accepted no payment for the interview with the BBC,
which released excerpts of the interview before it was broadcast.
The program was heavily trailed on news bulletins throughout
Monday.
	   Asked about her relationship with Matthew's parents, Deborah and
Sunil, she replied, ``I liked them. I think we got on pretty
well.'' But she added, ``We had our ups and downs. I mean I'd only
been living there 10 weeks. And I was 18 and there were the normal
frictions that you might expect when somebody comes to live in your
home. ''
	   She said she resented a curfew imposed by Sunil Eappen ``a
little. I felt that I was over 18 and it really should be up to me
to decide when I go to bed, and that if they were entrusting me
with their children and their home in the day, I felt that they
should trust me to know what time I should go to bed.''
	   Asked what their reaction was to her staying out late, she said:
``Well, Sunil was furious with me he was very angry and he shouted
at me and we had quite a scene in the kitchen and he was yelling at
me I told him I didn't appreciate being spoken to like that.''
	   Ms. Woodward was allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentence her to the 279 days she had already spent
in prison.
	   Ms. Woodward said she was fortunate her sentence was not longer.
	   But she added: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an innocent
person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing, worry and
pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up in a prison
in a strange country _ and please remember that I was 18 when I
went into prison _ and being scared, for something that you didn't
even do.''

World Cup: South African striker out with bad ankle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Striker Phil Masinga, South Africa's
all-time leading scorer, will miss this week's World Cup match
against Saudi Arabia due to an injured ankle, team officials
announced Monday night.
	   Masinga, who turns 29 on Saturday, first hurt the ankle early in
the opening 3-0 loss to France but stayed in the game. He came on
as a substitute in the second half of last week's 1-1 draw with
Denmark.
	   Team doctor Victor Ramathesele said Masinga's ankle had inflamed
muscle fibers and that a specialist recommended the lanky Bari
player rest it for four weeks.
	   He will remain with the team, which faces Saudi Arabia on
Wednesday in a match it must win to have any chance to qualify for
the second round.
	   Masinga ``is no longer part of the playing squad and will have
no activity up to and including the match against Saudi Arabia,''
said Danny Jordaan, chief executive of the South African Football
Association.
	   ``Unfortunately, the injury has let me down,'' Masinga said.
	   Because the injury has apparently ended his participation in
South Africa's first World Cup, Masinga said he would reconsider an
earlier decision to stop playing international matches after the
tournament.
	   ``At one stage I did say my goal was to play at the World Cup
and end my international career after the tournament. But now I am
not yet decided,'' he said.

Top Peruvian official calls for pardon for jailed American woman 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOOP
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A top Peruvian official said an American woman
serving a life sentence for treason in a prison high in the frigid
Andes mountains should be pardoned because her trial was flawed.
	   A hooded military judge found New York-native Lori Berenson
guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996, for helping leftist Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted assault on Peru's
Congress.
	   Since then, Berenson, 28, has been held in Yanamayo prison,
located 845 kilometers (525 miles) southeast of Lima at 3,870
meters (12,700 feet) above sea level.
	   In a television interview broadcast Sunday night, Cabinet chief
Javier Valle Riestra said that as a foreigner, Berenson could not
be sentenced for treason.
	   Other government officials disagreed, saying Peruvian law allows
such prosecutions of foreigners.
	   ``The military court has acted with honesty and transparency and
has convicted those whom it has proven to be guilty,'' said Daniel
Espichan, president of Congress' human rights commission.
	   Berenson's family says she is innocent and is campaigning to win
her freedom or an open civilian trial.
	   ``What the government of Peru does is for it to decide. We hope
it will be the right thing,'' Berenson's mother Rhoda said Monday.
``We certainly agree the trial was flawed.''
	   Berenson's parents claim Peru's military justice system, which
sentenced thousands of suspected rebels to long prison terms on
scanty evidence in secret trials, did not give their daughter a
fair chance to defend herself.
	   The decision over whether to free Berenson ultimately rests with
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, said the Rev. Hubert
Lanssiers, a member of a government commission reviewing the cases
of people convicted of treason or terrorism on allegedly weak
evidence during Peru's war against leftist guerrillas.
	   Lanssiers said his commission is not reviewing Berenson's case.
	   Fujimori in the past has insisted that Berenson is a terrorist
and that she would receive no special treatment.
	   Berenson's father visited his daughter Sunday in prison and said
that she had lost weight and had digestive problems from the food.
	   The window in her cell has no glass, and the freezing wind means
she must sleep under eight blankets and a heavy coat, Rhoda
Berenson said after returning to New York Monday morning. She must
bathe in cold water.
	   ``Her spirits remain high. She's good about that,'' she said.

Joe Louis' KO 60 years ago remembered

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Joe Louis' knockout of Germany's Max Schmeling 60
years ago Monday was a hit felt around the world.
	   The sensational first-round victory by Louis in a heavyweight
title June 22, 1938 not only avenged his 12th-round knockout loss
to Schmeling in a nontitle bout in 1936, it countered Adolf
Hilter's belief of Aryan supremacy.
	   On Monday, Louis' politically charged victory was celebrated at
Cobo Center.
	   ``I admired Louis for his contribution to the fighting game and
contributions to the black race regarding Hitler's Nazi Germany,''
said James Williams, 72, who was 12 years old when his family
gathered around a radio in Fayetteville, North Carolina to listen
to the fight from Yankee Stadium in New York.
	   Williams remembered how even though whites lived on one side of
his street and blacks on the other, the fight brought the two sides
together.
	   ``After the fight, people marched up and down the street and
some of the whites would shake hands with the black,'' he said.
``I'm proud of the man for his contribution to humanity.''
	   Monday's symposium, sponsored by the Michigan Jewish Sports Hall
of Fame, featured a short film on Louis' life, ``And Still the
Champ.'' After the film, those attending shared their memories of
Louis.
	   Louis, who died in 1981, was born May 13, 1914, in Lafayette
Alabama and moved to Detroit with his family when he was 12.
	   Detroit's love of Louis is evident by the sports arena named
after the boxer and a downtown statue of a giant fist. The left
glove Louis wore when he beat Schmeling is bronzed and on display
in a glass case in the lobby of Cobo Center, which also houses a
memorabilia room for Louis.
	   Stuart Kirschenbaum, a former state boxing commissioner and on
the board of directors for the Michigan Jewish Sports Hall of Fame,
said the fight is still significant.
	   ``I think it's important for the black community, the Jewish
community and the community of the world, to gather around and
understand what this fight meant historically 60 years ago and
still significantly what it means 60 years later,'' he said.
	   Professor Robert Weisbord, from the University of Rhode Island,
attended the symposium to provide some insight into the life of
Schmeling, who is 94 and lives in Germany.
	   Weisbord, who teaches about the Holocaust and black history,
said Schmeling represented a fascist government, but didn't
necessarily hold fast to those beliefs. Schmeling sent financial
support to Louis' widow after he died and also is credited with
helping to hide two Jewish boys from a night of terror in 1938,
Weisbord said.
	   Schmeling was invited to the anniversary celebration. He wrote
that he was too ill, but wished the event well.

Prosecutor: King seeking unfair advantage with jurors 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defense lawyers for boxing promoter Don King
opened Monday what is expected to be a brief defense against
insurance fraud charges after prosecutors alleged King was unfairly
communicating with jurors through grimaces and gestures.
	   The defense briefly called FBI agents to the stand to testify
about how they handled evidence in the investigation of King's
finances. It remained unclear whether King himself would testify
before the jury receives the case in several days.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss accused King at one point
last week of muttering for jurors to hear that prosecutors were
trying to frame him.
	   Weiss told U.S. District judge Lawrence M. McKenna that King
repeatedly during the trial had tried to bond with jurors by
grimacing or by shaking his fist as if he enjoyed trading punches
with the government.
	   Hearing a reference to being framed was the last straw, Weiss
said.
	   ``This time it crossed the line,'' he said.
	   McKenna reserved decision on prosecutors request that he order
King to stop making faces and remarks directed towards the jury.
	   Weiss made the comments after resting the government's case last
week in the second trial to result from the nine fraud counts that
put King at risk of up to 45 years in prison if he is convicted.
	   The first trial ended in a mistrial when jurors deadlocked.
Prosecutors then added Don King Productions Inc. as a second
defendant.
	   The government alleges that King and his company faked documents
to steal up to dlrs 750,000 from Lloyds of London after a canceled
1991 bout.
	   Throughout both trials, King has been approached in and out of
the courtroom by well wishers and autograph seekers and has nodded
and smiled toward faces he has seen regularly.
	   Weiss, though, said the gesturing and nodding gets out of hand
when he is directing it at the jury.
	   ``It is the reason why every time we go up to the sidebar I go
up last,'' he told McKenna. ``I have got to keep an eye on him as
to what he is going to say to the jury, what sort of comments he is
going to make.''
	   The prosecutor recalled that King once passed by him making
``some very inappropriate faces and grimaces and this sort of
clenched fist gesture which I heard some of the jurors laugh at.''
	   King's lawyer, Peter Fleming Jr., said his client had not done
anything inappropriate.
	   Testimony was scheduled to resume Tuesday.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A labor strike against privatizing
Puerto Rico's telephone company escalated in violence and scope
Monday, with riot police mobilized and 10 people injured in
picket-line clashes.
	   Four police officers were among those hurt.
	   Some university students and utility workers joined the
protesters Monday and the General Council of Workers, including
state electricity, water and health employees, called for a general
strike.
	   Fearing they would lose their jobs, some 6,400 unionized
employees began striking Thursday to stop the government selling
control of Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   ``Organized sabotage'' of telephone lines cut service to 75,000
customers, said Carmen Ana Culpeper, president of the company
called Telefonica.
	   Unions denied any sabotage and blamed lack of maintenance
because their members were striking. However, some fiber optic
cables and other telephone lines have been cut and otherwise
damaged in recent days.
	   Also out of service are 210 of the island's 750 automated bank
teller machines, as well as some cellular telephones in this U.S.
commonwealth of 3.8 million people.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate already has approved the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale of Telefonica to U.S. communications giant GTE Corp., which
has promised no layoffs for a year. The local House of
Representatives is expected to vote for the sale Wednesday.
	   On Monday, police clubbed strikers who tried to keep managers
from reporting to work in Guaynabo, a San Juan suburb. Four
protesters were injured, including one bloodied picketer who was
knocked unconscious.
	   A union delegate said police attacked without warning. Police
said officers reacted when a worker ``pulled a weapon'' as managers
tried to enter the building.
	   Four police officers and two protesters were hurt in a scuffle
in the Hato Rey banking district.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo reacted angrily, saying ``delinquent''
students started the violence to show their support of the workers.
``The abuse stops here,'' he said. ``If the unions want to
negotiate, we will negotiate. But we will not permit attacks on our
police officers.''
	   Culpeper charged that ``leftist students and other professional
strikers'' had taken over the protest from the two striking labor
unions and that strikers were harassing managers by following them
home.
	   Some managers found their electricity turned off at home,
indicating other state-owned utility workers were joining the
protest, Culpeper said.
	   State water and electricity workers blocked traffic on busy
highways Monday by slowly driving heavy equipment to Telefonica
headquarters.
	   On Friday, a bank reported that at least 130 of its 750
automated bank teller machines were not working.

 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``The way I'm playing now, if guys want to beat me, they're
going to have to play at their very best.'' _ Jonas Bjorkman.
	   ``If I do well at Eastbourne, I do well at Wimbledon.'' _ Jana
Novotna, after winner the Wimbledon warmup tournament for the first
time.
	   ``This was definitely something that I needed.'' _ Patrick
Rafter, after winning the Heineken Trophy title.
	   ``It's one of the best matches I've played.'' _ Anna Kournikova,
following her 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-4 victory over Steffi Graf.
	   ``I have no idea why these players don't get it. They think
because I yelled at an umpire or (Jimmy) Connors grabbed his crotch
that that's all we did.'' _ John McEnroe, bemoaning the lack of
emotion among today's pro players.
	   ``It's amazing what playing (Bjorn) Borg and (John) McEnroe does
for my game.'' _ Jimmy Connors, after capturing This Challenge for
the third time.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SERENA IN THE LEAD &QC; 
	   When Serena Williams reached the quarterfinals at Eastbourne, it
marked the first time that she has progressed further in a
tournament than her older sister. Venus Williams was ousted in the
second round by Natasha Zvereva.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SAY BYE-BYE, CEDRIC &QC; 
	   Cedric Pioline said the ``magic words'' and was defaulted from
the Nottingham Open. The Wimbledon runnerup last year, Pioline was
trailing Australia's Scott Draper 6-3, 1-1, 0-40 when he was
ejected for ``verbal abuse.'' ``I don't remember what I said to the
umpire, but when you get fed up, you don't send flowers _ you're

doubles titles.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SHAKY RANKING &QC; 
	   Four-time champion Pete Sampras will lose his No. 1 ATP Tour

Petr Korda, Carlos Moya, Greg Rusedski and Patrick Rafter.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SURFACE TO SURFACE &QC; 
	   In order to win the Nottingham Open grass court tournament in
Nottingham, England, Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman had to win his last

were played on an indoor hard court. After winning, the winners
returned to the grass court for the final, where Bjorkman beat
Zimbabwe's Byron Black.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STANFORD'S DOUBLE LOSS &QC; 
	   Stanford's twin tennis players, Bob and Mike Bryan of Camarillo,
California have turned pro after helping their school win its
fourth consecutive NCAA men's team title. The 20-year-old
sophomores began their pro careers at a USTA futures tournament in
Waco, Texas. Bob Bryan won the NCAA singles title, then teamed with

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A local newspaper headline screamed,
``Hooliganism: It's Escalating,'' and wary townsfolk scrutinized
strangers in their midst. Those English fans seemed harmless enough
partying on the Place du Capitole. Were they the hooligans?
	   In scattered outbreaks of World Cup violence, real culprits were
hard to miss. German neo-Nazis bludgeoned a policeman in Lens on
Sunday, leaving him near death. English thugs, French-Tunisians and
riot troops have fought pitched battles in Marseille.
	   But beyond the incidents themselves, the fear of potential
conflict has thrown a wet blanket over an international sporting
extravaganza meant to see out the millennium with unprecedented
merriment. Authorities were taking no chances.
	   Marseille at times resembles an armed camp, with metal barriers
closing off sections of the Old Port, where local authorities had
planned night after night of free concerts.
	   Lens, a hardscabble industrial town which lives for soccer, is
still shaken from Sunday's violence that left a policeman comatose
and on a respirator after being battered by German thugs. Lyon,
where only small incidents have been reported, is on alert.
Likewise, Montpellier, where Germany plays Iran on Thursday.
	   In Toulouse, where one in six of the 600,000 inhabitants is a
university student, the bars now close at 11 p.m. An extra 500
police, with heavy riot gear, patrol the few places where soccer
fans gather. Cars are spot-checked coming into town.
	   Two huge video screens set up so townsfolk and visitors without
tickets could watch the games were covered with tarps for Monday's
match in which Romania beat England 2-1. Police feared a repeat
performance of a rumble on the beach at Marseille.
	   And there was some trouble. English fans attacked a reporter for
the British Press Association on the way to the game, breaking his
collarbone. Andrew Woodcock was attacked by five fans who accused
the 30-year-old newsman of giving England supporters a bad name and
threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   ``It's a little silly, isn't it?'' observed Brian Edwards of
Stoke, a peaceable English fan with long experience in soccer
crowds. ``The more you act like you expect trouble, the more likely
you'll provoke it. There are always a few idiots around.''
	   Police also broke up a brawl among Englishmen who watched the
game at the Blacksmith Bar. After England lost the heartbreaker
match, most fans left the stadium and taverns in dejected clumps.
	   The diehards, with energy to burn and no place to go, gathered
around a shutdown bar behind the Place du Capitole. Riot police
watched in tense silence. For those used to lively Toulouse by
night, it was an eerie scene.
	   Many Frenchmen who waited years to welcome the world are
beginning to wish everyone would just go home.
	   ``What a mess,'' muttered Christophe Bourgan, a young French
streetsweeper whose crew crisscrossed the Place du Capitole,
picking up beer cans, bottles and half-chewed food by the ton.
``This is worse than the Fete de la Musique.''
	   And this year, even that _ the Fete _was canceled. Every June
21, French cities and towns celebrate summer solstice with
nightlong music festival. Toulouse has one of the best, usually
drawing 100,000 people. But it was called off to avoid possible
trouble.

World Cup: Petruscu wrestles Romania to 2-1 win

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Dan Petrescu won the wrestling match,
and Romania won the game.
	   Charging into the 6-yard box to chase down Constantin Galca's
pass in the 90th minute, the Romanian midfielder put his right arm
across the neck of Graeme Le Saux _ Petrescu's teammate on the
English club Chelsea. Then Petrescu slid his left foot around
England defender to poke the ball between the legs of goalkeeper
David Seaman.
	   The goal won the game 2-1 and put Romania into the World Cup's
second round.
	   ``This is the greatest moment of my life,'' Petrescu said. ``I
scored a winning goal in the last World Cup, but compared to this
feeling it meant nothing.
	   ``I couldn't have asked more than to score a goal in the last
minute against the country where I make my living. It was a truly
wonderful feeling. I couldn't sleep last night but even if I could
have, scoring a goal like that would have been beyond my wildest
dreams.''
	   The victory put Romania in first place in Group G and left
England needing a win or a draw in its final first-round game
against Colombia on Friday. The result also eliminates last-place
Tunisia.
	   ``Dan was trying to get outside me, but I couldn't get my foot
in in case I gave away a penalty,'' Le Saux said. ``Then when I
tried to stop him as he shot his elbow hit me in the face. I
couldn't do anything about it.''
	   Eighteen-year-old Michael Owen, who became the youngest player
ever to score for England in a World Cup warmup against Morocco,
appeared to save his team with an 83rd minute goal. Owen, who
entered the game in the second half, also hit the left post from 30
meters in injury time.
	   ``I'd rather draw 1-1 and not score,'' Owen said. ``Not winning
the match was a bitter disappointment.''
	   Gheorghe Hagi, 33 years old and playing his 112th international,
set up England-based forward Viorel Moldovan for the goal that gave
Romania the lead two minutes after halftime. Hagi chipped from the
right to the Coventry striker, who was left unmarked by Tony Adams
to chest the ball down and slot it past Seaman from six meters.
	   ``The two goals we gave away were schoolboy stuff,'' England
coach Glenn Hoddle said. ``The defending was poor. If you give away
stupid goals like that at this level you are going to get punished.
... Now we know what we have got to do against Colombia.''
	   Owen was the bright spot for England, a bundle of energy who
tied the game by sliding to the turf to net a right-footed shot
after Paul Scholes had knocked down Alan Shearer's cross from the
right.
	   ``I told him to go out and enjoy himself and see if he could get
that goal,'' Hoddle said. ``And it went his way.''
	   The game was a potential flashpoint for fan violence following
the riots that surrounded England's game last week against Tunisia.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags. A British journalist was attacked by five hooligans and
was hospitalized with a broken collar bone.
	   After the game, diehards fans with energy to burn and no place
to go gathered around a shutdown bar behind the Place du Capitole.
Riot police watched in tense silence, but there were no incidents
reported.

Government explores holding referendum on West Bank pullback reach agreement by August 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with eight grafs with official saying Netanyahu hopes to
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's justice minister says a
non-binding referendum on a West Bank troop withdrawal would force
the hand of opponents to the redeployment _ but the Palestinians
and leading Israelis who back a withdrawal call it a waste of time.
	   Tsahi Hanegbi met Monday with legal advisers and Cabinet
colleagues to discuss the referendum proposal.
	   After the meeting, Hanegbi said he would probably recommend to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he hold a non-binding
referendum that could be organized within 90 days.
	   If recent polls are accurate, a referendum would likely yield a
solid majority for a pullback and silence Netanyahu's far-right
coalition partners, who have threatened to topple him over a troop
withdrawal.
	   ``The government cannot ignore the results,'' Hanegbi said,
adding that ministers who still opposed the public's wishes after
the vote ``will need to resign.''
	   But the referendum would also further delay Israel from carrying
out a troop withdrawal it committed to in January 1997 and hold up
a peace process the United States is trying to revive.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure to make a quick decision on a U.S.
plan for a pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians have accepted the plan.
	   Officials said Netanyahu hopes to reach a deal on a withdrawal
before parliament recesses in August. Such a deal would be
presented to the public for vote if Netanyahu decides to hold the
referendum.

Top Peruvian official calls for pardon for jailed American woman conform.

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A top Peruvian official said an American woman
serving a life sentence for treason in a prison high in the frigid
Andes mountains should be pardoned because her trial was flawed.
	   A hooded military judge found New York-native Lori Berenson
guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996, for helping leftist Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted assault on Peru's
Congress.
	   Since then, Berenson, 28, has been held in Yanamayo prison,
located 845 kilometers (525 miles) southeast of Lima at 3,870
meters (12,700 feet) above sea level.
	   In a television interview broadcast Sunday night, Cabinet chief
Javier Valle Riestra said that as a foreigner, Berenson could not
be sentenced for treason.
	   Other government officials disagreed, saying Peruvian law allows
such prosecutions of foreigners.
	   ``The military court has acted with honesty and transparency and
has convicted those whom it has proven to be guilty,'' said Daniel
Espichan, president of Congress' human rights commission.
	   Berenson's family says she is innocent and is campaigning to win
her freedom or an open civilian trial.
	   ``What the government of Peru does is for it to decide. We hope
it will be the right thing,'' Berenson's mother Rhoda said Monday.
``We certainly agree the trial was flawed.''
	   Berenson's parents claim Peru's military justice system, which
sentenced thousands of suspected rebels to long prison terms on
scanty evidence in secret trials, did not give their daughter a
fair chance to defend herself.
	   The decision over whether to free Berenson ultimately rests with
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, said the Rev. Hubert
Lanssiers, a member of a government commission reviewing the cases
of people convicted of treason or terrorism on allegedly weak
evidence during Peru's war against leftist guerrillas.
	   Lanssiers said his commission is not reviewing Berenson's case.
	   Fujimori in the past has insisted that Berenson is a terrorist
and that she would receive no special treatment.
	   Berenson's father visited his daughter Sunday in prison and said
that she had lost weight and had digestive problems from the food.
	   ``Her spirits remain high. She's good about that,'' her mother,
Rhoda Berenson, said.

French blame German squads of `thugs' for violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with color after Toulouse game ending.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Authorities on Monday blamed squads of
German ``thugs, fanatics and fascists'' for attacks that left a
policeman in a coma and fighting for his life after being clubbed
with an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, the 44-year-old victim, was attacked minutes after
Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia, when
groups of neo-Nazis rampaged through Lens, a town in northern
France.
	   Nivel was attacked by the rioters on a narrow street and
collapsed unconscious in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. He was
taken by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Lille Sunday night, and
put on a respirator.
	   ``His condition didn't improve or get worse during the night,''
Lille hospital spokeswoman Annie Ervard said Monday. ``He is still
in a coma and under respiratory assistance.''
	   Doctors later released a statement saying the multiple fractures
in his skull showed he'd suffered ``repeated violent blows from a
massive object.'' They said they hadn't yet decided whether to
operate.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge on Tuesday afternoon.
	   In the southern city of Toulouse, meanwhile, English soccer fans
attacked a British news reporter on the way to England's World Cup
game against Romania Monday, breaking his collarbone.
	   The fans accused Andrew Woodcock, who writes for the British
news agency Press Association, of giving England supporters a bad
name and threw him to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   About 1,800 police were deployed to guard against trouble during
the match between England and Romania.
	   Two huge video screens, originally meant to bring the game to
ticketless fans, were covered over with tarps, with police fearing
a repeat of last week's scuffles in Marseille.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars appeared to
keep violence in check.
	   Some fans gathered around a shut-down bar behind the Place du
Capitole, while riot police watched in tense silence.
	   In the north, a local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police
were pursuing other possible attackers in the assault on the
policeman.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged.
	   A German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in
connection with soccer violence, French news reports said Monday
evening. No further details were immediately available.
	   Most of the detainees were booked for drunkenness and were
expected to be released, the ministry said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A labor strike against privatizing
Puerto Rico's telephone company erupted in violence Monday, leaving
four police and six others injured in picket-line clashes.
	   Riot police were mobilized as the five-day-old strike took a
violent turn. Some university students and utility workers joined
the protest and union leaders called for a general strike.
	   The strike has left 75,000 customers of a total 1.3 million
without phone service. Carmen Ana Culpeper, president of the Puerto
Rico Telephone Company, blamed the outages on strikers and their
supporters vandalizing lines. But unions said they were caused by
poor maintenance.
	   Fearing for their jobs, some 6,400 unionized employees began
striking Thursday to stop the government from selling control of
the phone company to private investors for dlrs 1.9 billion. U.S.
communications giant GTE Corporation, the lead investor, has
promised there will be no immediate layoffs.
	   Puerto Rico's Senate approved the sale last week. The House of
Representatives is expected to vote Wednesday.
	   On Monday, police clubbed strikers who tried to keep managers
from reporting to work in Guaynabo, a San Juan suburb. Four
protesters were injured, officials said.
	   Four police officers and two demonstrators suffered minor
injuries in a clash in San Juan's banking district.
	   An angry police Chief Pedro Toledo accused ``delinquent''
student sympathizers of inciting the violence.
	   ``The abuse stops here,'' he said. ``We will not permit attacks
on our police officers.''
	   There were signs of support from other workers. Culpeper said
some workers at state-owned utilities were joining the protest by
blocking traffic on busy highways.

Take the tough decision, Australia urges Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Treasurer Peter Costello
on Tuesday urged Japan to show strong political will and impose
tough reforms on its financial system, warning instability there is
a serious threat to world economic growth.
	   ``The situation in Japan is very serious today,'' Costello told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``If the Japanese can't fix their financial system, that's a
serious threat to world growth.''
	   It was in the interests of Australia, the Asian region and those
of the rest of the world that the Japanese government take
``decisive action in relation to the Japanese financial system,''
Costello said.
	   ``The Japanese government has announced it wants to deal with
the problem and has set aside money to do it.
	   ``What really is required now is the political will to come in
and take the tough decisions,'' he said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea captured a suspected
North Korean submarine and towed it gingerly to shore Tuesday,
fearing the vessel contained a crew that might commit suicide by
blowing it up. The craft, described as a ``midget submersible,''
was seized in the same area where a North Korean submarine ran
aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with 37 people dead and
relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years. Monday's
discovery of the sub about 15 kilometers (10 miles) off South Korea
threatened to set back new President Kim Dae-jung's efforts to end
years of antagonism by engaging communist North Korea in cultural,
economic and other dealings. (SKOREA-SUBMARINE)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian diplomats pressed Monday for
an end to fighting in Kosovo, but shelling and gunfire resounded
across the secessionist province and there was no sign that talks
between the warring sides were near. Serb forces rained mortar
shells onto villages in western Kosovo and a Yugoslav army convoy
bearing tanks and trucks full of soldiers rumbled in _ the latest
evidence of the army's apparently increasing role in putting down
Kosovo's independence movement. Six armed ethnic Albanian militants
reached deep into Serb territory to kidnap three Serb workers at a
coal mine in Kosovo Polje, just outside the provincial capital of
Pristina, Serb sources said. More than 300 people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been killed this year in fighting between Serb
forces and separatist fighters in the predominantly Albanian
province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police opened fire Monday on Yemenis
protesting a 40 percent increase in fuel prices in two of the
country's biggest cities. Four people were killed and 10 wounded,
witnesses said. It was the fourth straight day of protests
following Friday's hikes in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas
prices. Two people were killed in a similar shooting Sunday in
Arhab, a suburb of the capital, San`a, witnesses said Monday. An
opposition group, however, said at least nine people were killed in
the two days of violence. The figure could not be independently
confirmed. Police confirmed three deaths in Monday's violence, the
official SABA news agency reported. Protesters demanded the
resignation of Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani, who came to
power last month in Yemen, a poor country on the southwest corner
of the Arabian Peninsula. (YEMEN-PROTESTS)
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Without immediate food and medical relief,
hundreds of thousands of war refugees inside Guinea-Bissau face
imminent famine, a U.N. refugee agency spokesman warned Monday. As
many as 300,000 people have fled fighting in the West African
nation's capital, converging on towns north of the city where there
is little food, clean water or medical supplies. Although fighting
near the capital, Bissau, was not as fierce Monday as in recent
days, gunfire and the blast of artillery shells were heard near the
airport. The country's breakaway military faction has dug in there
to hold off loyalist forces and Senegalese troops. Senegal,
fighting on behalf of Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira,
has about 1,500 troops inside the country and has begun shipping in
supplies and troop reinforcements from the southern town of
Ziguinchor. (GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ New Colombian President-elect Andres
Pastrana moved Monday to shake off his predecessor's legacy of
mutual ill will with the United States, saying his election meant a
new way of dealing with Washington. Colombian-U.S. relations ``will
now begin to change,'' Pastrana told foreign reporters. He said he
wanted to ``open the agenda to include topics other than drugs.''
The Conservative Party challenger beat ruling Liberal Party
candidate Horacio Serpa in a runoff Sunday characterized by one of
the best voter turnouts in memory. Pastrana received 50 percent of
the vote to 46 percent for Serpa. (COLOMBIA-US-TIES)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Big-name technology shares rallied Monday as
money managers dressed their portfolios for end-of-quarter reports,
but the broad market posted only slim gains after a summit on the
Asian fiscal crisis proved uneventful. The Dow Jones industrial
average slipped about 1 point to 8,711 after retreating from a
50-point gain. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index jumped
more than 1 percent, led by technology favorites Intel and Dell
Computer, but most broad-market indicators posted only marginal
gains. The market's gains came despite disappointment that a
weekend financial summit in Tokyo produced no concrete plan from
Japan to revive its economy. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Premier Sergei Kiriyenko stressed Monday that
Russia needs money from the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the ruble and fend off speculative attacks. ``We're
merely talking about stabilization funds for the Central Bank,''
Kiriyenko said, according to the Interfax news agency. ``This will
increase reliability and will make it possible to rebuff any
speculative attacks on the ruble more steadfastly.'' Kiriyenko met
with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the government's strategy
to combat the economic crisis, while IMF negotiators were headed to
Moscow. An expanded Cabinet meeting on the strategy, chaired by
Yeltsin, is scheduled Tuesday. Yeltsin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the IMF was making some
unacceptable demands. The fund has been pressing Russia to sharply
curtail spending, boost tax collections and reform its energy
sector. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top officials intend to decide in two weeks how to
have a ``bridge bank'' take a mountain of bad loans off the hands
of Japanese banks so they can help lift Japan out of recession.
Koichi Kato, secretary-general of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, said Monday he and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto have
agreed to make a final decision by July 8, four days ahead of
elections for Parliament's upper house. Japanese banks have an
estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 555 billion) in bad loans. Worried
about adding to their losses, they have been reluctant to grant new
loans that could help revive the slumping economy. The United
States and Japan's Asian neighbors have been urging it to fix its
economy, seen as dragging down other economies in the region.
Hashimoto has promised action, including accelerated moves to solve
the bad loan problem. (JAPAN-BANK RESCUE)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Warning that economic turmoil is
tearing apart Indonesian society, a World Bank official said Monday
that the number of Indonesians living in poverty could double to
more than 50 million. Such a setback in the Southeast Asian nation
of 200 million people would shatter much of the economic legacy of
former President Suharto, an authoritarian leader who made poverty
reduction a linchpin of his mandate during 32 years in power. Also
Monday, U.S. and German envoys met new President B.J. Habibie to
offer their support for Indonesia's efforts to revive a
once-booming economy that is now virtually at a standstill.
Recovery is likely to take years in Indonesia, where political
stability is still in doubt despite the downfall last month of
Suharto after student protests and riots over price increases. His
successor, Habibie, has embarked on democratic reforms but foreign
investors remain wary and the rupiah is weak. (INDONESIA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A prominent U.S. senator said Monday that Swiss
banks have jeopardized hopes for the resolution of Holocaust
victims' financial claims with what he called an arbitrary,
high-handed settlement offer. ``We've come a long way from `Here's
dlrs 32 million _ take it or leave it,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said,
referring to the figure the banks' were talking about three years
ago. But D'Amato denounced the final offer of dlrs 600 million,
announced by the banks last week, saying it ``does not begin to
rectify the damage or injustice done'' to Jewish victims of Nazi
oppression. The New York Republican, chairman of the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee, said the world was entitled to a full
accounting. ``For this reason, the Banking Committee's inquiry into
the Swiss banks' role in World War II will be expanded to include a
re-examination of the 1946 Washington accords,'' he said at a news
conference at offices of the World Jewish Congress. (US-SWISS

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Larry Flynt got married during a sumptuous
weekend ceremony at his Hollywood Hills estate.
	   Flynt, publisher of the pornographic Hustler magazine, exchanged
vows with his former nurse, Elizabeth Barrios.
	   ``I put her off for seven years,'' Flynt, 55, said Monday.
``Marriage is more important to women than to men. I could have
done without it, to tell you the truth.''
	   Woody Harrelson, who played Flynt in the film ``The People vs.
Larry Flynt,'' was among the 150 wedding guests, along with the
movie's director, Milos Forman, and stars Courtney Love and Ed
Norton.
	   Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since an
attempt on his life in 1978, said the couple will honeymoon on the
Caribbean island of St. Martin.
	   Althea Leasure Flynt, who was married to the publisher for 11
years, died in 1987 at age 33 in the bathtub of their home. The
death was ruled a drowning stemming from drug intoxication and the
effects of AIDS.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II is getting some help from the
gas company.
	   Centrica PLC, the holding company that controls British Gas,
will lend its corporate affairs director, Simon Lewis, to the
palace for two years.
	   Lewis, 39, will be communications secretary to the queen.
	   ``The queen and senior members of the Royal Family have decided
to devote more resources to communications generally,'' said a
palace spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Centrica will continue to pay Lewis his normal salary.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Reba McEntire said she had the
chance to play Molly Brown in the movie ``Titanic'' but had to bow
out because of a scheduling conflict.
	   The country music star said she was hired by director James
Cameron for the part ultimately played by actress Kathy Bates. Ms.
McEntire said she rearranged her schedule to do the role but that
the shooting of ``Titanic'' was moved.
	   ``We'd have lost no-telling-how-much money to move those dates
again or cancel them,'' Ms. McEntire told The Tennessean newspaper.
	   Ms. McEntire, who has acted in several TV movies and in
``Tremors'' for the big screen, said her singing career remains her
priority.
	   ``Without the music, I lose my identity,'' she said. ``The other
things enhance it, make it more fun and exciting.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sporting oversized black glasses in honor of the
late Harry Caray, singer Jimmy Buffett was the latest to sing
``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning stretch
Sunday at Wrigley Field, home of baseball's Chicago Cubs.
	   ``I have your glasses, Harry,'' Buffett shouted between the
lyrics of the song, a trademark for Caray, the longtime Cubs
play-by-play announcer.
	   Buffett is an avid baseball fan and owns two minor league
baseball teams. He said he learned to love baseball as a child
while watching the minor league team in his hometown of Mobile,
Alabama.
	   ``If I hadn't done this, I would've done something in
baseball,'' Buffett said of his music career.
	   Buffett, who was in the Chicago area on tour, said he has
something in common with the Cubs _ a diehard following.
	   ``My fans are as loyal as Cubs fans,'' he said as he watched the
Cubs play the Philadelphia Phillies. ``And I appreciate it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Woolworth Building, the Gothic-style
``Cathedral of Commerce'' that was once the world's tallest
skyscraper, has been sold to a real estate developer for a reported
dlrs 155 million.
	   The 60-story tower with its spires and gargoyles was bought by
the Witkoff Group. The Wall Street Journal reported the price was
dlrs 155 million.
	   The sale is one more step by the Venator Group, formerly the
Woolworth Corp., to shut down its variety stores and focus on
sports-oriented products.
	   Looming over City Hall Park in lower Manhattan, the 1913
building is identifiable by its lantern-like crown. The vaulted
lobby is covered with mosaics of company founder Frank Woolworth
counting nickels and his architect, Cass Gilbert, holding a model
of the structure.
	   Woolworth is said to have paid more than dlrs 13 million for the
building, ordering it to be an extra 100 feet (30.5 meters) high to
steal the title of the world's tallest from the Metropolitan Life
building.
	   In 1929, Manhattan's Chrysler Building grabbed the title away,
but the Woolworth Building had already become a city attraction.

Graf brought to tears by return to Wimbledon
Eds: RECAPS previous; play starts on Centre Court and Court 1 at
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just being back at Wimbledon was
enough to bring Steffi Graf to tears.
	   A year ago, the seven-time champion was in rehabilitation after
reconstructive knee surgery. Two months ago, her comeback
threatened by more injuries, she was considering retirement.
	   So Monday, after winning her first-round match in straight sets
on Centre Court, Graf was overcome by emotion. Twice during a news
conference, she broke down crying.
	   ``I get emotional because I don't take it for granted being
here,'' said the German, playing her 13th Wimbledon. ``It's just
special to be here.''
	   It was a remarkable display from a player who has rarely
expressed her emotions on or off the court.
	   Graf said she was surprised to be on Centre Court, the scene of
her greatest triumphs, for the opening match against Spain's Gala
Leon Garcia.
	   ``It is not common to play the first match on Centre Court
unless you win the year before, so I didn't take it as normal at
all,'' she said. ``I got really excited and it definitely pumped me
up to be playing out there.''
	   After some initial nerves, Graf settled down and beat Garcia
6-4, 6-1, a solid start to her first Grand Slam tournament since
the French Open in 1997.
	   After undergoing surgery after the French, Graf didn't return to
tournament play until March. But she was sidelined again with calf
and hamstring injuries.
	   That's when she started wondering whether her career was over.
	   ``There have been a couple of occasions where it has been really
difficult, seven or eight weeks ago was the last time,'' she said.
``I had so many little injuries and every week something else came
around.''
	   But Graf, who said she now feels ``100 percent,'' must be
considered a title contender.
	   ``There is no question it is my favorite tournament and I do
feel the grass suits my game and experience does help,'' she said.
``But winning is a long way. That is not as far as I am looking
now.''
	   Monday was also an emotional day for Monica Seles, the No. 6
seed, who beat Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Seles, who made an inspiring run to the French Open final three
weeks ago, said she has been able to concentrate fully on her game
since the death last month of her father Karolj from stomach
cancer.
	   ``It's the first time in a long time, I've had time to focus
really on tennis, and I'm really glad for it,'' she said.
	   While her career was disrupted by her stabbing in 1993 and her
father's long illness, Seles said she has never thought of
quitting.
	   ``I just love the game way too much and I wouldn't be thinking
of stopping at all at this point,'' she said. ``For the rest of my
career, I just want to win the most Grand Slams that I can.''
	   One player Graf and Seles won't have to worry about at Wimbledon
is 17-year-old Russian star Anna Kournikova.
	   Kournikova withdrew from Wimblebon on Monday with torn and
sprained ligaments in her right thumb _ an injury she suffered
during a fall in the third set of a victory against Graf at
Eastbourne last Thursday.
	   Kournikova, a semifinalist last year, has been the focus of the
buildup to this year's tournament in the British media, which has
dubbed her the ``Lobbing Lolita.''
	   ``I was hoping a miracle could happen ... but this morning when
I woke up, it was very difficult for me to move the finger,'' she
said. ``It's a very tough decision for me to make. I was really
ready and in great shape.''
	   The woman's top seed, 17-year-old defending champion Martina
Hingis, was scheduled to play her opening match Tuesday on Centre
Court against Lisa Raymond.
	   In other featured women's matches, Jana Novotna, last year's
runner-up and No. 3 seed, was up against Sandra Kleinova. And No. 6
Venus Williams faced Jana Nejedly.
	   On the men's side, No. 2 Marcelo Rios was due to play Francisco
Clavet. Fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, No. 5 Carlos Moya, No. 6
Patrick Rafter and No. 9 Richard Krajicek were also scheduled to
play.
	   Two men's seeds were eliminated on opening day. No. 7 Yevgeny
Kafelnikov lost to Australia's Mark Philippoussis, 6-7 (7-5), 7-6
(7-1), 6-4, 6-2, while No. 10 Alex Corretja was ousted in straight
sets by Justin Gimelstob.
	   Kafelnikov, winner of a Wimbledon warmup event in Germany and
one of the pre-tournament favorites, killed his chances by serving
22 double faults.
	   Top-seeded defending champion Pete Sampras eased through his
first match with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Slovakia's Dominik
Hrbaty, while 1992 champ Andre Agassi was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 winner
over Spain's Alex Calatrava.

Philippoussis upsets Kafelnikov; talks of winning Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Two weeks ago, he threatened to pull
out of Wimbledon. Now, he thinks he can win it.
	   Australian Mark Philippoussis _ sporting a shorter haircut and
his usual thumping serve _ pulled off the opening day's biggest
upset with a 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-2 victory Monday over No.
7 seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
	   That prompted him to talk boldly about winning at Wimbledon, not
a far stretch for the tall Australian who won last year's Queen's
grass-court warmup for Wimbledon _ and then lost to eventual
champion Pete Sampras in the first round at the All England Club.
	   This year, Philippoussis lost in the first round at Queen's and
_ in a fit of temper _ said he wouldn't play here.
	   ``I haven't had a great year, but I really do honestly think
there's no reason why I can't win this tournament,'' Philippoussis
said.
	   ``I'm going to say that, there's no reason why, and that's what
I really do think inside of me, and I've got to go out there and
prove it to everyone and to myself.''
	   The 21-year-old Australian, who served 21 aces and capitalized
on 22 double-faults by Kafelnikov, said he's in better shape,
weights a bit less, and credits some of his success to a new-look,
shorter haircut.
	   ``I don't know if it helped,'' he said. ``I just went to a
hairdresser ... and I said do whatever you want, and this is what
he did.''
	   Kafelnikov just looked perplexed.
	   ``I felt quite good, I felt all right,'' he said. ``It was one
of those days where you have no luck on your side. That is how I
can explain it to you.''
	   The Australian, who faces American Alex O'Brien in the second
round, took a shot at Australia's Davis Cup coach John Newcombe,
who suggested he take six months off.
	   ``How is his comment looking now?'' said Philippoussis, who has
had a running feud with Newcombe. ``That's the way to put it.''
	   He also paid tribute to his father Nick, who is fighting cancer
but made the trip to Centre Court to watch him play.
	   ``He doesn't like traveling,'' Philippoussis said. ``He just
comes to this tournament, maybe the U.S. Open, some big
tournaments, but the guy just loves the game. He just loves, you
know, seeing his son play tennis, and that brings a lot of
happiness and makes me feel relaxed on the court.''

Serena surpasses Venus in debut AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ In her Wimbledon debut, Serena
Williams did what her sister didn't do: get a victory.
	   Venus lost in her debut last year. But on Monday, 16-year-old
kid sister Serena reached the second round with a 6-4, 6-3 victory
over Italian veteran Laura Golarsa.
	   Golarsa can play well on grass, and once came within two points
of upsetting Chris Evert at Wimbledon. But that was nine years ago,
and although Golarsa made a match of it, she was no match for the
power of the young American.
	   ``I was a little nervous at first and went a little crazy,''
said Williams, after a match watched by her sister.
	   ``But now I'm past the first round I'll be able to move on. But
I think I should have won easier.''
	   Williams said she had little time to do any Wimbledon tourism _
but planned to. And she said she wasn't wild about Wimbledon's
famed strawberries and cream.
	   ``I haven't been able to see much of the atmosphere, but I want
to do the museum before my next match,'' she said. ``I had the
strawberries and cream in France. Here it seems like strawberries
and milk. The cream is too thin. It's not like whipped cream. It's
like milk and I don't like milk at all.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BIG, BLANK SCREEN: &LR;  The All England Club probably had the only
giant-screen television in the country that wasn't tuned Monday to
the soccer World Cup in France.
	   Romania beat England 2-1 Monday in Toulouse, but Wimbledon
officials declined requests to show the crucial match on a giant
screen situated in the practice area near Court No. 1.
	   ``While we thoroughly appreciate and understand that many of our
visitors will be interested in the World Cup, the tennis must
remain our first priority,'' said chief executive Chris Gorringe.
	   In the wake of riots in Marseille just over a week ago involving
English hooligans, Gorringe also cited a safety reason.
	   ``There is a saftey issue, the question of thousands on the
terrace. And what of a penalty shootout at 10:30, 10:45 at night in
the darkness? We're not geared for that.''
	   The World Cup ends July 12 with England among the favorites to
reach at least the quarterfinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MISS ANONYMOUS: &LR;  Lindsay Davenport is seeded No. 2 at Wimbledon,
but you'd never know it. She's Miss Anonymous.
	   ``I'm pretty much used to it now,'' Davenport said Monday after
a comfortable 6-2, 6-2 first-round victory over former world junior
champion Florencia Labat of Argentina.
	   ``It's tough, but it doesn't really bother me. I'm just going
out there and trying to play well and try not to worry about what
is going on in the media.''
	   Much of the pre-Wimbledon attention has focused on veterans
Steffi Graf and Monica Seles and teen stars like Martina Hingis,
Anna Kournikova (who withdrew Monday with a thumb injury) and
sisters Venus and Serena Williams.
	   ``The younger players have definitely made a name for themselves
and they love doing all the media stuff and getting the
attention,'' Davenport said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STRAWBERRY LINE: &LR;  There's no shortage of strawberries at
Wimbledon, and no price increase either.
	   Again, a cup filled with seven or eight berries and a dollop of
cream sells for 1.85 pounds (dlrs 3.05). Officials have ordered 24
tons of strawberries for the fortnight. The healthy alternative of
yogurt and strawberries costs more _ 2.85 pounds (dlrs 4.70).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PETE IN JEOPARDY: &LR;  How's this for pressure?
	   Four-time champion Pete Sampras will lose his No. 1 ATP Tour
ranking if he fails to reach the Wimbledon final.
	   Sampras, who was ranked No. 1 for 102 straight weeks before
briefly falling to No. 2 behind Marcelo Rios this spring, could
lose his No. 1 to six possible players _ Rios, Petr Korda, Carlos
Moya, Greg Rusedski, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Patrick Rafter.
	   Sampras on Monday beat Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.
The last defending champion to lose in the first round was Maunuel
Santana in 1967.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LET, ANDRE: &LR;  Andre Agassi is dead set against a proposal under
consideration by the International Tennis Federation to do away
with the let rule.
	   ``If you play (lets), I think you're just throwing in a whole
other element,'' he said. ``It just seems so random, almost
somewhat lucky.''
	   ``A lot of times in crucial serves you'll see a let. Sometimes a
couple of them in a row. I don't think they should ever play it. I
think that's ludicrous... It would be a horrific change in the
game.''
	   The rule change will be debated in July at the ITF's annual
general meeting in Ireland and could be voted on before the years
is over. Designed to speed play, the rule would mean no replay of
serves which catch the tape before going over.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   ODDS AND ENDS: &LR;  Sixteen-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic _
playing her first Wimbledon _ is just getting over a case of
chicken pox that kept her out of the French Open... No woman seeded
below No. 4 has won Wimbledon since the Open era began in
1968....The Americans topped the men's singles field with 16
entries, with Spain next with 12 .. The United States leads the
women's singles field with 17 entries... Asked why he played in
long sleeves on a mostly sunny day, Andre Agassi cracked, ``You
don't have to wear as much sunscreen.''

Teen-age sensation brightens blase day of soccer AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ At the halfway point of the World Cup, near the end
of a day when the soccer had been as dull as ditchwater, an
18-year-old wonderkid ran onto the field and spiced things up.
	   Michael Owen didn't win the game for England, but he tied the
game with seven minutes to play and nearly did it again with a
30-meter blast that hit the post in injury time.
	   In between, Dan Petrescu won a wrestling match with a defender
to score a 90th minute goal in a thrilling finish for a 2-1 victory
that put Romania into the second round and gave everyone in France
a topic other than fan violence to discuss over Tuesday morning's
croissants and coffee.
	   ``The second half,'' said Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu,
``was really a wonderful show for all.''
	   Last month, in a World Cup warmup against Morocco, Owen became
the youngest player this century to start a game for England and
the youngest ever to score a goal. Long before he entered the game
in the 73rd minute, England fans at Toulouse's Municipal Stadium
were chanting his name.
	   ``I told him to go out and enjoy himself and see if he could get
that goal,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle said. ``And it went his
way.''
	   Owen was a bundle of energy, tying the game by sliding to the
turf to net a right-footed shot after Paul Scholes had knocked down
Alan Shearer's cross from the right.
	   ``It's the case for every striker,'' Owen said. ``If you don't
set out expecting to score, you should not be a striker.''
	   Still, it must be remembered, England lost. Now it needs a win
or a draw in its final first-round game against Colombia on Friday
to join Romania as the two second-round qualifiers from Group G.
	   ``I'd rather draw 1-1 and not score,'' Owen said. ``Not winning
the match was a bitter disappointment.''
	   In Monday's other game, substitute Leider Preciado's goal in the
83rd minute gave Colombia a 1-0 victory over Tunisia. The loss,
coupled with Romania's victory, made Tunisia the sixth team
eliminated from second-round contention.
	   The Romania-England game was No. 32 on the 64-game World Cup
schedule, which starts getting frenetic Tuesday when the first of
the simultaneous group deciders are played.
	   Group B goes first, with Italy facing Austria at Saint-Denis at
the same time that Chile plays Cameroon in Nantes. All four teams
are still in the running.
	   Group A follows, with Brazil-Norway at Marseille and
Scotland-Morocco at Saint-Etienne. Brazil has already clinched
first place in the group, a possible boost for Norway should the
defending champion decide to rest some of its stars.
	   Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the Romania-England game
was that it wasn't accompanied by a riot.
	   Some 1,800 French police, wary of three days of violence that
surrounded England's first game in Marseille, were on full alert in
Toulouse. They deported known hooligans before they could even
start making trouble, imposed an 11 p.m. curfew at bars and tensely
stared down dejected clumps of English fans that congregated
afterward.
	   It worked for the most part. The one reported injury was to a
British journalist who was attacked by five hooligans and
hospitalized with a broken collar bone.
	   ``They said I was there to cause trouble and give England fans a
bad name,'' said Andrew Woodcock, who writes for the British news
agency Press Association. ``They also accused me of having a ticket
that an England fan should have had.''
	   However, across the country in Lille, a policeman continued his
fight for life as he lay in a deep coma following violence after
Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia match in nearby Lens.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was attacked by a
German fan wielding an iron bar. German police said a 27-year-old
man from Hanover was arrested for the attack. The man, whose name
wasn't released, was to appear before a judge Tuesday afternoon.
	   ``If it would have meant saving the policeman from his injuries,
I would rather have lost the match,'' said German coach Berti
Vogts. The game ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   Germany played down suggestions it was considering pulling out
of the tournament because of the Lens violence.
	   ``It might be that in the first moments of shock, the question
of a measured reaction, possibly a withdrawal, was hinted at or
raised,'' said German federation spokesman Michael Novak. ``But
within the delegation there were no serious considerations to
withdraw the team.''
	   Violence was on the minds of the top brass at FIFA, which held
an emergency meeting and emerged with a a five-step plan to quell
it. The centerpiece of the plan was FIFA president Sepp Blatter's
call for the European Union to do more to prevent known soccer
thugs from easily crossing borders.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A bus carrying day laborers lost
control on a tight curve and plunged into a lake Monday in northern
Brazil, killing 12 people.
	   The bus, carrying day laborers to an orange field in Sao Paulo
state, about 540 kilometers (335 miles) northwest of the capital,
fell some 5 meters (15 feet) after the driver lost control on a
tight curve, police chief Joao Brocanelo Neto said.
	   Police believe there were between 23 to 25 people on the bus at
the time of the accident. Those who survived the fall suffered only
minor injuries.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police seized 150,000 pirated music cassettes
in raids in houses and warehouses in Mexico City and neighboring
Mexico State, the attorney general's office reported. Five people
were arrested.
	   In addition to the pirated cassette tapes, police seized 100,000
blank tapes, 3,000 pirated compact discs and machinery to reproduce
tapes, the attorney general's office said Sunday.
	   Also seized were 28,175 articles of pirated clothing bearing the
brand name ``Edoardo's,'' it said.
	   Foreign businesses have pressed the Mexican government to crack
down on the sales of pirated goods, which are commonly available
throughout the country.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Public support is slipping for a proposed
change to Panama's constitution that would allow President Ernesto
Perez Balladares to seek re-election next year, according to a poll
published Monday.
	   Thirty-three percent of Panamanians questioned said they
approved the reform, down from 39 percent recorded in a March poll,
the daily La Prensa said. The poll, conducted by Dichter and Neira
on June 13-14, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
	   A national referendum on Aug. 30 will decide the question.
	   The latest survey of 1,224 people showed 48 percent opposed the
reform. Eleven percent were undecided and 8 percent said they would
not participate in the referendum.
	   Perez's Democratic Revolutionary Party is pushing the
constitutional amendment to end the current ban on re-election.
Perez has announced he intends to run in the May 1999 race.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Relatives and supporters of a dissident
Mexican general filed an appeal Monday against the 14-year prison
sentence he received on a charge of illegal enrichment.
	   Brig. Gen. Jose Francisco Gallardo Rodriguez has been held in a
military prison since 1993, when he wrote an article calling for a
human rights ombudsman within the military.
	   He was sentenced to 14 years in April on charges of illegally
amassing a fortune while in uniform. That followed a separate
14-year sentence on charges of corruption and destroying files.
	   Gallardo claims dlrs 340,000 that military officials say was
found in his bank account had belonged to former Defense Minister
Gen. Juan Arevalo and was to be used on improvements to Arevalo's
ranch.
	   Monday's appeal was filed before the Supreme Military Tribunal,
said Gallardo's son, Marco Vinicio Gallardo Enriquez.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's long-dominant political party
intends to slash its executive committee staff by 30 percent to
improve efficiency, a report said Monday.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party currently spends dlrs
565,000 each month on salaries for 1,200 employees. Cutting the
staff by 30 percent would save the party dlrs 170,000 a month, the
daily Reforma reported.
	   Jose Luis Stein, the National Executive Committee's secretary
for administration and finance, said the party is looking to use
its resources more effectively and eliminate job duplication.
	   The 69-year-old ruling party of President Ernesto Zedillo
dominated all levels of Mexican politics until recent years. In
1997, the party lost control of the lower house of Congress for the
first time.

	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ For a man whose job as a coach was not
looking too permanent, Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic certainly saw
things turn around at the World Cup.
	   Two weeks and two wins have made a world of difference for the
Yugoslav, who also took Mexico, Costa Rica and the United States to
the second round.
	   His job security was in doubt after a series of dismal World Cup
warmup outings. But the Super Eagles' boss has the team already
into the second round with a game to spare.
	   By rallying twice to stun Spain 3-2 in its opener and then
holding off Bulgaria 1-0, Nigeria clinched first place in Group D.
`
	   ``It's been much easier than we thought. It's great for us,''
Milutinovic said after a training session Monday. ``I did not
expect we'd have six points after two games.''
	   The coach is already looking ahead to a possible final.
	   ``Everybody hopes to be Paris on July 12,'' he said.
``Everything about the team convinces me. These players can beat
anyone. We have a lot of talent and confidence.
	   ``There are teams that are better than us but, like in life,
anything is possible at the World Cup.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT DENIS, France (AP) _ Francesco Moriero, a teammate of
Brazilian star Ronaldo with Inter Milan in the Italian League, said
he hoped to play against the Brazilians in the World Cup.
	   In the final.
	   ``This is because we don't want to eliminate Brazil too soon,''
Moriero said following Italy's training session in St. Denis
Monday.
	   Italy will be seeking victory against Austria Tuesday to qualify
for the second round as Group B winner and avoid a clash with Group
A leader Brazil.
	   Moriero wished Ronaldo to score two goals in the next match
against Norway.
	   ``He's a great player. Forza Ronnie,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's coach Hristo Bonev had decided
to impose harsh financial sanctions on two of the team's star
players - Hristo Stoichkov and Lyuboslav Penev, for boycotting a
training session.
	   According to national soccer union official Nikola Ekserov, they
boycotted a training session Monday when Bonev intended to analyze
the tactics of the Spanish squad in the buildup to Wednesday's
crucial game between the two teams.
	   Stoichkov and Penev have played for years in the Spanish league
and Bonev had expected that they'll share their experience during
that session, Ekserov said.
	   Ekserov would not specify the amount by which both will be fined
but said that Bonev has also considered the possibility to expell
both players from the team.
	   Stoichkov and Penev refused any comment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT DENIS, France (AP) _ Making his personal list of the most
impressive strikers in the first series of matches, Italian
star-forward Alessandro Del Piero listed Gabriel Batistuta,
Ronaldo, Marcelo Salas and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   ``Batistuta's three goals in one match were impressive. I can't
predict who will be the No.1 at the end of the competition,'' he
said.
	   ``Probably the star playing with the winning team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Sami Trabelsi gained the dlrs 1,000 award for
charity for his standout performance for Tunisia in Monday's 1-0
World Cup loss to Colombia.
	   The defender was voted Tunisia's player-of-the-match by a panel
of sports writers assembled by MasterCard. For each of Tunisia's
first round games against England, Colombia and Romania, MasterCard
is giving dlrs 1,000 to an SOS Children's Village.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister promised that
the national soccer soccer team, eliminated Sunday from the World
Cup competition in France, would be a contender again.
	   The team, named the Reggae Boyz, was ousted after a 5-0 drubbing
by Argentina. But Prime Minister Percival Patterson predicts the
team will improve, noting it only recently went professional.
	   ``When the West Indies started to play cricket, we were known as
the calypso cricketers and it was not long before we became the
best in the world,'' he said. ``We have started out (in soccer)
being known as the reggae team; we intend to be the best in the
world.''

As Clinton heads to China, problems worsen for pragmatic regime 
</HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ When U.S. President Clinton arrives in Beijing,
he will meet a Chinese leadership beset by deepening problems _
from a slowing economy to challenges to its own political
authority.
	   For China, the summit is a chance to show itself as an emerging,
responsible global power. But global power ultimately depends on
internal stability, and China's leaders are struggling to keep the
world's most-populous nation on a stable course.
	   Among the problems now troubling Zhongnanhai, the high-walled
leadership compound in central Beijing:
	   _New Premier Zhu Rongji, touted as a pragmatist, wants to keep
economic growth strong and force failing state industries and banks
to play by capitalist rules. But his plans are imperiled by Asia's
financial upheaval, worsening unemployment and bureaucratic
resistance.
	   _As the economy slows, risks are growing for the ruling
Communist Party. Outbursts of protest and crime by dispossessed
members of the once-protected proletariat are rocking cities.
	   _Morale in the military _ the ultimate protector of party power
_ is sinking. Feeling the economic pinch, the People's Liberation
Army's own industries are laying off workers, many of them the
wives of servicemen. Officers worry about how to support their
families on meager salaries.
	   The domestic unease has stripped some gloss off the bright
prospects for Zhu and his Cabinet, which marks its 100th day in
office Friday, the day Clinton lands in Beijing.
	   For Clinton, eight days of negotiating and toasting Chinese
leaders offers opportunities. They may be in a mood to compromise
to preserve their huge stake in the U.S. market and win a
presidential seal of approval to inspire foreign investors.
	   ``The initiative is all in the United States' hands,'' said Wang
Shan, an author and political commentator. ``China needs so many
things from the United States.''
	   At his inaugural news conference in March, Zhu promised 8
percent growth, a threshold seen as critical to meeting his
three-year goal to turn around loss-making state industries and
absorb more than 30 million state workers to be laid off.
	   The plans _ along with a paring of the bureaucracy _ would rid
the economy of the last vestiges of central planning and launch a
new phase in the acclaimed reforms that have quadrupled national
wealth and pulled tens of millions of Chinese out of poverty.
	   When Zhu was announcing his plans, few decision-makers expected
Asia's financial crisis to deteriorate and drag down China's
already slowing economy. Japan's economic torpor and sinking yen
have threatened a crucial export market and source of investment
for China.
	   Exports declined in May for the first time in nearly two years.
Foreign investment in the first five months of the year weakened.
	   Few economists now predict 8 percent growth. Even Finance
Minister Xiang Huaicheng, who insisted last week that the target
could be met, conceded ``relatively great effort will be
required.''
	   There may be a ``recession with Chinese characteristics'' _ a 5
or 6 percent clip that in other countries would be considered
booming _ said Lin Yifu, an economist at elite Beijing University.
	   Questions remain, however, whether that will be enough to create
jobs and keep simmering discontent in check. Layoffs are coming
relentlessly. Last month the coal industry alone predicted it would
lose a half-million workers in three years.
	   Hard-luck cities like Wuhan and Xi'an, once titans of centrally
planned industry, have been beset by demonstrations this month.
Some of the unemployed have turned to crime. Bombings have been
reported in Wuhan, Kunming and other cities.
	   ``People have no hope for the future,'' said Wang, the author.
	   Attempts to revive the economy and stave off unrest have taken
on ad hoc, totalitarian and even desperate overtones.
	   In a secret document, the Communist Party Central Committee
ordered all government agencies to be on guard for challenges to
the regime, Hong Kong newspapers have reported.
	   Sichuan province has ordered every official to ``adopt'' an
unemployed worker. As one solution, Chongqing city's state-run
trade union federation gave laid-off women textile workers
shoeshine boxes.
	   In the rust-belt capital of Shenyang, the mayor has peddled
state industries for as little as 12 cents. The catch: The buyers
must assume the enterprise's debts and massive social welfare
payments. There have been few takers.

	   PORNIC, France (AP) _ Summer vacation started early for the U.S.
soccer team, which moved to a Brittany beach resort on Monday as
the shock of World Cup elimination set in.
	   After Sunday night's 2-1 loss to Iran, American players returned
to their chateau in Beaujolais wine country and sat around the
swimming pool until the wee hours, trying to figure out what went
wrong.
	   They then jetted across France on Monday and settled in a
seaside village west of Nantes to prepare for Thursday's World Cup
finale against Yugoslavia, little more than an exhibition for the
United States.
	   ``The joke around camp is we don't have to worry about security
_ except from Sam's Army,'' Brian McBride said, referring to the
American group of fans who followed the team to the World Cup.
	   In brilliant sunshine, with the Atlantic surf crashing into the
beach, players shuffled across the hotel grounds for a bus ride to
one of their final practices, in nearby Saint-Marie du Mer.
	   ``I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of
disappointment from the fans and, I think, the general public,''
Alexi Lalas said.
	   Players laughed and joked during the workout, and some sounded
like they were trying to convince themselves the loss wasn't all
that bad. Others admitted it was brutal, probably the lowest moment
for American soccer since 1985, when they failed in World Cup
qualifying for the ninth straight time.
	   ``The tournament's over for us. There's nothing to really
discuss,'' said forward Eric Wynalda, told not to speak to
reporters Sunday night after he was benched in the loss.
	   Coach Steve Sampson started Roy Wegerle and McBride at forward
against Iran, concluding Wynalda played an ineffectual game in the
2-0 opening loss to Germany. Wynalda, the Americans' career scoring
leader, has just two goals in his last 17 games with the national
team, including one on a penalty kick.
	   ``I would have liked to have him out there because he's a
dangerous player,'' Joe-Max Moore said. ``We needed someone to
score goals and he's the guy who's going to do it.''
	   Sampson refused to give a direct answer when asked whether he
benched Wynalda because he didn't like the effort against Germany
and in practice. He instead talked about other forwards and the
problems Wynalda had in coming back from arthroscopic knee surgery
on April 16.
	   ``It' difficult to come back at this level and play and have an
impact,'' Sampson said. ``I had hoped the excitement of the event
would allow Eric to work through this and have an impact in the
Germany match, but it just didn't come.''
	   Sampson was undecided about starting veterans, young players or
a mix against the Yugoslavs, one of Europe's top teams. He already
was looking ahead to the future of U.S. soccer, which seemed on the
upswing after the team advanced to the second round in 1994 and
then qualified for its third straight World Cup.
	   He maintained this team played a better and more offensive game
than the 1994 group. He quickly was asked if the American public,
not known for a great interest in soccer, will believe that.
	   ``The bottom line is the American public isn't going to buy
anything until we're world champions. You go in knowing that,''
Sampson said. ``Those of us who know the game will know the subtle
changes.''
	   Sampson, who may be let go later this year, and other U.S.
soccer officials have set a goal of winning the tournament by 2010.
In the fallout of Sunday night's loss, it seems unreachable.
	   After talking for weeks about how they wanted to be treated as
equals by the big European soccer powers, the Americans learned
they're still far away. The question is how the U.S. Soccer
Federation can close the gap.
	   ``The blueprint exists on the Internet _ and I've written it,''
Sampson said. ``The identification of players at an early age who
have great athletic ability. We must do a better job of attracting
the best athletes the United States has to offer into the sport of
soccer.''
	   Players, many of whom will never play in another World Cup,
didn't want to think that far ahead. They still hoped to avoid
matching the 1990 team, which went 0-3 and finished next to last in
the 24-nation field.
	   ``Yeah, you can make that comparison,'' Jeff Agoos said. ``I
think this is a better team than went to Italy.''

More protests, fire heavily damages government building in Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and pellet guns
Monday at hundreds of protesters demanding that Guyana's new
president resign, and a fire heavily damaged the finance ministry
building.
	   It was not clear whether the blaze, which injured four people,
was related to the political unrest in the South American country.
Police said they had investigated a telephone bomb threat at the
three-story wooden building earlier Monday.
	   Chanting ``Janet must go!'', about 500 protesters _ most from
the opposition People's National Congress _ marched downtown to
demand that U.S.-born President Janet Jagan resign. Some overturned
police cars.
	   Police responded by firing tear gas and pellets at the
demonstrators. Several were slightly hurt. They fled, only to renew
their protests in other areas.
	   Jagan, who took over the presidency after her husband, President
Cheddi Jagan, died in 1997, was officially elected to the top post
on Dec. 15 in voting that the opposition contends was fraudulent. A
subsequent audit of ballots by the Caribbean Community found
irregularities but still concluded that Jagan won.
	   The loser, Congress leader and former president, Desmond Hoyte,
blamed the violence on police brutality during protests last week.
Hoyte also blamed the government, which he said had backed out of a
deal to discuss constitutional reforms to give the two main ethnic
groups a more equal share in government.
	   ``These are people demonstrating against a government they
believe is not legal,'' Hoyte told The Associated Press in an
interview.
	   The deal, brokered by the 15-member Caribbean Community economic
bloc to end violent protests in January, called for Jagan's
People's Progressive Party and Hoyte's Congress to form a
commission to discuss reforms and call early elections.
	   Race riots broke out following the elections as Guyanese of
African descent, who primarily support Hoyte's party, protested the
win by Jagan's party, backed mainly by people of East Indian
descent.
	   Jagan's party has demanded that Congress members take up their
25 seats in the 65-seat Parliament before it discusses reforms. But
Hoyte said there was no requirement that the reform dialogue take
place in Parliament.
	   Jagan said Sunday she would not step down.
	   Hoyte, who was president from 1985 until he was defeated by
Cheddi Jagan in 1992, denied that Monday's protests were organized
by his party, although he said he planned a rally Wednesday to
``put some order into the demonstrations.''

World Cup: English spies give Romania victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In the end, Romania's ``English spies''
decided the outcome.
	   Goals by Coventry striker Viorel Moldovan and defender Dan
Petrescu of Chelsea put Romania into the second round and left
England's World Cup fate resting on its final first-round game
against Colombia on Friday. The 2-1 result Monday also eliminated
last-place Tunisia.
	   ``The game brought us from ecstasy and agony and vice versa, and
I was close to having a heart attack,'' Romania coach Anghel
Iordanescu said.
	   In the 90th minute, Petrescu, an offensive fullback whose
devastating runs down the right wing sow panic among opponents, put
the ball into the net while wrestling with a defender. His goal put
Romania in the final 16.
	   Charging into the 6-yard box, Petrescu held back Graeme Le Saux
_ his teammate on the English club Chelsea _ by putting his right
arm across Le Saux's neck. Then Petrescu slid his left foot in
front of the defender to poke the ball between the legs of
goalkeeper David Seaman.
	   ``This is the greatest moment of my life,'' Petrescu said. ``I
scored a winning goal (against the United States) in the last World
Cup, but compared to this feeling, it meant nothing.''
	   Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, playing his 112th international, set
up Moldovan for the goal that gave Romania the lead two minutes
after halftime. Hagi chipped from the right to Moldovan, who
chested the ball down and sent it past David Seaman from 6 yards.
	   Petrescu, who feels at home when it comes to British soccer,
helped Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu devise the game plan.
	   Romania's skillful and tight passing game and speedy bursts
created problems for the English, whose defense made several key
errors.
	   ``This is a well-deserved victory for our players, who made
tremendous efforts to obtain it,'' Iordanescu said. ``They played
with their heart, soul and with intelligence.''
	   A visibly disappointed England coach Glenn Hoddle said, ``We
gave away two sloppy goals and it cost us. We had sloppy
defending.''
	   ``We didn't take our chances, yet we gave them some ridiculous
chances and they took them,'' Hoddle added. ``Now we know what we
have got to do against Colombia.''
	   One thing he might do is start 18-year-old Michael Owen, who
became the youngest player to score for England in a World Cup. He
appeared to save his team with an 83rd-minute goal. Owen, who
entered the game in the second half, also hit the left post from 30
yards in injury time.
	   ``I'd rather draw 1-1 and not score,'' Owen said. ``Not winning
the match was a bitter disappointment.''
	   The game was a potential flashpoint for fan violence following
the riots that surrounded England's game last week against Tunisia.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags. A British journalist was attacked by five hooligans and
hospitalized with a broken collarbone.

World Cup: As Tunisia loses face, hopes hinge on Morocco and Iran to regain it for Muslims BY TAREK EL-TABLAWY 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ For weeks, Tunisia has been claiming
it has the ability to surprise in the World Cup. But after its 2-0
defeat to England, and its 1-0 loss to Colombia, surprise is hardly
the word to describe the team's performance.
	   The defeat ``hit hard at our confidence and our spirit,'' team
coach Henri Kasperczak said after Monday's match during which
Tunisia's failure to follow through on opportunity after
opportunity to score, effectively eliminated it from the
competition.
	   If, however, Tunisian fans are not lamenting the loss as
severely as expected, it is because other Arab and Muslim teams had
that extra edge, and the ability to surprise, which Tunisia failed
to display in its two matches.
	   ``Sure I'm disappointed,'' fan Ahmed Hazem, 31, told The
Associated Press. ``But I can still take pride in Morocco's
accomplishments and, in a way, those of Iran.''
	   While Morocco suffered a crushing 3-0 thrashing from defending
champions Brazil, it showed in its first match against Norway,
which ended 2-2, that it has the ability to hold its on the
international soccer pitch.
	   More surprising was Iran, a team which was not favored to
anything but go home early. Although it lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia, in
a match whose political undercurrents outweighed those of a simple
soccer match, the Islamic republic's 2-1 win over nemesis United
States came as an athletic and political victory celebrated among
Shiite Muslims throughout the Middle East.
	   ``As much as the (World) Cup is about proving your abilities on
the soccer field, its also a chance for us Arabs and Muslims to
show the world that we will not allow the West to wipe the floor
with us,'' said Hazem.
	   ``Western countries have placed Arabs under sanctions, branded
all Muslims as terrorists...and generally ignored our voice,'' he
said. ``But on the soccer field, we have as much chance of winning
as they do. This is a chance for national and regional honor.''
	   It was Saudi Arabia's two losses, the first to Denmark, 0-1, and
the second to France, 4-0, that prompted the kingdom's soccer
federation to sack Brazilian coach Alberto Parerira and to issue an
apology to the ``loving, loyal fans`` not just at home, but also
the ``Arab and Muslim world for failing to meet their hopes and
expectations.''
	   Similar feelings are shared by the Tunisian squad, whose
assistant coach Ali el-Selmi had said that one of the team's
objectives was not just to play well, but to ``honor Arab soccer''
as well.
	   The goal, however, was not to be reached in Monday's match.
Tunisia, though playing a markedly improved game, was incapable of
carrying through on its at-first lethargic drives into Colombia's
half of the field.
	   Both Mehdi Ben Slimane and Skander Souayah were offered several
chances to score, but seemed to err on the side of caution, giving
Colombia's defenders and goalie ample chance to move into position.
	   ``It's a shame that the whole team has to pay the price for the
difference in (the abilities) of the offense and defense,''team
captain Sami Trabelsi said.
	   If Tunisia had hopes of a fighting chance after that match, they
were shattered when Group G rivals Romania knocked England aside
with a 2-1 win later on Monday.
	   With Tunisia now joining Saudi in being eliminated, hopes now
rest mainly on Morocco. It is a pressure the Moroccans themselves
are feeling.
	   ``We're not just carrying the hopes of 30 million Moroccans, but
those of at least 150 million Arabs on our shoulders,'' said
Moroccan striker Abdeljilil Hadda. ``It's not an easy burden to
bear.''
	   But bear it they will when the Atlas Lions attempt to do what
Tunisia and Saudi Arabia could not _ qualify for the final-16 of
soccer's premier competition.
	   ``A win for Morocco (against Scotland) is a win for the Arabs,''
said fan Hazem. ``If they make it through to the second round, they
are setting the groundwork for other Arab teams to also make us
proud in the future, God willing.''

Hundreds mourn victims of Mexico massacre 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ACTEAL, Mexico (AP) _ Hundreds of people prayed and wept Monday
at a Mass for 45 people gunned down by a vigilante force six months
ago, and many complained the people involved in the slaying remain
at large.
	   ``The paramilitaries ... remain free and are preparing to attack
us again if we return to our original communities,'' said Ernesto
Mendez Paciencia, a survivor of the Dec. 22 attack.
	   More than 800 people driven from their communities by violence
in the surrounding area are to return home on Thursday in a program
sponsored by state officials. They are to be accompanied by human
rights observers.
	   The massacre occurred when a pro-government vigilante group,
apparently seeking revenge for attacks on government supporters,
gunned down members of a group called Las Abejas as they left a
church in this hamlet north of San Cristobal de las Casas.
	   Las Abejas sympathizes with the leftist Zapatista National
Liberation Army, but preaches non-violence. Many of those who died
were among some 9,000 people in the Chenalho region who have been
driven from their homes by threats or attacks.
	   The government arrested or opened criminal investigations
against 150 people in the slaying, and Gov. Julio Cesar Ruiz Ferro
was forced to resign after evidence emerged that lower-ranking
state officials had collaborated with the vigilante group and
ignored early reports of the massacre.
	   Women in hand-woven Indian shawls lit candles and sang before an
altar made of wooden poles and laminated roofing.
	   Priest Pedro Arriaga assured the worshippers that ``the force of
Jesus accompanies us to achieve peace with justice and dignity.''
	   Survivors complained that some of those involved in the
vigilante group remained at large and that other vigilantes operate
in the region.

World Cup: South Korea: same goal, different coach 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ It may be a different coach, but
the goal remains the same. In fact, for South Korea at the World
Cup, the objective has remained unchanged for a long, long time.
	   Still winless after five World Cup appearances and 13 World Cup
matches, with a record of three draws and 10 defeats, South Korea
is simply looking to win just one match _ enough to justify its
co-hosting of the 2002 tourney with Japan.
	   The team arrived at this World Cup determined to post the
landmark win, but their campaign has been one disaster after
another.
	   The team's star-striker Hwang Sun-hong has been sidelined with a
knee injury since the start of the tournament, while several other
players also suffered a variety of health problems.
	   But the most harmful incident was midfielder Ha Seok-ju's red
card for back-tackling a Mexican, which may have cost the team the
match.
	   Following its 3-1 loss to Mexico, South Korea then sustained a
crushing 5-0 defeat at the hands of the Dutch, bringing to mind the
nation's early days in the World Cup.
	   The first time the nation qualified for the World Cup finals, in
Switzerland in 1954, it suffered a stunning 9-0 loss to Hungary
before another massive 7-0 defeat to Turkey.
	   The team's performance in France was doubly disappointing for
the nation, which had seen its best and most promising campaign at
the last World Cup in 1994 in the United States.
	   Then, South Korea displayed an iron will, rallying back from a
2-0 deficit to tie Spain in its opening match. It also managed to
draw 0-0 with Bolivia, before showing another burst of spirit
against Germany, when, down 3-0, the Asian team scored twice to
narrow the final score to 3-2.
	   Now, if it still hopes to receive a welcome-home party, the
South Korean team will have to pull out its heavy artillery against
Belgium on Thursday in its final match in France.
	   But the Belgians, who drew against Mexico and the Netherlands,
are in desperate need of a win over South Korea to keep their
second round chances alive.
	   ``The Belgian team will be on the attack,'' said Kim. ``They've
tied two games and they need a win to advance.
	   ``We don't expect to catch the Belgians off guard. We expect
them to know our team well. We're not saying we expect to win
against them but we're not intimidated by them.''

World Cup: Talk of Cha now taboo 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Look forwards, not back seemed to
be the South Korean team's motto during training on Monday.
	   Though the team was unusually open about its strategies and game
plans, players refused to talk about deposed-coach Cha Bum-kun,
fired after the team's bruising 5-0 loss to the Netherlands on
Saturday.
	   ``The players don't want to talk about it,'' said team
vice-manager Chun Hanjin. ``It's kind of a taboo thing.''
	   It also seems that Cha is a no-no topic in his homeland, with
Samsung Electronics reportedly pulling television commercials
featuring Cha giving a pep talk to players.
	   Cha, the most successful and talked-about player in the history
of South Korean football, and still the most successful foreign
player ilhe Bundesliga, has now become an uncomfortable topic.
	   The sacking of the 45-year-old former star has stirred up mixed
reactions in his homeland.
	   South Korean xournalists report that half of the South Korean
public regrets his failure but feels Cha should receive a second
chance. Many are also aghast at the timing, just days before South
Korea's final match against Belgium next Thursday. The South
Koreans are still looking for their first World Cup victory in five
appearances, hoping to post the landmark win before the 2002
tourney they are co-hosting with Japan.
	   But the other camp believes that someone must shoulder the blame
and that Cha rightly deserved to be fired.
	   The team is now trying to recover from recent events _ its
losses to Mexico and the Netherlands, as well as Cha's dismissal _
in time for Thursday's match against Belgium in Paris at the Parc
des Princes.
	   The team's makeshift coach, Kim Pyung-seok, is now feeling the
heat, but unlike Cha, refused to forecast a South Korean victory.
	   ``Before we start making any hasty judgements or predictions I
just want to show that the Korean players are doing their utmost,''
said Kim. ``I want them to go out and play their best and for the
South Korean public to see that.
	   ``We're confident. I'm not saying we're going to win but we're
not intimidated by them.''
	   Kim appeared less secretive than Cha, and unafraid to reveal his
tactics.
	   ``Our players will focus on defense for the first half,'' said
Kim. ``Then in the second, when the Belgians tire a bit, we'll
focus on the offense.
	   ``We'll also keep a close eye on Belgium's key player Marc
Wilmots. I don't think we should have too much trouble marking
Belgium's strikers Luc Nilis (PSV Eindhoven) and Luis Oliveira
(Fiorentina).''
	   Kim has decided to start Kim Byung-j{ in t4- net on Thursday,
despite the fact the goalkeeper has let in eight goals in just two
matches.
	   The team will once again have to play without star-striker Hwang
Sun-hong, still sidelined with a knee injury sustained shortly
before the start of the World Cup.
	   Hong Myung-bo, a key element in South Korean's defence, is not a
100 percent of his form, said coach Kim. The coach also informed
reporters that Kim Tae-young has a light injury to his right leg.

World Cup: Iran's World Cup appearance boost in the arm for soccer 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Re-emerging from the turmoil of
revolution and war, Iranian soccer is getting a much-needed shot in
the arm with the national team's first World Cup appearance in 20
years.
	   So far, the three-time Asian champions have done better than
expected at the World Cup. They are unashamed of their 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia, a game in which they were expected to crumble against a
highly rated opponent.
	   Iran's stunning 2-1 victory Sunday over the United States, a
political foe for 20 years, was almost as good as winning the World
Cup itself for many Iranians.
	   ``It will go down in history that Iran won this game at the
World Cup. This will be a great boost for Iranian soccer, and for
lovers of soccer in Iran,'' said Iran's head coach Jalal Talebi,
himself a long-time U.S. resident, after the game in Lyon.
	   Soccer is a passion in Iran. When it clinched the last of 32
World Cup berths by edging Australia in an away game, millions
danced and celebrated in the streets of Tehran. Those scenes were
repeated after Sunday's win against the United States _ a country
branded ``The Great Satan'' by hard-line Muslim leaders.
	   With few soccer fields and other sports facilities available,
kids learn the game and hone their skills in the streets and alleys
around the country. On the weekend when traffic is thin, kids block
off side roads for rousing games, usually played with a cheap
plastic ball.
	   ``That's how nearly all of our players learned their soccer,''
said Amir Yazdjerdi, a writer for Abrar Varzeshi, the largest
sports daily in Tehran.
	   With more than half the population of 60 million under 16,
encouraging sports is important for the Iranian government.
	   In recent years, more and more Iranian players have made a name
in some of the world's best clubs.
	   Strikers Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and Khodadad Azizi all play in
Germany's first division Bundesliga, and a fourth player, Alireza
Mansourian, says he also has an offer from a German club.
	   Mehdi Mahdavikia, identified as Iran's rising star, especially
after scoring the second goal against the United States, has an
offer from Italy's highly-rated Inter Milan.
	   With 19 goals, Bagheri was the top overall scorer in Iran's
qualifying run.
	   ``Coming to the World Cup is a great boost for Iranian soccer,''
said Yazdjerdi. ``It's going to make kids even more passionate
about the sport, and more Daeis, Azizis and Mahdivikia's are going
to emerge,'' he said.
	   During the turmoil following Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution that
ousted the U.S.-backed shah, and the 1980-88 war with Iran, Iranian
soccer virtually died.
	   It was at its peak just before the revolution, when Iran played
at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina for the first time. It was
beaten 3-0 by Holland, and 4-1 by Peru, but managed an impressive
0-0 draw against Scotland.
	   The Iranian Football federation was founded in 1920, and became
an affiliate of the world soccer federation FIFA in 1945.
	   When Iran got its first taste of international competition at
the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, it was a far cry from Iran's first game
against Afghanistan in Kabul in 1941. The game was a 0-0 tie.
	   The golden age of Iranian soccer began in the late 1960s. Iran
clinched its first Asian title in 1968, and won twice more in 1972
and 1976.
	   Some of the country's best soccer talent left the country during
the war, or left sports to try to make a living.
	   Talebi, the Iranian coach, was forced to leave in 1983 because
he wanted a job in soccer and there was none in Iran. He left for
the United Arab Emirates, and later moved to the United States.

French blame German squads of `thugs' for violence

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The matches went on, but much of the soccer
world's attention was on a hospital in this northern French city,
where a policeman lay struggling for his life after his head was
bashed in by a German fan wielding an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma
after suffering ``repeated violent blows from a massive object''
after Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said
Monday night. They could barely hide their pessimism about his
chances.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars appeared to
keep most violence in check.
	   The exception was a British reporter who was attacked by English
fans. Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association broke his collarbone
when the fans, who accused him of giving them a bad name, threw him
to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge Tuesday afternoon.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged. One
German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in connection
with weekend mayhem.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounced ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''

Italian chamber to vote on NATO expansion 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Debate resumes at 0830 GMT, vote expected around 1000 GMT
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's government appears to have secured the votes
it needs in the lower house of parliament to ratify NATO's eastward
expansion.
	   As Tuesday's vote in the Chamber of Deputies approached, Premier
Romano Prodi's center-left government had been having trouble
rounding up the necessary votes because its usual ally, the
Communists, oppose NATO expansion.
	   But Monday night, the center-right opposition decided to vote
for NATO expansion. However, its leader, Silvio Berlusconi, also
called on the government to resign. He said any government
opposition help on something so important clearly lacked the
backing to continue governing.
	   The spat did not appear to be a serious threat to the government
since the Communists have said they'll back Prodi if things come to
a confidence vote.
	   The chamber was expected to vote on NATO by midday.
	   On the eve of the vote, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini asked
lawmakers to put aside their differences and say yes to letting
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic join NATO.
	   The alliance's expansion, he argued, is a ``huge strategic
choice'' for Italy and deserves approval ``by a large consensus.''
	   The Senate has already ratified the expansion, which must be
approved by all 16 NATO countries as well as the three membership
candidates.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Excerpts from Louise Woodward's interview with
British Broadcasting Corp. television, broadcast Monday:
	   On her relationship with the Eappen family: ``I liked them. When
I was living there, particularly Sunil. I think we got on pretty
well. We had our ups and downs. I mean I'd only been living there
10 weeks. And I was 18 and there were the normal frictions that you
might expect when somebody comes to live in your home.''
	   ``I think that they felt guilty about leaving their children
throughout the day and I think that they possibly overcompensated a
little when they came home. They were pretty devoted parents when
they were there, but they worked very long hours. Usually there was
only one parent in the house at a time. They would take turns to
come each night, to come home and take the children from me. So I
think there was certainly a lot of guilt on their part that they
were leaving the house and not being with their children as much as
they should.''
	   Asked if she resented a curfew set by Sunil Eappen, she replied,
``A little. I felt that I was over 18 and it really should be up to
me to decide when I go to bed, and that if they were entrusting me
with their children and their home in the day, I felt that they
should trust me to know what time I should go to bed.''
	   On the Eappens' reaction to her staying out late: ``Well, Sunil
was furious with me he was very angry and he shouted at me and we
had quite a scene in the kitchen and he was yelling at me I told
him I didn't appreciate being spoken to like that.''
	   ``I certainly have no love for them. They did their very best to
get me in prison, I just don't feel there is anything I could say
to them that they don't know already.''
	   Asked if she had any feelings for the fact that they lost a
child she said: ``Of course I do. I am not accusing anyone of
anything, because I don't know what happened either.
	   ``I don't know and I said that from the beginning. All I have
ever been able to say is, I don't know what happened, but I know
what didn't happen, and I can only ever tell you that.''
	   On the Eappen children: ``Well, they were adorable. Brendan was
very advanced for his age. You could hold a conversation with him
he was very talkative and Matty was a very sweet baby. He was
smiley, playful and they were just beautiful children.''
	   Matthew ``wasn't sitting up yet on his own. He could manage
maybe possibly a minute, tops, and then he would fall over. And
usually there would be cushions around him or you'd be sitting with
him.
	   ``But there was a ... the day before he went to hospital there
was a time when he fell and I thought he was rather close to the
steps ... and in telling Debbie of times where I thought he may
have hit his head because I was asked, I explained that I thought
he could have hit his head. I wasn't sure, I didn't see it. And he
didn't seem hurt at the time.''
	   ``The only thing that was on my conscience was that I may not
have done enough, but I know I did every thing I could, that
everything I was capable of doing I did. I know that I did nothing
to cause it.''
	   On the jury that convicted her of murder: ``I don't think they
understood the medical evidence. I think it is incredibly difficult
to try and explain neurosurgery and a doctor's life's work to an
ordinary lay person and expect them to understand and be able to
have two doctors giving two extremely different interpretations of
the same piece of evidence and to expect a lay person to chose
between the two I think is impossible.''
	   On why some commentators described her as ``cold'' in the
witness box: ``I guess maybe it is the British in me that I'm
naturally restrained. I saw it as my big chance to tell everybody,
and I did hold back with crying, because I was trying so
desperately to tell my story, to tell what happened.''
	   On Judge Hiller Zobel's decision to reduce her murder conviction
to involuntary manslaughter: ``I think he made a moral decision. I
think he knew this was not right, that this was a miscarriage and I
think he did the best he could under the circumstances.''
	   On her sentence: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an
innocent person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing,
worry and pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up
in a prison in a strange country _ and please remember that I was
18 when I went into prison _ and being scared, for something that
you didn't even do.''
	   On the court's recommendation that she be prevented from working
with children: ``I feel almost that I've lost the right to look at
a child, that I've lost the right to tell a mother that her child
is beautiful, or to coo at a baby. And I do feel a stigma, but
that's something personally that I'll have to get over.''

Israel says Palestinian rhetoric is obstacle to peace 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo GAZ101
By NICOLAS B. TATRO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On a recent episode of the Palestinian TV show
``Children's Club'' the kids took a break from games and puppet
skits to listen to a song.
	   ``Now we sing for the revolution and olive trees. We've stopped
being pampered,'' sang an 8-year-old Palestinian boy. ``Now we
throw bombs and burn our enemies.''
	   Extremist rhetoric laces Palestinian public discourse at all
levels _ mosque sermons, newspaper editorials, politician's
statements, even children's television. Israeli officials say that
without the backing of Palestinian public opinion, militants would
not be able to carry out bombings and shootings.
	   And they believe Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's failure to
curb hate speech is a prime symbol of what's wrong with the peace
process.
	   ``The sorts of terrorism we are facing are ones that find it
very difficult to operate without a sympathetic environment,'' said
Daniel Taub, a Foreign Ministry legal expert. ``Incitement is the
sort of thing that helps generate that environment.''
	   Taub cited the official naming of a public square in the Gaza
Strip after slain Hamas master bomber Yehiya Ayyash, calling it an
act that ``seriously undermined'' anti-terror statements by the
Palestinian leadership.
	   The militant rhetoric also plays out in the streets, where there
is indulgence _ sometimes even encouragement _ of Palestinian
children who confront Israeli soldiers with insults and stones,
putting themselves at risk of injury or death.
	   Reports issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office
list myriad examples of hostile propaganda.
	   A Palestinian Authority press release likened Israeli security
practices to those of Nazi soldiers, and an editorial in al-Hayat
al-Jeddida, a Palestinian Authority-backed newspaper, compared
Zionism with Nazism.
	   Such comparisons are particularly offensive to Israelis, many of
whom lost relatives to the Nazi Holocaust.
	   Also cited was a sermon in which the chief Muslim authority in
Jerusalem, Mufti Ikrima Sabri, an Arafat appointee, refers to Jews
as ``the sons of monkeys and pigs.''
	   Ahmed Tibi, a political adviser to Arafat, dismissed the Israeli
complaints and said Netanyahu was more interested in
``point-scoring'' and finding excuses not to make peace.
	   ``Are there some bad statements by Palestinians? Yes. Is it
official policy? Of course not,'' said Tibi, who monitors Israeli
media.
	   Palestinians contend Israel has been no less derelict in halting
hatemongers in its camp. Netanyahu, for example, has failed to
remove a shrine erected by extremists at the grave of Baruch
Goldstein, a settler who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in a
Hebron mosque in 1994.
	   The Israeli government also supports legalization of Channel 7,
a pirate radio station that has broadcast diatribes by Jewish
settlers against the peace process.
	   A study by Tibi cites a call on Channel 7 for listeners to
``raise a toast'' to an Israeli jailed in 1990 for gunning down
seven Palestinians in a highway shooting.
	   Mark Heller, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said a lot of the complaints
about Palestinian rhetoric was ``grandstanding'' and playing to
Western audiences, especially in the United States.
	   ``There is a lot of disillusionment among Israelis that this
government is able to play to very successfully,'' Heller said,
noting that about 250 Israelis have been killed since the 1993
peace agreement was signed.
	   A centerpiece of the debate over hate speech is ``Children's
Club,'' aired on official Palestinian TV. In the United States,
supporters of Israel distributed a package to each member of
Congress detailing examples of such rhetoric on Palestinian TV,
with the show prominently featured.
	   As a result, U.S. aid for the Palestinian Broadcast Authority _
in the form of cameras and editing equipment _ was cut off this
year, according to Duncan MacInnes, spokesman for the U.S.
Consulate in Jerusalem.
	   But the producer of the kids' show, Jamila Abu Shanab, said the
aim of the show was to ``introduce children to their national
identity.''
	   ``We never teach the children to hate their neighbors,'' she
said.
	   The Palestinian position received at least partial backing from
a study sent to Congress by U.S. officials in Israel. They said
some things about the show had been taken out of context and made
to seem more inflammatory than they were, according to Macinnes.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC is confronting an oil price crisis
by pledging new production cuts, and Kuwait gave markets a bit of
optimism by suggesting the exporters might need to slash output
even more than promised.
	   But the Kuwaiti oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, would
not say whether the biggest OPEC producer, Saudi Arabia, will face
pressure from the others to reduce its production by more than the
225,000 barrels a day already pledged.
	   ``I'm not naming anybody,'' Sheik Saud told reporters as he
arrived late Monday for the OPEC meeting, which formally opens
Wednesday. More delegations were arriving Tuesday.
	   The Saudis have promised the biggest cuts, but they are by far
the biggest producers, pumping some 8.5 million barrels a day out
of OPEC's total daily production of 28.2 million barrels.
	   Others in the group can't help but notice that the promised
Saudi cuts are proportionately smaller than those being made by
others who agreed to withhold oil from the market.
	   Sheik Saud said earlier that if the latest round of production
cuts fails to lift the market, then more cuts must be considered.
His comments pushed crude oil futures prices higher on Monday.
	   Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi's huge production makes him the
most influential player in OPEC, but his influence left the oil
producers in trouble after the Saudis pushed through a plan late
last year to raise production in the winter.
	   OPEC started pumping more crude just as the Asian economic
crisis began choking off the growth in world demand, and prices
have plunged to their lowest levels in 12 years. It's been a
bargain for consumers, including gasoline-craving Americans, but a
nightmare for the producers who will have severe problems meeting
their national budget targets if prices don't pick up quickly.
	   ``We hope to get a fair price for our crude _ something like
dlrs 18 to dlrs 20,'' said the United Arab Emirates oil minister,
Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri.
	   OPEC tried to solve the problem in March by agreeing to some
1.245 million barrels of production cuts, but the ministers
delivered a little less than a million barrels that they had
promised. Now, the new cuts being pledged come to just 620,000
barrels a day.
	   Even though non-OPEC producers Mexico, Russia, Oman and Egypt
have tried to help with promises to take another 223,000 barrels
off the market, analysts say the latest effort will come up short.
Traders are looking for cuts of 1 million barrels a day or more.
	   It remains to be seen whether OPEC can do more this week, or
whether it will take the pain of continued weak prices to force
stronger action.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen on
profit-taking early Tuesday, while Tokyo stock prices fell amid
bearish sentiment over Japan's economy.
	   The dollar bought 137.61 yen in early morning, down 0.93 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
138.16 yen overnight.
	   Overseas players sold dollars to book profits after the U.S.
currency's steep rise Monday after the Japanese government failed
to offer concrete steps to prop up the yen at a weekend meeting of
Group of Seven industrialized nations.
	   Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
jointly intervened to halt the yen's slide after the dollar hit an
eight-year high against the Japanese currency.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 158.14 points, or 1.03 percent, to 15,150.95 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei gained 41.11
points, or 0.27 percent.
	   Stocks moved lower as investors wait for more details of
Japanese government measures to tackle the nation's sagging economy
and bad debt problems at banks in coming weeks.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with details by July 8 of a proposed ``bridge bank''
that will take over bank debt, a main negative factor weighing on
the economy.
	   Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose shares plunged on
Monday by 50 yen, the limit allowed under exchange rules, rose 14
yen to 76 yen by early Tuesday.
	   News reports said that government and LDP officials met late
Monday and vowed support for the troubled bank.
	   The main trigger for the steep drop in the bank's shares, which
began Friday, was the expectation that more aggressive efforts by
the government to clean up bad debts would mean letting weak banks
fail.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 5.72 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,181.59. The
TOPIX closed up 0.04 points, insignificant in percentage terms, the
day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.245 percent from Monday's finish of 1.255
percent, driving its price higher to 111.64 yen from 111.57 yen.

Talks break off after 30 minutes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Talks between the National Basketball
Association and the players' union broke off Monday after just 30
minutes, and no new sessions are scheduled prior to the expiration
of the current labor agreement at midnight, June 30.
	   Commissioner David Stern, union director Billy Hunter and
players association president Patrick Ewing were among those in
attendance for the meeting.
	   ``Neither side had anything new to offer,'' league spokesman
Chris Brienza said. ``There was no talk of a moratorium.''
	   The sides have made little progress in almost two months of
negotiations aimed at replacing the current collective bargaining
agreement. Unless a dramatic and unforeseen change of events takes
place, a lockout is expected to be imposed by the league beginning
July 1.
	   The union proposed a no strike, no lockout moratorium at a
bargaining session last week, but the offer was contingent on teams
being able to consummate trades and sign free agents _ terms that
were unacceptable to the league.
	   The sides are far apart on a variety of issues. The league wants
a hard salary cap to replace the current soft cap, a phase out of
the Larry Bird exception which allows teams to re-sign their own
veteran free agents at any price, a longer-term rookie salary scale
and a new drug agreement.
	   Stern claims that almost half the league's 29 teams lost money
last season, while the union says that number is closer to four.
	   The first apparent casualties of the labor stalemate were the 12
NBA players selected for the world championships. They were removed
from the team last week after refusing to commit to playing in the
tournament July 29-Aug. 9 in Athens, Greece, in the event of a
lockout.
	   USA Basketball, the sport's national governing body, plans to
replace the 12 NBA players with a team of CBA players and Americans
currently playing overseas.
	   The current collective bargaining agreement was due to run for
six years, but owners voted 27-2 in April to reopen the agreement.
They had the right to do so if the amount of basketball-related
income paid out in salaries rose above 51.8 percent. The league
claims that number reached 57 percent last season.

University tells Asian newspapers international students welcome 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian National University
has appealed to prospective fee-paying students from Asia not to be
scared off by the rise of anti-Asian immigration politician Pauline
Hanson.
	   University vice-chancellor Deane Terrell wrote letters Monday to
the editors of newspapers in Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Singapore.
	   The move was meant to stave off a possible fall in Asian student
numbers which is feared may result from the success of Hanson's One
Nation party in a state election.
	   One Nation's success at the June 13 Queensland election _ it
attracted about 23 percent of the vote _ has been widely reported
in Asia.
	   In his letter, Terrell said the result of the election was ``not
indicative of the thinking of the majority of Australians.''
	   ``The racism, bigotry and xenophobia of a minority have no place
in the international community of scholars and equally have no
place on any Australian campus,'' the letter says.
	   Terrell said Australia and its universities would continue to be
welcoming, supportive and safe for students from the region and the
rest of the world.
	   Hanson claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by
Asians,'' and has advocated an end to immigration, limits on
foreign investment and other protectionist economics as well as
cutting welfare payments to Aborigines.
	   Australian universities take some 150,000 overseas students a
year _ mostly from Asia _ a market worth about U.S. dlrs 1.8
billion (Australian dollars 3 billion) a year to the economy.

Russia says it needs IMF funds to stabilize ruble GMT.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government said it needs money from
the International Monetary Fund to avoid a devaluation of the
ruble, but it called some of the potential conditions for the loan
unacceptable.
	   As IMF negotiators headed to Moscow for talks on what could be a
dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion bailout, Premier Sergei
Kiriyenko met Monday with President Boris Yeltsin to finalize the
government's strategy to combat the country's economic crisis.
	   The expanded Russian cabinet, chaired by Yeltsin, was expected
Tuesday to discuss steps for dealing with the crisis. Kiriyenko
said the government program included many unpopular steps,
including tightly reining in government spending, but that the
poorest Russians would be protected.
	   Analysts have questioned whether Russia's top officials have
sufficient political will to push through an austerity program.
Yeltsin was giving ``maximum support'' to the program, Kiriyenko
said.
	   Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky confirmed earlier reports
that Russia was seeking dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in talks
with the IMF
	   But, he said, the government wasn't happy with all the IMF
demands for additional funds. The fund has been pressing Russia to
sharply curtail spending, boost tax collections and reform its
energy sector.
	   ``We will look at and consider the conditions, but it goes
without saying that far from all of the conditions are acceptable
to us,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The IMF last week said it was delaying the release of a dlrs 670
million installment of an existing loan to Russia because the
government needed to take further steps to comply with conditions
for receiving the money.
	   Kiriyenko said that Russia could collect at least 100 billion
rubles (dlrs 16.6 billion) more in income taxes if it cracked down
on delinquents. Last year, only about 5 million of the country's
147 million citizens paid income taxes.
	   ``The country cannot exist unless taxes are collected, and it
cannot spend more than its revenues,'' Kiriyenko said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Excerpts from Louise Woodward's interview with
British Broadcasting Corp. television, broadcast Monday:
	   On her relationship with the Eappen family: ``I liked them. When
I was living there, particularly Sunil. I think we got on pretty
well. We had our ups and downs. I mean I'd only been living there
10 weeks. And I was 18 and there were the normal frictions that you
might expect when somebody comes to live in your home.''
	   ``I think that they felt guilty about leaving their children
throughout the day and I think that they possibly overcompensated a
little when they came home. They were pretty devoted parents when
they were there, but they worked very long hours. Usually there was
only one parent in the house at a time. They would take turns to
come each night, to come home and take the children from me. So I
think there was certainly a lot of guilt on their part that they
were leaving the house and not being with their children as much as
they should.''
	   Asked if she resented a curfew set by Sunil Eappen, she replied,
``A little. I felt that I was over 18 and it really should be up to
me to decide when I go to bed, and that if they were entrusting me
with their children and their home in the day, I felt that they
should trust me to know what time I should go to bed.''
	   On the Eappens' reaction to her staying out late: ``Well, Sunil
was furious with me he was very angry and he shouted at me and we
had quite a scene in the kitchen and he was yelling at me I told
him I didn't appreciate being spoken to like that.''
	   ``I certainly have no love for them. They did their very best to
get me in prison, I just don't feel there is anything I could say
to them that they don't know already.''
	   Asked if she had any feelings for the fact that they lost a
child she said: ``Of course I do. I am not accusing anyone of
anything, because I don't know what happened either.
	   ``I don't know and I said that from the beginning. All I have
ever been able to say is, I don't know what happened, but I know
what didn't happen, and I can only ever tell you that.''
	   On the Eappen children: ``Well, they were adorable. Brendan was
very advanced for his age. You could hold a conversation with him
he was very talkative and Matty was a very sweet baby. He was
smiley, playful and they were just beautiful children.''
	   Matthew ``wasn't sitting up yet on his own. He could manage
maybe possibly a minute, tops, and then he would fall over. And
usually there would be cushions around him or you'd be sitting with
him.
	   ``But there was a ... the day before he went to hospital there
was a time when he fell and I thought he was rather close to the
steps ... and in telling Debbie of times where I thought he may
have hit his head because I was asked, I explained that I thought
he could have hit his head. I wasn't sure, I didn't see it. And he
didn't seem hurt at the time.''
	   ``The only thing that was on my conscience was that I may not
have done enough, but I know I did every thing I could, that
everything I was capable of doing I did. I know that I did nothing
to cause it.''
	   On the jury that convicted her of murder: ``I don't think they
understood the medical evidence. I think it is incredibly difficult
to try and explain neurosurgery and a doctor's life's work to an
ordinary lay person and expect them to understand and be able to
have two doctors giving two extremely different interpretations of
the same piece of evidence and to expect a lay person to chose
between the two I think is impossible.''
	   On why some commentators described her as ``cold'' in the
witness box: ``I guess maybe it is the British in me that I'm
naturally restrained. I saw it as my big chance to tell everybody,
and I did hold back with crying, because I was trying so
desperately to tell my story, to tell what happened.''
	   On Judge Hiller Zobel's decision to reduce her murder conviction
to involuntary manslaughter: ``I think he made a moral decision. I
think he knew this was not right, that this was a miscarriage and I
think he did the best he could under the circumstances.''
	   On her sentence: ``I think 279 days is a long time for an
innocent person to serve. For when it's 279 days of agonizing,
worry and pain, being torn away from your family, being locked up
in a prison in a strange country _ and please remember that I was
18 when I went into prison _ and being scared, for something that
you didn't even do.''
	   On the recommendation of a Supreme Judicial Court justice that
she be prevented from working with children: ``I feel almost that
I've lost the right to look at a child, that I've lost the right to
tell a mother that her child is beautiful, or to coo at a baby. And
I do feel a stigma, but that's something personally that I'll have
to get over.''

Witnesses: Earthquake rumbles through Outback towns like a truck 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A small earthquake shook two tiny towns
in Australia's northwest, seismologists said. No injuries or damage
were reported.
	   Monday's magnitude 4 quake was centered midway between Marble
Bar and Nullagine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia state,
about 680 miles (1,100 kms) north of the state capital, Perth,
Australian Seismological Center spokesman Kevin McCue said Tuesday.
	   Residents of the gold mining town of Nullagine thought the quake
sounded like a truck or a mining explosion when it struck shortly
before 6 p.m. local time (0800 GMT), said the town's policeman John
Heesters.
	   ``My neighbor thought a semitrailer was about to crash through
his front wall,'' Heesters said.
	   The town has a population of 200.

Mexico army reports attack on patrol; three killed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire an army anti-drug patrol
in southern Mexico, killing at least three soldiers and wounding
three others, the military said in a news release.
	   The Defense Secretariat said the attack occurred Monday in a
remote area on the road from Zihuatanejo on the Pacific Coast to
Ciudad Altamirano _ a region of Guerrero state where cultivation of
marijuana and other drugs is common.
	   The military gave no motive for the attack and there were no
immediate indications of involvement by leftist rebels who have
sometimes skirmished with troops in over the past two years.
	   The most recent rebel confrontation occurred June 7 in El Charco
_ 230 rugged kilometers (145 miles) to the east _ when the army
killed 11 people in a gunbattle.

Dodgers continue to change dramatically under Fox 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The firing of Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Bill Russell and general manager Fred Claire had the appearance of
still another bold move by new owner Fox.
	   But Peter O'Malley, who sold the team to Rupert Murdoch's Fox
Group and remained the Dodgers' chairman of the board, insisted
Monday that he would have done the same thing even if the team
didn't have new ownership.
	   ``I've been asked 100 times since this morning, `If the
O'Malleys still owned the team, would you have done the same
thing?''' he said. ``The honest answer is yes. I've been
disappointed in the team's performance.''
	   Tom Lasorda, who retired as the Dodgers' manager in 1996 and has
remained as a vice president, will become the GM for the rest of
this season.
	   ``I'm going to speak to the team and issue a challenge to them
to perform the way they're capable of performing,'' said Lasorda,
who guided the Dodgers to two World Series titles, the last a
decade ago.
	   Glenn Hoffman, who was the manager at Triple-A Albuquerque and
who played for Lasorda during part of his nine-year major league
career, replaces Russell on an interim basis.
	   Team president and CEO Bob Graziano said Hoffman could have the
interim removed from his title if the team does well the rest of
this season.
	   ``There's a lot of baseball left ... we can't worry about what's
going on around us,'' said Johnson, acquired from Florida in the
Piazza deal. ``We've just got to worry about the group of guys we
have here and play.''
	   Lasorda helped Hoffman don a blue and white No. 22 Dodgers
jersey.
	   ``Wear it with pride, dignity and character,'' Lasorda told him.
	   The firings Sunday are the latest major changes under the Fox
ownership. The Dodgers recently traded fan favorites Hideo Nomo and

Mexican foreign minister visits Cuba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a visit Cuban officials called ``a meeting
between brothers,'' Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green and
other officials have begun a trip to Havana.
	   Mexico has long been one of Cuba's most important diplomatic
allies _ one of the only nations in the Americas that always
resisted U.S. pressure to break ties with President Fidel Castro's
government.
	   The visit, which began Monday, ``has a very special
significance'' because Mexico has worked with Cuban ``in good times
and bad,'' Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was quoted as
saying by the Mexican government's Notimex news agency.
	   Green's delegation is to hold regularly scheduled meetings with
Cuban officials on topics ranging from immigration to cultural
exchanges.
	   Mexico also has favored Cuba's readmission to the Organization
of American States. It was suspended in 1962 and U.S. officials
have blocked its return.
	   Robaina told reporters that Cuba would accept no conditions for
readmission to the OAS, according to Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency.
	   Cuba has steadily gained diplomatic relations in recent years, a
process accelerated by the January visit of Pope John Paul II.

Beyond the veil: Women going to work in Saudi Arabia 
</HEADLINE>
By EILEEN ALT POWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A blue-uniformed guard outside the
door is the last man you see when you enter the new ``ladies only''
shopping center in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
	   What sets Al-Multaka apart from other malls is not that it's for
women as customers but that it's owned, managed and staffed by
them.
	   It's one sign of a surprising trend in this conservative kingdom
that has seen a growing number of women working outside the home.
Some do so because they need to earn, others simply because they
have more chances to use their education.
	   Most work in fields traditionally reserved for women, such as
education and health care, though some have started dabbling in
retailing, marketing, banking and even industry.
	   To do so, they must accommodate strict Saudi social customs
requiring women to be covered in public and segregated from men.
And they have to be creative about travel in a country where women
are banned from driving.
	   At Al-Multaka, which was opened by Saudi fashion designer Lama
al-Aggad, women can check their floor-length ``abaya'' robes and
head scarves at the door while they shop with assistance from an
all-woman sales force.
	   Electricians and other repairmen come only at night, after
closing hours, and a lot of management tasks that involve dealing
with men are accomplished by phone and fax, said Laura Collins,
Al-Multaka's general manager.
	   ``We have very good relations with our customs clearing agents
by phone, but we've never met them,'' said Collins, an American
woman married to a Saudi businessman.
	   Economists estimate that some 240,000 Saudi women are working
and that their numbers are increasing annually as more schools,
hospitals, banks and other institutions are opened to handle the
kingdom's fast-growing population.
	   Still, working Saudi women represent just a fraction of the
country's estimated 14 million nationals. In addition, some 600,000
foreign women, most from Asian and African countries, are employed
in the kingdom, often as housekeepers and nannies.
	   ``Social and family values are strong inhibitors to Saudi women
working,'' said Omar Bagour, an economics professor at King
Abdul-Aziz University in the port city of Jiddah.
	   ``Girls are not brought up to see work as a career,'' he added.
``Work is a transitory thing, something she does until she marries
or has children.''
	   A key reason is that Saudi Arabia adheres to the strict Wahhabi
sect of Islam.
	   Women are veiled, educated in segregated schools and banned from
socializing with men except close relatives. Those who challenge
the system risk being detained by the ``mutawwa,'' or religious
police.
	   At hospitals _ one of the few places in the kingdom where
workers are integrated _ women staffers turn their photo I.D.s
toward their chests so men won't see pictures of them without their
veils.
	   Still, women are finding ways to work, often targeting potential
customers their male counterparts can't or won't _ women.
	   Mona al-Nomrossi, who founded her own advertising agency in
Jiddah three years ago, produces a book of some of the city's
fanciest jewelry, clothing and housewares stores for distribution
at hotels and other tourist sites.
	   And although she's run into men who won't deal with her, ``some
have been very encouraging,'' she said.
	   Al-Nomrossi, who trained in Egypt in cinematography, also
produces TV commercials and is working with the Jiddah Chamber of
Commerce to produce a promotional film about the city's
recreational facilities.
	   Rula al-Shugairi, an official at the United Saudi Bank in
Jiddah, points out that women's banking is a growing business.
	   USB women's branches in the Western region alone have increased
to 11 from two in the past 14 years, she said, and some are larger
than associated men's branches.
	   ``In our religion, ladies have control of their own money,''
al-Shugairi said. Women's branches ``offer them privacy'' as well
as stock market services, letters of credit for trade and overdraft
accounts to help businesswomen manage their cash flow.
	   Women who want to work in non-traditional fields say their
biggest problem is finding employers who will hire them.
	   The government _ an almost exclusively all-male preserve _ bans
women from getting licenses in real estate, engineering,
contracting and other professions deemed men's work.
	   But there are women working quietly in back offices in most of
these fields, leaving the job of public contacts to their male
colleagues.
	   Some women skirt the rules by using phones and faxes or
networking with women friends to do market surveys, sell
time-shares in resorts or arrange trade shows.
	   Things are changing, if slowly, because Saudi women are becoming
better educated, said Aziza al-Mane'e, a professor of education at
King Saudi University in Riyadh.
	   And despite the kingdom's oil wealth, ``there are a lot of young
couples who need two incomes to make it,'' she said.
	   Al-Mane'e argues that ``a big obstacle'' to women working is
their inability to drive _ making them dependent on chauffeurs or
buses where they must sit in the back, behind a partition.
	   Al-Mane'e was among 47 women who challenged the kingdom's ban by
driving through the streets of Riyadh in November 1990. For that
protest, she and the other drivers were suspended from their jobs
for three years.
	   ``We didn't get public support then, even from the women,''
al-Mane'e said. ``It's only a matter of time before this changes. I
am sure of it.''

Inventor of headphones tunes into success again

 &UR; By JIM CHILSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The timing was perfect when John Koss Sr. and a
partner invented stereo headphones using two tiny speakers, chamois
pads from old flight helmets and red tubing that looked like
licorice.
	   It was 1958, the stereo business was taking off, America would
soon meet the Beatles and parents were looking for an escape from
their children's blaring rock 'n' roll.
	   ``They would just go nuts with the phones, because you've got to
remember this was something that was never heard before,'' says
Koss, chairman of the Milwaukee-based Koss Corp., which this year
celebrates the 40th anniversary of the invention.
	   ``Little did we know we were going to create an industry.''
	   And little did he know the ups and downs in store for his
business, which would file for bankruptcy protection in the 1980s
and see industry giant Sony take over the top spot in stereo
headphones.
	   ``It's hard to think about it once in a while. I'd just as soon
not have gone through it,'' the 68-year-old Koss says. ``But it was
all a learning experience.''
	   His son Michael, now president and chief executive officer, took
in a lot of those lessons while sitting at the family dinner table
and while working his way through the company, pushing a broom and
laboring on the assembly line.
	   Lesson No. 1?
	   ``Shun conventional wisdom,'' says Michael Koss, 43, a
vegetarian who wears a bow tie and suspenders on the job.
	   With Michael Koss at the helm since 1991, the company has seen
its stock quadruple to dlrs 10 a share on the Nasdaq exchange. Last
year, Koss had record sales of dlrs 39.6 million and record profits
of dlrs 3.6 million.
	   Although Sony sells more of them, Koss still leads U.S.-based
companies in headphone sales.
	   ``I think there's plenty of business to go around,'' says
Michael's brother, John Jr., vice president of sales. ``We would
really like to continue to be the only other source for
stereophones.''
	   Analyst David Leibowitz, a managing director of Burnham
Securities, says Koss is poised to remain a dominant player in the
headphone market.
	   ``In the past, there were occasions where they have had
difficulty in maintaining their leadership position, but more often
than not they have very successfully defended their home turf,''
Leibowitz says.
	   The years after the first stereo headphones were exciting times
for Koss.
	   Tony Bennett and Dizzy Gillespie were among early disciples of
the headphones who would call and visit John Koss. Michael Koss
remembers bringing his Dad's old trumpet to jazzman Bobby Hackett
and asking, ``Can you teach me to play this thing?''
	   Bolstered by success, Koss diversified into other consumer
electronics, with poor results.
	   In the 1960s, Koss bought a maker of manual turntables _ just as
automatic record changers were taking over the market. In the
1980s, the company tried to take on Sony's Walkman and ended up
millions in debt. Koss, which has been publicly traded since 1966,
eventually filed for bankruptcy protection.
	   ``We didn't diversify, we `deworsified' the business,'' Michael
Koss says.
	   Koss has returned mainly to headphones, a specialty it should
have stuck with from the start, said Alan Lofft, senior editor of
Audio magazine.
	   ``When you have a dominant technology that's superior and you're
good at it, it's probably unwise to expand too much,'' Lofft says.
	   While the company was restructuring, Michael helped lead what he
now calls Operation Clean Sweep, cutting the salaried staff was
from 90 to 45. The company also liquidated excess inventory and
closed European operations.
	   ``It was a lot like boot camp,'' he says. ``You learn a lot, but
you don't want to go twice.''
	   The company, which today tries to keep its work force at 200 to
250 employees, pulled itself out of bankruptcy protection. Michael
Koss, who studied art and anthropology in college after his father
told him to learn about people rather than business, became
president in 1987 and chief executive in 1991.
	   He brought unconventional ideas to the business. Koss scrapped
the old assembly line that he used to work on during summers in
college and instituted a more efficient ``cell'' format, in which
small groups of workers build a product from start to finish.
	   Around the same time, when a valued employee moved to Texas,
Koss didn't let her go. She now does her job by telephone and fax,
and she travels to Milwaukee a couple of times a month.
	   ``Five years ago, this was unheard of,'' says Sue Sachdeva, vice
president of finance, who started with the company as a temporary
employee. ``I'm sure he caught a lot of flak for doing this in the
beginning.''
	   The company's finances remain solid. Profits for the first nine
months of the current fiscal year were dlrs 3.15 million, ahead of
last year's record income.
	   Revenues are down slightly, but in keeping with the 40th
anniversary of Koss headphones, the company is close to surpassing
dlrs 40 million in sales for the first time, Michael Koss says.

World Cup: French blame German squads of `thugs' for violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; version also moving on news lines
By SEBASTIEN BOUWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ The matches went on, but much of the soccer
world's attention was on a hospital in this northern French city,
where a policeman lay struggling for his life after his head was
bashed in by a German fan wielding an iron bar.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, was in a deep coma
after suffering ``repeated violent blows from a massive object''
after Sunday's match between Germany and Yugoslavia, doctors said
Monday night. They could barely hide their pessimism about his
chances.
	   Nivel was cornered by a group of neo-Nazis on a narrow street in
Lens, a nearby town in northern France. He collapsed unconscious in
a pool of blood on the sidewalk.
	   At the other end of the country in Toulouse, 1,800 police were
in force Monday outside the England-Romania game, to guard against
a repeat of the violence that plagued Marseille, site of England's
last contest.
	   After England lost the heartbreaker match, 2-1, most fans left
the stadium in dejected clumps. Though the atmosphere was tense,
the heavy police presence and an 11 p.m. curfew at bars appeared to
keep most violence in check.
	   The exception was a British reporter who was attacked by English
fans. Andrew Woodcock of the Press Association broke his collarbone
when the fans, who accused him of giving them a bad name, threw him
to the ground against a concrete pylon.
	   Yet the focus of the world's anger, and Germany's shame, was in
the north. Authorities blamed squads of German ``thugs, fanatics
and fascists'' for the spasm of violence there Sunday.
	   A 27-year-old man from Hanover was arrested for attacking Nivel.
His name wasn't released. Police announced late Monday that his
detention had been extended for another 24 hours, and he was to
appear before a judge Tuesday afternoon.
	   A local prosecutor, Christian Roussel, said police were pursuing
other possible attackers in the assault.
	   ``We have pretty good witness accounts from other policemen,''
Roussel said. ``We are working on the hypothesis that several,
about four, may have participated in the attack.''
	   In all, 93 Germans and three French were detained in the spasm
of violence in Lens Sunday afternoon, the French Interior Ministry
said.
	   Six Germans were immediately deported. Another 15 were placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged. One
German fan was sentenced to three months in prison in connection
with weekend mayhem.
	   French President Jacques Chirac called the violence swirling
around World Cup stadiums ``unacceptable.'' Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin denounced the ``cowardice'' of ``these showoffs.'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who called Chirac to express his sorrow,
said the Lens attack was ``a scandal for our nation.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said it was the work
of ``small groups of thugs, fanatics and fascists who are running
riot in the heart of our towns.''
	   ``We are standing up to them. We repelled them in military
style,'' he said.
	   The German soccer federation said it had warned German police
about known groups of thugs headed for Lens for Sunday's match,
which ended in a 2-2 tie.
	   Sepp Blatter, chief of the world soccer federation FIFA, urged
European Union countries to do more to prevent known thugs from
crossing borders to disrupt soccer matches.
	   But, he said, the street violence wouldn't affect the staging of
the rest of the tournament.
	   In a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting, FIFA
denounced ``the barbaric acts of violence by those who have nothing
to do with soccer or any other sport.''

Pacific-Rim trade ministers debate market liberalization 
</HEADLINE>
By BETH DUFF-BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Having been warned of a global
recession triggered by the Asian economic crisis, Pacific-Rim trade
ministers began their second day of talks Tuesday on opening their
markets to free trade.
	   With the backdrop of the year-long Asian crisis ever present,
the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum took
up a formidable plan to begin liberalizing trade in nine industries
by next year.
	   The concept, known as early voluntary sectoral liberalization,
was agreed to by the APEC heads of state last November. But much
has changed since the Vancouver summit.
	   Asia has been wracked further by plummeting currencies,
shrinking economies and the downfall of several leaders. The Asian
powerhouse, Japan, is in full-blown recession, its banking sector
crumbling and the yen has taken a beating.
	   The United States is at the forefront of pushing the EVSL
concept, insisting market liberalization is an important means out
of the Asian economic slump. It wants specific dates and amounts of
tariff reductions set in the nine industries representing dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade.
	   And it wants Japan on board.
	   ``Japan has a responsibility, as the second largest economy in
the world to participate,'' said a senior U.S. trade official who
asked not to be named.
	   ``We view it as critical to reaffirm the commitment to
liberalization in this part of the world to show that this setback
is temporary and will not undermine the process which we consider
to be essential for growth in trade and prosperity to people in the
region.''
	   Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia are calling
for more emphasis on the APEC principles of voluntarism and
flexibility in liberalizing ``sensitive'' industries, particularly
fish and forests.
	   Sources say Japanese Trade Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi told U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Monday that fast-track
liberalization must be voluntary.
	   According to a senior Japanese official, Horiuchi told
Barshefsky that full APEC participation would be ``very difficult''
if countries reluctant to open their markets were denied
flexibility in setting free-market schedules.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   For Japan, six of those sectors _ fish, forestry, toys, jewelry,
energy and environment _ are seen as ``sensitive'' industries. In
particular, the forestry and fish industries are seen as vulnerable
to foreign competition.
	   Thailand's deputy commerce minister, Photipong Lamsam, said
Thailand planned to support the EVSL plan, but also said it needed
more leeway in opening its chemical and toy markets.
	   ``We are not going to undermine the integrity of the package as
a whole,'' Photipong told the Associated Press. ``But some
sacrifices may have to made in the way of flexibility.''
	   South Korean trade minister Han Duck Soo told AP Monday night
that they, too, would call for ``flexibility'' in opening up its
fisheries and forestry markets.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz, chairwoman of the APEC
trade ministers forum, on Monday warned of a global recession
triggered by the Asian crisis. She called on the stronger APEC
countries to prevent that from happening.
	   ``It is also important that in the spirit of APEC member
economies must understand the problems and where possible assist in
the process of economic recovery,'' Rafidah said Monday.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

England decides against appeal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Lock Danny Grewcock's five-match
ban for kicking an opponent in the head will stand after England
team management decided not to appeal Tuesday.
	   Grewcock suffered the shame of becoming only the second player
to be dismissed while playing for England in a test match _ Mike
Burton was the first, 23 years ago.
	   He was sent off by Australian referee Wayne Erickson for
stomping the head of New Zealand's Anton Oliver as the All Blacks
posted a record 64-22 victory in Dunedin on Saturday.
	   England manager Roger Uttley received a full version of the
judicial committee's report late Monday, and the announcement was
made after the squad arrived in Rotorua for Tuesday's match against
the New Zealand Maoris.
	   Grewcock was banned by a judiciary panel on Sunday and is yet to
talk about the matter. He is expected to hold a news conference
Wednesday.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks fall in morning trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen on
profit-taking in morning trading Tuesday, while Tokyo stock prices
fell amid worries about Japan's economy.
	   The dollar bought 137.71 yen at midday, down 0.83 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 138.16 yen
overnight.
	   Overseas investors sold dollars to book profits after the U.S.
currency's 3 1/2 yen rise Monday, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 221.88 points, or 1.45 percent, to 15,087.21 points at midday.
On Monday, the Nikkei gained 41.11 points, or 0.27 percent.
	   Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
jointly intervened to halt the yen's slide after the dollar hit an
eight-year high against the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar rose back sharply Monday after the Japanese
government failed to offer concrete steps to prop up the yen at a
weekend meeting of Group of Seven industrialized nations.
	   But dealers hesitated to push the dollar higher ahead of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week.
	   Market participants said there was a good chance the United
States and Japan would again act jointly to support the yen if it
falls too much ahead of and during the visit. China has complained
that the falling yen was putting pressure on its own currency.
	   On the stock market, share prices moved lower as investors
awaited more details of Japanese government measures to tackle the
nation's sagging economy and bad debt problems at banks.
	   Governing Liberal Democratic Party officials have said the party
will come up with details by July 8 of a proposed ``bridge bank''
that will take over bank debt, a main negative factor weighing on
the economy.
	   ``People are still nervous about the Liberal Democratic Party's
ability to come up with a plan'' to deal with the bad debt problem,
said Jon Yang, a salesman in the futures and options group at
Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose shares plunged on
Monday by 50 yen, the limit allowed under exchange rules, rose 9
yen to 71 yen by early Tuesday.
	   News reports said that government and ruling-party officials met
late Monday and vowed support for the troubled bank.
	   The main trigger for the steep drop in the bank's shares, which
began Friday, was the expectation that more aggressive efforts by
the government to clean up bad debts would mean letting weak banks
fail.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section fell 7.70 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,179.61. The TOPIX
closed up 0.04 points, insignificant in percentage terms, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.260 percent from Monday's finish of 1.255
percent, driving its price lower to 111.53 yen from 111.57 yen.

Reports say government looking for ways to help major bank 
</HEADLINE>
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd. _ one of
Japan's largest lenders _ rebounded Tuesday after news reports said
the government and ruling party have agreed to keep the ailing
institution from collapsing under a mountain of bad debt.
	   Worries about the Long-Term Credit Bank have swelled as Japan,
slogging through its worst recession in decades, has come under
pressure to move more aggressively to fix its troubled financial
system.
	   Ruling-party politicians are discussing the establishment of a
government-run ``bridge bank'' to support the overall financial
system by taking over banks' bad loans.
	   The party has pledged to announce the details of its plan by
July 8, but a top Finance Ministry official said Monday that the
idea needs a good deal more study.
	   ``There are still many details to be worked out, such as how to
prevent losses from new loans and where to get the funds for the
bank,'' Administrative Vice Finance Minister Koji Tanami said.
	   But investors fear greater determination by the government to
clean up the mess may mean it will let more weak banks fail _ and
the Long-Term Credit Bank has become a focus of their concern.
	   Although the bank has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs 203
billion) in assets, it recently announced it has problem loans
worth 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion).
	   Altogether, Japanese banks have some 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550
billion) of bad loans.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka and Liberal Democratic
Party Secretary General Koichi Kato, and others met late Monday and
agreed that the Bank of Japan should support the Long-Term Credit
Bank, the Mainichi newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The central bank can make emergency loans to banks when
necessary to stabilize the financial system.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank first went into a tailspin
Friday after Moody's Investors Services lowered it credit rating
for the bank.
	   Frantic selling of its stock accelerated Monday after two larger
banks _ Daiwa Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. _ denied
reports they were negotiating to merge with it.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank's shares had plunged 45 percent, to 62 yen
(45 U.S. cents), before trading was halted Monday by exchange rules
that limit declines.
	   The stock recovered early Tuesday, rising 9 yen to 71 yen in
morning trading, following the Mainichi's report and other
indications the government was considering ways to rescue the bank.
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's largest circulation newspaper, on Tuesday
quoted top ruling-party official Taku Yamasaki as suggesting a
merger between the Long Term Credit Bank and the Japan Development
Bank, a quasi-public institution.
	   Financial authorities customarily have orchestrated buyouts of
troubled banks by stronger institutions as a way of avoiding the
lost jobs that would come from an outright bank failure.
	   But it's not clear whether that custom _ never explicitly
acknowledged as government policy _ still holds. Last week, the
Finance Ministry said any possible mergers were for banks to decide
on their own.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank is one of three credit banks established
at the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in
an effort to rebuild Japan's economy. But as deregulation has made
it easier for companies to raise money directly by issuing stocks
or selling bonds, the banks' role has been largely lost.
	   Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd., the largest Japanese bank to fail,
went under in November with 5,400 employees and 8.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 62 billion) in assets.

South Korea captures North Korean submarine 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea towed a captured North
Korean submarine into this major naval base Tuesday, unsure if its
crew was still aboard but angered by ``a clear armed provocation.''
	   Officials said North Korea was questioned about the intrusion at
a meeting Tuesday between generals of the communist nation and the
United Nations Command, their first in seven years.
	   U.N. officials declined comment following the meeting.
	   ``The fact that the North Korean submarine infiltrated across
the military demarcation line is a clear armed provocation and a
violation of the armistice agreement,'' said Maj. Gen. Lim
Jong-chul, chief operations officer for South Korea's Joint Chiefs
of Staff.
	   ``Our side will take proper action later,'' Lim said
	   Although Lim didn't elaborate, the sub's incursion was sure to
further cloud relations between North and South Korea just as the
new government of President Kim Dae-jung was beginning to reach out
to its reclusive northern rival.
	   The meeting between an American general representing the United
Nations and a North Korean general at the border village of
Panmunjom was designed only as a get-acquainted session after the
long moratorium on such talks.
	   But a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs said the submarine's
intrusion into South Korean waters was taken up by the U.N.
officer.
	   North Korea broke off armistice talks at Panmunjom in 1992,
angered that a South Korean general had been named to represent the
United Nations. The North sees South Korea as a U.S. puppet and
refuses to talk to it.
	   The sub was captured Monday after it became entangled in a
fishing net off the east coast. It was first towed to the small
port of Yang-Yang, just south of the North Korean border, but
officials later decided to bring it to the better equipped naval
base at Donghae, 60 kilometers (40) miles down the coast.
	   ``We need to take extra precautions (with the sub) because (the
crew) might blow it up,'' a Defense Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity. He added, however, that it was unclear
whether anyone was aboard the vessel.
	   At one point during the night of towing, South Korean sailors
pounded on the surface of the sub with a hammer, but there was no
response from within.
	   SBS-TV in Seoul reported without attribution that the sub's
antenna moved up and down a few times shortly after daybreak and
theorized the crew was trying to contact its headquarters in the
North. The Defense Ministry said it could not confirm the report.
	   The submarine was seized not far from where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996 _ an incident that ended with
37 people dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst
in years.
	   Military officials said as many as six North Koreans might be
aboard the vessel seized Monday. It was described as a ``midget
submersible'' used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct
coastal surveillance.
	   North Korean agents are said to be told to commit suicide to
avoid capture. In the 1996 submarine incursion, 11 North Koreans
were reportedly shot to death by one of their commanders, who then
killed himself.
	   The boat seized Monday was a 70-ton Yugo-class submarine, 3
meters (10 feet wide) and 18 meters (60 feet) long, officials said.
A recent Defense Ministry report says North Korea has 14 such subs,
each manned by a crew of four to five.
	   North Korean media monitored in Seoul made no mention of the
incident.
	   South Korean officials said the sub's antenna and propeller got
caught in the fishing net about 18 kilometers (10 miles) east of
the town of Sokcho, just south of the North Korean border and 200
kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Seoul.
	   The net had been set with buoys to be retrieved later. A passing
fishing boat spotted the entangled craft and radioed maritime
police and the military.
	   Kim In-yong, skipper of the fishing boat, told police he saw
three people on the sub's deck trying to untangle the net.
	   Sokcho is about five miles from where the North Korean submarine
ran aground in 1996, touching off a 53-day manhunt for its 26
occupants. The search by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police
ended with 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans dead.
One North Korean was captured and another was believed to have
escaped.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Chinese government warns of layoff crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's Communist Party and government leaders
warned Tuesday that more needs to done to find jobs for millions of
workers laid off from struggling state industries.
	   Stronger measures must be taken in order to reform state
enterprises and preserve social stability, the Communist Party's
policy-setting Central Committee and the State Council, or Cabinet,
said in a circular issued Monday and carried in leading official
newspapers Tuesday.
	   The order said government at all levels must expand retraining
programs and provide stipends so that laid-off workers can get by
until they find work.
	   The central government has repeatedly stressed that coping with
mounting unemployment will be difficult but critical for reforms.
Protests by workers complaining they have not received stipends,
pensions or wages have erupted in cities throughout China.
	   The leadership's statement promised more than 50 percent of
laid-off workers this year would find new jobs. But it warned it
would take five more years to establish a social security system
that would guarantee welfare, unemployment, medical and pension
payments.
	   China's state factories are trimming millions of unneeded
workers as the government cuts off state subsidies and forces them
to adjust to capitalist markets.
	   The government has said about 40 percent of state factories are
in the red. In Beijing, nearly half of all state factory workers
have been laid off, according to government-controlled newspapers.

Clinton asked to seek release of imprisoned Chinese reporters 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton should seek the release of a
dozen imprisoned Chinese journalists when he meets with President
Jiang Zemin this week, a press freedom group says.
	   Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without
Borders) said in a letter to Clinton dated Monday that the Chinese
reporters were jailed ``simply because they did their work honestly
or expressed their opinions peacefully.''
	   The group also asked Clinton to persuade China to sign the
United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
	   China announced in March that it planned to sign the covenant,
which guarantees civil liberties such as freedom of the press and
assembly. The state-run Xinhua News Agency late Monday quoted Jiang
as saying China would sign it in the fall.

New Zealand: fast-track trade critical to global economy 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand's trade minister said
Tuesday it was ``critically important'' to the global economy to
move quickly on free-market trade among Pacific-Rim countries.
	   Lockwood Smith told reporters before entering the second day of
talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers
meeting that Japan had to be a key player in a plan under
discussion to liberalize trade in nine industries.
	   Smith said Japan was holding up finalization of the
liberalization pact, known as early voluntary sector
liberalization, which ministers were expected to sign off on in
time for APEC's November summit in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``We've almost got unanimity,'' Smith said. ``We're still
discussing the package with the Japanese, that's it.''
	   The main sticking point among ministers the 18-member APEC forum
has been the issue of ``flexibility'' _ whether to allow some of
the group's more economically-battered members more time to lower
tariffs in markets ranging from forests and fisheries to
telecommunications.
	   The United States and New Zealand have maintained that Japan
needs to open its markets to APEC members and that, as the world's
second-largest economy, Japan's participation in the EVSL plan was
crucial.
	   ``This is critically important to the global economy,'' Smith
said.
	   Japan has consistently maintained that industries like forestry
and fisheries were vulnerable to trade liberalization.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators seemed to be leaning toward a decision that
incorporated that vision, granting more leeway to developing
countries.
	   ``We should be addressing the concerns of developing countries
to make sure we are sensitive,'' Smith said. ``For the good of the
APEC region, I'm hoping we see a bold result with the whole package
holding together.''

World Cup: English spies give Romania victory injured. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with minor scuffles after the game, 10 arrested, three
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ In the end, Romania's ``English spies''
decided the outcome.
	   Goals by Coventry striker Viorel Moldovan and defender Dan
Petrescu of Chelsea put Romania into the second round and left
England's World Cup fate resting on its final first-round game
against Colombia on Friday. The 2-1 result Monday also eliminated
last-place Tunisia.
	   ``The game brought us from ecstasy and agony and vice versa, and
I was close to having a heart attack,'' Romania coach Anghel
Iordanescu said.
	   In the 90th minute, Petrescu, an offensive fullback whose
devastating runs down the right wing sow panic among opponents, put
the ball into the net while wrestling with a defender. His goal put
Romania in the final 16.
	   Charging into the 6-yard box, Petrescu held back Graeme Le Saux
_ his teammate on the English club Chelsea _ by putting his right
arm across Le Saux's neck. Then Petrescu slid his left foot in
front of the defender to poke the ball between the legs of
goalkeeper David Seaman.
	   ``This is the greatest moment of my life,'' Petrescu said. ``I
scored a winning goal (against the United States) in the last World
Cup, but compared to this feeling, it meant nothing.''
	   Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, playing his 112th international, set
up Moldovan for the goal that gave Romania the lead two minutes
after halftime. Hagi chipped from the right to Moldovan, who
chested the ball down and sent it past David Seaman from 6 yards.
	   Petrescu, who feels at home when it comes to British soccer,
helped Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu devise the game plan.
	   Romania's skillful and tight passing game and speedy bursts
created problems for the English, whose defense made several key
errors.
	   ``This is a well-deserved victory for our players, who made
tremendous efforts to obtain it,'' Iordanescu said. ``They played
with their heart, soul and with intelligence.''
	   A visibly disappointed England coach Glenn Hoddle said, ``We
gave away two sloppy goals and it cost us. We had sloppy
defending.''
	   ``We didn't take our chances, yet we gave them some ridiculous
chances and they took them,'' Hoddle added. ``Now we know what we
have got to do against Colombia.''
	   One thing he might do is start 18-year-old Michael Owen, who
became the youngest player to score for England in a World Cup. He
appeared to save his team with an 83rd-minute goal. Owen, who
entered the game in the second half, also hit the left post from 30
yards in injury time.
	   ``I'd rather draw 1-1 and not score,'' Owen said. ``Not winning
the match was a bitter disappointment.''
	   The game was a potential flashpoint for fan violence following
the riots that surrounded England's game last week against Tunisia.
	   As kickoff time approached, English fans got drunk and rowdy,
pounding on the sides of passing trucks and leaping onto cars to
wave flags. A British journalist was attacked by five hooligans and
hospitalized with a broken collarbone.
	   After the game, a few minor scuffles broke out between English
fans and local residents. About 10 people were arrested and three
injured, police said.
