   TRAUMATIC EVENTS: A MOTHER'S RETURN AND A FATHER'S DEATH
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was 11when his mother went to jail. His father, who had
always been generous, installed a swimming pool, bought the boy a
piano and gave him freedom to be with friends. He also dropped the
tutors and sent the boy into sixth grade at a Catholic elementary
school, where some of his friends went.
</P>
<P>
   Vittorio Raho, the childhood playmate, referred to the time of
Mrs. Kimes' imprisonment as ``Kenny's golden years,'' adding: ``His
father was a very kind guy, a good friend. We'd go over to his
house and he'd buy 10 McDonald's. There would be four or five of us
there lazing around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kimes rushed construction of the pool for Kenny's
birthday and threw a party. Later, he took Kenny, Vittorio and
another friend on a weekend trip to Beverly Hills, Calif. They
stayed in a hotel on Rodeo Drive, went shopping and had breakfast
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, then 67, made more time for his son by veering away from
business. He sold his motel in Anaheim near Disneyland, the Mecca,
to his fellow hotelier, O'Connell, for $3.4 million in late 1986.
``He kind of gave me the impression he was throwing in the towel,
that he planned to retire, that he was tired,'' said O'Connell, who
estimated Kimes' net worth at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kenny had almost no contact with the mother who had
dominated his earlier life. ``He didn't even want to speak to her
on the phone,'' Raho said. ``He was ashamedof her.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend said Kenny began to voice resentment against his
jailed mother. ``He said he hated his mom,'' the man said. ``He
just said she was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the boy graduated from grade school and began classes
at Bishop Gorman High School. He soon become interested in sports,
clothes, computers and ``had several short-term girlfriends,'' Raho
said.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changed in 1989, when Mrs. Kimes was released
after serving three years of her five-year term. ``He was very
traumatized when she got out of prison,'' a female friend said.
``That was when the whole roller coaster started. He dropped out of
high school, then started travels to Tokyo, Hawaii, the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Raho agreed. ``When the mother came back, she told Kenny that
she did not want her son associating with any of the friends he had
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was transferred to Green Valley High School, and the
family moved to a house across town where he had no friends. Before
they left, a neighbor said, Kenny, now 15, became so angry that he
attacked and beat his mother. But his rebellion was soon over, and
he was swept off to other homes and more tutors.
</P>
<P>
   In Montecito, an affluent enclave of Santa Barbara, they leased
a luxurious seaside house and contacted a friend, John Boettner, a
retired teacher, who helped them find several tutors for Kenny.
During what would have been his last three years of high school,
the tutors accompanied the family to Hawaii, the Bahamas and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Boettner called Kenny ``a courteous young man who had some
obvious academic abilities,'' and said he did well enough to be
admitted to the University of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble seemed to follow the family. On Sept. 19, 1990, a
suspicious fire destroyed the Kimeses' house on Portlock Road in
Honolulu. There had also been a suspicious fire there in 1978, and
the insurers, Chubb Corp., refused to pay the 1990 claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, meantime, filed suit against Chubb and began making
threatening calls to Chubb executives. The company counter-sued and
obtained an injunction against her. Her suit was eventually
dropped. No criminal charges were filed in the fire, which was
never formally declared to be arson.
</P>
<P>
   While the Honolulu case was a standoff, there were always other
scams, other questionable activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas house, an open garage door occasionally
revealed television sets and other appliances that some neighbors
thought might be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, neighbors said they saw a moving truck cart away
some furnishings from the house. Shortly thereafter, an insurance
investigator came to their doors to ask about Mrs. Kimes' claims
that burglars had taken the furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade, the Las Vegas accountant who was the Kimeses'
bookkeeper in 1993 and 1994, said Mrs. Kimes always had many
lawsuits going, some against her and others against a myriad of
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade said Mrs. Kimes created confusing paper trails for
creditors, process servers and lawyers, and sometimes used Ms.
Meade's address or phone number to throw off the hounds.
</P>
<P>
   One gimmick, Ms. Meade said, was to list Kimes properties in the
names of other people; some of these people were paid, while others
were used unwittingly. She said she once learned, to her surprise,
that she was the owner of the house near Green Valley High, and
Kadzin, the Los Angeles businessman whom they had known for years,
became the unwitting owner of the Geronimo Way house _ an
arrangement that held sinister portents.
</P>
<P>
   While the couple had millions, Ms. Meade said, Mrs. Kimes could
not resist the temptation to steal and scam. Once, Ms. Meade said,
Kenny wanted a laptop computer with certain features and
specifications. Even before it could be bought, Mrs. Kimes was
submitting an insurance claim for such a computer, saying it had
been stolen from her car. It was her way of getting the laptop for
free, Ms. Meade said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade said Kimes had told her not to give his wife details
of his portfolio of stocks. And when she refused to give in to Mrs.
Kimes' demands for information about his holdings, she said, Mrs.
Kimes dismissed her.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1993, Kenny enrolled at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, and in 1994, after several years of
failing health, his father died, apparently of natural causes. The
size of his estate and how it was disposed of is unclear,
investigators say. But a few months before his death, property
records show, he transferred a laarge parcel of land in Santa
Maria, Calif., to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kimes' ashes were being spread over a bay in Hawaii, his
wife was looking at engineering companies to survey the Santa Maria
site, consisting of 170 building lots, for a future housing
development _ and then refusing to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was devastated by his father's death, a friend said.
Moreover, it seemed to move him closer to the mother he had long
distrusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months, maybe a year after his father's death, he still seemed
near tears about it,'' Raho said. ``He changed after his father
died, because he said he did love his mother. I said, `Are you
serious _ you love your mother?' He said, `She's my mother, man.'''

   PARTNERS: SCAMS GROW MORE SINISTER
</P>
<P>
   At college, Kenny Kimes' own violent streak surfaced. In
November 1995, a student, Carrie Louise Grammer, filed for a
restraining order against him, saying he had become abusive after
his cat had soiled her roommate's bed. Kimes, she said, had
promised to pay for the $75 worth of bed linens and then handed
over only $35.
</P>
<P>
   Her petition said Kimes ``came at me in a threatening manner''
and ``proceeded to angrily curse me.'' She also maintained that
Kimes had ``hit his ex-girlfriend'' and had beaten another student
so badly that he had to be hospitalized. Kimes denied these
charges, and a state judge told him and Ms. Grammer to stay away
from each other.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Kenny had dropped out of college, and he may have
conspired with his mother for the first time in pair of malpractice
lawsuits against a plastic surgeon, Dr. Joseph Graves of San Diego.
Kenny sued for what he called a botched nose job. His mother
claimed she had suffered a head injury falling off the doctor's
operating table during a face-lift. ``She portrayed herself as a
`longevity model,' an older person who is beautiful and still does
modeling,'' said Joseph Lange, the lawyer for Graves. Both suits
were dismissed after the plaintiffs failed to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, the mother and son were staying in Nassau,
the Bahamas, when Syed Bilal Ahmed, 55, a native of Bahrain and an
officer of the First Cayman Bank in the Cayman Islands, began
investigating irregularities at a First Cayman subsidiary, the Gulf
Union Bank in Nassau, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Ahmed's said he had been approached by the Kimeses
about an online business venture. On his last trip to Nassau, his
family said, Ahmed was accompanied by the Kimeses. Doug Hanna,
chief of the criminal investigative unit of the Royal Bahamas
Police, confirmed that Mrs. Kimes later went to the Gulf Union Bank
in Nassau and saw Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's family said he had an appointment to dine that night
with Mrs. Kimes. But he disappeared and was never seen again. His
luggage also vanished from the Radisson Cable Beach Resort in
Nassau. By the time the police learned that Ahmed had met with
Sante Kimes, the woman and her son were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian investigators say they would like to question the
Kimeses, but have no proof linking them to the banker's
disappearance or the bank's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late last year, investigators say, Sante Kimes, trying to
cash in on the unused Geronimo Way house, began a series of complex
financial transactions. Since 1992, the house had been listed in
Kadzin's name, to keep it out of reach of creditors. Martin
Handweiler, a lawyer and longtime friend of Kazdin, said Kazdin had
signed a deed for the Las Vegas property as a favor for the elder
Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes went to a Florida bank and took out a $200,000
mortgage on the house. After obtaining the money, she again changed
the name on the title. The new owner became Frank McCarren, an
indigent man she found in a Las Vegas homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, investigators said, Mrs. Kimes took out fire
insurance on the home in McCarren's name. The house was then
heavily damaged in a fire on Jan. 31. Arson experts found that
fires had been deliberately set, one upstairs and one downstairs,
with a flammable liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance scam unraveled when McCarren told investigators
that Mrs. Kimes had held him captive, beat him and forced him to
memorize prepared lies for the inevitable questions. The insurance
money was never paid.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Florida bank that had given a mortgage on the
house contacted Kadzin, who said he had not applied for any
mortgage. Kadzin, 64, who had known Mrs. Kimes for 20 years, was
terrified of her, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bank called, a woman whom Kazdin did not
recognize appeared at the door of his home in Granada Hills,
Calif., and ``made the statement along the line of, `You know you
got the loan, but you're working with a very vague memory,''
Handweiler said, adding that Kazdin then received several phone
messages from the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   And when Kazdin was found shot to death last March 14, suspicion
fell on the Kimeses, whose whereabouts were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they were nearby, in rooms at the Beverly Wilshire
Hotel. Before leaving the West Coast in April, they bought a green
1997 Lincoln Town Car from a dealer in Cedar City, Utah, who agreed
to take the order by phone because the Kimeses had bought other
cars from him without problems. It was delivered to Los Angeles,
and Sante Kimes paid for it with a $14,900 check that bounced.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer filed a complaint, but the Kimeses and the car were
gone, headed for Florida. In Baton Rouge, La., they picked up an
$80,000 motor home from a dealer with a similar scam, paying with a
rubber check. The motor home was found abandoned in Florida several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-June, mother and son were in New York, where Kenneth,
using a phony reference, rented a $6,000-a-month apartment at the
East 65th Street town house of Mrs. Silverman. By early July,
investigators said, the pair had forged the paperwork to take over
her money and town house. On July 5, Mrs. Silverman disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, as Sante and Kenneth Kimes returned to the New
York Hilton, they were finally arrested _ not for murder, arson or
any of the countless scams of which they are suspected, though
their car was full of papers that appeared to implicate them in a
vast web of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   They had been tripped up by the Utah car dealer's bad-check
complaint.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Michael O'Mara, a retired vice president of New York
University who had an earlier career as a rackets investigator,
died on June 19 at Hackensack University Medical Center in New
Jersey. A former resident of Leonia, N.J., he was 84 and more
recently lived in Norwood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1984 after about 20 years as assistant vice
president for business affairs and later vice president for
institutional facilities at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Worcester, Mass., 'Mara graduated from Holy Cross
College there in 1936, attended Harvard Law School and received his
law degree from Boston College in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the FBI as a special agent and for 10 years dealt with
major criminal and espionage investigations in New York, including
the Alger Hiss perjury case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he was named chief investigator for a newly formed New
York City Anti-Crime Committee. Privately financed, it was a
citizens' initiative headed by Spruille Braden, a retired diplomat.
Its purpose was to expose rackets and thereby spur officials to
prosecute the racketeers. Its activities led to confrontations with
the Police Department, District Attorney Frank Hogan and
politicians from both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   O'Mara was promoted to executive director, but internal quarrels
on the committee and a public dispute over wiretaps forced his
resignation in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   O'Mara then was a vice president at Webb &AMP; Knapp, the real
estate empire of William Zeckendorf Sr., until NYU recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Mara is survived by his wife of 54 years, Elisabeth; three
daughters, Kathleen of Modesto, Calif., Patricia Adair of New
Canaan, Conn., and Elisabeth Sutter of Milbrae, Calif; a son,
Michael, of Nantucket, Mass.; three sisters, Christine Sullivan of
Boston, Sister Claire O'Mara of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Lucille
Murphy of Dennis, Mass.; and eight grandchildren.

JACK HAUSMAN, 96, EXECUTIVE; RAISED MILLIONS TO COMBAT PALSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Hausman, a retired textile manufacturer who
raised millions of dollars as a founder of New York and national
organizations to benefit people with cerebral palsy, died on Friday
at his home in Manhattan. He was 96 and for many years also had a
home on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Hausman and his wife, Ethel, together with Leonard and
Isabelle Goldenson and Jane Hoving, gathered a group of parents to
raise money for medical care for children with the disorder. The
Hausmans' middle son, Peter, had been born with it and some of the
children of the parents' group had been as well.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort produced what was initially called the Cerebral
Palsy Society. It, in turn, spawned about 150 United Cerebral Palsy
affiliates, along with the United Cerebral Palsy Associations in
Washington, an umbrella organization that Hausman helped to
organize in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hausmans and the Goldensons succeeded in mobilizing
thousands of business and labor leaders, celebrities and parents as
volunteers. Under their leadership, United Cerebral Palsy raised
more than $100 million for medical research and a variety of
clinical, educational, recreational, training and employment
services and family support for children and adults with palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Hausman also helped bring about the first United Cerebral Palsy
telethon in 1951. He initiated the New York chapter's annual awards
dinner in 1955, with Bob Hope as the guest of honor, and he
remained a central figure in the event until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former chairman, president and executive vice president
of the New York and national groups. In 1955, he also helped create
the national group's Research and Development Foundation, a
separate organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Hausmans also played a crucial role in creating North Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset on Long Island. They established
the Ethel and Jack Hausman Lectureship in Pediatrics and supported
the Hausman Department of Pediatrics. Hausman was the hospital's
president in the 1960s and endowed the Jack Hausman Professorship
in Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Vienna, Hausman came to New York as a boy. His
father, Morris, started M. Hausman &AMP; Sons, and Jack joined the
company at 14 as its bookkeeper while studying accounting at night.
</P>
<P>
   The sons, Jack, Leo and Sam, helped to build it into a concern
with nationwide operations. They bought out Belding Heminway &AMP; Co.
in 1960, and Jack Hausman remained its board vice chairman until
the company was sold in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Hausman died in 1993 after nearly 65 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard, of Montauk, N.Y., and
Michael, of Manhattan; his brother, Leo, of Manhattan, who is
president of New York United Cerebral Palsy; eight grandchildren
and nine great-grandchildren.

BETTY LEHAN HARRAGAN, 77, WRITER AND ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY
IN WORKPLACE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and
advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at
New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen
Harragan, her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Harragan's book ``Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate
Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson
Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been
published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college
undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a
television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam
Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Another book by Ms. Harragan, ``Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play
Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's
Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about
careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day,
Mademoiselle and Savvy.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for
which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms.
Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for
female managers. She also testified before legislative committees
on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for
women.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University
in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English
literature in 1947 from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New
York Telephone Co. and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms.
Harragan started Betty Harragan &AMP; Affiliates, a consulting company
that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David, died in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is
survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard
Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.;
two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio
of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.

HOGARTH LAUDS PUBLINKS' COMMON VIRTUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Tim Hogarth said the appeal of the U.S. Amateur
Public Links Championship is the fact that it's the people's golf
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth, who won the 1996 final in Hawaii to earn a 10-year
exemption, will play in the event that is being held again this
week at Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, one of 13 conducted annually by the U.S. Golf
Association, is for public-course players only and excludes players
who are members of private courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings together the normal guys,'' Hogarth said, ``the guys
that are there on the weekends waiting for the starting times. The
school teachers, the policemen, even the health-food salesman _
it's their tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth, a health-food broker, and 155 other golfers began two
rounds of stroke play Monday. After today's round, the low 64 will
advance to match play that runs through Saturday's 36-hole final.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth, who played golf at Alemany High School and was later an
All-American at Cal State Northridge, says nothing in the sport has
affected him as much as winning the PubLinks title.``It's a chance
to make history for yourself and memories that will last you the
rest of your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has achieved much, winning a Los Angeles City championship
two years ago and reaching the semifinals of last year's state
amateur after setting a medalist record of 16-under-par 138. But
nothing compared to his PubLinks title of '96. Because of that, he
got the opportunity to play in last year's Masters. And at every
tournament he has played in since winning the PubLinks, he has been
introduced as a former USGA champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any victory in a USGA event changes your life dramatically,''
Hogarth said. ``You can ask (1997 U.S. Amateur champion) Matt
Kuchar what his life has been like since he won.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's trademark smile and impressive play in this year's
Masters and U.S. Open have made him one of the most recognizable
amateurs in the country. Hogarth understands what Kuchar is
enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't believe that he's on that peak,'' Hogarth said. ``The
opportunity to play in the Masters is something every golfer will
cherish, and its all possible with this event.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a Masters invitation, PubLinks champions are
granted exemption into the next U.S. Amateur and Mid-Amateur finals
and into the final round of qualifying for the next U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth, who had some success playing professionally on the
Golden State Tour before regaining his amateur status three years
ago, says he has come to appreciate amateur golf more the longer he
plays it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows someone who loves golf the opportunity to compete at
a very high level,'' he said. ``The older I get, the more respect I
have for (1994 PGA Senior Tour rookie of the year) Jay Sigel. He
was able to golf (as an amateur) for so long, and then he plays on
the senior tour and he's a winner there also.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth said national tournaments such as the PubLinks
demonstrate how high the quality of play can be below the
professional level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing amateur golf, but it's not really that far of a
step below,'' he said. ``The U.S. Open and Masters have certainly
showed that your champion amateur golfers can compete at all
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hogarth will attempt to follow in the footsteps of
another former Alemany High star and win a second PubLinks title.
Sylmar's David Berganio accomplished that in 1991 and '93 before
going on to a professional golf career that earned him a PGA Tour
card last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Finneran, a longtime area golf instructor and teammate of
Hogarth's at Northridge, expects Hogarth to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that can play in the Masters and all those other
tournaments he's been in will do just fine,'' Finneran said. ``He
can hit it long, and he's tough on the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth will tee it up with the best of the nation's
public-course players, some of them once-a-week golfers who are
living the dream in this tournament. That's what Hogarth likes best
about the PubLinks _ that it's open to players who might not
otherwise have the chance to compete in a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still the opportunity,'' he said, ``for someone to
play the best golf that they ever played and jump out from nowhere
and win.''

50 YEARS IN FILM AND STILL COUNTING 
FILM FESTIVAL SHAKE-UP  
 AU REVOIR, DANIEL 
BUT CAN HE SING?
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I just found out I was born the day women got the
vote,'' Shelley Winters was saying. ``I was watching a documentary.
A state voted in favor, I forget which state. I've been telling
everyone I take two years off, but now I'll put them back.'' The
date, she said, was Aug. 18, 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days before she turns 76 _ no, 78 _ Ms. Winters will
receive a lifetime achievement award at the Hollywood Film
Festival. Looking back on a career of 150 films, she singled out
``A Place in the Sun'' as a favorite. ``It's a universal story,''
she said. ``All the women weep, and the men go, `Oh.' Forty-eight
years later. My God, I've been in movies for 50 years. But 50 years
isn't as long as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turned to her latest film, ``Gideon's Web,'' an
independent feature. ``I should have played the part where I was in
the nursing home, but they had me running it,'' she said. ``It
showed the kind of stopping of living people do when they retire. I
think retiring is the worst thing people can do.''
</P>
<P>
   FILM FESTIVAL SHAKE-UP
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There has been a shake-up at another film festival.
Denise Kasell, a film producer who ran the Hudson Valley Film
Festival, has taken over the Hamptons International Film Festival,
whose star power seemed somewhat dim last year (``Bigwigs Skip
Expanded Fest,'' Variety declared in a headline). The festival has
also recruited David Schwartz of the American Museum of the Moving
Image for its programming committee.
</P>
<P>
   But will the stars bring their reading glasses? The program at
another festival in Ms. Kasell's new neighborhood, the Music
Festival of the Hamptons, promised the aria ``There's Nothing So
Fat as a Woman'' by the 17th century composer Henry Purcell. It was
not an ode to Weight Watchers: The tenor Robert White told the
audience that the correct title was, ``There's Nothing So Fatal as
a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   AU REVOIR, DANIEL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I didn't bring you here just to celebrate the World
Cup,'' the French-born chef Daniel Boulud told the lunchtime crowd
at Restaurant Daniel on East 76th Street. Certainly not: He wanted
to talk about his restaurant's fifth anniversary, and the fact that
it is closing next month.
</P>
<P>
   Well, moving. The room where Boulud's customers have been seated
since 1993 will be remodeled as Cafe Boulud, a less formal
restaurant. Daniel will reopen at the end of the year at 65th
Street and Park Avenue, where Le Cirque used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd looked at blueprints and drawings, as well as
prototypes of plates on which the food will be served. ``They
haven't made hundreds of these yet, have they?'' asked Joel Smilow,
Boulud's financial partner, looking at a plate on which the words
``Cafe Boulud'' appeared, over and over, in a circle. He suggested
simplifying the design, then declared, ``I never try to interfere
or second-guess creative or restaurant-type decisions.'' Nor did he
try to rein in the ever-exuberant Boulud. ``When he'd be asked to
go on the David Letterman show, he'd say it would be great for
business. I'd say, `Daniel, how can it be great for business? You
can't serve more people than you're serving already.'''
</P>
<P>
   BUT CAN HE SING? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from Bert Parks: Boomer Esiason, a former
quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, will be the host of this
year's Miss America Pageant. Esiason will also make his debut as a
commentator on ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' which took over the
pageant broadcast last year.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Horn, the longtime president and chief executive of the
pageant, announced Esiason's arrival at the same time that he
announced his own departure. Horn, 61, said that after the Sept. 19
pageant, he would move to Jackson, Tenn., his wife's hometown, to
become a ``country lawyer.'' His replacement has not been named.

COLUMN: WAS FORMER JUDGE A SCAPEGOAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is safe to say that Lorin Duckman, formerly Judge
Lorin Duckman, is one of the more reviled public figures in New
York City. The attacks against him have been so harsh, you would
almost think that Duckman alone stood between New York and
Periclean bliss.
</P>
<P>
   His critics' line of reasoning leads to one logical conclusion:
Now that he has been booted off the bench, in a decision upheld
last week by the state Court of Appeals, we can expect a flawless
city where no one is murdered, no man beats his wife and everyone
is ineffably courteous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it did not seem an affront to democracy to visit Duckman
Monday in his house near Prospect Park in Brooklyn to hear his
version of events. What he went through these last two years, he
said, was nothing less than a ``lynching.'' It was an opinion that
might be dismissed as mutterings of a bitter man, except that
dissenting judges on the Court of Appeals came close to saying the
same thing in more judicial language.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a dissenting opinion is more of an eye-opener than a
majority ruling, especially when, as in this case, the majority
writes with the blandness of someone going through the motions and
the minority writes with fervor. Here is what one impassioned
dissenter, Judge Vito Titone, said in part about the Duckman
affair:
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication of the present disciplinary proceeding is that
judges whose rulings displease the political powers that be may be
subjected to a modern-day witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   You will remember that the state's most powerful politicians
went after Duckman in 1996 after he set relatively low bail for a
man jailed on domestic-abuse charges. Once released on bail, this
man, Benito Oliver, killed a former girlfriend, Galina Komar, and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lost no time
screaming for Duckman's scalp. Then other judges came in their
cross hairs, damned as responsible for New York's crime problems.
It was an all-out assault, abetted mightily by baying tabloid
headlines about ``junk justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the noise was a critical fact: The state Commission on
Judicial Conduct and other bodies that reviewed the Oliver case
determined that Duckman had done nothing wrong. But by then, he had
become the poster child in a conservative campaign against
pointy-headed, lenient judges. Officials were determined to build a
case against him, and, in Duckman's view, ``it was a done deal from
the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   He charged that the office of the Brooklyn district attorney,
Charles Hynes, had kept a dossier on him, and that it still does
with other judges deemed anti-prosecution. In response, a Hynes
spokesman said, ``We don't do that.'' But Titone, for one, was
willing to believe that anti-Duckman files were kept, and said so.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the case against Duckman was built on episodes in
which he used intemperate language, as well as 16 cases in which
his dismissal of criminal charges was questionable or even, as he
now acknowledges, flat-out wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But are we seriously to believe that no judge still on the bench
has uttered intemperate words in the hurly-burly of the New York
court system? Bear in mind, too, that no one had brought
disciplinary charges against Duckman until after the Oliver case.
</P>
<P>
   As for those 16 dismissals, all involved misdemeanors, and the
district attorney appealed not one of them. How outraged could he
have been?
</P>
<P>
   And even if Duckman's judgment was off, they were 16 cases out
of 55,000 _ repeat, 55,000 _ that he handled in five years as a
Criminal Court judge. To another Court of Appeals dissenter, Judge
Joseph Bellacosa, the ax that fell was ``disproportionate to the
nature, number and gravity of the proven and acknowledged judicial
misdeeds, misspeaks and mishaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument here is not that Duckman was the wisest judge since
Learned Hand. He is clearly a quirky character, as evidenced by the
whimsical duck themes that fill his house: wooden ducks, Donald
Duck, posters for the Marx Brothers' ``Duck Soup.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to ask how well anyone's reputation would hold up
if put under a microscope the way his was once the politicians
decided that he must go. More important is whether other judges
have been intimidated by his example. Absolutely, Duckman said,
``judges are in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a serious charge, and, the appellate dissenters agreed, no
canard.

E.Y. TAKES TURN ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Second baseman Eric Young, who leads the National
League with 33 stolen bases despite missing 14 starts with a
strained quadriceps, was placed on the 15-day disabled list after
doctors determined his leg was not improving.
</P>
<P>
   Young, sidelined the past two games after going 4 for 11 to
start the second half, was placed on the DL on Monday after
undergoing an MRI exam. Young first injured the leg May 19 in
Chicago and has missed playing time on four separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wanted to put Young on the DL June 26 in Texas when
he reinjured the leg a third time, but he talked general manager
Tom Lasorda out of making the move. Instead, he missed the final
five games of the first half and hoped the three-day All-Star break
would get him back to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to play against the Giants and the Padres, and I
respect his desire to take one for the team,'' Lasorda said. ``But
we can't have this continue. We need him healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Young becomes the fourth member of the Dodgers' starting infield
to go on the DL. First baseman Eric Karros missed the season's
first 22 games after knee surgery. Shortstop Jose Vizcaino has been
out since June 22 with a severely sprained right ankle. Third
baseman Bobby Bonilla, who since has been moved to left, was on the
DL from June 20 to July 3.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hubbard back: Trenidad Hubbard, who was sent down Sunday to
make room on the roster for pitcher Brian Bohanon, was recalled
Monday to take Young's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Dodgers tried to option Hubbard to the
minors, but he came up with a sore left knee and was placed on the
disabled list. Hubbard is batting .323 in 39 games with the
Dodgers, including four homers and eight RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hubbard never left Los Angeles, the Dodgers did burn an
option by sending him down. A player is allowed three with each
team before he has to clear waivers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hershiser comes home: On Wednesday, former Cy Young
Award-winning right-hander Orel Hershiser will make his first
appearance at Dodger Stadium since leaving the club in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was moved up in the Giants rotation after left-hander
Shawn Estes, Wednesday's scheduled starter, was scratched because
of shoulder fatigue. He faced the Dodgers on July 3 in San
Francisco and won 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely will be special,'' said Hershiser, who is 7-7
with a 4.01 ERA this season. ``I mean, that goes without saying. I
don't think it's going to be emotionally hard because, like I
explained in San Francisco, it's really not against guys that I
lived and died with other than a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big series for the Dodgers. So I know that it's going
to be a big game for us, because they're trying to climb back in
the race and we're trying to chase the Padres.''

LAWYERS FOR SUSPECTS ACCUSE POLICE OF CONCEALING EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Also see MISSING-MILLIONAIRE)   (sw) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nine days after Irene Silverman mysteriously
vanished, the lawyers for the mother and son under investigation in
the case went to the socialite's lavish East Side mansion on Monday
and accused the police of concealing evidence that might clear the
suspects of any suspicion in her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a combative news conference that used Mrs.
Silverman's East 65th Street home as a backdrop, the lawyers gave
the first glimpse of their possible defense in the case, should any
charges be brought against their clients, Sante Kimes and Kenneth
Kimes. The lawyers described Mrs. Silverman, 82, as a domineering
woman whose contentious personality might have provided motives for
a long list of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, Matthew Weissman and Jose Muniz, also accused the
police of using the news media to smear their clients' reputations
by portraying them as a mother-and-son con artist team who traveled
the country preying on the wealthy, and suggested that members of
Mrs. Silverman's staff of 10 servants might be involved in her
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tough lady, she treats her help very abruptly, she's
hard on her employees,'' Weissman said. ``She has a lot of
arguments with them. She's not the lovely eccentric old lady who's
devoted to the arts and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   With television cameras rolling, Weissman later banged on the
mansion's front door demanding that detectives let him in so that
he could monitor the investigation and find evidence to prove his
clients' innocence inside the $6,000-a-month suite in the mansion
that Kimes rented from Mrs. Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, 23, and Mrs. Kimes, 63, were arrested in Manhattan on
July 5 on the relatively minor charge of using a bad check to
purchase a Lincoln Town Car in Utah, but have since been linked to
a series of disappearances and a murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police have said the Kimeses are suspects in the
shooting death in March of their former business partner after they
used his property to obtain a fraudulent $280,000 loan. The
authorities in the Bahamas have said the Kimeses are under
investigation in connection with the disappearance of a bank
auditor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The New York police have found no sign of Mrs. Silverman, who is
presumed dead by many of her friends, but detectives have
discovered tantalizing links between her and the Kimeses. Four days
before Mrs. Silverman vanished, for example, the Kimeses took a
notary public to Ms. Silverman's office and asked her to sign a
power of attorney form, according to an investigator who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. The Kimeses were also carrying Mrs.
Silverman's passport and other identification when they were
arrested, the police have said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Kimeses' arrest, their car contained business
documents, a loaded 9-millimeter handgun and the same brand of
.22-caliber ammunition used in the March 14 slaying of David
Kazdin, their former business partner in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   New York detectives have found a small spot of blood on a seat
belt of the Lincoln Town Car and a small patch of blood outside
Mrs. Silverman's home, but have not yet received laboratory
results.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz and Weissman offered explanations for some of the
evidence. The gun had been purchased by a former employee of the
Kimeses, Weissman said. He suggested that the employee, who later
became an informer for the FBI and helped the authorities arrest
the Kimeses, had close ties to Kazdin before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gambled together in Las Vegas,'' he said, ``and whether
the FBI put the heat on him and he found it appropriate or adept to
pass the buck to our clients, we'll find out down the line.'' Los
Angeles police investigators say the former employee is not a
suspect in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz also said he is confident that a DNA examination will show
that the blood did not come from Mrs. Silverman or the Kimeses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ ``So, where we going, Braggie?'' Mo
Vaughn cracked to Darren Bragg the other day, when talk of Vaughn's
contract negotiations dominated the Red Sox clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg looked puzzled for a moment, then broke into a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can afford to take both of us,'' said Bragg, the
Connecticut brown-bagger who this spring had to ask his agent how
much he'd signed for.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bragg's $367,500 salary barely registers on the Red
Sox' $51 million payroll, there was no overlooking his value to the
team Monday night in a 2-0 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays that
ended a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox right fielder followed a two-out, carpet-rolling
double by Mike Benjamin with an RBI single to break a scoreless tie
in the fifth, and threw out Wade Boggs at the plate in the sixth to
preserve a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs's 40-year-old legs were no match for Bragg's strong right
arm, which easily cut down the former Red Sox at the plate as he
tried to score on Dave Martinez's single off Steve Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to send him,'' Bragg said, ``so I just
tried to get to it quick and make a good throw. I threw it on the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary singled in Boston's second run, only his second hit
in 17 at-bats since the All-Star break, in the eighth. Though the
Red Sox had 10 hits, all but one were singles, which hardly
constituted an end to the offensive drought that struck with a
vengeance in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But it was enough against the pitiful Devil Rays, who have lost
11 in a row and six of seven to the Sox this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five innings, you're pushing, pushing, pushing,''
Vaughn said, ``but then Braggie got a big hit, made a big play to
keep us in it, and we went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is like anything. You feel it, you know how to get it
done. But it's never easy when you go through a slide like that.
The first one you win is always a close game, always tight, but
that kind of game, when you win, can change your attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragg and Vaughn also were involved in the night's comic relief,
when the scoreboard operator at Tropicana Field drew Vaughn's ire
for stating, big as life on the jumbo-sized screen, that Bragg once
knocked out Vaughn in a high school football game.
</P>
<P>
   That set Vaughn to gesturing toward the press box, and prompted
the following message to appear on the board: ``Sorry about that,
Mo, that intern has been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Vaughn was asked, did the pride of Taft High in Watertown
really smoke the joy of Trinity Pawling Prep on the football field?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy?'' Vaughn asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Bragg acknowledged the big man was right. ``We had
some good collisions,'' he said. ``He might have had double vision
a couple of times, but I never knocked him out, and he never
knocked me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where they got that, but it's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays stirred late when Boggs singled off lefty
reliever Ron Mahay in the eighth. But Tom Gordon, who hadn't
pitched since his All-Star appearance, retired pinch hitter Aaron
Ledesma on a ground ball and struck out pinch hitter Fred McGriff
to end the inning, then finished off the Devil Rays in the ninth
for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to Avery, who is now 6-2 and matched his victory
total from last season, when he was one start away from becoming
history in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had no shortage of runners against Avery,
posterboy for five-inning pitchers, who was rescued in the sixth by
a big strikeout of Mike Kelly by Derek Lowe with runners on second
and third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable,'' Avery said. ``I mostly got outs
on sheer will. And (the Devil Rays) were probably a little anxious,
pressing a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lefthander gave up five hits, walked four, and threw a wild
pitch in his 5 2/3 innings, but he also struck out the side in the
third and benefited from two double plays, one of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   That came in the second, when John Flaherty hit a line drive
back at the pitcher with Martinez on second after a walk and stolen
base. Avery got his glove on the ball, then when it popped loose,
grabbed it with his pitching hand and fired to second baseman Mike
Benjamin to double up Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was self-defense,'' Avery said. ``It knocked my glove
off. The ball popped up, my glove was half on, and I grabbed it
with my other hand. Then I looked to second, nobody was really
close, so I decided to throw it to the first guy I made eye contact
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a screwed-up play, but the kind of break you need to
get a win.''

APPEAL SET IN RULING ON SECRET SERVICE TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has decided to appeal a
decision last week ordering Secret Service agents to testify before
a federal grand jury in the Lewinsky matter, a senior
administration official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Attorney General Janet Reno had decided
on Monday to support a further appeal to the full panel of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On July 7, a
three-judge panel from the appeals court unanimously rejected the
administration's argument that Secret Service agents should be
entitled to a novel privilege that would shield them from
testifying in most criminal inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows a debate within the top ranks of the
Justice Department about the wisdom of a further appeal. Some
officials had argued that because there was virtually no law on the
administration's side to establish such a privilege, it would be
counterproductive to seek a further review. But Lewis Merletti, the
director of the Secret Service, had strenuously argued that the
president would distance himself from his bodyguards _ putting his
life in danger _ if Secret Service employees were compelled to
testify about his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the office of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, have been seeking the testimony of three
Secret Service officials for months to help determine whether
anyone committed obstruction of justice, witness tampering or
perjury in the inquiry of the relationship between President
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Those three were identified as John Kelleher, the chief counsel
of the Secret Service, and Gary Byrne and Brian Henderson, both
uniformed officers, lawyers involved in the appeal said. The
lawyers said investigators wanted to know whether the uniformed
officers discussed Ms. Lewinsky with Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, Byrne had apparently informed Evelyn
Lieberman, then deputy chief of staff at the White House, that he
had seen Ms. Lewinsky in the West Wing when he did not believe she
was authorized to be there. Ms. Lieberman has said Ms. Lewinsky was
transferred to the Pentagon and removed from her White House job
because of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of success in continuing the appeal, which was
first reported in the early Tuesday edition of The Washington Post,
seems slim. The full court of appeals does not usually accept such
reviews. If the court decides not to consider the matter, the
Justice Department may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court,
which would not hear the case until after it returned in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service case is one of two being litigated over legal
privileges and the independent counsel. A different panel is
expected to rule soon on over whether Bruce Lindsey, deputy White
House counsel and one of Clinton's closest aides, can refuse to
answer some questions on the grounds that they are protected by the
lawyer-client privilege.

L.A. STUDENTS RATE FAR BELOW NATIONAL AVERAGE ON STANFORD 9 TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAUSD students scored in the bottom third of the
country in the Stanford 9 standardized test _ and on average failed
to even match their national peers in any subject, according to
exam results.
</P>
<P>
   Test results released Monday for English-speaking and nonfluent
students showed the Los Angeles Unified School District
underperformed other districts in Los Angeles County for every
grade and every subject even though 48,000 limited-English students
opted out of taking the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking a state trend that showed higher scores among the
youngest students, the LAUSD's tallies showed its third and fourth
grades were the lowest performers while 11th-graders did best
comparatively.
</P>
<P>
   California students scored just below the 50th percentile
national average, while L.A. Unified students ranked between the
20th or 30th percentiles in nearly every grade and category.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' bilingual students in second through 11th grades,
required to take the exam in English under a controversial state
law, scored poorly in all subjects and never pulled out of the
bottom quarter of the country.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in four years California schools have all
taken the same standardized exam, and the first time that districts
have been required to administer it to their bilingual pupils _
setting a benchmark for measuring student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ruben Zacarias urged caution in interpreting the
test scores, saying the requirement to include scores of bilingual
students resulted in ``distorted'' figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are releasing the Stanford 9 results today to
overwhelming interest of the public and the media, it is important
for everyone to understand that the aggregate scores do not
accurately reflect the quality of instruction occurring in this
school district,'' said Zacarias in a written statement. ``With the
large number (46 percent) of limited English proficient students in
our classrooms, comparisons with other districts and even between
LAUSD schools can be misleading and should be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who pushed for the
statewide test, said the scores pointed out the need for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scores clearly point out that we must continue our
efforts to reform California's education system,'' said Wilson's
spokesman Ron Low. ``California's students should not be scoring at
or below the nation's average. California's students deserve better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 462,946 LAUSD students this year in first through
11th grades were tested in such subjects as reading, math,
language, spelling, science and social science. The state did not
require first-graders to be tested, but the LAUSD decided to give
the test to its students fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 363,612 students fluent in English in second through
10th grades took the test. Because most bilingual students were not
included, the results are not comparable, LAUSD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford 9 results are given in percentiles, showing how
students ranked against their peers across the nation. A student
who scores 25, for example, did better than 25 percent of students
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Individual student scores still are being sent to parents, with
some reports not expected to reach homes until the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Districtwide reading averages for each grade ranged from the
21st percentile to the 29th percentile, with third-graders bringing
in the lowest results. That poor showing was a blow to the LAUSD,
since Zacarias has called for for all third-graders to be reading
at grade level as part of his plan to increase student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Math averages were higher _ from the 27th to the 37th percentile
_ yet still below the national average of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Language scores echoed math scores with the lowest averages at
27 for third- and 10th-graders.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD Board of Education member David Tokofsky said low scores,
especially in reading, could be traced to poor leadership in the
highest levels of the district. While Zacarias was urging change _
including increasing test scores by 8 percentile points in four
years _ his staff was not following through, Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said there was little coordination in instruction. For
example, schools were using 18 different programs to teach reading,
and were offering very little staff development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias' performance in his first year on the job will be
evaluated today by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Although most districts already have issued their Stanford 9
scores, the LAUSD has let its results out in a trickle. On Monday,
it presented the results by grade, along with a school-by-school
breakdown for fourth-, eighth- and 11th-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information for all grades will be released eventually,
although district officials were not able to say when.
</P>
<P>
   Lilliam Castillo, deputy superintendent for instruction, said it
was important for the LAUSD to carefully analyze the scores before
their release _ and denied the delay was ``for the sake of spin.''
</P>
<P>
   However, district officials were not able to provide any
in-depth analysis of results for the three grades it released
Monday. Castillo said she believed that scores were ``not good
enough and we need to do a lot more to bring them up.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, the district released results only for its students
fluent in English, showing the average score rose slightly from
last year from the 31st to the 32nd percentile. Zacarias said that
comparison was the only valid comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``These comparisons are the ones we will find useful in helping
us to improve student achievement and that's our bottom line,''
Zacarias said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD had balked from releasing numbers for its bilingual
education students, citing a judge who banned districts from
issuing those scores. Lawyers representing the Oakland and Berkeley
school districts argued that scores from bilingual students would
be falsely low, and fail to indicate what they know.
</P>
<P>
   The state is fighting that temporary restraining order, and will
go to court later this week to request that it be lifted.

INDIANS SNAP YANKEES' 10-GAME WINNING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Orlando Hernandez is already renowned for his
ability to make adjustments on the fly, but on Monday night the
Cleveland Indians made their own adjustments to Hernandez and beat
the right-hander, 4-1, snapping the Yankees' 10-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a home run and a triple against Hernandez, and
Jaret Wright (9-5) pitched seven innings to become the first
pitcher to beat the Yankees (65-21) twice this season. The only run
allowed by Wright was a long home run to Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we're not doing it lately,'' Paul O'Neill said.
``We're putting a lot of pressure on our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed nine hits, two walks and four runs in six and
two-thirds innings. Two of the hits he yielded were homers: one to
Thome, the first homer Hernandez had given up in 44 innings, and
the other to Kenny Lofton, only the third the Cuban pitcher has
allowed since joining the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yankees won, their 66-20 mark would have been the best
86-game record in the 20th century, one game better than that of
Honus Wagner's 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates. As it stands, the Yankees
and the 1902 Pirates are tied, along with the 1912 New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Indians for the second time in less than a month,
Hernandez dominated in the early innings, confusing batters,
forcing them to swing on his terms, throwing almost everything on
the outer edge of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   After Omar Vizquel stole second with one out in the first,
Hernandez struck out David Justice swinging on a straight changeup,
and with a 2-2 count on Thome, Hernandez chose that moment to throw
his first curve. Thome watched it bend over the plate for strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright, Cleveland's burly bleached-blond pitcher, matched
Hernandez in the early innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wright retired Tino Martinez and Tim Raines to open the fourth
inning. Strawberry walked to the plate, in the midst of a 1-for-19
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Wright threw him what appeared to be a high fastball, and
Strawberry smashed it more than 400 feet, the ball carrying until
it bounced on top of the ledge of the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson, the second-base umpire, immediately signaled home
run _ Strawberry's 12th, the most in a season for him since 1991 _
and Lofton, the center fielder, and others complained that the ball
had struck the yellow border above the fence and should have been
in play.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's call stood, and the Yankees had a lead, something they
do not often relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' hitters made an adjustment, however, and lurched
ahead. Realizing that Hernandez was throwing outside repeatedly,
Thome leaned across the plate with one out in the fourth inning and
drove the first pitch to the opposite field, instead of trying to
pull it, for a home run into the left-field stands, his 24th.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians seemed to ascertain what Thome did right in going to
the opposite field. After Manny Ramirez walked, the
left-handed-hitting Brian Giles banged a first-pitch fastball to
left field, off the wall, Ramirez stopping at third base. With two
right-handed batters due to hit, Hernandez was still in control:
right-handed batters had just 7 hits in 72 at-bats against the
pitcher known as El Duque, because they have such a difficult time
with his sidearm slider.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw a sidearm slider to Sandy Alomar, who stretched
his arms to reach the ball out of the strike zone. He barely hit
the ball, but hit it enough. The ball fell over the head of
Martinez, the first baseman, scoring Ramirez with the run that gave
Cleveland a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thome again reached out in the sixth inning to drive a ball to
the opposite field, and when it bounced against the wall and above
the leaps of outfielders Raines and Chad Curtis, Thome rambled into
third with a triple. He scored on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton homered in the seventh, his fifth hit in eight at-bats
against Hernandez. Two batters later, Manager Joe Torre relieved El
Duque, who stalked off, self-torture evident in his grimace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go more away,'' catcher Jorge Posada said
afterward of Hernandez's pitching pattern. ``For him to do well,
he's got to pitch inside.''

DODGERS WIN, SHOW SOME FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers don't care if they have
been reduced to the watered-down wild card. They were facing the
San Francisco Giants on Monday night and that always means
something.
</P>
<P>
   Their 7-5 victory didn't draw much of a crowd, which isn't
surprising from fans hoping for more than the chase for second
place. But the Dodgers showed 36,409 a few pluses they hope will
make the second half worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Dodgers within 5{ games of San Francisco
for the wild-card spot in the National League. Of course, there are
four other teams between the Giants and Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   On a less realistic front, the Dodgers even picked up a game on
West-leading San Diego, creeping within 12{ games of first place.
</P>
<P>
   There were individual efforts worth watching as well, and more
than just the first-inning home runs by Raul Mondesi and Eric
Karros. Gary Sheffield, who had three hits and two runs and now has
reached base in 15 of his past 20 plate appearance. He is 7 for 11
with six walks and has been hit twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also finally saw a glimpse of the Bobby Bonilla they
hoped they traded for in the big May 15 Mike Piazza deal. Bonilla,
who lost much of his power with an intestinal infection, finally
hit a ball with authority in the seventh inning. He even tried to
stretch the single into a double but was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki (5-4) ran his record to 4-0 since
joining the club June 5. He allowed eight hits and four runs in
62/3 innings before giving way to Scott Radinsky and Jeff Shaw, who
earned his first save as a Dodger and 24th overall.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there was Wilton Guerrero, who will be playing
second base for the next two weeks. Before the game, Eric Young was
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right
quadriceps. Guerrero, who had a career-high four hits Sunday night,
tripled to open the Dodgers' four-run first inning and made a
brilliant defensive play to end he seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers nearly chased Giants starter Danny Darwin (6-6) in
the first inning when they scored four times on four extra base
hits.
</P>
<P>
   With Guerrero on third, Mondesi drove a 1-0 breaking ball off
the cement facing of the second deck. For Mondesi, who hit his
team-leading 20th home run, had a hitting streak snapped Sunday at
11 games but entered Monday's game only 3 for 17 in the first four
games of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, however, has had no such ups and downs. When he
followed Mondesi with a double to left, it marked the 25th
consecutive game he has reached base. It also was his fifth hit in
11 at-bats. He added two more, including a third-inning single
through a vacant second-base hole created when the Giants put three
players on the left side of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first, Sheffield's double set up Karros, who followed
with a two-run homer to left. It was his 10th of the season and his
48th and 49th RBI despite missing the first 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers extended their lead to 5-0 in the third when
Sheffield singled, took third on the first of two fielding errors
by Giants second baseman Jeff Kent and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants got back in the game in the fourth when former
Dodger Stan Javier hit a three-run homer with two outs. Mlicki had
allowed a one-out double to Barry Bonds then gave up a two-out walk
to J.T. Snow. The switch-hitting Javier, batting left-handed
against the right-handed Mlicki, drove the first pitch into the
left-field stands for his second homer of the season and first in
207 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla made it 6-3 in the fifth with a sacrifice fly that
scored Juan Castro. Kent got the run back in the sixth with his
eighth homer, and his first since missing a month with a sprained
right knee. He returned to the Giants' lineup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki reached on a throwing error by Kent with one out in the
sixth and later scored on a single by Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was replaced by left-hander Radinsky after Darryl
Hamilton singled with two outs in the seventh. Radinsky got out of
the inning when Guerrero made a diving stop at second and got up to
throw out Bill Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds opened the eighth by doubling to left center, stole third
and scored when Charles Johnson's throw got away from Adrian
Beltre.

WOMAN LEFT TO BLEED 3 HOURS, ABORTION CLINIC EX-STAFFERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER RATCLIFFE, SUSIE STECKNER AND JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Louann Herron lay bleeding to death from a punctured
uterus for more than three hours as a medical assistant at the A-Z
Women's Center begged her supervisor to call 911, three former
employees of the controversial abortion clinic say.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the supervisor paged Herron's doctor to get
permission to call paramedics, it was too late. Herron was
pronounced dead at a hospital across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Herron's abortion was performed April 17 by Dr. John Biskind,
the same doctor who delivered a full-term baby at the clinic June
30 after misdiagnosing the fetal age by 13 weeks. Biskind and
center officials on Monday refused to comment on the baby's birth,
which has prompted a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Herron's encounter with A-Z Woman's Center began in a similar
fashion. But it became a saga of disappointment, deception and
death, according to three former employees who told their stories
to ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the former employees, Herron, 32, was in the
process of being divorced when she visited the center April 7 with
a friend for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   An employee _ fairly new to the clinic _ performed an ultrasound
examination indicating that Herron was 23 weeks and a few days
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   State law permits abortions until the fetus is ``viable'' _ 23
weeks according to most medical definitions. The A-Z Women's Center
advertises in the Yellow Pages as the only clinic in Arizona that
performs abortions on fetuses up to 24 weeks along.
</P>
<P>
   According to information provided by Planned Parenthood, the
risk of death associated with abortion increases with the length of
pregnancy, from one death for every 600,000 abortions at eight or
fewer weeks to one per 6,000 at 21 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because Herron was so close to the 24-week limit and because the
person who performed the ultrasound was inexperienced, the clinic
administrator sent her to a sister clinic in the Phoenix suburb of
Glendale to have a second ultrasound done by a more experienced
employee.
</P>
<P>
   That employee told ``The Republic'' that Herron was 24 weeks and
four days pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, who says she fears that she and her children will
be targeted by anti-abortion protesters if her name is printed,
added that Herron cried when she was told the clinic could not
perform the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Herron went back to the clinic on McDowell Road and met with the
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after Herron's first visit, the administrator told
employees that she had a ``personal patient'' coming in. The
patient turned out to be Herron, now about 26 weeks pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Kimball is a registered nurse who quit the clinic after
Herron died. She told ``The Republic'' that during Herron's April
16 visit, she overheard Biskind tell a medical assistant to take an
ultrasound from a different angle to make Herron appear to be less
than 24 weeks pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Herron underwent a procedure to begin dilating her cervix, then
went home. She returned the next day about noon; Biskind began the
abortion a little after noon and finished at 12:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When Herron went into the clinic's recovery room, there was no
nurse present. The nurse on duty had left about 10 minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Several medical assistants were present, two of them new and
untrained. About 2 p.m., the assistants started to worry because
Herron was still bleeding. Most abortion patients go home after an
hour in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind told the assistants to give Herron medication for the
bleeding, then left the clinic, the former employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Herron remained in the recovery room, bleeding, for another two
hours. At about 3:50 p.m., the frantic medical assistants asked the
administrator to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor insisted on paging Biskind first, saying she
didn't ``want trouble,'' the former employee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to have been four other girls (medical assistants)
in there,'' she continued. ``None of them wanted to do anything.
They were all scared. Two of them were brand new to the clinic. . .
. They didn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Biskind told the employees to call paramedics. ``He made it very
clear that he was not coming back,'' the ex-employee said. ``When
the ambulance got there, (the administrator) kept stressing to them
that she didn't want them to put the sirens on because she didn't
want to alarm anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 911 tape, the caller, another medical assistant, first
tells the Phoenix Fire Department dispatcher to keep the sirens off
and to come to the back of the clinic. She then tells the
dispatcher the nature of the emergency. The dispatcher repeatedly
asks the caller whether the clinic has oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The caller says she doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics arrived, CPR was not being administered, said
Division Chief Bob Khan, so paramedics began the procedure.
Paramedics were concerned about the large amount of blood Herron
had lost, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   Herron was pronounced dead across the street at Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner's
Office ruled the cause of death was hemorrhaging from a punctured

   ``This girl didn't have to die,'' Kimball said. ``If I had been
there, or an RN had been there, she would have lived. I would have
called 911.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began looking into the center after the June 30
case. In that incident, Biskind began the abortion, but wound up
delivering a full-term baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   The child, who suffered a skull fracture and two deep
lacerations, reportedly shows no signs of brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Biskind was admonished by the state Board of
Medical Examiners ago for trying to abort another full-term baby,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Records also reveal that the A-Z Women's Center has been the
subject of several lawsuits. The clinic's CEO, Dr. Moshe
Hachamovitch, has been the target of at least seven complaints to
the examiners board.
</P>
<P>
   The board has said that it received a complaint about Herron's
death and is investigating the matter. Police and prosecutors have
not said whether they are looking into Herron's death. &QL;

MONAHAN STAKES CLAIM IN LEFT FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Undoubtedly, Shane Monahan will be one of those
players who is known as gritty, hard-nosed, tough. That's the
exterior and the mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Monahan also might be recognized as an angry young
man, but only occasionally and just because the Mariners' new left
fielder is such a perfectionist. When his own expectations aren't
met, tantrums result with helmets flying, teammates scattering.
</P>
<P>
   It is in his competitive nature, not to mention his genes. This
descendant of two Hockey Hall of Famers would body check you into
the boards, a candidate for the penalty box if he still played the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe only his fiancee has seen the flip side of Monahan's
apparent ruggedness. If you think the biggest catch he ever made
was the one that saved two runs and the game for Randy Johnson on
Saturday afternoon, Monahan would tell you otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred during spring training. Monahan went to his
girlfriend's school, where she is a sixth-grade teacher in the
Phoenix area. The morning announcements in each class are aired on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan popped up on the monitor as a special guest. He told his
soon-to-be fiancee, Alisha, that he loved her with all of his heart
and proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I said if your answer is yes, open your door and run
out,'' Monahan said. ``I was standing out in the hallway, and sure
enough, she came running out. I do have a romantic side to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, if there have ever been love stories in left field,
they have been quick-readers with sad endings. The most recent
chapter featured Glenallen Hill, who was dismissed last week,
taking his iron glove to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When he started last Thursday's game against Anaheim, Monahan
became the 58th left fielder to play alongside Ken Griffey Jr.
Monahan might be the solution. The 6-foot, 200-pound 24-year-old is
a scrapper who likes to play defense, hit line drives and run the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Monday night's game, Monahan was averaging .417 in
his first three games since being called up from Tacoma. His first
hit was a two-run single, delivered when the bases were loaded, an
exception to the Mariner trend.
</P>
<P>
   His most significant contribution occurred two days later when
he dived to snare Tim Salmon's sinking liner in the eighth inning,
preserving Johnson's 2-0 victory. Monahan said later he would have
rather had his teeth knocked out than to have the ball get by him.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner can appreciate that type of dedication. The Mariners'
right fielder sees too many youngsters who don't respect the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see a kid coming up who is not afraid to leave a
little skin on the Astroturf,'' Buhner said. ``He plays the game
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Buhner playfully criticized Monahan for being too
outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to teach him not to be so diarrhea-mouthed, and then
he'll be just fine,'' Buhner said. ``He has a tendency to open his
trap a little too much. That's the only fault he has.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception surprised Monahan, who said: ``To my standards,
I've been quiet. I'm not going to speak unless I'm spoken to.''
</P>
<P>
   He intends for the last word to be different from the first.
Monahan carved out a hot-headed reputation in the minor leagues. He
got into one scuffle last year. He has tossed helmets and broken
bats.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan's fiancee cautioned him about his behavior, reminding
him that kids were watching, to ``chill out.'' He tries to watch
himself now, admitting that he has to fight the urge.
</P>
<P>
   The nut-outs are still one play away, like when Monahan ran home
the other night, even though third-base coach Steve Smith told him
to see the ball through the infield. He was gunned down by the
second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just pumped up, I guess, trying to make things happen,''
Monahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan was trying to score, just like his father, Hartland,
frequently did as a right-winger in the NHL. His grandfather is
Bernie ``Boom-Boom'' Geoffrion who starred in Montreal and New York
and those Miller Lite commercials. His great-grandfather, former
Canadien Howie Morenz, was the best of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan quit playing hockey when he became a teenager. The
Mariners spotted him at Clemson, where Monahan was a two-time
All-American, selecting him in the second round of the '95 draft.
</P>
<P>
   He wears No. 12, though he is actually No. 58, hopeful that the
Mariners can stop counting and start experiencing a little
stability in left field.
</P>
<P>
   M'S LOG: Utility player Rickey Cradle was sent down to Class AAA
Tacoma to make room for pitcher Ken Cloude. . . . Reliever Greg
McCarthy suffered a sprained right ankle during pregame drills.
While McCarthy ran sprints he stepped on a baseball. His foot
buckled, and he limped off the field and into the clubhouse. His
status was not announced. . . . The season attendance total for 46
Mariners home games is a little more than 1,550,000, a drop of more
than 12 percent from a year ago, when the club drew nearly
1,800,000 for its first 46 home dates. . . . The M's got a visit
from retired hitting coach Lee Elia prior to the game.

Diamondbacks keep Astros reeling
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ Bank One Ballpark must have looked like an oasis to the
Astros, who arrived in the desert thirsty for a victory after
losing three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Make that four.
</P>
<P>
   The most woeful team in the majors added to the Astros' miseries
Monday night, tagging them with a 5-3 loss that extended their
losing streak to a season-worst four games.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Arizona Diamondbacks should have been just what
the doctor ordered, but these are sickly times indeed for the
Astros. Temperatures are expected to exceed 100 degrees in the
Phoenix area today. Perhaps the Astros should allow their bats to
soak up some rays. Anything to break the cold spell.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have the second-worst pitching staff in the
National League, and Monday's starter, Amaury Telemaco, hadn't won
a game outside of relief appearances since Aug. 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way the Astros are struggling, Telemaco might as
well have been Greg Maddux, and the Diamondbacks might as well have
been the Atlanta Braves. Telemaco (3-3) and relief pitchers Bobby
Chouinard and Gregg Olson held the Astros to five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not swinging the bats well,'' said Astros second
baseman Craig Biggio, who is hitting .158 since the All-Star break.
``It's as simple as that. We usually don't get so many guys
struggling at once, but sooner or later we're going to break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou have only eight hits among
them in the five games since the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the offensive capabilities that we have, offense
is always the excuse people want to use when we lose,'' Astros
center fielder Carl Everett said. ``You're going to go through your
dry spells offensively. That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who lead the NL in runs, enjoyed one of their most
fertile offensive stretches just before the All-Star break when
they averaged 8.3 runs over an eight-game span. They've averaged
3.6 runs in the first five games of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from (Arizona's)
pitching,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said, ``but when we don't
hit for three or four days in a row, it's more than just the other
team's pitching. It's us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an unparalleled losing streak for the
Astros, who remained four games ahead of the second-place Chicago
Cubs in the NL Central. Although more than a few batting helmets
and bats have been slammed into the ground over the past four days,
the Astros insist they have not begun to press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we supposed to do, panic?'' right fielder Derek Bell
asked. ``We've only lost four games in a row. It's not like we've
lost 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Pete Schourek didn't allow an outrageous number
of hits, but the ones he surrendered were big. Four of the seven
hits the Diamondbacks collected while Schourek was in the game went
for extra bases, and three of them produced runs.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (5-6), who missed a chance to extend his winning streak
to three games, allowed five runs and three walks in six innings.
It was only the second time in his last seven starts that Schourek
allowed three or more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't make good enough pitches,'' he said. ``That's
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek allowed five Diamondbacks to reach base in the first
three innings, but he managed to keep each of them from crossing
the plate. The veteran lefthander ran out of escape tricks in the
fourth inning when the Diamondbacks put three runs on the board.
</P>
<P>
   An oxygen tank might have done Everett as much good as a glove
considering the workout Schourek put him through in the fourth.
After Schourek issued a leadoff walk to Jay Bell, Everett had to
chase down back-to-back triples by David Dellucci and Damian
Miller. Each three-base hit produced a run for the Diamondbacks, as
did Telemaco's sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I should've been able to get out of that inning in
better shape than I did, but I didn't,'' Schourek said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he probably could have used a break, Everett led off
the fifth inning with a single and scored along with Brad Ausmus on
Schourek's opposite-field double to left. They were the first two
RBIs of the season for Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Schourek, his bat was working better than his
pitches. Diamondbacks second baseman Danny Klassen led off the
bottom of the fifth with a homer into the left-field seats. The
second run of the inning was preceded by a controversial call that
resulted in the second ejection of the season for Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams, who drew a walk and stole second after Klassen's
homer, was called safe at third on a fielder's-choice grounder by
Jay Bell. Dierker immediately bolted from the dugout and engaged in
the most spirited protest of a call in his 254 games as a manager.
When third-base umpire Angel Hernandez had heard enough, he
banished Dierker to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker didn't miss much. His offense managed only an infield
single after he was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hernandez) missed that call by a mile,'' Dierker said. ``That
was a costly run. Sometimes you get the breaks, and sometimes you
don't. I guess I was a little frustrated and got madder than I
should have.''

MARINERS BLAST RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Cloude stood with his right arm heavily encased in
ice, talking about his career performance.
</P>
<P>
   All Ken Griffey Jr. did was flash a smile before he brushed off
a night that makes most careers.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, if it were only that easy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cloude looked more like a hospital patient than a
guy who threw a career-high eight innings, he helped the Mariners
score a casual 10-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Monday night
at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude (5-7) supplied the sweat and stamina. Edgar Martinez
produced the power.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey _ in his own
simple-but-don't-you-try-this-at-home-manner _ manufactured the
breath-taking highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 7-3 in the fifth inning, Griffey robbed Will Clark of an
extra-base hit with a spectacular catch. Clark belted a Cloude
fastball 400 feet into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, running hard with his back to the ball, reached out his
glove and made an over-the-shoulder catch before crashing into the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   The play was reminiscent of Willie Mays, but is becoming
routinely Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   About the only other spectacular part of the game was Cloude's
pitching. He allowed just two earned runs and struck out four.
Cloude, who returned from Class AAA Tacoma yesterday, could have
worked the ninth if not for having pitched three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Griffey stole his thunder. But what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   At least Cloude got a good look at the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best catches I've ever seen,'' said Cloude,
who was asked how Griffey makes such plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does he do a lot of the things he does? He's amazing. He's
the best player in baseball,'' Cloude said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a reporter mentioned that to Griffey before the
game. Griffey responded, ``I don't play for that. I play to win
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who went 3-for-5 with 2 RBIs, did not want to comment
after the game. However, he helped the Mariners win for the third
time in five games since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy, what a play,'' M's manager Lou Piniella said. ``Over
the shoulder, over the play and against the wall. He just turned it
perfectly, and made it look easy. ... We played crisp on the field.
It was a good ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their chances in the American League West, the M's crept
to within 12 games of first-place Anaheim, which lost to Oakland.
If only for one more day, the Mariners remain optimistic about
climbing out of the division basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent (to get back in the race),'' said Martinez,
who hit his 16th home run in the first inning and 17th in the
sixth. ``We can do it. I believe in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Todd Van Poppel (1-2) took the loss. He struggled
with his control from the outset. What Van Poppel got over the
plate, the Mariners picked up. Martinez registered the biggest blow
of the first inning, popping a three-run blast deep into the
right-center-field bleachers. It came on Van Poppel's first pitch
to Martinez, only moments after Griffey's RBI single scored Joey
Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners sent nine batters to the plate in the first,
beginning with Cora's leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-0 cushion out of the gate did not preclude a shaky start
from Cloude. He threw six pitches before walking the first hitter
he faced. Cloude's inconsistency quickly cost him three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude threw 117 pitches, although he settled down in the middle
innings. He ended the third with two strikeouts and didn't allow a
runner to get in scoring position in the next three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners chased Van Poppel and distanced
themselves from the Rangers with three runs in the fourth. The
Rangers used three pitchers in that inning, which ended with the
Mariners ahead 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Alex Rodriguez's two-out RBI double put the
Mariners ahead 8-3. They took a 9-3 advantage on Martinez's second
homer in the sixth. It was his 1,300th career hit. Another run
before the inning ended gave the M's a 10-3 lead.

FORGET MARINER WOES AND JUST ENJOY WATCHING GRIFFEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For any citizens of Marinerville who have spent too
much time senselessly worrying about whether Ken Griffey Jr. smiles
too much or not enough _ are we a society with too much time on our
hands or what? _ do yourself a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Walk up and buy a ticket for Tuesday night's Mariner game
against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, try not to care that some of the money will help
ease the burden on the Mariner owners _ those indecisive fellas too
paralyzed to have pulled the trigger on any moves that would have
salvaged this frustrating season and put this should-be contender
back on track.
</P>
<P>
   For now, forget about all that.
</P>
<P>
   Just for tonight, let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Marinerville, Griffey is doing great stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Like making catches that make his seen-it-all manager glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, boy, was that a pretty catch,'' Lou Piniella said Monday
night after his MVP center fielder ran down a ball and let it drop
into his glove with so much ease you wonder what Griffey would do
if baseball was basketball and he could have the ball at the end of
every game.
</P>
<P>
   People talk about why Griffey doesn't inflict his will on his
team. People are wondering why he doesn't blow up his clubhouse and
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   People wonder whether he is a natural-born leader, but for
everyone who wonders, Griffey has his answer.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, you have to wait your turn. It takes 25 guys to
win. It takes all nine on the field to perform.
</P>
<P>
   So he can't take over. He can't demand and take over. It's not
the way it works _ and give Griffey some credit for not thinking he
could save the Mariners. His ego truly isn't that large.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Griffey made a catch Monday night on Will
Clark's long fly ball that made your mouth drop. It elevated a 10-3
victory into the realm of entertainment and wonder _ a nice thing
considering so much of the Mariners' season has been such a bloody
and blood-curdling disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was over the shoulder. Over the back. Against the wall,''
Piniella said, almost reveling in his description of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that play once in the 1954 World Series. Willie Mays
caught a fly ball by Vic Wertz,'' Piniella said, recounting the
immortal Mays play at the Polo Grounds that also doubled up the
Cleveland runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing those kinds of plays a couple times a summer.
He timed it perfectly. He made it look so pretty,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had themselves that kind of night. Ken Cloude
pitched through some trouble and got the 10-3 win. Edgar Martinez
cashed in for two homers. The Kingdome crowd got to stand and cheer
in the ninth, when Bobby Ayala came on in relief and preserved the
win.
</P>
<P>
   All those boos in Denver did perk his ears and his conscience.
He has been thoughtful and patient since his return, trying to
explain the pressure and demands on him and the reasons he has for
handling the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, he says, is what he does on the field.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, he is racking up hits faster and with more
persistence than a lumberjack taking cuts at the tallest Douglas
fir.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey now has 1,499 hits to his major league credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, No. 1,500 should go in the books, considering
that Griffey has seemed all but bent on making contact and getting
base hits and driving up his batting average.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after hitting .282 a month before the All-Star break,
Griffey has gone on a deliberate march toward hiking his batting
average. It culminated in Monday night's 3-for-5 effort, nailing
three singles and collecting two more RBIs. That puts him at .303 _
the first time since June 2 he has been over .500. He has 38 RBI in
the last 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. All while cranking out 38 homers _ enough to keep him
on pace with McGwire to make September a time for a national
feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if he's the fastest major leaguer to collect 1,500
hits. This is Griffey's 10th season _ hard to believe he is 28
years old with a decade of experience. And we all know Griffey has
a long way to go to even think about Pete Rose's 4,256 career hits.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey is no Pete Rose, who Griffey called the leader of
the Big Red Machine and who said he could never be like on the
field or in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is a different sort of star. Superlative. Superior.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a different sport, like the one Michael Jordan
plays, Griffey could take over. But he is learning all the time
what this game demands of him, just as much as he continues to show
what he can give to it. And to us.

CONT: . . .from the death-rate studies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The department also tried to discredit the head of the research
team, UC Riverside Professor David Strauss. And department
employees who questioned the policy said they, too, had been
subject to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo written last year for Wilson, Amundson described how
the department was orchestrating a letter-writing campaign against
The Chronicle and other media and was aiding groups that joined the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   When the department withheld important data on the system's
performance and finances, The Chronicle filed 11 requests for
information under the California Public Records Act. All were
initially stalled or refused by Amundson's department.
</P>
<P>
   The delays and denials were, in effect, state policy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials kept track of the requests for information on private
logs, some of which were obtained by The Chronicle. One column
listed how much ``actual'' time it would take to comply with a
request; the next column, under the heading ``est. time including
Fudge Factor,'' doubled or tripled the response time, adding weeks
or months to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the data and documents were eventually
released, and San Francisco Superior Court Judge Raymond Williamson
ordered the state to pay $27,336 in attorney's fees to The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Amundson's department was scrambling to quell criticism
last year, alarms were sounding in other quarters of Smoley's
Health and Welfare Agency. The licensing division of the Department
of Social Services quietly opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the August 1997 draft report, researchers from the
division's Rohnert Park office counted 66 deaths among more than
2,000 state hospital residents moved to community care between
April 15, 1993, and Oct. 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, they conducted a ``comprehensive'' review of the 20
deaths among clients assigned to homes regulated by the licensing
division.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted ``many examples . . . of exemplary
practices'' among care homes and state oversight staff. But among
the 20 who died, they found a pattern of inadequate care and
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five (of the deaths) were clearly preventable and 11 were
questionable,'' the researchers wrote. ``It appears that some
deaths were the result of staff mismanagement, incompetent staff or
gross neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the preventable deaths and eight of the questionable
deaths had ``implications of staff mismanagement'' _ medication
errors, communication breakdowns, the caretakers' ``inability to
adequately understand and provide care for high-need clients.'' In
two deaths, staff at the homes had not received legally required
emergency health training.
</P>
<P>
   While licensing officials had already disciplined the homes in
three cases, the authors said, 16 of the deaths had never been
investigated. Seven had never even been reported to the licensing
office.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond such breakdowns, though, the researchers raised strong
doubts about the philosophy of placing the most severely disabled
in community care.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that the developmentally disabled be placed
in the ``least restrictive'' suitable setting. But according to the
study, overzealous pursuit of that goal may have resulted in forced
transfers and inadequate care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the cases reviewed indicated a high risk in community
placement,'' the researchers wrote. ``(We were) struck by the
discrepancy between the care needs of such profoundly disabled and
medically fragile clients and the level of care being offered to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who knew of the report remained unclear Monday. Eloise
Anderson, director of social services, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lopez, deputy director in charge of Community Care
Licensing, said some of the data gathered by the researchers were
sent to Wilson's office to support the department's proposed budget
increase. But, she said, the finding that 16 of the 20 deaths were
questionable or preventable was not included.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said she was ``not sure'' whether her division had passed
the report up the chain of command. Said Peter Castillo, an
attorney with the Department of Social Services: ``That's a
question for the Health and Welfare Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez declined to comment on most other aspects of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Some influential advocates speculated that because the report
was such a strong repudiation of state policy, officials may have
felt compelled to suppress it.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate, who asked to remain anonymous, put it bluntly:
``He (Wilson) doesn't want negative press, especially if he's going
to run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the secret report parallel those in another
internal state study quietly completed March 9 by the Department of
Developmental Services and released last week.
</P>
<P>
   That report counted 106 deaths among 2,641 people moved from the
state hospital from 1993 through 1997. Of those, 29 occurred within
a year of the move. Twenty resulted from homicide, automobile
accidents, medication errors and other ``possibly preventable''
causes.
</P>
<P>
   But that report, like the licensing division's mortality study,
has not been widely circulated. Instead, Smoley's agency and its
branches have been more eager to circulate reports that cast their
programs in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Wilson administration has released several
studies on mortality among the disabled, all of which cast doubt on
the UC Riverside research:
</P>
<P>
   -- In March, a $500,000 study by Citygate Associates, a
Sacramento management consulting firm, detailed problems in the
community care system: inadequate quality assurance at community
homes; elevated use of powerful sedatives; less access to medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released with the report, Smoley stressed the
favorable findings of Citygate's simple mortality review:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to note that the study found that mortality rates for
consumers in the community were not higher than those in the (state
hospitals), and were, in some cases, actually lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 28 deaths and found that ``only one . .
. was indisputably related to community placement.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Two professors with another consulting firm _
Pennsylvania-based Columbus Medical Services _ found 34 deaths
among those moved from the state hospitals from April 14, 1993,
through Dec. 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In two similar mortality studies released in October and in
January, the authors did not review individual cases. But based on
their statistical analysis, they reached a dramatic conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly probable that all 34 deaths might have occurred
anyway, even if the individuals had remained (in institutions).''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus has a $1.2 million contract to provide services to the
department. The state paid $40,100 for the studies.
</P>
<P>
   -- A fourth study, conducted by two professors at the California
State University School of Business Administration, found that
death rates were 26 to 43 percent higher in community care than in
state hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authors said, ``one must question whether this
difference (in death rates) is significant from a social
perspective, especially when one considers a greater possible
quality of life for all individuals placed in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   That study, released in June, cost the department $22,940.
</P>
<P>
   Amundson could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Allenby, his successor, stressed that the secret report
was not done by his department and that he had never heard of it.
He conceded that the array of conflicting studies would do more to
confuse the issues than to clarify them.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is that some preventable deaths
apparently occurred and that the state now must continue to repair
its system of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were perfect, they might not have occurred,'' he said.
``I don't know if, given the fragile nature of many of our clients,
you could ever get to the point where there's zero deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to try to . . . get it as close to zero as we
can.''

SECRET REPORT BLASTED CARE OF DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD W. LEMPINEN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ The Wilson administration has suppressed for
nearly a year a blistering internal study of deaths among the
developmentally disabled in community care, instead releasing a
series of reports that play down the problems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The secret report, obtained by The Chronicle, directly
challenges the safety and the philosophy of the state policy that
has moved more than 2,000 people with severe mental retardation and
other disabilities from hospitallike institutions into community
homes sometimes ill-prepared to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Staff competence at the community homes is ``too often
inadequate'' to meet the needs of severely disabled clients, says
the August 1997 draft report. Caretakers ``often'' did not
recognize life-threatening conditions and did not try to get
medical attention for them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the report says, ``some deaths, while perhaps not
preventable, exhibited incompetence, neglect or mismanagement by
facility staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson's administration has defended the controversial
transfer policy and the quality of care in the community. Monday,
officials in the governor's office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the suppressed report, prepared by a division of the
Department of Social Services, suggests that officials found grave
problems last year and then attempted to conceal them from public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The report was never circulated among disabled advocacy groups
or lawmakers who have been collaborating on reforms. Lawyers for
the Department of Social Services stonewalled or denied requests
for its release until late last week, when they promised to provide
a copy _ with most details about the client deaths and the authors'
analysis blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft obtained by The Chronicle, the researchers reviewed
20 deaths and concluded that 16 were ``preventable or
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 51-year-old man died after he suffered severe
burns in a scalding bathtub that was unattended. When staff members
discovered him, the report says, ``the large amounts of white
tissue floating on the surface around the client was thought to be
toilet paper instead of his skin.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a 47-year-old client died of a medication
overdose after members of the group home staff did not recognize
``pronounced overdose symptoms.'' A profoundly retarded 67-year-old
man died of cardiac arrest ``after being forced to attend a day
program while recuperating from pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle last year documented life-threatening breakdowns
in state care for those with mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
autism and other disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have since approved broad reforms to improve care and
tighten state oversight of disabled programs, and other reforms are
under consideration. Many advocates have argued, however, that the
reforms do not provide sufficient funds to hire, train and retain a
qualified staff in care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials never released the critical internal
report, they commissioned and circulated several others, all more
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Smoley, secretary of Wilson's Health and Welfare Agency,
in March heralded a $500,000 study that found no evidence of
elevated death rates. She also sponsored two public forums to
publicize the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's system of providing services to the
developmentally disabled is very sound,'' she said in a statement
released with the report, ``and is as good as any such program in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoley declined to comment on the secret mortality study done by
Social Services' Community Care Licensing Division, which also is
under her command.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of one influential family group said she was
``appalled'' that the report was not widely circulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly didn't publicize it _ they didn't say anything
about it,'' said Barbara Turner, president of the California
Association of State Hospital Parent Councils for the Retarded.
``In that regard, I think they're disingenuous, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other states, California has long attempted to move
the developmentally disabled from institutions. The practice
accelerated sharply in 1993 after a group of parents and advocates
sued to protest poor conditions in the state hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was settled when the Wilson administration and another
branch of his Health and Welfare Agency, the Department of
Developmental Services, agreed in 1993 to discharge 2,000 state
hospital residents into community care over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement created an unusual alliance of hard-line
disability rights advocates and the Wilson administration. The
former believe that institutional care is dehumanizing even for the
most vulnerable people; for the administration, community care
offered millions of dollars in potential savings over state
hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those who were discharged had extremely limited
intellectual function, complex medical conditions and sometimes
destructive behavior disorders. Although most completed the
transfer without incident, parents' and advocacy groups heard
scattered reports of injuries and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1995, a team of researchers based at the University of
California at Riverside had approached developmental services
officials with preliminary but troubling findings: Death rates
appeared to be significantly higher in community care than for
comparable clients in the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In a later study, the team found that among nearly 1,900 people
who had been moved from the state hospitals under the legal
agreement, 45 had died _ a death rate more than 50 percent higher
than the rate for similar clients still in state hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Those studies became the flash point for an acrimonious fight
among rival factions of parents, interest groups and policymakers
over the size and scope of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the researchers and some family groups,
the state pressed ahead and finished the transfers 18 months ahead
of schedule. And as the controversy became a public embarrassment
for the Wilson administration, state officials often tried to cloud
the issues and cast doubt on critics who offered devastating
reports of danger, injury and death among the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we did was geared to make closure of the
institutions look like a really wonderful thing,'' says one source
familiar with operations at the Department of Developmental
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important not to release any information or to let
people know of anything critical of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   In a copy of a handwritten 1996 memorandum obtained by The
Chronicle, then-department Director Dennis G. Amundson instructed
his staff to find ``favorable'' research on community care that
could be used to ``counter some of the . . . hoopla'' arising from
the death-rate studies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  MORE
</P>
<P>
   The department also tried to discredit the head of the research
team, UC Riverside Professor David Strauss. And department
employees who questioned the policy said they, too, had been
subject to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo written last year for Wilson, Amundson described how
the department was orchestrating a letter-writing campaign against
The Chronicle and other media and was aiding groups that joined the
attack.

initially stalled or refused by Amundson's department.

   The delays and denials were, in effect, state policy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials kept track of the requests for information on private
logs, some of which were obtained by The Chronicle. One column
listed how much ``actual'' time it would take to comply with a
request; the next column, under the heading ``est. time including
Fudge Factor,'' doubled or tripled the response time, adding weeks
or months to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the data and documents were eventually
released, and San Francisco Superior Court Judge Raymond Williamson
ordered the state to pay $27,336 in attorney's fees to The
Chronicle.

VIAGRA DOESN'T FAZE NEVADA'S WORKING GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE RUBENSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARKS, Nev. _ If there is a line of rejuvenated old men in
wheelchairs waiting to roll into the Mustang Ranch clutching
handfuls of Viagra pills, Amy the courtesan hasn't seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Candy, nor Autumn. And they've been looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd know,'' said Amy, very sweetly. ``The gentlemen would
tell us if they were using Viagra. The gentlemen tell us
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the specter of Viagra has wafted over the 34 legal
brothels of Nevada like the scent of chlorine from the party-room
Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothel owners even put out the word that, because of
Viagra, business was _ pardon the expression _ up. One working
woman near Carson City announced she was doing 20 percent more
business since the impotence drug hit the market, a suspiciously
specific number for a certifiably loose trade.
</P>
<P>
   And a Chronicle investigation at the Mustang Ranch, Nevada's
best-known brothel, did reveal a great deal, as any such
investigation would.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that the favorite food of demimondaines is Cap'n
Crunch cereal and Hostess Twinkies, washed down with Nestle's Quik
chocolate-flavored milk.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that the mattress of choice is Simmons, and that a
new shipment is being delivered to the ranch this week, because
mattresses tend to wear out here faster than in other venues.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that 90 percent of the shoes have three-inch spike
heels and that the women are remarkably adept at teetering across
the cheap carpeting on them.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that even with the air conditioner set at 68
degrees, there was nary a goose bump, for these are professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed a genuine ATM in the parlor that charges only $1.50
per transaction, which is less than the cost of other transactions
on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   It did not, however, reveal a single Viagra pill, or a courtesan
who said her customers had used the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't a thing to hide here,'' said Candy, who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ring the bell at the front gate of the ranch 10 miles east of
Reno and absolutely nothing is left to the imagination. Everything
is up front. If there is any fantasy about the Mustang Ranch, the
customer must bring it with him because it surely does not exist
behind the iron fence that surrounds the cluster of low,
barracks-style dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the women line up at the front door, shoulder to
shoulder, like Marines at roll call. Names are cooed. Some names
begin with K and end with I, like Kathi and Kristi. Others are
seasonal, like Autumn and Summer. All are fake.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is genuinely and forthrightly anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is in uniform. The customers wear blue, mostly jeans.
The staff wears pink, mostly shimmies.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with an eye for detail might notice that staff members
tend to look a lot like another Nevada regular _ the ladies who tug
the slot machines. Each wears a glazed, vacant expression while
cranking away at a repetitive act grounded in the coin of the
realm.
</P>
<P>
   After the selection is made, the parties proceed down the hall
to small cubicles crammed with mirrors and stuffed kitties and
puppies, where the transaction is effectuated. The manufacturer's
suggested retail price is $100, with dealer-installed extras
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Amy, a 36-year-old hotel clerk from Oregon, has been working at
the ranch for more than a year. She said the world's newest drug is
not likely to change the world's oldest calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke about it, among ourselves, but it's not really a
factor,'' she said. ``It might even be kind of scary, with all the
side effects you hear about. I mean, we're not doctors in there.
Sometimes we're psychiatrists, but we're not doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mustang Ranch is free of Viagra, it is also free of
venereal disease, muggings, rip-offs, pimps and ineptly performed
pretext Swedish massages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what you're going to get here, and you know that
you're going to get it,'' said George Flint, director of the Nevada
Brothel Association, while sitting at the bar in the parlor. He was
chewing on a cigar, which was unlit, in deference to the
hardworking ladies who pay his way.
</P>
<P>
   The work is timeless, said Flint. The trade goes on and on, and
mankind's only choice is whether to allow it with mandatory VD
tests and income tax withholding, Nevada-style, or with pimps and
muggings, Tenderloin-style.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning at the ranch brings another brilliant high desert
sunrise, and the opening of another box of Cap'n Crunch, and the
burning of the previous day's used latex in the old incinerator out
back.
</P>
<P>
   No, said Amy, the blue pill changes little in the land of the
red light. Viagra may be a miracle drug, but it is hardly a
substitute for a woman at the top of her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked miracles myself, honey,'' she said. ``We all
have. And you know how? Just by paying attention to business, and
doing what we do best.''

THIS IS THE WAY TO ENGAGE IN DEATH'S RITUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Vt. _ The shovel to dig the grave for my
mother-in-law's ashes was in the back seat of my rental car as I
drove here to the cemetery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With world enough and time we could have dug the hole with our
hands, probably, but it wouldn't have been as neat. And, naturally,
the digging would have been much slower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shovel made the work simple, which, in character, differed
rather radically from the life of the remarkable, complicated and
lovely woman whose remains we would inter here on a sweet, nearly
80-degree day when an occasional cloud offered relief from what
passes for summer heat in Vermont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery, which contains graves of people who died nearly
200 years ago, would have charged $40 to dig a small hole in which
to place an urn full of ashes of recently alive skin and bones and
love. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont branch of my family is not cheap. But when a
cemetery employee said even he considered $40 too much, my
mother-in-law's best friend in the universe said no one would pay
$40 _ not when we could, and should, do the job ourselves. So we
came here with a plain garden shovel, the type you might use to
transplant hostas. I leaned the shovel against a tree and waited
until Russell _ my wife's oldest brother, Elizabeth's oldest son _
arrived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job,'' he said quietly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' I said. ``I know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small, selfish part of me wished for a chance to dig the hole,
place the urn in it and say the closing prayer to tie together this
amazing day. But I have learned, I hope, when to disappear into the
background. So I handed the shovel to Russell, and he slammed it
into the moist earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was purposeful, full of clarity and grace. He split the
ground on four sides and peeled off a chunk of green Vermont turf
that spoke of recent rains and monarch butterflies and the kind of
sugary skies, overhead just then, that give atheists lapses of
disbelief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Two feet,'' I told him. That's how deep the hole had to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I say, I understood what a privilege it was for Russell to
dig the hole. And even as he shoveled he said, ``It feels like an
honor.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's grandson and I watched as Russell leaned to his work
with persistence and dug coffee-colored earth out of Betty's final
home. (Some called her Elizabeth, some Betty and some _ in touch
with her special vision and direction _ called her simply Bet.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Betty thought it awkward that she could be
confined to a granite-like box no more than 8 inches high. Betty
Locke had never been close to being that constrained her whole long
and intriguing life. She tended to move about with the beauty _ but
unpredictability _ of a butterfly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way we said goodbye to Betty is how funerals should be.
Doing it this way acknowledges the reality of our death, our earth
to earth, our dust to dust. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We do so many unwise things at grave-side services to shelter us
from the finality of death. We set up a tent to protect us from the
sun. We use Astroturf to hide the earth dug out to create the
grave. We leave before the body is lowered into the ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Wrong. All dead wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is how we did it: When it was time, Russell picked up the
urn and, arms quaking, set it into the bottom of the hole _ where,
by coincidence or providence _ he had struck the flat side of a
boulder in this stony soil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then we all came by, most of us, and threw dirt in the hole as a
final reminder that the ball of dust on which we live eventually
reclaims us all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later, after champagne and potato salad at the nearby church,
the love of Bet's life and I came back to the grave and filled in
the dirt. Each of us stomped down the earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as we finished, that very instant, a monarch butterfly _ as
if having someplace else to go, someplace eternal _ flitted over
our shoulders and was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

INTEL DEFENDS ACTS THE FTC SEES AS ANTICOMPETITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its first formal response to an antitrust suit
brought by the Federal Trade Commission, the Intel Corp. insisted
it was within its legal rights when it withheld some technology and
sought to retrieve other technology from three computer companies
with whom it was engaged in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed an antitrust suit last month against Intel,
accusing the company of injuring three computer manufacturers,
including the Compaq Computer Corp., in an attempt to coerce them
to turn over rights to patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Intel is accused of withholding information about
its chips that the computer makers _ the Digital Equipment Corp.,
the Intergraph Corp. and Compaq Computer, which has acquired
Digital, _ considered crucial to developing their own products
based on Intel microprocessors. At the same time, Intel asked the
companies to return to it other technology it had given them
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In its 15-page response Monday, Intel said it did not violate
any law nor did the company constitute a monopoly in the
microprocessor industry. The case is scheduled to go before an
administrative law judge on Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Molloy, a spokesman for Intel, said the company had been
in litigation with the other three companies and ``we thought it
prudent not to give our intellectual property to the people who
were suing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Molloy also said that Intel would argue that there was no
diminution to competition in the microprocessor industry because
those three companies are not principally makers of
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all systems companies,'' he said. ``Even if they left
the market there is still ample competition in the microprocessor
industry.''

CRITICS HAVE NO RIGHT TO ANONYMITY ONLINE, CANADIAN COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Canadian court ruling that may impose new limits on some
online discussions, an Ontario-based recycling company attacked by
pseudonymous critics on an Internet message board has succeeded in
unmasking several of its cyberantagonists.
</P>
<P>
   While the company, the Philip Services Corp., has not yet sued
for libel, it contends that it has been defamed by comments posted
in a finance forum on Yahoo, a popular World Wide Web site. Last
month, a court in Toronto ruled for the company, ordering 12
Internet service providers to turn over the names of subscribers
who used aliases in expressing their often-vituperative opinions.
At least one Internet service provider complied with the order last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Internet postings about Philip included personal attacks
on its executives, with racial slurs and threats, said Lynda Kuhn,
a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of posters began making remarks and all of a sudden
it was open season,'' Ms. Kuhn said. ``We believe that laws that
apply to any form of communication should also apply to this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The case underscores the fact most Internet communications are
not truly anonymous. Although many Internet service providers have
policies protecting the privacy of their subscribers, they have
frequently turned over records, including subscribers' real names,
to law enforcement authorities. Some critics said the ruling could
have a chilling effect on Internet communication, at least in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the ruling has set off a heated debate about the balance
between anonymity and accountability. In an editorial on the case
Monday, The Toronto Globe and Mail cited Emile Zola's defense of
Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French Army falsely accused
of treason, in urging Internet users to remember that ``a real name
adds conviction, credibility and moral authority to a
denunciation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Libel is still libel, even on the World Wide Web,'' the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Hamilton on the west end of Lake Ontario, Philip has
had a hard few months. A copper trading scandal and the departure
of many of its senior managers have contributed to a recent steep
drop in its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Internet critics insist they were simply relaying
important information that the company would rather not have had
publicized. One participant on Monday pointedly posted a quote from
a former Canadian Prime Minister on the Canadian Bill of Rights:
``I am a Canadian, free to speak without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said one question posed by the case was whether
anonymous accusations carried enough weight to be considered
defamatory. That may become more important as Internet users
realize that the anonymity they have now is by no means ironclad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution protects anonymous speech, but that doesn't
matter if Internet service providers don't provide it,'' said Mike
Godwin, author of ``Cyber Rights,'' published last month by Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers demanded it, Godwin said, technology now available,
that would provide true anonymity so that service providers would
have no information to turn over, even if ordered to do so by a
court, would be more widely used.
</P>
<P>
   John Gallagher, 49, an active poster on the Yahoo board whose
identity was made known to Philip last week by his service
provider, Weslink, said he felt justified in using an alias. A
former Hamilton City Council representative, Gallagher said he had
been publicly involved in various controversies and wanted to
protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to know what this company is doing,''
Gallagher said. But he agreed that the pseudonymous communication
allowed the discussion at times to become ``aggressive.''

MOTOROLA TO BUY SOFTWARE MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Motorola Corp. said Monday that it would
acquire a software company that has developed technology to link
wireless devices like cellular phones with a wide range of
information appliances, including personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Starfish Software Inc., was founded in 1994 by
Philippe Kahn, the Silicon Valley software entrepreneur who founded
Borland International in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn has focused Starfish on technologies that permit users of
computers and consumer appliances to easily synchronize information
like electronic calendars and datebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer,
said the Starfish software would be built into a new version of
Motorola's cellular telephones to be announced in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, which the two companies valued
at ``several hundred million'' dollars, Kahn will remain chief
executive of Starfish and will become a technology adviser to top
Motorola executives.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Motorola said it was reorganizing its
communications-related businesses.

 &HT;    New desktop computer designed to turn heads
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the iMac's iridescent blue gumdrop body be the candy that
at last lures new users to the Mac platform?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Apple Computer is hoping with the August release of
its latest consumer desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   While it has some weaknesses, the iMac looks like Apple
Computer's best chance in years to expand its market share.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the iMac was designed to draw people's attention. Its
body, like the original Mac's, includes a monitor. This one,
though, is 15 inches and displays color.
</P>
<P>
   Enough power
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the iMac's microprocessor, the chip that controls
most functions of the computer, is 233 megahertz. While not the
latest that Apple Computer offers, it's pretty darn powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac also includes a 56k bps modem, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
CD-ROM drive and a 4.6 gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You get all this for $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best deal Apple Computer has ever offered and is
competitive with the lower end of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, budget computer maker Micro Express offers a
computer similar to the iMac for $1,349. There are less expensive
PCs, but they have slower microprocessors and fewer features than
the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the iMac's design is to offer novice users an
all-in-one design that lets them do most things without ever
opening the hood of their computer. The key markets intended for
the iMac are the home and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the iMac has one serious, potentially debilitating
drawback. It's missing an internal floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the floppy drive is on the way out, it
remains today the best and least expensive way to copy and move
files.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing easier than copying a homework assignment or a
document onto a floppy and sticking it in the pocket of your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You can add an external floppy or Zip drive, but that will add
an extra $200 to the cost of buying the iMac, which lessens its
appeal as a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple says the iMac will provide fast and easy use of the
Internet, it may be exaggerating. Its 56k modem is the fastest
modem for consumer use, but 56k modems often operate at lower
speeds than the theoretical limit of 53k bps.
</P>
<P>
   And both 33k and 56k modems are too slow for enjoyable use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most PCs offer 56k modems and buyers may be pleased with
the new iMac.

 &HT;    Big wedding generates news, gossip, photos
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good bet that the new wife of James Brolin, aka Barbra
Streisand, will probably not change her name. For the uninformed,
the celebrated singer and actress, wearing (what else?) a Donna
Karan wedding dress, tied the knot last week with longtime
boyfriend Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   If, by chance, your invitation got lost in the mail or your
helicopter was in the shop that day, you can find plenty of Barbra
wedding news and info on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine has the exclusive story and pictures of the big
day at http://www.pathfinder.com/people/sp/streisand/index.html.
The site is short on photos, but more are scheduled to come soon,
with the approval of the Brolins themselves. But in the meantime,
you can read a blow-by-blow, minute-by-minute account of who was
there, what they wore and what they ate (appetizers included sushi,
pizza, and roasted small potatoes filled with caviar, creme fraiche
and dill). The People site is just filled with juicy gossip, info
and tidbits that both the rabid fans and the merely curious will
adore.
</P>
<P>
   But will the couple live happily ever after? People has set up
message boards for visitors to voice their opinions. Fans of the
couple can also see if the couple's astrological signs are
compatible (Streisand's a Tauras, Brolin's a Capricorn) at
http://astrozine.com/preview002/feature4.html.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's wedding is also a time to reconsider the star's life
and career. Fans of the singer can check out Barbra Streisand.com
(http://www.barbra-streisand.com) The site is primarily devoted to
her latest CD, ``Higher Ground'' but does include some comments
from Barbra herself as well as a place to sign up to get the latest
Streisand dish. It's a little bit out of date, but it's the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are an astonishing number of fan pages devoted to creative
and interesting tributes to Barbra. The Streisand Myths and
Misinformation page
(http://acs2.bu.edu:8001/(tilde)pimentel/myths.html) is devoted to
debunking the many myths surrounding the singer. From here we can
learn that Barbra doesn't have an official fan club or an e-mail
address _ and no, she's never had her nose fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known Barbra fan site, which turns up on nearly
every Web page devoted to her, is the Barbra Streisand FAQ
(frequently asked questions) at
http://members.aol.com/markjayeye/bjsfaq. This is an amazingly
complete listing of Streisand's professional life and works. There
are no pictures, but the information here is exhaustive. Another
America Online member has another page devoted to Streisand's
musical career at http://members.aol.com/barbramusc/index.html with
some great vintage black and white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some people who take Streisand very
seriously, there are others who don't mind having a little fun with
the icon. Mr. Showbiz has a fun site at
http://www.mrshowbiz.com/games/linked/hi/153.html that shows
visitors all the men (and there are quite a few) with whom Barbra
has spent time over the years. Memo to James Brolin: This is one
Barbra site you might just want to skip.

 &HT;    Danged if technology don't giveth and taketh away
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently decided to join hands with those living in the latter
part of the 20th century and get cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of years I've suffered along with rabbit
ears. But I live in an area where broadcast reception isn't that
good. One of the few channels I can get is a public TV station that
seems to have a long-term contract with a gardening expert who
spends most of his air time explaining how to make homemade
mosquito repellent using soap, lemon juice and chewing tobacco. I
don't have a garden and, over time, the gardening expert has become
more annoying than mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   So, about a week ago, I set off on my great cable adventure.
What happened has very little to do with cable TV or the companies
that provide it. I could have just as easily been trying to contact
an insurance company or any other big business that uses an
automated voice mail system. Instead, what I found reminded me of
the price of technology, the price that doesn't appear on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   On my first attempt to call, I got the company's voice mail
menu. You've run into them several times a week yourself, so I
won't spend much time describing it. You are asked a series of
questions, and you're supposed to respond by pressing one of the
keys on your telephone's touchpad. I follow directions OK, and I
finally reached a question that asked me to enter my home telephone
number. I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a valid number, please enter it again,'' the
recorded voice told me. I did, figuring that I had misdialed. ``I'm
sorry, that is not a valid number. Please hold for a
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   I held through two country songs and what seemed to be an
orchestral treatment of the Beatles' ``Norwegian Wood.'' Finally,
the music stopped. By now, I was in one of my obsessive moods. I
didn't much care about cable TV, I just wanted to complain to a
human. But, instead of a real live human, I heard a recorded voice
again: ``Please enter your home telephone number.'' Like a fool, I
did. And, like a predictable machine, the recorded voice said:
``That is not a valid number.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, because I am a certified TechnoBuddy, I came up with the
perfect answer for fooling the machine. I hung up, called again,
and _ when asked to enter my home telephone number _ I entered
someone else's number and figured I could explain my subterfuge
when I finally reached a human. Danged if it didn't work. There was
no ``This is not a valid number'' message. Instead, I worked my way
_ happy in the way that only the gainfully dishonest can be _
through the menu, all the way to the questions about whether I
wanted new service, or to change my existing service.
</P>
<P>
   Just about then, the recording asked me, and I swear it is true,
to ``enter your home number.''
</P>
<P>
   I eventually got cable TV service. But the topic of this sermon
is technology, not cable TV. My experience with the voice menu
system reminded me of an old truth: For everything that technology
gives us, it also takes something away.
</P>
<P>
   I say old truth because it stretches back as far into history as
the invention of the written language. Up until that time, it was
common to create long, epic poems that were memorized and told
aloud. But that skill gradually faded away as writing let us record
the information and save our memories. That's just one example. You
can come up with dozens of examples of your own. For instance,
until recorded music was common, families would sit around the
piano and sing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that writing has eliminated memorizing poems. And
people still sing at home. But both skills have withered because a
new technology forced out an old one. It would be difficult to be
against recorded music or the written language. But it is
important, I think, to understand that it does happen.
</P>
<P>
   We _ as humans and especially as Americans _ spend a lot of time
glorifying technology. And sometimes the glory is well earned. But
we also need to remember the price tag. And, in the case of the
company that uses a high-tech voice messaging menu instead of
humans to deal with customers, the price tag can be really high.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that saved the cable company from losing a
customer was a fellow in overalls who knows a lot about homemade
mosquito repellent.

 &HT;    Tech Report: Laptop can accept new DVD disc
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are selling widgets, you just want to sell a
bunch of them with a healthy profit margin. But if you are pushing
a format, then just selling 10 times more units than last year may
not be enough. You want it to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As the premiere issue of Business 2.0 puts it, in discussing the
emerging rules of the new economy, ``value rises exponentially with
market share'' _ at least for products that help establish a
platform or a standard. ``The more plentiful they become, the more
essential each individual unit is, a striking exception to the
economic rule that value comes from scarcity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or to think of it from the other side: If only one person owns a
fax machine, how much is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of DVD _ the digital versatile disc _ the format
doesn't completely have to replace the compact disc, which was the
first digital medium for pop culture, but it has to be in all the
places that people go for entertainment. For DVD to truly become a
roaring success, it must become the way people watch movies on
television and on computers, at home, in airports and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the challenge is like that faced by Apple Computer.
The Macintosh computer might be, as founder Steve Jobs once put it,
``insanely great,'' but it cannot survive unless a potential
purchaser knows there is plenty of Mac-friendly software and CD
games on the shelves. Apple has the advantage of already having a
large and largely loyal customer base, along with the disadvantage
of competing against the marketing machines of Microsoft, Intel and
IBM. Moreover, Mac competitors can argue that their format is as
good or better.
</P>
<P>
   DVD starts from nothing. Even worse, most consumers already own
CD players. But DVD has an inherent and critical advantage over
CDs: They can hold so much more than a CD. For instance, an entire
movie can fit on a single DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage Macintosh has faced is in pricing _ many
buyers will simply not pay a premium just to own an Apple. DVD too
has been more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the manufacturers are trying to overcome
all these obstacles. More and more movie titles are available on
DVD. And DVD players will mostly be ``backward compatible'' _ that
is, capable of playing the millions of CDs that consumers have
already sunk money into. And the technology is increasingly moving
into the corners _ becoming as mobile as we increasingly expect
technology to be.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dell Computer Corp. has recently released notebook
personal computers with optional DVD drives. With that $299 option,
the Inspiron 3000 and 3200 notebooks can play full-motion video,
Dell says. Those notebooks also come with a device that lets users
play digital versatile discs and watch on their television. The
entry level version costs $2,300, including the DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the Dell Inspiron, visit the company
Web site (http://www.dell.com/products/notebook/inspiron) or call
the company, 1-800-388-8542.
</P>
<P>
   True compressions
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk about cable modems, digital subscriber lines
and the like, if you are stuck at home downloading through your
28.8k bps modem, you may be forgiven for thinking that the
revolution has passed you by. No way, you sigh, that you can have
live video or piercing audio until you invest in one of those
high-priced, cutting-edge technologies for connecting to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but just perhaps you are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   RealPlayer 5.0 from RealNetworks uses data compression to let a
virtual flood of data pour through that skinny little pipeline that
runs to your PC. Reviewers writing in the summer edition of Windows
Magazine say the software gives you a pretty good shot at watching
live events, videos and hearing CD-quality music from sites like
C-SPAN, Sports Illustrated and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a free download of the basic plug-in. For RealPlayer
Plus, it's $30. For more information, visit the Web site
(http://www.real.com).
</P>
<P>
   Better mail
</P>
<P>
   E-mail for most of us is just a tool. You want it to work, and
you probably don't care if it's super-durable, extraordinarily easy
to handle or stunningly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, you might want more from your tools if your work
_ or even your life _ depends on them. E-mail is essential to many
professionals. And even others who use e-mail for personal
messaging may be willing to pay a bit to have efficient and
reliable e-mail software. Perhaps Eudora Pro Email 4.0 from
Qualcomm is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In its summer roundup, Windows Magazine recommends 4.0 as a
feature-rich way to organize and use e-mail. Eudora's lesser
offerings are available free, but 4.0 includes a variety of
displays and a task-bar that makes for swift and productive use.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro Email 4.0 costs $59. For more information, call
Qualcomm at 1-800-238-3672 (1-800-2-EUDORA) or visit the Web site
at http://www.eudora.com.

 &HT;    Money tips can make for a better trip
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you and your family are heading off on a dream
vacation next week. After years of excuses, you've decided to spend
what a good used Toyota would cost to go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   You've made flight and hotel reservations and gotten over your
personal reservations about traveling to any spot on the globe
where snails are eaten. But now you need a little last-minute help.
After all, you'll be dealing with languages other than Southern
American and currencies you've never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the World Wide Web can come in handy. You'll find
several sites that can cushion the culture shock of an overseas
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the problem of money. Figuring out conversion
rates can help you judge whether you're getting a good deal (stay
away from money-changer booths at airports) and also let you start
adjusting mentally for shopping trips. You'll want to have a firm
idea whether that 487-franc dinner in France is a bargain or
whether you'd be better off buying a loaf of bread and some cheese.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best currency converters on the Web is the Universal
Currency Converter at http://www.xe.net/currency/. Unlike using a
chart you've found in a newspaper or even on the Web, this
converter will do the math for you. Simply enter the amount of
money and the currency on one side of the chart, and select the
currency you'd like it converted to on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Let's use that 487-franc dinner as an example. You'd type in 487
in the left-hand box and select French francs, then select U.S.
dollars in the right-hand box. Press the button called Perform
Currency Conversion and _ in just a second or two _ you'll find the
tab for that meal is $79.89 (based on the currency exchange rate on
the day I tried this site).
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about this converter is that it is amazingly
complete. Most world currencies are available. And, you can set the
page, if you'd like, to use languages other than English. If you're
really traveling to some exotic locations, you'll be able to use
the full version of this page (with 180 different currencies) at
http://www.xe.net/currency
</P>
<P>
   /full/. But, if the currencies you need are in the main page,
you'll find it is easier to work with since you won't have so many
possible currencies to plow through.
</P>
<P>
   Since the really good sites on the Web can get overcrowded and
slow, let's look at one more currency converter before moving on.
It's called Homer: Currency Conversion and can be found at
http://www.rmg-c.se/rmg
</P>
<P>
   /currency.htm. This site works much like the first one, so you
don't need additional instructions, just some spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's tackle the language problem. If you're lucky, you
won't need to be fluent in the language of the country you plan to
visit. Especially in Europe, the natives are likely to have a
better command of English than you'd expect. But you'll want to
brush up a bit, just to show you're not the typical ugly American
who firmly believes that if you talk loud enough, they'll
understand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best places on the Web to brush up on languages _
including some you'd expect, such as French, Italian and German,
and some you wouldn't, like Farsi, Finnish and Tagalog _ is at the
excellent Languages for Travellers site at
http://www.travlang.com/languages/. Don't expect to do the few
simple exercises and then be able to get a job as a translator.
But, if you pay attention, you'll be able to order dinner, find a
bathroom and book a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   If your language needs are more extensive, you'll want to check
out a page full of links to literally hundreds of Web pages
offering everything from instant translations, to dictionaries, to
explanations of the fine points of grammar. It is, logically
enough, called Language and Translation Links and is located at
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/3137/index.html.

 &HT;    New desktop computer designed to turn heads
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the iMac's iridescent blue gumdrop body be the candy that
at last lures new users to the Mac platform?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Apple Computer is hoping with the August release of
its latest consumer desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   While it has some weaknesses, the iMac looks like Apple
Computer's best chance in years to expand its market share.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the iMac was designed to draw people's attention. Its
body, like the original Mac's, includes a monitor. This one,
though, is 15 inches and displays color.
</P>
<P>
   Enough power
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the iMac's microprocessor, the chip that controls
most functions of the computer, is 233 megahertz. While not the
latest that Apple Computer offers, it's pretty darn powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac also includes a 56k bps modem, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
CD-ROM drive and a 4.6 gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You get all this for $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best deal Apple Computer has ever offered and is
competitive with the lower end of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, budget computer maker Micro Express offers a
computer similar to the iMac for $1,349. There are less expensive
PCs, but they have slower microprocessors and fewer features than
the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the iMac's design is to offer novice users an
all-in-one design that lets them do most things without ever
opening the hood of their computer. The key markets intended for
the iMac are the home and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the iMac has one serious, potentially debilitating
drawback. It's missing an internal floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the floppy drive is on the way out, it
remains today the best and least expensive way to copy and move
files.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing easier than copying a homework assignment or a
document onto a floppy and sticking it in the pocket of your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You can add an external floppy or Zip drive, but that will add
an extra $200 to the cost of buying the iMac, which lessens its
appeal as a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple says the iMac will provide fast and easy use of the
Internet, it may be exaggerating. Its 56k modem is the fastest
modem for consumer use, but 56k modems often operate at lower
speeds than the theoretical limit of 53k bps.
</P>
<P>
   And both 33k and 56k modems are too slow for enjoyable use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most PCs offer 56k modems and buyers may be pleased with
the new iMac.

 &HT;    Big wedding generates news, gossip, photos
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good bet that the new wife of James Brolin, aka Barbra
Streisand, will probably not change her name. For the uninformed,
the celebrated singer and actress, wearing (what else?) a Donna
Karan wedding dress, tied the knot last week with longtime
boyfriend Brolin.
</P>
<P>
   If, by chance, your invitation got lost in the mail or your
helicopter was in the shop that day, you can find plenty of Barbra
wedding news and info on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine has the exclusive story and pictures of the big
day at http://www.pathfinder.com/people/sp/streisand/index.html.
The site is short on photos, but more are scheduled to come soon,
with the approval of the Brolins themselves. But in the meantime,
you can read a blow-by-blow, minute-by-minute account of who was
there, what they wore and what they ate (appetizers included sushi,
pizza, and roasted small potatoes filled with caviar, creme fraiche
and dill). The People site is just filled with juicy gossip, info
and tidbits that both the rabid fans and the merely curious will
adore.
</P>
<P>
   But will the couple live happily ever after? People has set up
message boards for visitors to voice their opinions. Fans of the
couple can also see if the couple's astrological signs are
compatible (Streisand's a Tauras, Brolin's a Capricorn) at
http://astrozine.com/preview002/feature4.html.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's wedding is also a time to reconsider the star's life
and career. Fans of the singer can check out Barbra Streisand.com
(http://www.barbra-streisand.com) The site is primarily devoted to
her latest CD, ``Higher Ground'' but does include some comments
from Barbra herself as well as a place to sign up to get the latest
Streisand dish. It's a little bit out of date, but it's the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are an astonishing number of fan pages devoted to creative
and interesting tributes to Barbra. The Streisand Myths and
Misinformation page
(http://acs2.bu.edu:8001/(tilde)pimentel/myths.html) is devoted to
debunking the many myths surrounding the singer. From here we can
learn that Barbra doesn't have an official fan club or an e-mail
address _ and no, she's never had her nose fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known Barbra fan site, which turns up on nearly
every Web page devoted to her, is the Barbra Streisand FAQ
(frequently asked questions) at
http://members.aol.com/markjayeye/bjsfaq. This is an amazingly
complete listing of Streisand's professional life and works. There
are no pictures, but the information here is exhaustive. Another
America Online member has another page devoted to Streisand's
musical career at http://members.aol.com/barbramusc/index.html with
some great vintage black and white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some people who take Streisand very
seriously, there are others who don't mind having a little fun with
the icon. Mr. Showbiz has a fun site at
http://www.mrshowbiz.com/games/linked/hi/153.html that shows
visitors all the men (and there are quite a few) with whom Barbra
has spent time over the years. Memo to James Brolin: This is one
Barbra site you might just want to skip.

 &HT;    Tech Report: Laptop can accept new DVD disc
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are selling widgets, you just want to sell a
bunch of them with a healthy profit margin. But if you are pushing
a format, then just selling 10 times more units than last year may
not be enough. You want it to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As the premiere issue of Business 2.0 puts it, in discussing the
emerging rules of the new economy, ``value rises exponentially with
market share'' _ at least for products that help establish a
platform or a standard. ``The more plentiful they become, the more
essential each individual unit is, a striking exception to the
economic rule that value comes from scarcity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or to think of it from the other side: If only one person owns a
fax machine, how much is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of DVD _ the digital versatile disc _ the format
doesn't completely have to replace the compact disc, which was the
first digital medium for pop culture, but it has to be in all the
places that people go for entertainment. For DVD to truly become a
roaring success, it must become the way people watch movies on
television and on computers, at home, in airports and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the challenge is like that faced by Apple Computer.
The Macintosh computer might be, as founder Steve Jobs once put it,
``insanely great,'' but it cannot survive unless a potential
purchaser knows there is plenty of Mac-friendly software and CD
games on the shelves. Apple has the advantage of already having a
large and largely loyal customer base, along with the disadvantage
of competing against the marketing machines of Microsoft, Intel and
IBM. Moreover, Mac competitors can argue that their format is as
good or better.
</P>
<P>
   DVD starts from nothing. Even worse, most consumers already own
CD players. But DVD has an inherent and critical advantage over
CDs: They can hold so much more than a CD. For instance, an entire
movie can fit on a single DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage Macintosh has faced is in pricing _ many
buyers will simply not pay a premium just to own an Apple. DVD too
has been more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the manufacturers are trying to overcome
all these obstacles. More and more movie titles are available on
DVD. And DVD players will mostly be ``backward compatible'' _ that
is, capable of playing the millions of CDs that consumers have
already sunk money into. And the technology is increasingly moving
into the corners _ becoming as mobile as we increasingly expect
technology to be.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dell Computer Corp. has recently released notebook
personal computers with optional DVD drives. With that $299 option,
the Inspiron 3000 and 3200 notebooks can play full-motion video,
Dell says. Those notebooks also come with a device that lets users
play digital versatile discs and watch on their television. The
entry level version costs $2,300, including the DVD.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the Dell Inspiron, visit the company
Web site (http://www.dell.com/products/notebook/inspiron) or call
the company, 1-800-388-8542.
</P>
<P>
   True compressions
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk about cable modems, digital subscriber lines
and the like, if you are stuck at home downloading through your
28.8k bps modem, you may be forgiven for thinking that the
revolution has passed you by. No way, you sigh, that you can have
live video or piercing audio until you invest in one of those
high-priced, cutting-edge technologies for connecting to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but just perhaps you are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   RealPlayer 5.0 from RealNetworks uses data compression to let a
virtual flood of data pour through that skinny little pipeline that
runs to your PC. Reviewers writing in the summer edition of Windows
Magazine say the software gives you a pretty good shot at watching
live events, videos and hearing CD-quality music from sites like
C-SPAN, Sports Illustrated and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a free download of the basic plug-in. For RealPlayer
Plus, it's $30. For more information, visit the Web site
(http://www.real.com).
</P>
<P>
   Better mail
</P>
<P>
   E-mail for most of us is just a tool. You want it to work, and
you probably don't care if it's super-durable, extraordinarily easy
to handle or stunningly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, you might want more from your tools if your work
_ or even your life _ depends on them. E-mail is essential to many
professionals. And even others who use e-mail for personal
messaging may be willing to pay a bit to have efficient and
reliable e-mail software. Perhaps Eudora Pro Email 4.0 from
Qualcomm is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In its summer roundup, Windows Magazine recommends 4.0 as a
feature-rich way to organize and use e-mail. Eudora's lesser
offerings are available free, but 4.0 includes a variety of
displays and a task-bar that makes for swift and productive use.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro Email 4.0 costs $59. For more information, call
Qualcomm at 1-800-238-3672 (1-800-2-EUDORA) or visit the Web site
at http://www.eudora.com.

 &HT;    Danged if technology don't giveth and taketh away
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently decided to join hands with those living in the latter
part of the 20th century and get cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of years I've suffered along with rabbit
ears. But I live in an area where broadcast reception isn't that
good. One of the few channels I can get is a public TV station that
seems to have a long-term contract with a gardening expert who
spends most of his air time explaining how to make homemade
mosquito repellent using soap, lemon juice and chewing tobacco. I
don't have a garden and, over time, the gardening expert has become
more annoying than mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   So, about a week ago, I set off on my great cable adventure.
What happened has very little to do with cable TV or the companies
that provide it. I could have just as easily been trying to contact
an insurance company or any other big business that uses an
automated voice mail system. Instead, what I found reminded me of
the price of technology, the price that doesn't appear on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   On my first attempt to call, I got the company's voice mail
menu. You've run into them several times a week yourself, so I
won't spend much time describing it. You are asked a series of
questions, and you're supposed to respond by pressing one of the
keys on your telephone's touchpad. I follow directions OK, and I
finally reached a question that asked me to enter my home telephone
number. I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a valid number, please enter it again,'' the
recorded voice told me. I did, figuring that I had misdialed. ``I'm
sorry, that is not a valid number. Please hold for a
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   I held through two country songs and what seemed to be an
orchestral treatment of the Beatles' ``Norwegian Wood.'' Finally,
the music stopped. By now, I was in one of my obsessive moods. I
didn't much care about cable TV, I just wanted to complain to a
human. But, instead of a real live human, I heard a recorded voice
again: ``Please enter your home telephone number.'' Like a fool, I
did. And, like a predictable machine, the recorded voice said:
``That is not a valid number.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, because I am a certified TechnoBuddy, I came up with the
perfect answer for fooling the machine. I hung up, called again,
and _ when asked to enter my home telephone number _ I entered
someone else's number and figured I could explain my subterfuge
when I finally reached a human. Danged if it didn't work. There was
no ``This is not a valid number'' message. Instead, I worked my way
_ happy in the way that only the gainfully dishonest can be _
through the menu, all the way to the questions about whether I
wanted new service, or to change my existing service.
</P>
<P>
   Just about then, the recording asked me, and I swear it is true,
to ``enter your home number.''
</P>
<P>
   I eventually got cable TV service. But the topic of this sermon
is technology, not cable TV. My experience with the voice menu
system reminded me of an old truth: For everything that technology
gives us, it also takes something away.
</P>
<P>
   I say old truth because it stretches back as far into history as
the invention of the written language. Up until that time, it was
common to create long, epic poems that were memorized and told
aloud. But that skill gradually faded away as writing let us record
the information and save our memories. That's just one example. You
can come up with dozens of examples of your own. For instance,
until recorded music was common, families would sit around the
piano and sing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that writing has eliminated memorizing poems. And
people still sing at home. But both skills have withered because a
new technology forced out an old one. It would be difficult to be
against recorded music or the written language. But it is
important, I think, to understand that it does happen.
</P>
<P>
   We _ as humans and especially as Americans _ spend a lot of time
glorifying technology. And sometimes the glory is well earned. But
we also need to remember the price tag. And, in the case of the
company that uses a high-tech voice messaging menu instead of
humans to deal with customers, the price tag can be really high.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that saved the cable company from losing a
customer was a fellow in overalls who knows a lot about homemade
mosquito repellent.

 &HT;    Sewage woes seep into East Texas
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKELAND, Texas _ Missy and Bill Hanks built a path of bricks
and boards to their front door so they, their two children and a
foster child would not have to walk on dirt and grass dampened by a
leaking septic system.
</P>
<P>
   At $5,000, the septic system didn't come cheap. It leaks because
the lot is too small, the clay soil does not absorb well and it
rains a lot _ more than 50 inches a year in East Texas, a region of
small towns, big lakes and vast pine forests along the Louisiana
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the hell wants to live with sewage in your back yard?''
said Missy Hanks, 33, a full-time homemaker. ``We need something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Water Development Board concluded three years ago that
sanitation was substandard in scattered parts of Sabine and Newton
counties. Many septic systems leak. Some households discharge raw
sewage through above-ground pipes to back yards or roadside
ditches. Water systems also need upgrading to meet federal and
state standards.
</P>
<P>
   The development board awarded Sabine County a $312,000 grant in
1995 to prepare engineering plans for $35 million in sewer and
water improvements to serve the Hanks family and more than 7,000
other people _ 70 percent of the county's population. Newton County
got $376,000 to plan a $30 million project to benefit 5,400
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are almost complete. But now the development board's
sister agency, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission,
has concluded that conditions in most of the two counties are only
bad enough to warrant grants covering half of the construction
cost. Without grants covering virtually all of the cost, county and
local officials say, the projects are unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the state has spent $688,000 in tax money to plan
water and sewer improvements that might never be constructed. The
Water Development Board is determined to avoid such an outcome but
concedes that some risk is inevitable in the $479 million program
to provide sewer and water services in the poorest areas of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabine and Newton projects are the largest among a
half-dozen in danger of never being built. The other stalled
projects are in Cameron, Hidalgo, Uvalde, Reeves and Bee counties.
</P>
<P>
   The delays, uncertainties and potential waste of money are
frustrating to state officials, local leaders and residents alike.
In all cases, the development board is working with local
officials, other agencies and residents in efforts to revive the
stalled projects, said Janice Cartwright, a spokeswoman for the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of sewage
</P>
<P>
   Sabine and Newton counties offer a case study in how poverty,
vague rules, bureaucratic infighting and lack of political will
have added to the challenge of providing adequate water and
sanitation systems. A daylong tour showed that it's not difficult
to find homes with leaking septic systems, or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Hanks household in Brookeland, a community with
about 170 residences wedged between the Sam Rayburn Reservoir on
the Angelina River and the Sabine National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale odor of leaking sewage emanates from the ground
next to the family's blue-and-white mobile home. Black water stands
in the yard and in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all runs down to Sam Rayburn Reservoir. It's not even a
quarter-mile away,'' said Richard Tillery, a consultant who has
managed small water systems in the area for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby neighborhood called Stumptown, Tom Donahoe, 61, a
retired Navy ordnance specialist, said his septic system routinely
overflows because the soil cannot absorb all of the wastewater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine starts flooding out here in the pasture,'' Donahoe said,
pointing out where wastewater was flowing under a public road and
down a foul-looking gully through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen miles north, in Bronson, white plastic pipes drain raw
sewage from several mobile homes to a ditch that meanders between
houses and pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that pipe right yonder? When it's hot, you catch the
odor,'' said Iverne Conner, 69, who has lived for 24 years in a
house with an exterior of rough boards on a lot bordering the
ditch.
</P>
<P>
   A question of nuisance
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the Water Development Board runs the program to
provide aid for construction of sewer and water systems. But the
Natural Resource Conservation Commission decides whether water
supply and sanitation problems constitute ``a nuisance dangerous to
the public health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   If the commission finds nuisance conditions, state law allows
the development board to award a grant covering up to 100 percent
of the construction cost. Nuisance findings have been issued for
scores of projects along the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But if the conservation commission finds no nuisance, the board
may award a grant for no more than 50 percent of the cost and a
loan for the balance. Residents have to repay the loan through a
surcharge on water and sewer bills.
</P>
<P>
   For homeowners, the difference is significant. In a typical
project whose cost is substantially or completely covered by a
grant, monthly sewer and water bills total at least $15 or $20 per
household, sometimes more. But with no nuisance finding, the
monthly bill can double.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than many people in the Piney Woods of East Texas
can afford, county officials say. The average household income in
Brookeland, for example, is less than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Sabine County, the conservation commission found nuisance
conditions only in two subdivisions near Pineland. Elsewhere in the
county, the commission's inspector reported seeing no failing
septic systems or raw discharges from pipes.
</P>
<P>
   After development board and county officials complained, the
commission conducted another inspection. This time, problems were
found: Of 170 homes and businesses in Brookeland, 10 were releasing
partially treated or raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Pearson, then the executive director of the conservation
commission, concluded in a January letter to the development board
that this did not constitute a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Several other subdivisions in Sabine County did not warrant a
nuisance finding because they are resort communities on Toledo Bend
Reservoir, on the Sabine River, with residents who presumably could
afford more advanced septic systems, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newton County, the commission initially found no nuisance
conditions. After the county and the development board complained,
it conducted a second inspection and found nuisance conditions in
four subdivisions near Deweyville.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions were not identified during the first inspection
because the conservation commission had not been given maps and
other essential information on the project areas, according to
commission officials.
</P>
<P>
   Vague rules
</P>
<P>
   State law does not define what constitutes a nuisance, and the
conservation commission has no written guidelines. So the decision
boils down to a judgment call by the agency's regional offices,
officials said. Top officials in Austin typically follow regional
offices' recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of whether we find a nuisance or not is not tied to
whether we think these areas deserve help,'' said Vic Fair, manager
of the conservation commission's regional office in Beaumont.
``It's tied to whether we think there are enough failing systems to
say the community as a whole has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a prevalent, overwhelming problem'' in most of Sabine
and Newton counties, he said. ``It's something you could get a
handle on by fixing just a few systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the no-nuisance finding could be lack of
strong public and political support. Jack Leath, the Sabine County
judge, contrasted his county, with just 10,200 residents, to the
Rio Grande Valley, where a network of activists and Catholic Church
leaders has been instrumental in securing aid for water and sewer
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a nun in this county,'' Leath said.
``I can't send a nun out to plead for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duties and hopes
</P>
<P>
   The county and its residents bear some responsibility for the
sanitation problems. By law, the county is responsible for septic
system inspections, permits and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But the county has failed to administer the program for years,
leaving that task to the conservation commission, which cannot keep
up. As a result, violations are widespread.
</P>
<P>
   And the area's independent-minded residents haven't demonstrated
wide concern or a willingness to spend their own money on
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Leath conceded that the county has not carried out its
regulatory duties. He said county officials were reluctant to order
homeowners to spend thousands of dollars on advanced septic systems
that are prone to fail on small lots in poor soil and climate
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling someone to put in a $4,000 system, and they
don't have $4,'' Leath said. ``I'm not going to do something that's
going to damage the poor folks and the old folks in this county.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, projects in Pineland and Deweyville are poised to
proceed. The Water Development Board has not given up on the rest
of Sabine and Newton counties.
</P>
<P>
   The board is looking into whether other agencies, including the
Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, might be able to offer grant money.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Norris Jr., an assistant division director for the
development board, offered a postscript on Sabine County that also
sums up the views of many government officials, activists and
residents on the broader efforts to provide safe drinking water and
proper sewage treatment to all of the state's impoverished areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see a quality system for people who need the
service.''

Board concluded three years ago that sanitation was substandard in
scattered parts of Sabine and Newton counties. Many septic systems
leak. Some households discharge raw sewage through above-ground
pipes to back yards or roadside ditches. Water systems also need
upgrading to meet federal and state standards. ``Who in the hell

   MACREPORT _ Will the iMac's iridescent blue gumdrop body be the
candy that at last lures new users to the Mac platform? That's what
Apple Computer is hoping with the August release of its latest

Where is that mouse cursor? What's wrong with this danged thing?
Those are just a few of the questions Windows 98 users are asking

launching the latest upgrade to the world's most popular operating

   TECHREPORT _ ATLANTA _ In the case of DVD _ the digital
versatile disc _ the format doesn't completely have to replace the

become the way people watch movies on television and on computers,
at home, in airports and hotels. (Kanell, Atlanta

<P>
   TECHTOOLS _ ATLANTA _ I'm indebted to Bob Wildau for a set of
questions that are both interesting and within my ability to

worth going from a 33k bps modem to a 56k bps modem when the V.90

an automated voice mail system. Instead, what I found reminded me
of the price of technology, the price that doesn't appear on the
bill. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED. (l, f)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite age restrictions on the women's tour and the need for a
power game on the men's tour, tennis prodigies continue to spring
up like mushrooms, many of them traveling to the United States with
eager parents who still believe that the sport can deliver their
children to the pot of gold at the end of a global rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Like divas sharing the same stage, two of these players
brandished their racquets and pounded away last spring on adjacent
practice courts at the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton,
Fla., without ever acknowledging the other's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They plowed through intense practices like workhorses in
blinders: 15-year-old Yelena Bovina, working out with a coach and a
male sparring partner under the watchful eye of her mother,
Marguerite, and 11-year-old Maria Sharipova, whose effervescent and
opinionated father, Uri, has received strict orders to stay mum
while his daughter learns her trade.
</P>
<P>
   All that was at stake, according to both young emigrants, was a
happy future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come to Bollettieri's: back home I played
on a piece of street, but here you've got good coaching, good
weather, good everything,'' said the freckle-faced Bovina, a
6-foot-2-inch power hitter who likens her style to Monica Seles and
Venus Williams, and who won her professional debut recently in a
satellite event in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina once took 90-minute subway rides to practice in Moscow
but now lives in a brand-new apartment a stone's throw from the
Bollettieri complex. ``You have everything here. When I saw this
place, I wanted to stay,'' said Bovina, who arrived with a single
suitcase, intending only to play the Eddie Herr junior event in
December. She never went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one way for my daughter to become the best, to
realize all of her potential,'' added Marguerite Bovina, who left
her husband and another daughter behind in Moscow to chaperon
Yelena's quest.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina and Sharipova are two of the latest influx of Russian
prodigies plucked up by talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Each is poised for a direct launch into professionalism, a place
where, in Sharipova's carefully enunciated vision, she said: ``If
you're good enough, you're going to make a lot of money. I won't
make a million dollars by staying back in Russia and being the No.
1 junior in the world. Because I came here to Florida, I gave
myself the ability to make it in the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharipova signed with the International Management Group when
she was 9 and already commands a ballerina's poise. She said she
planned to use her tennis earnings to ``buy a house in the
mountains and help all my grandparents, because life is hard for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bovina, who was discovered in Moscow three years ago by scouts
for IMG, which owns the Bollettieri complex in Bradenton, got to
the pro circuit sooner than Sharipova. ``In Russia I was always the
best for my age; now I get to prove I can be the best in the
world,'' said Bovina, who insists she has selected her own destiny
and expresses gratitude to her parents for helping her pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina first gripped a racquet at 4 in Morocco, where her father
had a stint with the consulate; back in Moscow, she played and won
her first tournament at 8. She and her family were hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sneaker companies are in a retrenchment mode and the
popularity meter does not shine as brightly on tennis as it once
did, business is booming at the tennis academies that dot south
Florida. While the mission of the camps is to turn out graduates
with college scholarships, what makes them famous is the superstars
they spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bovina and Sharipova, nearly everybody is in a hurry _ with
a clear conscience. All the parents say they have nothing but the
maximization of the child's talent in mind, an assertion echoed by
the academies, with a caveat: ``The role of the parent in a
player's career is huge, and there's often a fine line between
coach and parent, but we're getting better at dealing with it,''
said Ted Meekma, the head of I.M.G.'s academies division. ``We're
trying to educate them that the best role of the parent is usually
just that, to be a parent, not the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ross of Advantage International, who represents Australia's
17-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, said: ``As managers, it's our job to
exploit and extract the very best opportunities for our clients,
but for the players themselves, and their families, it can't be all
about the money. At least, it shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, parents like Hewitt's, who waited for a nod from John
Newcombe and Tony Roche, the sages of Australian tennis, before
letting their son turn professional at 16, appear more restrained
than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the carrot and the stick, and it's created a
monster,'' said Mike DePalmer Sr., a former coach at the University
of Tennessee and a longtime associate of Bollettieri, the mentor
who developed Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Anna Kournikova. ``The
downside to the equation is the pressures on some kids; the upside
is that kids who graduated from this place received $2.2 million in
college scholarships last year alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But those were ``normal'' teen-agers with no chance of making a
splash in the pros. The prodigies, according to IMG's Gavin Forbes,
are not normal. ``They're like your little Mozarts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents set by 17-year-old Martina Hingis' No. 1 ranking
and megamillions, 16-year-old Anna Kournikova's multimillion-dollar
clothing contracts even before she has won a tournament and the
dual celebrity of the teen-aged Williams sisters despite bypassing
the traditional junior development route have had a galvanizing
impact. If you're extraordinary, you're marketable. Now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Bovina already has a Nike contract and a clear-cut goal. ``I
want to be No. 1,'' she said in succinct English as her mother
beamed. ``Then I want to buy a house and 10 horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollettieri's blueprint for Bovina includes a slew of $10,000
Challenger events and a summer of World Team Tennis. ``She's got a
lot working for her if she can come through on the playing end:
she's tall, blonde, pretty, friendly, a natural for television,''
he said. ``But I don't know what will happen if we don't have quick
results. I need two more years, but I'm not sure they think that
way. I think she overworks, but when we talk about cutting back her
court time, the mother, who happens to be a lovely person, starts
to cry. So there's pressure coming from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of teen professionals is more common, but not
limited to the women's side: Belgium's 17-year-old Xavier Malisse
and Australia's Hewitt made their mark on the men's circuit in a
matter of weeks. Malisse came within 2 points of upsetting a fellow
high school dropout, top-ranked Pete Sampras, last February in his
professional debut in Philadelphia, and Hewitt made history at 16
by defeating Agassi en route to his first career title at Auckland,
New Zealand, in January. Now the 17-year-old generating the most
fuss, along with a feeding frenzy of agents eager to represent him,
is southern California's Taylor Dent, the son of Phil Dent, a
former Australian touring pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early for a guy these days,'' said Jose Lambert, who
coaches Malisse at Bollettieri's, ``and I would never tell a
17-year-old boy he better be ready to hang with the consummate
pros. But Xavier's got the God-gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got me a winner and a character,'' Bollettieri said
proudly about Malisse. ``He's a magician, moves like lightning, and
oh boy, the mark he can make if he stays halfway sane when the
money starts rolling in. He's my breakthrough player for late
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Maria Sharipova Bollettieri's player for 2002,
barring a revision of a rule that keeps her off the women's pro
tour until she's 15. ``I keep telling the dad, what's the rush,
we've got an age rule here,'' Bollettieri said. ``The girl knows
how to win, and all the fundamentals are there, but I can't send
her out when she's 13, even if she's ready. And I can't switch her
to a lefty just because he says it's in the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Uri Sharipova, who worked the mines in Siberia to pay for
his daughter's passage to the United States four years ago, a
passage that separated Maria from her mother in Sochi for two
years, remains impatiently optimistic. As he observed from
courtside during one of Maria's morning practice sessions at the
Bollettieri academy: ``This place is Mecca for the dreams, isn't
it? So maybe the rule will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Macci, whose academy is based in Fort Lauderdale, says the
new tennis parents are well-informed, hypercritical and demanding.
``With the parents,'' he said, ``no matter what you do, it's never
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Macci estimates the total yearly costs of top-caliber full-time
private training can hit $100,000. No wonder the parents, whether
they are paying now or paying back later (an arrangement Macci
often employs), can get overwrought about their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bollettieri and Macci sent home an 8-year-old candidate
from England. Though Macci now coaches 13-year-old Todd Reid, the
Australian prodigy who arrived at Bollettieri's last fall with his
own agent and sponsorship portfolio, he admits that ``they put the
cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can know how a 13-year-old boy will turn out,'' Macci
said. ``I even had some parents bring in a 5-year-old for me to
look at, and what I said was, `This is insane.'''
</P>
<P>
   But signing 11-year-old girls like Katia Afinogenov, a Russian
prospect whose mother was a world-class runner at 800 meters and
whose brother has been drafted by the National Hockey League's
Buffalo Sabres, to a 10-year contract is, according to Macci, a
sane maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer Capriati was 10 when she came here, and Venus and
Serena Williams were 10 and 11,'' Macci said. ``When you know
you've got a can't-miss on your hands, especially with the girls,
this is when to get serious.''

FIRES? WHAT FIRES? FOR FLORIDA TOURISM IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 19)  
 (JT)  
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Visitors to the Sunshine State this summer are being
greeted by a new slogan: ``Florida in Flames.'' Since Memorial Day,
thousands of wildfires have burned about a half million acres of
mostly forest land and threatened some communities. But even with
intermittent road closures and evacuations of residents, and
cancellation of Fourth of July events in some areas, it's been
business as usual at most attractions, parks and beaches, state
tourism officials said _ even under a blanket of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Everglades National Park in southern Florida, Miami-Dade County
beaches and Walt Disney World in Orlando reported no commercial
impact from the blazes as of early July, even when some had
operated under hazy skies from distant fires.
</P>
<P>
   Visit Florida, the agency that promotes tourism in the state,
said most hotels and attractions throughout Florida reported no
drop in attendance or cancellations although it was still too early
to tell how the continuing fires fed by the worst drought
conditions here in 50 years would undermine summer travel.
</P>
<P>
   The worst disruptions were in the northeast, where fires in
early July caused the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents in
Brevard, Volusia and Flagler counties and shut 140 miles of
Interstate 95, from Titusville east of Orlando to Jacksonville near
the Georgia border. The crisis lasted less than a week, but it came
during the peak tourist season for the northern portion of Florida.
Of 47 million visitors to Florida last year, Visit Florida figures
show, 12 million came between the months of April and June and
another 11 million visited between July and September.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke and the fire threat around the Fourth of July weekend shut
down attractions like the Fort Matanzas National Monument south of
St. Augustine and kept visitors away from those that remained open,
like the Canaveral National Seashore and the Kennedy Space Center.
It also interfered with fishing, hunting, camping and hiking at
piers and wilderness recreation areas and ruined the holiday
business for cities like Daytona Beach, which was forced to
postpone until Oct. 17 the Pepsi 400 Nascar Winston Cup race that
was expected to draw about 150,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   With a statewide ban on individual fireworks in effect and
firefighters so busy few were available to staff public displays,
Disney World canceled its Fourth of July fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the fires have caused no deaths and less damage than
hurricanes or tornadoes. A persistent worry for both residents and
visitors, however, has been the haze that could be seen and smelled
from miles away throughout most of the state at times. It has
reduced visibility on roads, caused mild conditions such as
headaches, nausea and throat and eye irritation, and created more
serious problems for sensitive segments of the population such as
the elderly and children and those with heart disease and
respiratory ailments like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials have advised the most susceptible people,
and all residents in areas where smoke is heavy, to stay indoors as
much as possible, preferably in air-conditioned rooms. Those with
specific concerns have also been advised to check with their county
health departments.
</P>
<P>
   While people should heed shortness of breath and similar
warnings as signs to stay indoors, the officials said that exposure
to smoke does not pose a serious health risk to the general public.
``Unless somebody has severe lung compromise, I don't think that
should be an issue,'' said Dr. Eric Handler, the Florida Department
of Health's deputy secretary for children's medical services. ``I
wouldn't be fearful about coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the worst fires have raged across the central and
northern parts of Florida, most of the state has had to contend
with scattered fires sparked by lightning strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Many affected areas are operating normally again, but the fire
hazard has been so fluid, with the weather, winds, air quality and
other variables constantly changing, that state officials have
provided toll-free numbers for information about specific
destinations rather than issuing statewide advisories or
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists can call a 24-hour toll-free line, (888) 735-2872, for
reports and the telephone numbers of the visitor bureau or chamber
of commerce in the area they want to visit. For information about
road closings and detours, call the Florida Department of
Transportation at (800) 342-3557.

   &UR; Beatles Tours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you know of Beatles tours in London and Liverpool? _ Sarah
M. Loman, Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are enough Beatles sites and tours in both cities to
keep you busy for days.
</P>
<P>
   In London _ where Abbey Road Studios served as a recording base
for Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison _
the Original London Walks company offers several Beatles walking
tours. The 2-hour-and-45-minute Beatles Magical Mystery Tour, for
instance, is offered on Sunday and Thursday at 11 a.m. and
Wednesday at 2 p.m. It starts at the Tottenham Court Road subway
station and visits Abbey Road Studios, Savile Row where the Beatles
held a rooftop ``Let It Be'' concert in 1969, and Paul McCartney's
offices on Soho Square. The walk of about two miles costs $7.50.
Information: (44-171) 624 3978.
</P>
<P>
   A minibus tour called Beatles Sites and Rock n' Roll London
departs from outside London's Hard Rock Cafe on Old Park Lane at 2
p.m. on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and costs $25. In addition
to the Beatles' sites mentioned above, it takes in places connected
with other rock stars such as Elton John, Jimi Hendrix and Bob
Marley. Information: (44-181) 566 5312.
</P>
<P>
   For self-guided tours, you can pick up a free Rock and Pop Map
at Rock Circus, a branch of Madame Tussauds in Piccadilly Circus.
</P>
<P>
   In Liverpool, a two-hour Magical Mystery Tour is offered aboard
a copy of the vivid blue and yellow bus featured in the 1967 film
of the same name. Included on the itinerary are the Beatles'
childhood homes, their schools, Penny Lane, Strawberry Field and
the Cavern Club where they performed in the early '60s. The tour
runs daily at 2:20 p.m. from the Merseyside Welcome Center at the
Albert Dock. An additional tour runs in July and August on Saturday
at 11:50 a.m. The cost is $15. Information: (44-151) 709 3285.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles Story, on Albert Dock in the basement of the
Britannia Pavilion, is an exhibition that uses music, film footage
of performances, photographs and a copy of the Cavern Club to
present a comprehensive history of the group. Open daily from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $11. Phone (44-151) 709 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Cavern City Tours organizes an annual International Beatles
Festival; this year it runs from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1. Events include
live music by Beatles lookalike bands, an auction and a garden
party in Straw-berry Field. Hotel packages for the festival start
at $125 for two nights. Information: (44-151) 236 9091, fax
(44-151) 236 8081. The company also publishes three maps: Discover
Lennon's Liverpool; Discover Beatles Liverpool and Discover Beatles
London. These can be ordered from the above number by mail; the
cost, including shipping, is $3.40.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Southern California Pass &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard there is a combination pass for Universal Studios
and other tourist attractions in southern California. Can you give
details? _ Maryanne Myers, East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A.This year, Universal Studios near Los Angeles joined with Sea
World in San Diego to offer a discounted admission package that
provides unlimited entry into the two parks for 14 consecutive
days. The package, known as the Southern California Value Pass,
entitles guests to all of the roller coaster rides and sea mammal
spectacles they want. The cost is $68.95 for adults, $50.95 for
children. Normally the general one-day admission cost for adults is
$38 for adults at Universal Studios, and $34.95 at Sea World, so
the saving is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios is also offering the Celebrity Annual Pass,
which entitles guests to unlimited entry, free daytime parking,
invitations to special events, discounts on some merchandise and
reduced admission into such other California attractions as Knotts
Berry Farm, the Movieland Wax Museum, the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, and
Winchester Mystery House. The pass costs $69, $59 for senior
citizens and children. For information: (818) 622-3801.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Christmas in Capri &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A friend and I are planning to travel to Capri and the Amalfi
Coast between Christmas and New Year's. We would like information
on special events, and to know whether Pompeii, Herculaneum and
Paestum will be open. _ Beverly Elliott, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A. The 19-mile-long Amalfi coast and the island of Capri are
year-round tourist meccas. During the Christmas season, the mild
weather and holiday celebrations attract many Italian and foreign
tourists as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few annual events that have become part of the local
tradition, but specifics won't be released until late fall.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eve in the town of Amalfi is marked by the ``descent
of the comet,'' in which a torch-lighted sculpture of metal and
wood is reeled down a steel wire from the top of Mount Cabar to St.
Andrew's Cathedral just before midnight Mass. The cathedral, which
dates back to medieval times, also plays host to choral concerts
during the week between Christmas and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve celebrations begin on the morning of the 31st,
when a band parades through the streets playing typical Neapolitan
instruments: tambourines, rattles and drums of various kinds.
Midnight is marked by an open-air festival in the central piazza
where fireworks are set off against the backdrop of the Gulf of
Salerno. On New Year's Day, the ``banda del din din,'' strolls
through the town clanging on triangles. For more information call
the local tourist bureau at (39-089) 871107.
</P>
<P>
   Capri also plans a number of Christmas and New Year's
activities, including classical and Italian pop concerts, as well
as song and dance performances by folkloric groups. A large stage
is set up in the town of Capri's main piazza, which is decorated
with Christmas trees and serves as the focal point for the week's
events. Classical music concerts are held in the church of Santa
Stefano, and in the church of Santa Teresa, elaborate Nativity
scenes are set up as part of a creche-making competition. A jb band
playing Latino and disco rings in the New Year on the main piazza.
For information call the Capri Tourist Bureau at (39-081) 8370686.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the archeological sites at Pompeii, Herculaneum and
Paestum will all be open from 9 to 2 during that period, except for
Christmas and New Year's Day. Peastum is also closed the first and
third Mondays of the month.

   &QL;  MAINE'S SHARKS IN GREAT DANGER
</P>
<P>
   By Kyra Leasure
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 13 -- Maine is one of eight states that is
failing to protect shark populations in its waters, according to a
report issued by an environmental coalition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shark populations in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are
decreasing at alarming rates, some as much as 85 percent over the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Within three miles of Maine's shoreline -- beyond which are
federal waters -- the state's fishers brought in 1.07 million
pounds of shark in 1996, mostly spiny dogfish, Ocean Wildlife
Campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   The group, a Washington-based coalition of environmentalists
such as the National Audubon Society, credited Maine with passing
groundfish regulations that reduced the number of dogfish caught,
but warned that the shark was still being vastly overfished.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
instituted a fishery management plan to prevent overfishing of
sharks in federal waters of the Atlantic and Gulf. However, as
sharks move in and out of these protected waters they are
increasingly falling prey to overfishing in state waters where
federal rules don't apply, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also threatened by a growing market for shark fin soup,
which has led to an increase in finning -- a practice where the
fins are cut off of live sharks and then the wounded shark is
dumped back into the water and left to die, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most alarming is the absence of monitoring of estuaries
and bays which are critical for the bearing and nurturing of young
sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juvenile mortality must be reduced to speed the recovery of
large coastal sharks,'' said Mary Camhi, staff scientist at the
National Audubon Society's Living Oceans Program. ``The best way to
do this is to reduce fishing in nursery grounds, which primarily
occurs in state waters.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Jill Goldthwait, I-5th, defended Maine's stance
on shark fishing, saying the vast majority of sharks are far off
the coast and in federal waters, under the jurisdiction of the
NMFS.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature is much more concerned with the fate of lobster,
scallop, eel and groundfish fisheries, multi-million-dollar
industries for Maine's fishers, Goldthwait said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Maine, with the seventh largest commercial shark
fishery of any Atlantic or Gulf Coast state, isn't aware of the
damage its fishers are causing to the shark population. The dogfish
fishery does fall within state boundaries and accounted for 80
percent of all sharks hauled in by Maine fishers from 1990 through
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, NMFS declared spiny dogfish overfished but there is
still no management of this fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ``States must now act to implement the policies that are vital
to the recovery of sharks,'' said David Wilmot, director of the
Ocean Wildlife Campaign. ``Strong Federal regulations are extremely
important, but they will not be effective unless the states also do
their part.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Audubon Society recommends that Maine adopt federal
regulations in state waters, require all state commercial shark
fishers to hold federal permits, ban finning of all sharks and
improve species-specific identification and reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under current management measures, it is highly probable that
the populations will continue to decline below their already
critically low levels of abundance. Some results suggest that even
if all fishing of large coastal sharks were to cease, recovery
could take decades,'' said Ellen Pikitch, director of the Wildlife
Conservation Society.

JOLLY GOOD SHOW: KISS GOOD-BYE TO THE NEW YORKER'S `OLDE
ENGLISHE' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that Brit social climber Tina Brown is no
longer editor of the New Yorker, can the magazine please return to
American spellings and usages?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't mind the celebrity photographs, the in-depth O.J.
coverage or the obscenities (in the cartoons too, egad) nearly as
much as having to labor through ``labour'' and ``honour'' and
references to dead mobsters being put in the ``boots'' of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglicization of the New Yorker stopped short of rewriting
Roger Angell's baseball pieces and turning batters into
``batsmen.'' It wouldn't be cricket, and thank God didn't become
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The one victory for the American language during the reign of
Queen Tina at the New Yorker came when she started running Monica
Lewinsky articles every week. The magazine had been spelling
``intern'' as ``interne,'' in the English fashion. But Monica
proved more powerful than Tina, and soon the magazine dropped the
E, and adopted the world-famous six-letter word ``intern.''
</P>
<P>
   As in English, not Olde Englishe. As in New York, not York.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Something has gone very wrong with the Republican Party. I miss
the good, reasonable old days of Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months before congressional elections, something is
happening to distract Republicans from the concerns of average
Americans who think Congress should apply itself to education,
Social Security, health care, crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The following is the current platform of the Republican Party,
as near as I can figure from recent mouth-flapping in Washington:
The Republican Party is running against gays and lesbians. They're
also running against flag-burners, a group that doesn't exist
outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The pinks, lavenders and red-white-and-blue-blackeners have
replaced the reds as America's boogeypersons.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party not only is against abortion, but now many
Republicans have come out against the birth control pill.
</P>
<P>
   This won't go over well with voters, who already need three jobs
to take care of the kids they have. Besides, if Republicans get rid
of the Pill, more women will get abortions and more gays will be
born.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, and I know what it's like to live without
a Republican Party. I want the Republican Party to survive as a
party that believes in individual liberty and responsibility, not
as the mullah of all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Next it'll be mandatory chains to keep women in the kitchen, and
I suppose if women, gays or population growth gets out of line,
that's where the NRA comes in. It's hard to find any other logic in
the GOP X-Files.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lately there has been plenty of idiocy among Democrats and
liberals, too. Let's review:
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, President Clinton inhaled deeply, and
launched a billion-dollar ad campaign to teach kids that drugs are
bad. The ads must be a gas to watch stoned, the way we watched
``Reefer Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a stupid ad campaign. This is your brain on a stupid ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know it? I came out for Mayor Willie Brown's
visionary plan to provide universal health care for all of San
Francisco's workers and poor people, and some of Brown's biggest
pals came out against it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a union, too, the supposedly progressive Service
Employees International Union. Yes, a union doesn't want to pool
its health money with federal and state dollars to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to solidarity? It'll be wall-to-wall solidarity in
the emergency room, as the uninsured keep crowding in to use the
only medical services they can get, the ones that cost taxpayers
the most.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco last week, gay leaders complained that the
police were discriminatory by busting only men for having sex in
bus station restrooms. Never mind that women don't do such things.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Why do gays have sex in public restrooms in San
Francisco? This is a city where anything goes except going to the
bathroom, because there aren't enough. Heck, if it's illicit sex
you want, you can move to South Carolina, and suffer real
oppression, instead of making it up.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkeley last week, huggy liberals spoke out against cops
busting the street kids who sit on Telegraph Avenue sidewalks all
day, making messes and bothering people. At the same time in
Berkeley, there is a controversy over whether public nudity should
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise: All sidewalk sitters must be naked, and all
naked people must sit on the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   That'll fix all their bony butts.
</P>

ASIAN FLU MAY EVENTUALLY SPREAD WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1976, a Communist member of the Japanese Diet
accused the San Francisco-based Asia Foundation of being a CIA
front. Executives at the foundation denied the charge, but anyone
who did the research would have found that the nonprofit
organization acknowledged using CIA funds in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Since then things have changed in every respect. In particular,
I doubt anyone in Japan or its suffering Asian sisters complain
today when the foundation gives money away for good works _ about
1,000 small grants each year to Asian nations and organizations,
without ostensible Cold War-style intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that ended 31 years ago, period,'' said William Fuller,
president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say there aren't definite political designs,
direct and indirect. For example, Fuller said, the foundation
funded the first empirical look at corruption in Thailand, a
project at Chula Longkorn University in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now one of the professors has become an absolute advocate for
reform,'' Fuller said. ``He sees what has happened, as a result of
the financial crisis, as a wonderful opportunity to move on the
anti-corruption front. This will involve changes in the law, the
development of watchdog groups and the development of media
reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar foundation-funded program run by an aptly named group,
Transparency International Bangladesh, is studying corruption in
the judiciary, public works agencies and other governmental bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, the foundation is backing a group called Court Watch,
which monitors judges.
</P>
<P>
   Other foundation-funded efforts include programs intended to
empower women by helping them acquire income-generating skills and
teaching them how to finance and run political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   That project is important, Fuller said, because despite the
existence of a few women with political power _ such as former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan and Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga _ 99 percent of Asia's political
machinery is controlled by men.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Fuller said, the Asian men and women behind
reform efforts would have been thrown into jail. Today, the
necessity for change has made local initiatives politically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if the foundation was stymied by fundamentalists.
Indonesia, a nation of 200 million, is chiefly Islamic. Fuller said
it was impossible to generalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is very diverse. There are moderate groups
attempting to build strong bridges between faiths,'' Fuller said.
``For example, Muslims working with Christians and other
non-Muslims on food shortages.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller believes the central issue facing Asia today _ the
economic crisis _ could take more than five years to play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things don't happen quickly,'' he said. ``You can say
you'll eliminate cronyism, but patterns of behavior take a long
time to change. Secondly, there's the problem of restoring consumer
confidence. There's not going to be heavy-duty money coming in to
match the outflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese had something like $20 billion in business
activity in Indonesia, assets built up over 20 years. It just
evaporated.''
</P>
<P>
   California has fashioned itself as a big trading partner of
Pacific Rim nations. I asked Fuller if he thought the state would
feel any pain as a consequence of the Asian economic flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sneeze in Indonesia, it's not entirely clear.
But a sneeze in Japan or China? I'd be very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to assume everything we buy that's made in Asia
will cost less, he said. This could continue for some time, giving
us a false sense of security. Later on, however, we'll see Asian
markets for California products dry up. Our high tech goods,
timber, fruits, vegetables, movies and CDs may go begging.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Fuller said, this state is certain to catch the
same deadly strain of flu that began infecting Asia a year ago.

WOMEN SHOULD GET THE LEAD OUT OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I thought I was doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many women concerned about the potential for osteoporosis,
I try to make sure I get enough calcium. I drink fat-free milk, buy
orange juice fortified with calcium and take daily calcium
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I learned that my supplement, a brand made from oyster
shells, may also contain lead, a well-known health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment, in the food
we eat, the air we breathe and sometimes in the water we drink. At
high levels, it can cause high blood pressure, headaches, digestive
problems and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Small children and fetuses are especially vulnerable because
lead can damage the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws passed in the 1970s prohibited the use of lead in
gasoline and paint, and have helped lessen our daily exposure to
this toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lead remains in some calcium supplements, taken by more than
50 percent of American women during pregnancy and by a third of
American households, according to a 1997 report by the Natural
Resources Defense Council in California.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike food or medicine, there are no federal laws
requiring calcium supplements to be lead-free.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Resources Defense Council is still waiting to hear
back from the Food and Drug Administration on a petition to
establish a national standard limiting the amount of lead in
supplements and antacids to no more than 0.5 micrograms per daily
dosage, a negligible amount.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts aren't advising people to stop taking supplements
but to choose those that have the lowest levels of lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For consumers who want to be cautious, there are a variety of
options out there,'' said Dr. Gina Solomon, the council's senior
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In lab tests, the council cited several supplements that are
virtually lead-free.
</P>
<P>
   They include: TUMS 500 Calcium Supplement, Chewable; Posture D
High Potency Calcium Supplement with Vitamin D; Children's Mylanta
Chewable Antacid Fruit Punch and Bubble Gum flavors; and Children's
Mylanta Liquid Antacid in the same flavors.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about calcium, you can visit the Natural
Resrouces Defense Council's Web site at
http://www.nrdc.org/worldview/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find lead information on the label, but there are a
few guidelines to follow in selecting a brand. I've learned that
``natural sources'' of calcium aren't always better, though often
the cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is best to avoid calcium from bone meal, dolomite or
unrefined oyster shells, as these may contain lead or other toxic
metals,'' according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fallon, a pharmacist in Clifton Park, N.Y., agrees. He
doesn't sell oyster shell because he knows most consumers aren't
``really aware of the differences in calcium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's the risk? It's not as high as lead paint, for example.
But since we're already exposed to lead in our environment, the
council argues that we should avoid any unnecessary exposure in our
supplements, no matter how minute, since the technology is
available to remove that lead.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is being made. As a result of a lawsuit filed by the
council, Leiner Health Products Group, the nation's largest
manufacturer of calcium supplements, such as ``Your Life'' brand,
agreed to remove almost all lead from its calcium, and other
manufacturers are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still trying to do the right thing. But I don't want to
invite one health risk while trying to offset another. If lead-free
is good enough for my car, it's good enough for me.

<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ ``When I put my labyrinth in a few years ago my
family thought I was absolutely mad,'' says Elizabeth Cherniack.
</P>
<P>
   But she managed to win them over. ``Last Christmas we all walked
it together and had a group hug in the center,'' says the mother of
three and grandmother of one. ``Labyrinths are trendy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once almost forgotten in the Western world, the labyrinth has
been rediscovered in recent years and is now hailed as a powerful
spiritual and personal transformation tool by traditional
churchgoers and ardent new agers alike. Older than history,
labyrinths _ winding designs with a single and usually circling
path _ are found in cultures as diverse as Native American, ancient
Crete, and Medieval Europe. Also, in some form, in most major
religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While it may look rather odd to the uninitiated, enthusiasts say
going around in circles can straighten you out _ or at least make
you think a bit more clearly. The theory is that the act of
simultaneously meditating or praying while walking a circuitous
path in concentric circles engages both hemispheres of the brain to
produce a sense of calmness and a feeling of well-being that, among
other things, makes decisions easier.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how many labyrinths there are in
Massachusetts or anywhere else in the country. However,
knowledgeable local labyrinthians estimate that there are probably
about 30 accessible to the public in the eastern part of the state
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labyrinths are more than just a fad, this is a time when
people need energy and to center themselves and they give a sense
of direction,'' says Marty Cain of Newport, N.H., an artist who in
the past half-dozen years has designed more than 60 labyrinths in
this country and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Cherniack say she uses her labyrinth daily year-round,
regardless of weather. ``Walking a labyrinth is centering and gives
me a sense of proportion,'' she says; ``it's a sort of
mini-pilgrimage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mazes, which are deliberately confusing and very easy to
get lost in, a labyrinth has no dead ends or tricky turns. There is
only one path, and it always leads to the center and back out again
but by a twisting route. Maze paths are lined with high walls or
hedges that obstruct the view, but a labyrinth is open and you can
always see where you're going, although it's not easy to tell
exactly how you'll get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A labyrinth is a lot like life, you think you're getting to
the center of things and then you start to move away,'' says Susan
Burgess, a member of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Marblehead.
When Burgess and other members of the congregation laid out a
labyrinth in the memorial garden on the church lawn in 1993, they
thought they were creating a quiet place for solitary meditation.
That's not exactly what they got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to chase my 5-year-old grandson down it and then we sit
in the center and talk,'' says Sarah Lincoln Harrison, one of the
church volunteers who traced the labyrinth's path with stones
gathered from the nearby seashore. Many others at St. Andrew's have
also found their own satisfying, individual ways of going around in
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Some churchgoers make a point of walking the labyrinth before or
after services, for instance, while kids just let out of Sunday
school invariably run it as fast as they can. Participants in
12-step programs and yoga classes that meet at St. Andrew's usually
walk slowly and meditatively.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the church's blessing, all are welcome to go through
the labyrinth at whatever pace they want whenever the spirit moves
them. ``We haven't had any miracles,'' says church member Robert
Smythe, ``but a lot of people say they went into the labyrinth with
a problem and came out with a solution.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two traditions  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although they can be any size, labyrinths are typically about 30
or 40 feet across and fit easily into parks and gardens, the naves
of churches, and the floors of public buildings. They can be
temporary or permanent, and are delineated in all sorts of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Cain, who specializes in public art, has traced temporary
labyrinths with beds of flowers, turkey feathers, and white paint
on grassy lawns but also uses permanent materials such as
fieldstones, brick, and chunks of quartz. A dowser, Cain says she
uses whatever appropriate materials are at hand and places her
labyrinths where _ by new age standards _ they belong. ``I just ask
the earth what she wants,''she says, seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For outdoor labyrinths, such as the one that she designed at St.
Andrew's, Cain favors the classic seven-circle form found in
ancient ruins at Cretan and Celtic sites, which is also the one
preferred by most new agers. Rivaling that design in popularity,
however, and more often used indoors, is an 11-circle labyrinth
based on the one in the nave of 13th-century Chartres cathedral in
France. Inlaid in the stone floor, the 42-square-foot Chartres
labyrinth _ which represents the meandering path of a pilgrim going
to Jerusalem _ has the same dimensions and proportions as the
cathedral's famous rose window.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can't get lost in a labyrinth, they can be hard to
find, even ones that welcome the public. For instance, there is an
11-circle Chartres-style labyrinth in St. Paul's Episcopal
Cathedral on Tremont Street in downtown Boston _ painted on the
floor of a lower-level meeting hall that is often covered with
chairs. The labyrinth is reserved exclusively for meditative
walking Mondays from 4 to 6 p.m. and Fridays noon to 2 p.m. but can
also be visited at other times _ provided the hall isn't in use.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McNeill of Leominster has marked out a 20-foot-wide Cretan
labyrinth in purple spray paint on the driveway of her home on West
Street and lets anyone who passes by use it if they want. ``I get
about 10 people a day,'' she says. ``Labyrinths can heal us and
they can heal the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many people consider their labyrinths to be essentially
private places, an extension of home and the family circle. A
dowser and avid gardener, Cherniack picked an inconspicuous site at
the bottom of her garden, away from the street and out of sight of
nearby houses. ``It's also where two energy lines cross,'' she
says.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A spiritual path
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual the labyrinth may be, but current interest in it has
also created a sort of mini-labyrinth industry. Cain, for instance,
charges $500 plus expenses to design a labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   The founding mother of the labyrinth movement in America is the
Reverend Lauren Artress of Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San
Francisco, author of ``Walking a Sacred Path _ Rediscovering the
Labyrinth as a Sacred Tool.'' The nonprofit Veriditas Ministry that
Artress founded gives workshops on designing and using labyrinths
and trains facilitators to lead labyrinth meditation walks.
Veriditas also sells do-it-yourself design kits for $125 and
Chartres-size portable three-piece canvas labyrinths, priced at
$3,575.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Artress is organizing a ``global labyrinth
network,'' composed of people around the world who instead of
hoisting glasses of champagne at midnight on New Year's Eve 2000
will walk labyrinths as a gesture of unity with all life on the
planet. The Veriditas Web site (www.gracecathedral.org) lists more
than 100 labyrinths now in the network.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Keeler of Harwich, a Veriditas facilitator who is also a
registered and holistic nurse, has led labyrinth meditations for
hospice patients, senior citizens, community organizations,
schoolchildren, and even corporate executives. ``A labyrinth is
nonhierarchal and provides space for teamwork and community, and
the effect can be similar to that of ropes courses and other
confidence-building programs that executives often go through,''
she says, ``and it's about as metaphorical as you can get for the
way we go along life's path with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seminar project, a group of students at the Cape Cod
Lighthouse Charter School in Orleans recently built an outdoor
labyrinth under Keeler's direction, its path lined with stones and
quahog shells picked up on the beaches of Pleasant Bay. ``It's in a
valley surrounded by woods,'' Keeler says, ``and the entrance faces
the spot where the sun will rise at the summer solstice.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler says she frequently took the labyrinth-project kids to
the shore, drew a seven-circle design on the sand, and let them
play. It was fun, she says, but the children also seemed to
instinctively understand the labyrinth's ancient message. She
recalls the time when one 12-year-old, after running the labyrinth,
turned to her and remarked thoughtfully: ``We've been taught that a
straight line is the shortest distance between two points, but
maybe it isn't always the wisest choice.''

LOW GRADES IN EDUCATION FOR BAY STATE POLITICIANS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The embarrassment of Massachusetts does not lie in
the fact that one crop of prospective schoolteachers did terribly
on some tests recently.
</P>
<P>
   The real embarrassment is that a state once known for its
maturity and vision is worth studying today for the way its
politicians play games with serious topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the test scores were made public, Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci has actually proposed legislation of which
two of the main components are already law.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the same acting governor who just three years ago
was joined with his predecessor, Bill Weld, in a high-profile
effort to get Massachusetts out of the teacher certification
business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, meanwhile, the leadership from the House has
been virtually mute. And from the Senate has come a proposal so
tangential and fiscally questionable (signing bonuses of $20,000
for 250 new teachers a year) as to border on the humorous.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, any college kid watching this eruption of
cheap politics would be forgiven if he shipped his teaching
applications to states where teacher-bashing and education politics
are less a public sport. If the nonleadership at the highest levels
is too much even for the state's education commissioner _ and it
was _ how is someone with the commendable desire to teach school
supposed to feel?
</P>
<P>
   On first thought, perhaps House Speaker Tom Finneran should get
some credit for having the least to say or propose about this. The
harm done by doing nothing is less than that done by some of the
more headline-catching players.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, state Senate President Tom Birmingham at
least stayed on the fringes of activity by suggesting that with
$100 million in a trust fund, the interest could pay $20,000 to 250
top college students willing to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a state of the Commonwealth's size, educators may have
difficulty imagining what the impact would be on hundreds of
thousands of kids from 250 supposedly ``elite'' new teachers each
year. And the rest of us may not understand how some undisclosed
selection criteria can justify treating those 250 better than
others in the top fourth of college seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But given the furious competition for the highest-achieving
graduates from the private sector, and given the likelihood that
some form of signing bonus can play a role in avoiding a massive
teacher shortage over the next decade or so, the idea at least has
merit.
</P>
<P>
   The position of Cellucci is much harder to justify.
</P>
<P>
   His current role of top teacher policeman was not his role in
1995, when the state's mission seemed to be to become chief
cheerleader for Newt Gingrich's attempted revolution. Perhaps
people have forgotten, but Weld-Cellucci were pushing open
enrollment in 1995, along with de facto privatization via vouchers
for elementary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, if I may quote, ``In the new state
government, the Office of Education and Training would get out of
the business of teacher certification and recertification
altogether.'' Perhaps someday the acting governor might explain the
intellectual journey that got him from then to now.
</P>
<P>
   As for now, consider the plank in his latest proposal on college
loan forgiveness for new teachers. It claims that it ``expands''
the existing program to include young people who have graduated
with ``honors.'' Let's see now. The existing program includes all
those who graduate in the top fourth of their class. Has no one
stopped to wonder how many kids are in the top quarter of their
class and don't get honors?
</P>
<P>
   Or take Cellucci's tough-sounding proposal to require the
Education Department to produce by the end of this year a model
plan for local districts to develop new ways of certifying
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds nice, but the fact is, the law requiring this has been in
existence for the better part of five years. It is apparently the
acting governor's position that he needs a new law to tell his own
department what deadline it needs to meet. Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that serious education reform is being
implemented right now in Boston and several communities across the
state. It raises standards much higher for pupils and teachers
alike. A group may do badly on a given test, but that ought to
merely redouble the resolve of the people involved to make this
work. It definitely ought not lead to mindless teacher-bashing,
blame games, and minor-league politics.
</P>
<P>
   All this reform, don't forget, all this standards-raising, and
all this concern about shortage is occurring in the absence of any
real change in the horrid working conditions teachers endure and of
any serious attempt to make their pay and benefits commensurate
with less demanding tasks in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the state's leaders had a golden chance to
expand the base of support for reform, underline its urgency, and
increase their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And they blew it sky-high.

LYNE'S `LOLITA' IS DEFENDED BY ITS STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It took ``Lolita,'' Vladimir Nabokov's 1954
novel, four years to find a US publisher. Almost half a century
later, director Adrian Lyne's adaptation of the now-classic book
has encountered a similarly rough road to the American public. Not
a single US theatrical distributor was willing to release the film,
which was completed two years ago and has already opened in
European theaters, and it looked as though the new ``Lolita'' would
never be available in the country in which it is set.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in May, cable TV's Showtime once again proved that it
could be nicknamed the Rescue Channel. Described by its president
of programming, Jerry Offsay, as a home for ``quality projects that
would not otherwise be seen,'' Showtime purchased the rights to
Lyne's movie and announced an Aug. 2 premiere. And then last week,
emboldened by Showtime's willingness to be controversial, Samuel
Goldwyn Films reached an agreement with Showtime to release the
movie to theaters sometime after Aug. 2. In recent years, Showtime
has provided similar emergency resuscitation on projects like
``Bastard Out of Carolina,'' which was deemed too disturbing for
TNT, and ``More Tales of the City,'' the sequel to ``Tales of the
City'' that was rejected by PBS.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is thanks to Showtime that we will now be deluged with
``Lolita,'' the second adaptation of the novel after director
Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version starring James Mason and Sue Lyons.
Lyne's ``Lolita,'' which cost $58 million, features a wonderfully
full-bodied performance by Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert, the
middle-aged man in an obsessive relationship with a 12-year-old
girl (played by newcomer Dominique Swain). Over the weekend,
Showtime brought Lyne, Irons (via satellite), Swain, and
screenwriter Stephen Schiff here to introduce and defend the movie
to TV critics gathered for the semiannual press tour.
</P>
<P>
   Irons, who said he was getting tired of talking about a movie he
made two years ago (``I'd like to move on,'' he joked), pointed out
that the perception of ``Lolita'' does not match the reality.
``When it was published in America, everybody went out to buy it,
and started thumbing through it, looking for the dirty bits,'' he
said. ``And of course there are not dirty bits in this novel. It's
extraordinary that it has the reputation it has, but it is not
salacious.'' He said the movie is a victim of ``very bad timing,''
as recent years have seen a growing awareness of pedophilia: ``We
were, in a way, used to our detriment by this _ what do you call it
_ lobby, airing a very important subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The sexuality portrayed in ``Lolita,'' while more explicit than
in Kubrick's adaptation, is relatively muted when compared with
most R-rated movies _ including other Lyne-directed hits like ``9
1/2 Weeks.'' Swain was 15 at the time ``Lolita'' was made, which
meant Lyne ended up spending six weeks in the editing room with a
lawyer: ``I did lose some shots that involved the body double,
because there was a law that came into being in 1996 ... that said,
essentially, you couldn't use an adult to imitate a minor.'' Lyne
said he tried to handle the filming of the sexual encounters with a
special sensitivity toward Swain: ``We always had her mother and
the teacher on the set, and we had something that became quite
famous called `the pad,' which was a cushion thing that we put
between Dominique and Jeremy during those particular scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, a New Yorker writer who was film critic at the Boston
Phoenix from 1978-83, said the movie's problems in America come
from our ``culture of fear.'' We are a ``very jumpy,
keep-it-in-the-dark-maybe-it-will-go-away kind of culture,'' he
said, adding that ``this movie would have had much less trouble,
maybe no trouble, had it come out in the late '70s or the early
'80s.'' He said people sometime forget that one of the virtues of
art is that it can re-create a difficult situation: ``This is not a
message movie, but it is a movie in which you are poured into
Humbert's skin, and if you don't feel uncomfortable there, then I
don't think we've done a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime also introduced three other projects that might have
had trouble finding homes elsewhere in the TV universe. ``Rude
Awakening'' is an upbeat and offbeat comedy series that finds its
humor in the struggles of a newly sober woman in a 12-step program.
The show stars Sherilyn Fenn as the soap opera star who bottoms out
and Lynn Redgrave as her decadent mum. Comedian-actress Claudia
Lonow, the creator of the show, told critics she was tired of
humorless portrayals of sobriety. ``I've known a lot of people who
have gotten better, and the way they have gotten better is by not
taking themselves so seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Linc's'' is a 13-episode series that's being called ``Cheers''
from an African-American perspective. Set in a Washington, D.C.,
watering hole, the comedy revolves around the political, sexual,
and racial opinions of the ensemble, which includes Pam Grier,
Georg Stanford Brown, Tisha Campbell, and Steven Williams. It was
created by Tim Reid, who created ``Frank's Place.'' ``I think it's
too political for network TV,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime also previewed ``The Baby Dance,'' about a poor couple
who sell their forthcoming child _ their fifth _ to a couple
looking to adopt. The film, executive produced by Jodie Foster and
starring Laura Dern, brings a gritty reality and ambiguity to its
made-for-TV premise. ``There were a lot of people afraid of this
when we were going out with it in the beginning,'' said the movie's
producer, Meg LaFauve. ``But it was amazing to find Showtime
because they weren't afraid of it at all.''

`TAKE' TAKES THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people have spoken on the question of bring vs. take, and
the people _ 73 percent of them, at any rate _ say they prefer to
take their Coppertone to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The question, posed in a column last month, was which verb to
choose in the sentence, ``For a pain-free vacation at the beach, be
sure to bring/take plenty of sunblock'' _ advice we assumed, for
the purpose of the poll, to be coming from a newspaper, not from a
friend at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Responses came from 259 voters who claimed linguistic roots in
29 states (plus the District of Columbia) and seven other
countries, from Argentina to Australia. And the fiercest among them
were those with flags planted deep in take territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can there be any doubt?'' asked Cindy Day of Upton, Mass.
(educated in Auburn), and more than a dozen others like her
underlined their certainty with ``obviously'' ``unquestionably,''
and ``no doubt about it.'' Dana Guinn of Arlington, Mass. (via
Albuquerque and Cherry Hill, N.J.) worried that we'll be singing
``Bring Me Out to the Ballgame'' in our lifetimes _ or telling one
another, as the end draws near, ``You Can't Bring It With You.''
</P>
<P>
   Several writers had been schooled in the distinction with the
aid of a saying like the one offered by E. Cox of Peterborough,
N.H. (formerly of Long Island): ``Bring it with you when you come,
take it with you when you go.''
</P>
<P>
   But many, whether or not they chose take in the sample sentence,
were tolerant of deviance from the rule _ and ingenious in
explaining it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rich Ferrara of Amesbury, Mass., who comes from
Rhode Island, finds it natural (if ``incorrect'') to take a person
or animal, bring an inanimate object; ``I took my son to visit his
grandmother, and we brought her flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mary Stevenson, a Brooklynite transplanted to Brookline,
Mass., thinks the motion of the object toward or away from the
named location is the key: She would bring sunblock to the beach,
but take it from her home. ``The Visa ads seem to follow the same
rule,'' she notes: ```If you go to Ruby's, be sure to bring your
Visa card, because Ruby doesn't take American Express.'''
</P>
<P>
   But to readers brought up in the take camp, both examples sound
wrong, even headspinning, because they violate the bring-come,
take-go pairing enshrined in Cox's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Boyd of Haverhill, Mass., who grew up in Rhode Island,
votes for take in the sample sentence. But he argues that ``bring
Mary to the dance'' is the idiomatic expression, regardless of
direction. Not so in my corner of the Midwest, though: ``Who are
you taking to the dance?'' is the standard (and yes, I know it
should be whom, but it never is, is it?). A parent helping to
decorate the high school gym might ask a student, ``Who are you
bringing to the prom tonight?'' _ but from any other location the
verb would be take. Yes, you ``dance with the one that brung you,''
as the saying goes; once you get there, you have indeed brought (or
brung) him or her.
</P>
<P>
   We have far too little space to untangle this subject here, so
let's leapfrog to the conclusions of our unscientific survey _
noting firmly that this collection of opinions is the opposite of a
random sample. All it tells us is that among people who care quite
a lot about language _ enough to register an opinion via e-mail,
card, or letter _ the rulebook distinction between bring and take
is widely recognized.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising _ people interested in language, whatever
their background, are more likely to have learned along the way
what's considered ``proper'' usage. But actual conversation at your
neighborhood Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts isn't likely to mirror
these results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the geographical groupings show some suggestive
differences. Among the 63 Massachusetts-educated respondents, take
took just 57 percent of the vote. For New England as a whole, the
take majority rose to 67 percent. The overall total, as noted
above, was 73 percent for take. And if Massachusetts was excluded
from the reckoning, the vote for take hit 78 percent. I'm no
statistician, but this does seem to hint that if bring for take is
a regionalism, Massachusetts is its home region.
</P>
<P>
   But why? A few correspondents touched on the question of foreign
language influences, but none offered any solid clues. Other
languages draw the bring/take distinction differently, or not at
all; maybe German or Yiddish or Italian has left its footprints on
the Freedom Trail.
</P>
<P>
   We still have some exploring to do on this one; teachers and
speakers of foreign languages, your help would be welcome.
Meanwhile, my thanks to everyone who wrote and voted, bringers and
takers alike.

BOSTON SURGEON LENDS A HELPING HAND TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Children's Hospital chief surgeon Richard Jonas is
changing the way China provides health care.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a team for the US charity Project Hope, and working
hand-in-hand with Chinese government officials, Jonas helped build
the first world-class pediatric hospital in China at a cost of $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting specialists from the United States, Canada, and Europe
will teach Chinese doctors the latest in high-tech medicine at
Shanghai Children's Medical Center, then educate them to train
others, making the hospital the leading national teaching and
referral center. Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the ribbon-cutting
ceremony at the facility late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pediatric cardiac surgeon faces an equally daunting
mission: helping the Chinese make sense out of the nation's
health-care funding. Long a Communist country known for its free
health care, China today is looking to the medical center to raise
enough money from patients to cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's evolved into a market capitalist system without a good
insurance system,'' said Jonas, 46, who continues to serve as a
consultant on the hospital project.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, Shanghai has developed the only health
insurance system in China: it covers children under age 4, and only
for half the cost of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are asking for the rest of the money up front,''
Jonas said. And small employers in China still cannot afford to
provide any insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think health care was free in China,'' he said.
However, the unfortunate reality was ``it was completely free
because there wasn't any to get,'' he explained. Jonas wants to get
people to think of quality health care as a right, and to develop a
comprehensive insurance plan adapted to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, boomtown Shanghai is a wealthy, cultured, and fashionable
city, Jonas said, that historically has been a source of new ideas.
He hopes the rest of China will embrace Shanghai's new direction in
health care and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston after his 11th trip to China for the
ribbon-cutting ceremony last month, Jonas remembers his first call
in 1986 from Project Hope, a 40-year-old health-care charity for
children that spends $100 million a year in 30 countries. Officials
from Hope and the Chinese ministry of health asked him to lead a
group of cardiac surgeons and support staff to teach Chinese
doctors and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   He made the trip. And his group did so well that deaths from
simple surgeries in Shanghai plunged to 3 percent from 25 percent.
The number of surgeries soared to 1,000 from 200 a year. Since
heart problems are the most common life-threatening congenital
problem in children, Jonas said, pediatric hospitals need this
expertise as their cornerstone. The Chinese surgeons soon outgrew
their hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1990s, Chinese officials made land available for a
new hospital, and money for construction and operating costs.
Project Hope pledged architectural and engineering support, and
training for the medical and administrative staff _ about one-third
of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was literally nothing there,'' Jonas said. Steam and
water lines with steady pressure, power supplies free of erratic
surges _ everything had to be custom-designed and built.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a 410,000-square-foot hospital with 250 beds that
can care for 250,000 children a year. Surrounded by 13 landscaped
acres, it offers dental programs, laboratories, imaging centers,
and auxiliary functions.
</P>
<P>
   In China, about 140,000 children are born each year needing the
services the center provides. A waiting list in the thousands has
been shortened because of Jonas's success in training Chinese
surgeons who, he said, have learned quickly and are ready for more
complicated procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I already achieved in China will eclipse what I'll ever
achieve here (in Boston),'' Jonas said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas has practiced or taught medicine in his native Australia,
the United Kingdom, Hungary, Singapore, South America, and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is particularly proud of elevating the status of
nurses in China through the first master's program there. He also
introduced a new focus on families with waiting rooms and
counseling for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, parents had been allowed only one hour a week for
visits with their child after a surgery. ``It was upsetting how
distressed they were,'' Jonas said. ``Now they can support a child
and help it to heal.''

PLANNED SALE OF NORTHERN FOREST LANDS BUILDS UP FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER COVE, Maine _ Jim Glavine's rental cottages look across
the blue-black waters of Moosehead Lake to an unbroken line of
trees 12 miles long. At night, a single artificial light glows in
the vast darkness; only loons and the occasional bull moose in the
driveway break the silence.
</P>
<P>
   This is New England's wilderness, the biggest lake in one of the
largest forests in the eastern United States. But its fate may turn
on decisions made in far-off South Africa, where a paper company is
peddling 911,000 acres of Maine woods, including 60 miles of
Moosehead Lake shorefront.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa Pulp and Paper's proposed land sale is the most
dramatic among several plans that could sell off nearly 4 million
acres _ an area the size of Connecticut _ in the Northern Forest
this summer, raising fears that the best parts of the woods from
Maine to eastern New York could be turned from remote hideaways
open to all into real estate developers' bonanzas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to stand here 15 years from now and look
across and not see a marina and condos over there,'' said Glavine,
whose logging camp-style cabins look over timber company land,
including a small amount owned by South Africa Pulp and Paper,
known by its acronym SAPPI.
</P>
<P>
   Though new regulations could slow development _ and SAPPI
promises to sell its land for timber management only _ memories of
the 1980s real estate boom are too vivid to reassure people like
Glavine. Moosehead Lake still bears the scars of the last boom,
such as houses in the middle of nowhere put up by developers who
exploited legal loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Forest, the largest contiguous forest east of the
Mississippi, covers 26 million acres across northern Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Last month, New York barely
averted a 15,000-acre development in the Adirondacks when the state
bought the land last month instead. But, with 70 million people
living within a seven-hour drive of the Northern Forest,
environmentalists fear that more second home and tourism projects
could soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   At root, forest residents, environmentalists, and state
officials alike are worried that the wave of land sales signals a
breakdown of the ``working forest'' system that has preserved the
woods since Henry David Thoreau canoed Moosehead in 1846. Under
this system, a handful of ``timber barons'' owned and logged the
land and cut trees, but kept the land public and left many
waterfronts alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the globalization of the wood products industry,
timber barons have been replaced by distant corporations whose
decisions have little to do with preserving the forest. Analysts
say SAPPI, which bought Maine land just four years ago, is selling
partly to offset debt from buying a European paper firm.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the anxiety, Maine's largest land owner, South
Carolina-based Bowater Inc., confirmed on Friday that more than one
firm has expressed interest in buying its 2.1 million acres (3,281
square miles) of forest, as well as its Maine mills, as soon as it
finishes another purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation where one can depend on long-term ownership by
large paper companies is not the reality any more,'' said Catherine
B. Johnson of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, an
environmental group. ``Every time (properties) are bought and sold,
there is this tremendous risk that lands will be siphoned off and
liquidated.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, politicians in the four Northern Forest states as
well as the Clinton administration face a growing clamor for them
to protect the woods on a scale not seen since 1919 when Maine
Governor Percival Baxter personally bought 200,000 acres around
Mount Katahdin and gave it to the state of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should buy this land while it's still in the hands
of a carpetbagger rather than an industrial owner who wants to turn
it into a plantation,'' said Michael Kellett of RESTORE: The North
Woods, which calls for a 3.2 million-acre national forest park
including much of SAPPI's land.
</P>
<P>
   More modestly, the Moosehead Messenger, a newspaper in
Greenville at Moosehead Lake's southern tip, is calling for
government purchase of key forest land ``to protect ourselves from
the whims of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, calls for state and federal intervention come at
a time when only New York has a hefty fund to protect open space.
Maine has just $3 million to protect open space across the state,
while New Hampshire and Vermont have even less, and federal money
is tied up in congressional wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   So, Governor Angus King of Maine has asked his conservation
officials to give him a possible strategy for protecting important
parts of the SAPPI holdings, likely collaborating with private land
trusts to buy development rights on timber land while allowing
private owners to continue to log.
</P>
<P>
   However, King spokesman Dennis Bailey stressed that Maine's role
will have to be limited in a SAPPI land sale that could fetch $200
million to $320 million. ``The idea that we would scarf up 900,000
acres is a bit of a pipe dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's designation of the
Northern Forest as one of his top three land acquisition priorities
may not translate into big money. Babbitt called for $5 million for
Northern Forest land in the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the
1999 budget, an amount congressional committees since have cut.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that environmentalists would object to SAPPI selling
its Maine land is ironic, considering how the company has treated
the woods. SAPPI uses herbicides to kill unwanted trees such as
maples, and strips virtually all of the trees from thousands of
acres in a practice known as clearcutting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, SAPPI's harvesting methods, which leave large bare
patches on the roads along Moosehead Lake, were a prime reason for
the unsuccessful 1996 referendum effort to ban clearcutting.

HARPER'S' LIZ TILBERIS SURVIVES IN STYLE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Imagine accepting a coveted job as an assistant at the British
edition of Vogue magazine and then going home to a closet that's
virtually empty. What in the world would you wear every &UR;  &LR; day when
office culture dictates the most up-to-the-moment designer clothes
and most of your colleagues have trust funds?
</P>
<P>
   Liz Tilberis thought she could circumvent her problem by dyeing
her few pairs of shoes different colors every night to match the
next day's outfit. She was so broke in 1970 &UR;  &LR; when she started this
entry-level job, she shopped at Woolworth's and flea markets hoping
to emulate the look of the moment. And to supplement her meager
$1,500 annual salary, she even stooped to repairing the broken
zippers of her colleagues' pants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was humiliated by her co-workers and reduced to tears
by her own self-doubt. One &UR;  &LR; woman, a Ferrari-driving heiress to a
piece of the Shell Oil fortune, told her that as a ``Voguette,''
she really had to dress better.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward almost 30 years and you'll see Tilberis is dressing
just fine. As the editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Harper's
Bazaar in New York, Tilberis now wears Chanel suits and Gucci shoes
on a whim. Instead of shopping second-hand at flea markets, she has
personal shoppers shopping for her. While she never got that
Ferrari, she did manage to buy a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Now this former fashion flunky is telling her 700,000 readers
each month how (itals)they(unitals) can dress better. ``People do
read my editor's note,'' said Tilberis in her soft British accent
during a recent visit to Boston. ``If we say: wear pink, black, or
blue, they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is also telling readers _ not through her magazine but
through an autobiography ``No Time to Die'' _ of her tragic bout
with ovarian cancer. Diagnosed five years ago, she has endured
surgery, chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant that ``smashed''
her to pieces, the loss of her hair, fingernails, eyelashes, and
eyebrows, and countless hours of excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live with a chronic disease,'' she said. ``If I hadn't come
to the States, I'd be dead by now,'' because, she said, American
health care is more aggressive in diagnosing cancer than England's.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis grew up in England. She was an ordinary brown-haired,
green-eyed young woman who was expelled from college for
entertaining her boyfriend in her room (she eventually graduated
from another college). She got her foot in the door at British
Vogue _ not through connections _ but by winning an essay contest.
She stood out because _ in an era focused on instant
self-gratification and entitlement _ she was willing to pay her
dues, even if it meant ironing a blouse for a photo shoot or
studying the latest in bra designs.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis transformed herself into an international style maven
because, as a true student of fashion, she eagerly studied fabrics
and design. She didn't care if she was a misfit among the wealthy
fashion crowd and she was never too proud to learn. ``I never had
good taste,'' said Tilberis, who moved to New York for Harper's
Bazaar in 1992 after 22 years at British Vogue in London (including
almost five years as editor-in-chief). ``Even today, I don't feel I
have great taste. I trained to become a designer, and I was a very
bad one. When I became a junior fashion editor, I was very
observant. I watched very carefully women with great taste,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her strategy paid off. &UR;  &LR; Today, the 50-year-old Tilberis is so
influential that on one occasion, a Harper's wannabe followed her
into a bathroom and slid a resume under the door of her stall. When
Tilberis hosted a Christmas party at her home a few years ago,
Calvin Klein was the first one there, followed by Ralph Lauren and
Donna Karan. And _ as a true sign of her importance _ the New York
tabloids hammered her when she arrived in the States over something
truly petty _ her weight.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she was 150 pounds. At 5-feet-7, that's certainly
normal for most people, but in the fashion industry, she was
considered (by one newspaper account) ``bovine.'' The editor has
since slimmed down to a skinny 120 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With her cancer in remission, Tilberis has learned to be
grateful for every day. ``I try hard to take it easy,'' she says.
``I try to get out of a lot of things in the evening and I do fewer
lunches'' &UR;  &LR; socially.
</P>
<P>
   But a lighter schedule for Tilberis is still a heavy load for
most people. The editor has tackled the disease with the same drive
she used to take on the fashion industry, primarily because she's
convinced she developed ovarian cancer from the fertility treatment
she underwent years ago unsuccessfully (Tilberis and her husband,
Andrew, have two adopted sons, Robert, 17, and Christopher, 13).
</P>
<P>
   First, encouraged by her staff, Tilberis agreed to have the
story of her cancer and chemotherapy treatment profiled in
``Harper's Bazaar.'' ``Nobody knows about this kind of cancer,''
she said. Then, Tilberis and writer Aimee Lee Ball wrote a second
piece about her bone marrow transplant. The response amazed her.
``We got thousands of letters,'' she said. So Tilberis was inspired
to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   From January to August 1997, Tilberis, with Ball, wrote the
autobiography that chronicles her rise in the industry and her
struggle with the disease. ``We've sold 28,000 copies,'' said
Tilberis. ``It's a bestseller in England. But all I care about is
for a woman (with symptoms) to make an appointment'' with her
gynecologist, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the president of the nonprofit Ovarian Cancer Research Fund,
Tilberis travels the country speaking about her experiences and
encouraging other cancer survivers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she is still running the magazine as well. Rather
than let the disease hurt her career, she's just worked around it.
While recuperating from her bone marrow transplant in 1995, for
example, Tilberis still held staff meetings. They were just in her
hospital room where, for her own protection, her staff wore
surgical masks and gowns. To make light of her hair loss in an
industry obsessed with perfect looks (and for her children's sake),
Tilberis named the wig she wore ``Larry'' as a joke. Her hair has
since grown back into a chic, cropped style.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis's typical day starts around 9 a.m. when she makes
business calls to London in the car while her driver takes her from
her Manhattan home to her office. Once there, she often holds staff
meetings about upcoming issues and then spends an hour reading mail
before meeting with advertisers, designers, and retailers. ``I
spend most of my work life walking up and down corridors asking
people, `What happened there? Why this photo?''' she said. ``I
worry a lot about the magazine. I might feel the last issue wasn't
smiley enough or we didn't use the right celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Three or four nights a week, Tilberis has a dinner or gala to
attend. But when she's free, she'll leave work by 6 or 7 and return
home to cook dinner for Christopher and Andrew (who works out of
the house as an artist and exercise-device inventor). Robert is
away at boarding school. ``I have a housekeeper. She's bought
everything,'' she said. By 9 p.m., dinner is done and Tilberis is
watching television _ ``ER,'' ``The Practice,'' and ``Just Shoot
Me'' are her favorites. She'll help with homework when needed and
then read a novel.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, family members retreat to their Long Island
home, where they visit with friends, play tennis, go boating, and
cook traditional English fare: roast or lamb and apple tarts or
crumble. The family home is certainly noisy. The boys have two
canaries, a labrador, a cat who's flown the Concorde, and a
locust-eating lizard. ``I buy the locusts,'' Tilberis said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her vast Rolodex and a clothing allowance (she calls it
``nothing much''), Tilberis insists she has only two closets
containing ``a couple'' of trouser suits and skirts in colors like
gray and oatmeal. ``I changed my size when I dropped from 150
pounds to 120,'' she said. ``My wardrobe is very small.'' And
Tilberis isn't one to wear stilettos to a weekend movie. ``I live
in Old Navy pants,'' she said. ``On Fridays, I wear J. Crew shorts
or Old Navy cargo pants and a Gap T-shirt. This summer, I'm going
to buy brown Birkenstocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some fashion groupies in the business, Tilberis doesn't
keep track of what she wore last week and the week before. If she's
photographed wearing the same thing at various galas, she could
care less. ``Fashion is so relaxed now,'' she says with a wave of
her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, has she come a long way. Gone are the days when she worried
about making an impression. Nowadays the ultraconfident and
powerful editor _ who's been to the brink of death and has more
than paid her dues _ says without hesitation and with just a little
attitude, ``If they don't like it, I'm sorry.''

GIRL IN THE MIRROR 
Three Generations of Black Women in Motion 
By Natasha Tarpley 
Beacon, 183 pp., $22 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The journey that Natasha Tarpley takes in ``Girl in the Mirror:
Three Generations of Black Women in Motion'' is not exactly new.
The book fits right into the stack of memoirs being published as
writers increasingly turn inward and readers continue to peek
inside the real lives of others.
</P>
<P>
   It is the path that Tarpley takes _ the meanderings, the stops
along the way, the observations she chooses to make on her journey
_ that moves ``Girl in the Mirror'' beyond the basic all-about-me
offering. Tarpley, a poet, looks for herself and sees the faces of
the women who came before her, her mother and her grandmother. She
sees that she is a reflection of them, that their spirits are so
intertwined with her own that separation is impossible. And in that
realization, there is strength.
</P>
<P>
   The author uses poetry, prose, letters, and even a funeral
notice to unfold the lives of these women as they make geographic
as well as psychological moves. In doing so, she brings freshness
to the memoir structure, making it read like a novel.
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the book is about grandmother Anna's move
from Alabama to Chicago in the 1940s; she follows her husband
north, where pots of golden opportunity were supposed to be waiting
for black folks fleeing the South. The second part deals with
Tarpley's mother, Marlene, and her own move to Cambridge, where she
pursues a master's at Harvard after her husband dies and she has to
figure out what she is beyond her previous role as a wife. Then
comes Tarpley's story, her struggle to fulfill herself, to ease the
ache for the elusive ``more'' that her mother and grandmother
experienced, and her move to Washington, D.C., seeking in law
school more security than writing could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, then, this is a book about ordinary folks moving
through life, dealing with deaths in the family, miscarriages, and
unsuccessful attempts to fill the empty places inside themselves
with the love of others.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley, who was born in 1971, takes on the voices of the women
whose lives she recalls. There is a push and pull in the way she
presents family members from one perspective, letting us know them
as they know themselves, and then shows them from outside, through
the eyes of others. This gives all her characters a delicious
richness.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens in 1942, with Anna confronting the loss of the
company of her husband, Jack, who is heading north from Alabama to
build a better life and find freedom in Chicago. She refuses to
wait patiently for the man to send for her, hops in a car with some
friends, and goes to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley's background in poetry is evident from the start, as
when she personifies emptiness _ making it not just a feeling but
an entity taking up space: ``So there it was. The emptiness he left
behind had beat me back to the house and was already in the
kitchen, leaning back in Jack's chair and grinning with its feet
propped up on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is lyrical without being flowery. Throughout,
Tarpley's way with description creates a breathtaking clarity, in
imagery so solid you can taste it. For example, with Anna's take on
love: ``When you're in love, you get so carried away over the fact
that somebody loves you, somebody wants to marry you. ... You hand
over your life like it was a piece of sweet potato pie, and you
watch him pull the plate close to him, then hold your breath until
he takes the first bite and smiles. But then he'll come back for
seconds and thirds, and you'll keep dishing it out. And what does
that leave you but the crumbs of a life somebody else has
devoured?''
</P>
<P>
   The book begins to flag only near the end of the journey, when
Tarpley deals with her own story. The imagery isn't as sharp, the
introspection not as telling, when she is closer to autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Girl in the Mirror'' remains a pleasant trip that anyone
can enjoy. We are all our mothers' daughters and our fathers' sons,
and Tarpley helps us recognize the importance of looking over our
shoulders to understand better what is ahead. As the author puts
it: ``You're constantly negotiating between where you come from and
where you're going. And, one is always tugging at the other.''

THERE'S NO FLOW TO GO WITH IN `HELLO NASTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SAUNDERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As examples of concept succeeding over content, few bands can
match the Beastie Boys' 15-year reign as one of pop music's most
glaringly overrated acts. Of course, none of that matters to the
legions of Beastie Boys fans who will file dutifully into shopping
malls across the country Tuesday (July 14) to buy the group's
latest disc, ``Hello Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans love the idea of the Beastie Boys, the transcultural
novelty of wealthy upper-class New Yorkers copping B-Boy poses and
spouting frat-boy raps. Few other explanations exist for the nearly
universal deafness to the inescapable truth: Adam Horovitz (King
Adrock), Mike Diamond (Mike D), and Adam Yauch (MCA) have voices
like ice picks.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrical flow is a critical component of any effective hip-hop
track, or should be, in the Beastie Boys' case. Without that flow,
block-rocking beats fall apart, disjointed and unbound by vocal
mortar. This minimalist approach often works for the electronica
offshoot of breakbeat, but hip-hop thrives on The Word.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Hello Nasty'' will re-kin-dle Middle America's
long-running love affair with the New York City trio, who first
injected hip-hop into the heartland with the 1986 disc ``Licensed
to Ill.'' That debut soared to No.1, the first rap disc to hit the
summit, and more significantly, got there without support from
blacks, then rap's biggest audience.. It was the first rap disc for
many white teens who discovered that the marriage of grinding
guitars and whiny vocals served the same purpose as heavy metal.
There has always been, and will always be, a demand for music that
both annoys parents and creates bonds between friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensed to Ill'' was also one of the first rap discs given
credence by rock critics, many of whom slept through Grandmaster
Flash, Run DMC, and Afrika Bambaataa, hoping the fad would pass. It
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways ``Hello Nasty'' is a familiar record, a collection
of sonic motifs that the Beastie Boys have toyed with since
``Licensed to Ill.'' Since it's more of a collage than a
thematically unified disc, ``Hello Nasty'' falls somewhere in the
middle of the Beastie Boys' previously explored territory. It
emerges as less bratty than ``Licensed to Ill,'' less trippy than
``Paul's Boutique,'' and far less funky than the best cuts from
``Check Your Head'' and ``Ill Communication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Disco Breakin''' opens the disc, a track for the
old-school heads, the fans who waited four years to hear the
Beasties' hot-potato lyric trading. It's a rap style that faded
soon after Jordache jeans and Kangol caps vanished from wardrobes,
but it works within deliberately retro tracks such as this one, and
on ``Intergalactic,'' the first single released from the disc.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every rap is delivered in that characteristic
high-pitched grating whine that sabotages great beats and cuts the
legs from dance tracks. For a fleeting, teasing, all-too-brief
moment during its introduction, ``Just A Test'' was nearly as
hip-loosening as any song the group has ever recorded, on a par
with the ultra-funky ``Get It Together'' from ``Ill
Communication.'' A promising foundation of ground-rumbling jeep
beats sprinkled with static and turntable scratches gets a brutal
funk-robbing beat-down from the vocal noise. ``The Negotiation
Limerick File,'' an amazing piece of rhythm manipulation, nearly
succumbs to the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint is rarely associated with the Beastie Boys in any
form, so any attempts to smooth the edges immediately stand out.
That's evident on the surprising cut `'Flowin Prose,'' which layers
a subdued Q-Tip style rap over a head-bobbing rhythm track. Subtle
seems to work best throughout ``Hello Nasty,'' especially the odd
semi-acoustic tracks that effectively keep the listener off
balance. ``I Don't Know'' is a low-fi gem that demands repeated
plays. ``And Me'' is a takeoff on a spare drum 'n' bass theme, a
strange, wonderfully spacey little song. ``Picture This'' mines the
same ground, helped greatly by an ethereal vocal by Brooke
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unite,'' one of the disc's best songs _ and one of the group's
best in a decade _ creeps up suddenly near the end of the party,
No. 19 of 22 tracks. Deftly placed piano and organ riffs trigger
involuntary head-bobbing; Beastie lover or not, it's impossible to
deny the funkiness of this cut, one of the rare Beastie Boys songs
with potential crossover appeal to serious hip-hop heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Boys get credit for eclecticism, as on ``Electrify,'' a
weighty track built atop a sample from Igor Stravinsky's ``The
Firebird Suite.'' By song's end, however, weighty becomes leaden
and the track seems much longer than 2 minutes and 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox of the Beastie Boys: contradictory elements
seemingly at war with each other. An excellent steel-drum sample is
the foundation of ``Body Movin','' another almost funky track that
loses all credibility with lyrics such as this:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins/When
it comes to quarries, I'm known to swim.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Let's try that again:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked/I'll stir-fry
you in my wok.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, gentlemen. That's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Apologists will likely dress up this lameness in the
one-size-fits-all cloak of parody, either the popular self-parody
flavor (``By mocking their own failings, they elevate the entire
oeuvre''), or the more challenging genre/societal parody (``It's a
statement about the shallowness and impermanence of popular
American culture.'')
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you know there's trouble with the creative process
if novelty rapper Biz Markie is offering tips in the studio. It's
this weakness of words that hobbles the disc and saps the life from
the music. More than any previous Beastie Boys release, ``Hello
Nasty'' makes a case for the trio to focus on studio production and
leave the rapping to rappers.

TALES FROM THE TITANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are thousands of tales relating to the doomed RMS Titanic.
Here are a few, courtesy of the people who have brought ``Titanic _
the Artifact Exhibition'' to Boston's World Trade Center:
</P>
<P>
   _Minutes after leaving on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912,
the ocean liner nearly collided with the liner New York, whose
moorings had snapped because of the Titanic's massive wake.
</P>
<P>
   _The ``RMS'' stands for ``Royal Mail Steamer.'' The Titanic was
carrying hundreds of sacks of mail in addition to 2,228 people.
</P>
<P>
   _Among the last passengers to board a lifeboat were two
brothers, 3-year-old Michael and 2-year-old Edmond, who were handed
over by their father, who was traveling under the name ``M.
Hoffman.'' His real name was Michael Navrati, and he had taken the
boys from their mother during divorce proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _The headline in the April 15, 1912, New York Sun read: ``All
Saved from Titanic After Collision.'' (In reality, only 705 people
survived the sinking 450 miles southeast of Newfoundland on April
15, 1912.)
</P>
<P>
   _Shortly after the ship struck an iceberg, a steward told
passengers, ``Oh, it'll be a few hours and we'll be on our way
again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of the Titanic: &LR;  There was a Jack Dawson aboard the
ship, but he was a hard-working fireman, not a Leonardo DiCaprio
lover boy who had that name in the movie. But that hasn't stopped
hundreds of adolescent and preadolescent girls from flocking to
Jack Dawson's grave in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for swooning purposes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  How many Titanic survivors are alive today? None,
one, five, 15, or 50? (Answer at end of column.)

called a bar because of the wooden bars that enclosed colonial tap
rooms. (With thanks to Valerie A. Russo of Weymouth, who learned
the fact from Betty H. Wright, curator, during a tour of Fearing
Tavern in Wareham.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; No tipping turmoil: &LR;  The problem with tipping is not that people
don't want to reward good service but that they're not always sure
how much to tip whom. Boston's newest hotel, the Seaport, has a
policy that ends the confusion. You don't tip anyone, but a $2 per
room service charge is added to your bill and a 15 percent charge
is added at the hotel's fine restaurant, Aura. If you try to tip
anyone beyond that, the money will be refused. If you leave the
money and run, it will be donated to charity.

COMPUTER-CHIP MACHINE SUPPLIERS STUCK IN DOLDRUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The companies that make the machines that make
computer chips are weathering the worst industry slump in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current environment is one of the toughest, most
unforgiving that I have ever seen,'' said James Morgan, chairman
and chief executive of Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Dataquest Inc. estimated that
semiconductor-equipment sales would decline 17.3 percent this year.
The industry's revenues fell 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, things were flying pretty high,'' said John Field,
vice president of marketing and OEM sales at Asyst Technologies
Inc. in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry has taken a pretty steep southward direction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   An industry in despair is the theme at the Semicon West show,
the largest annual gathering of semiconductor-equipment makers,
which continues through Wednesday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame a host of factors for the slump, including an
over-supply of chips and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most equipment makers have predicted
lower-than-expected earnings, which have led them to cut costs
dramatically by slashing employees and reducing expenses for
business travel, industry conventions and other items.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be ``a pretty bleak year,'' said Gene Norrett,
a Dataquest analyst who follows the semiconductor industry. ``We
don't see much improvement of the financials till mid- to late next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, the world's largest semiconductor equipment
maker, said Friday its third-quarter earnings would fall about 5
cents a share because of reduced orders.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Applied Materials announced plans to eliminate 1,000 of
its 15,000 workers through attrition and a voluntary severance
program. Last month, Novellus Systems Inc. of San Jose said it
would cut about 180 employees, or 10 percent of its work force. Two
weeks ago, Asyst let go 10 percent, or about 60, of its workers due
to sluggish orders for its equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Norrett noted that businesses readying their computer systems
for the so-called millennium bug and countries converting to the
new European currency would also hurt sales of semiconductor
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Norrett explained that after businesses bought the software to
accommodate these changes, there wouldn't be much capital left over
to buy new computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole food chain is affected,'' Norrett said.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which equipment makers aren't making cutbacks is
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Field of Asyst said an industry retreat was the perfect time to
test new technologies that a company could launch when the market
strengthens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not coming up with new products, you're dead in
technology,'' Field said.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ever since she was a mere 64 years old, Sylvia Jaffe has been
traveling to Pietrasanta, Italy, leading a group of fellow
sculptors to ply their art where Michelangelo once worked his magic
in marble.
 &HT;    Jaffe is a sculptor/instructor at the Boca Raton Museum of Art
in Florida, who again will lead a group of artists to the Tuscany
region of Italy in August and September.
 &HT;    She has had students as young as 30 and as old at 93 with skill
levels of all ranges, including beginner.
 &HT;    She has spent 20 summers in Pietrasanta, as she says, ``learning
from master artisans and inspired by the mountains of stone around
me ...
 &HT;    ``This is not a package trip,'' Jaffe stresses. But she has made
arrangements for the students to stay in one of two Pietrasanta
hotels and to work in a fully equipped marble studio five days a
week.
 &HT;    ``We share the cost of renting cars while in Italy,'' she says.
``On weekends we travel to nearby cities and towns where we visit
museums, churches and other points of interest. Sometimes during
the week we break early for a picnic or take walking tours of other
artists' studios. This year's itinerary includes a two-day trip to
Rome.''
 &HT;    Students will select their own stones, which are cut to size and
placed on their own personal work tables for the 20 working days.
 &HT;    Trained artisans are available to the students. Spouses who
don't participate can make use of nearby golf courses, tennis
courts or swimming pool. Sometimes they join painting workshops.
 &HT;    Those involved in past workshops speak highly of the experience.
``The weeks spent in Pietrasanta were the epitome of intense work
and enjoyment,'' says former student Victor Gross. ``From the
morning carving, to the group lunch, to the afternoon working, to
the good food and wine, what could be better?''
 &HT;    The total cost of Jaffe's workshop _ including tuition, studio,
accommodations and airfare _ is about $6,000 for the month. For
details, call (561) 394-3284 or visit

 &HT;    
 ANOTHER ITALY  
 &HT;    The Frontiers tour company is offering a trip that mature
traveler are sure to love: ``World War II Battlefields, Gardens and
Antiquities,'' from Sept. 25 to Oct. 4.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ever since she was a mere 64 years old, Sylvia Jaffe has been
traveling to Pietrasanta, Italy, leading a group of fellow
sculptors to ply their art where Michelangelo once worked his magic
in marble.
 &HT;    Jaffe is a sculptor/instructor at the Boca Raton Museum of Art
in Florida, who again will lead a group of artists to the Tuscany
region of Italy in August and September.
 &HT;    She has had students as young as 30 and as old at 93 with skill
levels of all ranges, including beginner.
 &HT;    She has spent 20 summers in Pietrasanta, as she says, ``learning
from master artisans and inspired by the mountains of stone around
me ...
 &HT;    ``This is not a package trip,'' Jaffe stresses. But she has made
arrangements for the students to stay in one of two Pietrasanta
hotels and to work in a fully equipped marble studio five days a
week.
 &HT;    ``We share the cost of renting cars while in Italy,'' she says.
``On weekends we travel to nearby cities and towns where we visit
museums, churches and other points of interest. Sometimes during
the week we break early for a picnic or take walking tours of other
artists' studios. This year's itinerary includes a two-day trip to
Rome.''
 &HT;    Students will select their own stones, which are cut to size and
placed on their own personal work tables for the 20 working days.
 &HT;    Trained artisans are available to the students. Spouses who
don't participate can make use of nearby golf courses, tennis
courts or swimming pool. Sometimes they join painting workshops.
 &HT;    Those involved in past workshops speak highly of the experience.
``The weeks spent in Pietrasanta were the epitome of intense work
and enjoyment,'' says former student Victor Gross. ``From the
morning carving, to the group lunch, to the afternoon working, to
the good food and wine, what could be better?''
 &HT;    The total cost of Jaffe's workshop _ including tuition, studio,
accommodations and airfare _ is about $6,000 for the month. For
details, call (561) 394-3284 or visit
www.powersite.net/web/sculpture on the Web.
 &HT;    
 ANOTHER ITALY  
 &HT;    The Frontiers tour company is offering a trip that mature
traveler are sure to love: ``World War II Battlefields, Gardens and
Antiquities,'' from Sept. 25 to Oct. 4.
 &HT;    The area between Rome and Naples is where the U.S. and Allied
armies fought arduous battles during World War II, but it also
contains celebrated gardens, classic antiquities and picturesque
villages such as Ravellow.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Washington has always been a city of multiple personalities.
 &HT;    There is monumental Washington, the mecca for tourists who line
up for the White House tour, wander the statue-lined halls of
Congress and cram the National Air and Space Museum.
 &HT;    There is green Washington, the leafy parks and residential
neighborhoods of Northwest, and the jogging routes through Rock
Creek Park and along the C&AMP;O Canal.
 &HT;    And there is dysfunctional Washington, the world's most famously
mismanaged capital, parts of which are plagued by crime, troubled
schools and deeply impoverished neighborhoods where few tour buses
stray.
 &HT;    But this city of a thousand movie scenes defies typecasting. In
a long afternoon stroll, it is easy to move from the new Franklin
D. Roosevelt Memorial, past the Watergate (known to a new
generation of scandal buffs as the home of Monica Lewinsky), up
through Georgetown and into the woods near the vice president's
official residence. There, deer still wander, only three miles from
the White House.
 &HT;    In the summer, Washington changes hands. Congress is itching to
get out by late July, and by early August, the Red Line, the subway
artery for the city's standing army of lawyers, deal makers,
journalists and bureaucrats, is overrun by tourists headed for the
Mall and the National Zoo. (Alas, only one of the city's two famous
pandas has survived the rigors of Washington life.)
 &HT;    For visitors, getting in and out of Washington is becoming
easier. The recently renamed Washington Reagan National Airport
finally has its new (if somewhat garish) main terminal, and without
stepping outside, you can catch Metro trains to downtown. But for
cheaper airfares, check out the more-distant Baltimore-Washington
Airport.
 &HT;    For train travelers, Amtrak lowers rates in summer (especially
for kids) and it drops you exactly where you want to be: the
refurbished Union Station, within sight of Capitol Hill. The
station is filled with boutiques and places to eat, and is a
retreat from the Washington heat.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    For a touch of 1870s Paris, the National Gallery's East Building
is presenting ``Manet, Monet, and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' through
Sept. 20.
 &HT;    Some of the paintings are familiar: the eerie ``Chemin de Fer''
along with 19 other of Manet works, many inspired by scenes just
outside his studio. There are also 14 works by Monet, and five by
Gustav Caillebotte. Admission is free. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (202)
737-4215.
 &HT;    Just off the Mall, and into the air-conditioning, a visitor
might start at the National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets,
N.W., for ``Celebrity Caricature in America,'' a collection of
show-biz drawings by Al Hirschfeld, running till Aug. 23. Don't
miss the portrait of Babe Ruth.
 &HT;    Then drop in at the National Museum of American History, 14th
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., to check out the re-creation
of an El Monte, Calif., sweatshop, part of ``Between a Rock and a
Hard Place: A Dialogue on American Sweatshops,'' an exhibit through
Oct. 30 about how immigrants have been treated on American shores.
 &HT;    At the Freer Gallery of Art, on the Mall at 12th Street and
Jefferson Drive, there is a new exhibit of Islamic art, featuring
calligraphy from the Koran and manuscripts that date from the ninth
century. Calligraphy aficionados will also find early 17th-century
works from Kyoto, Japan. The Freer's permanent exhibit of Japanese
screens is among the best this side of the Pacific.
 &HT;    These museums are open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Information:
(202) 357-2700.
 &HT;    From now until Oct. 24, the Folger Shakespeare Library, 201 East
Capitol St., S.E., is showing ``Papers and Porcelains,'' a
collection of late 18th- and 19th-century tinted sheets, pastoral
and military scenes. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
(202) 544-7077.
 &HT;    Wolf Trap, the open-air concert center in nearby Vienna, Va.,
has a jammed summer schedule, ranging from jazz to Mozart. Mary
Chapin Carpenter sings on July 17, 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. ($30 and
$18), and Ray Charles on Aug. 11 ($27 and $16).
 &HT;    The Wolf Trap Opera Company turns to Mozart's ``Abduction From
the Seraglio'' on July 24, 26, and 28 ($45). It is the perfect
Washington opera: Nasty villains and a wise ruler who, in a
reminder of a less voluble age of government, sings not a word.
 &HT;    For tickets to any Wolf Trap performance and schedules, call
(800) 955-5566 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, or visit
www.wolf-trap.org on the Web.
 &HT;    The fast way to Wolf Trap is the Orange Line to West Falls
Church, where a shuttle bus leaves every 20 minutes for $3.50 round
trip.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum has its usual permanent
array of aircraft and temporary shows.
 &HT;    The ``Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'' exhibit, on through
October, is free, but tickets must be picked up starting at 9:45
a.m. or in advance through Protix, (800) 529-2440, for a $3.25
service fee.
 &HT;    Anyone with a real aviation bug, however, should make it out to
the Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in
Suitland, Md., east of the city. This is where the Smithsonian
keeps 90 percent of its aircraft and rockets, and where its staff
restores old planes, buffs up rocket engines and pieces together
propellers. Some buildings are open as a no-frill museum.
 &HT;    Reservations are required two weeks ahead for tours, at 10 a.m.
daily plus 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, lasting three hours;
(202) 357-1400.
 &HT;    At the National Zoo, the 3000 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W.,
just north of the Woodley-Zoo subway stop, Amazonia is a magical
rain forest complete with dense vines, vegetation and aquatic life
and plenty of microscopes for hands-on exhibits.
 &HT;    A new exhibit, ``Birds of Paradise Lost,'' is filled with song
birds from Hawaii, including the brilliant orange iiwi. The zoo is
open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer. Admission is free, but
parking costs $1 to $10; (202) 673-4800.
 &HT;    Some of the better hiking adventures are near downtown. My
4-year-old son, Andrew, delights in the paths, streams and old
stone bridges behind Dumbarton Oaks.
 &HT;    The museum, (202) 339-6400, with its collection of Byzantine and
pre-Columbian art, is open only from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Sunday ($1 contribution) and the gardens 2 to 6 p.m. daily ($4
admission), but the paths, which reach down into Rock Creek Park,
are accessible any time from the back of Montrose Park, next to
Dumbarton Oaks on R Street in Georgetown.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Grand Hyatt, 1000 H St., N.W., near 11th Street, has 900
rooms and is well situated: above Metro Center, where all the
city's subways come together.
 &HT;    Summer rates range from $139 to $290 depending on availability,
based on double occupancy. It also has a series of good restaurants
in a cool atrium that is a popular escape from the summer heat;
(800) 233-1234, fax (202) 628-1641.
 &HT;    The Washington Westin, 2350 M St., N.W., is equidistant from
downtown and Georgetown and has 263 modern rooms. Summer rates are
$109 on weekends, $179 during the week. Try the Cafe on M for lunch
and the M Street Grill, by the inner courtyard, for more formal
fare; (800) 848-0016, fax (202) 857-0127.
 &HT;    Budget: Each of the 195 rooms has a full kitchen at the St.
James Hotel, 950 24th St., N.W., an all-suite hotel. Continental
breakfast is included, and there is a good outdoor pool. Rates
begin at $89 on the weekends, and $125 during the week. It is a
short walk to the Kennedy Center, and even shorter to the Foggy
Bottom Metro station; (800) 852-8512, fax (02) 466-6484.
 &HT;    Luxury: Hotel George, 15 E St., N.W., near North Capitol Street,
is a four-month-old 139-room luxury ultra-modern contemporary hotel
on Capital Hill, near Union Station. In July and August, rates are
reduced to $109 (from the usual $185 to $240), and suites start at
$200, including Continental breakfast and parking; (800) 576-8331,
fax (202) 347-4213.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    One of the best new restaurants in Washington is Greenwood at
Cleveland Park, 3529 Connecticut Ave., N.W., a small place named
for its chef, Carole Wagner Greenwood. It serves an eclectic mix of
California-style seasonal cuisine, like smoke salmon stack with
avocado goat cheese for an appetizer, and lightly grilled tuna
filet served very rare.
 &HT;    Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine came to $96. Open
for dinner daily, except Monday; (202) 833-6572.
 &HT;    Citronelle, in the Latham Hotel at 3000 M St., N.W., in
Georgetown, is making a comeback after a total renovation. A former
assistant White House pastry chef, Ann Amernick, does the desserts.
 &HT;    Dinners run north of $70 to $75 a person with wine, but it's
worth it, and there is plenty of people-watching. Try the red
snapper or the lamb, and the almond polenta for dessert. Daily
dinner except Sunday; (202) 625-2150.
 &HT;    Great Japanese cuisine can be found in a tiny sliver of a
restaurant called Makoto, 4822 MacArthur Blvd., N.W., north of
Georgetown. It has a sushi bar tended by several chefs trained in
similarly wonderful holes-in-the-wall in Tokyo.
 &HT;    At the restaurant's four tables, you can get the chef's special
six- to 10-course meal for $38 a person. Closed Monday and for
lunch Sunday; (202) 298-6866.
 &HT;    There are plenty of vegetarian selections at the Lebanese
Taverna, 2641 Connecticut Ave., N.W. Try the mehshi bel zeit _
eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper stuffed with rice and spices.
There is pleasant sidewalk dining at lunch and dinner, but
reservations are available only to 6:30 p.m. Dinner is about $20 a
person, without drinks; (202) 265-8681.
 &HT;    Asian cuisine of all kinds can be found at Oodles Noodles,
downtown at 1120 19th St., N.W. The Malaysian shrimp is spicy and
the pad Thai is delicious. Lunch or dinner for two with drinks is
about $30; (202) 293-3138.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Washington has always been a city of multiple personalities.
 &HT;    There is monumental Washington, the mecca for tourists who line
up for the White House tour, wander the statue-lined halls of
Congress and cram the National Air and Space Museum.
 &HT;    There is green Washington, the leafy parks and residential
neighborhoods of Northwest, and the jogging routes through Rock
Creek Park and along the C&AMP;O Canal.
 &HT;    And there is dysfunctional Washington, the world's most famously
mismanaged capital, parts of which are plagued by crime, troubled
schools and deeply impoverished neighborhoods where few tour buses
stray.
 &HT;    But this city of a thousand movie scenes defies typecasting. In
a long afternoon stroll, it is easy to move from the new Franklin
D. Roosevelt Memorial, past the Watergate (known to a new
generation of scandal buffs as the home of Monica Lewinsky), up
through Georgetown and into the woods near the vice president's
official residence. There, deer still wander, only three miles from
the White House.
 &HT;    In the summer, Washington changes hands. Congress is itching to
get out by late July, and by early August, the Red Line, the subway
artery for the city's standing army of lawyers, deal makers,
journalists and bureaucrats, is overrun by tourists headed for the
Mall and the National Zoo. (Alas, only one of the city's two famous
pandas has survived the rigors of Washington life.)
 &HT;    For visitors, getting in and out of Washington is becoming
easier. The recently renamed Washington Reagan National Airport
finally has its new (if somewhat garish) main terminal, and without
stepping outside, you can catch Metro trains to downtown. But for
cheaper airfares, check out the more-distant Baltimore-Washington
Airport.
 &HT;    For train travelers, Amtrak lowers rates in summer (especially
for kids) and it drops you exactly where you want to be: the
refurbished Union Station, within sight of Capitol Hill. The
station is filled with boutiques and places to eat, and is a
retreat from the Washington heat.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    For a touch of 1870s Paris, the National Gallery's East Building
is presenting ``Manet, Monet, and the Gare St.-Lazare,'' through
Sept. 20.
 &HT;    Some of the paintings are familiar: the eerie ``Chemin de Fer''
along with 19 other of Manet works, many inspired by scenes just
outside his studio. There are also 14 works by Monet, and five by
Gustav Caillebotte. Admission is free. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (202)
737-4215.
 &HT;    Just off the Mall, and into the air-conditioning, a visitor
might start at the National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets,
N.W., for ``Celebrity Caricature in America,'' a collection of
show-biz drawings by Al Hirschfeld, running till Aug. 23. Don't
miss the portrait of Babe Ruth.
 &HT;    Then drop in at the National Museum of American History, 14th
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., to check out the re-creation
of an El Monte, Calif., sweatshop, part of ``Between a Rock and a
Hard Place: A Dialogue on American Sweatshops,'' an exhibit through
Oct. 30 about how immigrants have been treated on American shores.
 &HT;    At the Freer Gallery of Art, on the Mall at 12th Street and
Jefferson Drive, there is a new exhibit of Islamic art, featuring
calligraphy from the Koran and manuscripts that date from the ninth
century. Calligraphy aficionados will also find early 17th-century
works from Kyoto, Japan. The Freer's permanent exhibit of Japanese
screens is among the best this side of the Pacific.
 &HT;    These museums are open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Information:
(202) 357-2700.
 &HT;    From now until Oct. 24, the Folger Shakespeare Library, 201 East
Capitol St., S.E., is showing ``Papers and Porcelains,'' a
collection of late 18th- and 19th-century tinted sheets, pastoral
and military scenes. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
(202) 544-7077.
 &HT;    Wolf Trap, the open-air concert center in nearby Vienna, Va.,
has a jammed summer schedule, ranging from jazz to Mozart. Mary
Chapin Carpenter sings on July 17, 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. ($30 and
$18), and Ray Charles on Aug. 11 ($27 and $16).
 &HT;    The Wolf Trap Opera Company turns to Mozart's ``Abduction From
the Seraglio'' on July 24, 26, and 28 ($45). It is the perfect
Washington opera: Nasty villains and a wise ruler who, in a
reminder of a less voluble age of government, sings not a word.
 &HT;    For tickets to any Wolf Trap performance and schedules, call
(800) 955-5566 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, or visit
www.wolf-trap.org on the Web.
 &HT;    The fast way to Wolf Trap is the Orange Line to West Falls
Church, where a shuttle bus leaves every 20 minutes for $3.50 round
trip.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum has its usual permanent
array of aircraft and temporary shows.
 &HT;    The ``Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'' exhibit, on through
October, is free, but tickets must be picked up starting at 9:45
a.m. or in advance through Protix, (800) 529-2440, for a $3.25
service fee.
 &HT;    Anyone with a real aviation bug, however, should make it out to
the Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility in
Suitland, Md., east of the city. This is where the Smithsonian
keeps 90 percent of its aircraft and rockets, and where its staff
restores old planes, buffs up rocket engines and pieces together
propellers. Some buildings are open as a no-frill museum.
 &HT;    Reservations are required two weeks ahead for tours, at 10 a.m.
daily plus 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, lasting three hours;
(202) 357-1400.
 &HT;    At the National Zoo, the 3000 block of Connecticut Avenue, N.W.,
just north of the Woodley-Zoo subway stop, Amazonia is a magical
rain forest complete with dense vines, vegetation and aquatic life
and plenty of microscopes for hands-on exhibits.
 &HT;    A new exhibit, ``Birds of Paradise Lost,'' is filled with song
birds from Hawaii, including the brilliant orange iiwi. The zoo is
open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in summer. Admission is free, but
parking costs $1 to $10; (202) 673-4800.
 &HT;    Some of the better hiking adventures are near downtown. My
4-year-old son, Andrew, delights in the paths, streams and old
stone bridges behind Dumbarton Oaks.
 &HT;    The museum, (202) 339-6400, with its collection of Byzantine and
pre-Columbian art, is open only from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Sunday ($1 contribution) and the gardens 2 to 6 p.m. daily ($4
admission), but the paths, which reach down into Rock Creek Park,
are accessible any time from the back of Montrose Park, next to
Dumbarton Oaks on R Street in Georgetown.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Grand Hyatt, 1000 H St., N.W., near 11th Street, has 900
rooms and is well situated: above Metro Center, where all the
city's subways come together.
 &HT;    Summer rates range from $139 to $290 depending on availability,
based on double occupancy. It also has a series of good restaurants
in a cool atrium that is a popular escape from the summer heat;
(800) 233-1234, fax (202) 628-1641.
 &HT;    The Washington Westin, 2350 M St., N.W., is equidistant from
downtown and Georgetown and has 263 modern rooms. Summer rates are
$109 on weekends, $179 during the week. Try the Cafe on M for lunch
and the M Street Grill, by the inner courtyard, for more formal
fare; (800) 848-0016, fax (202) 857-0127.
 &HT;    Budget: Each of the 195 rooms has a full kitchen at the St.
James Hotel, 950 24th St., N.W., an all-suite hotel. Continental
breakfast is included, and there is a good outdoor pool. Rates
begin at $89 on the weekends, and $125 during the week. It is a
short walk to the Kennedy Center, and even shorter to the Foggy
Bottom Metro station; (800) 852-8512, fax (202) 466-6484.
 &HT;    Luxury: Hotel George, 15 E St., N.W., near North Capitol Street,
is a four-month-old 139-room luxury ultra-modern contemporary hotel
on Capital Hill, near Union Station. In July and August, rates are
reduced to $109 (from the usual $185 to $240), and suites start at
$200, including Continental breakfast and parking; (800) 576-8331,
fax (202) 347-4213.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    One of the best new restaurants in Washington is Greenwood at
Cleveland Park, 3529 Connecticut Ave., N.W., a small place named
for its chef, Carole Wagner Greenwood. It serves an eclectic mix of
California-style seasonal cuisine, like smoke salmon stack with
avocado goat cheese for an appetizer, and lightly grilled tuna
filet served very rare.
 &HT;    Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine came to $96. Open
for dinner daily, except Monday; (202) 833-6572.
 &HT;    Citronelle, in the Latham Hotel at 3000 M St., N.W., in
Georgetown, is making a comeback after a total renovation. A former
assistant White House pastry chef, Ann Amernick, does the desserts.
 &HT;    Dinners run north of $70 to $75 a person with wine, but it's
worth it, and there is plenty of people-watching. Try the red
snapper or the lamb, and the almond polenta for dessert. Daily
dinner except Sunday; (202) 625-2150.
 &HT;    Great Japanese cuisine can be found in a tiny sliver of a
restaurant called Makoto, 4822 MacArthur Blvd., N.W., north of
Georgetown. It has a sushi bar tended by several chefs trained in
similarly wonderful holes-in-the-wall in Tokyo.
 &HT;    At the restaurant's four tables, you can get the chef's special
six- to 10-course meal for $38 a person. Closed Monday and for
lunch Sunday; (202) 298-6866.
 &HT;    There are plenty of vegetarian selections at the Lebanese
Taverna, 2641 Connecticut Ave., N.W. Try the mehshi bel zeit _
eggplant, zucchini and bell pepper stuffed with rice and spices.
There is pleasant sidewalk dining at lunch and dinner, but
reservations are available only to 6:30 p.m. Dinner is about $20 a
person, without drinks; (202) 265-8681.
 &HT;    Asian cuisine of all kinds can be found at Oodles Noodles,
downtown at 1120 19th St., N.W. The Malaysian shrimp is spicy and
the pad Thai is delicious. Lunch or dinner for two with drinks is
about $30; (202) 293-3138.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Since this summer's travel season is shaping up to be the
busiest in years, consumers need every bit of help they can to take
the sting out of their vacation's price tag.
 &HT;    Here are a few suggestions for those who've yet to make their
summer plans.
 FREQUENT-FLIER MILES  
 &HT;    For travelers who have a stash of frequent-flier miles, Randy
Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer (4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado
Springs, Colo. 90816; 800-333-5937) has this advice: ``Don't even
think of using miles to go to New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orlando, Chicago or Las Vegas. The same is true for Boston, Denver,
Phoenix or Seattle. These are all top places for people to redeem
their awards, and those awards are pretty much already taken.''
 &HT;    But, on a more encouraging note, he advises looking for seats to
Tucson, Ariz.; Key West, Jacksonville and Sarasota, Fla.;
Indianapolis, Ind.; Portland, Ore.; Nashville, Tenn.; Austin and
San Antonio, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wis.
 &HT;    ``Since San Francisco is hard, consider flying to Oakland
instead,'' Petersen recommends. ``And Honolulu is tough, so think
about flying to Kona. As for Denver, look to Colorado Springs as an
alternative.''
 &HT;    Petersen also has some advice about international travel,
suggesting that travelers look to new airline routes. That means
Dublin and Edinburgh for Continental and the new seven-times-a-week
service to Hong Kong that United Airlines is offering.
 AIRLINE TICKETS  
 &HT;    A good source of bargains for last-minute travelers is the
Internet. American Airlines (www.americanair.com) has Net SAAver
Fares _ last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail.
 &HT;    International deals are listed on Mondays, domestic deals on
Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is offered for free.
 &HT;    Most flights originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago,
Dallas and Miami. These deals are good for long weekend travel from
either Thursday to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week.
And the Web site offers tickets for longer stays.
 &HT;    Look also to U.S. Airways (www.usairways.com) and Continental
(www.flycontinental.com) for weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    TWA (www.twa.com) has Trans World Specials, and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) sends deals out periodically.
Many of these airline sites also offer well-priced car-rental and
hotel deals too.
 &HT;    For price-sensitive travelers, Priceline.com (www.priceline.com)
is the newest source for airline tickets. A traveler logs onto this
site, decides what price he would like to pay for a round-trip
ticket, makes the request and guarantees it with a major credit
card.
 &HT;    Within one hour for domestic travel and 24 hours for
international trips, travelers can learn whether an airline has
agreed to release a seat and which flights and routing are
provided. Tickets are non-refundable, non-exchangeable and do not
earn frequent-flier miles.
 CONSOLIDATOR TICKETS  
 &HT;    This is the time of year when consolidator tickets to major
European cities can offer the best trans-Atlantic values around.
 &HT;    But the downside to these discounted tickets is that they are
usually not refundable, transferrable or good for frequent-flier
mileage credit.
 &HT;    These tickets are also typically non-endorsable, which means in
the event of a delay or cancellation, they cannot be used to travel
on another airline.
 &HT;    Many travel agents will procure these tickets. However, for
those who wish to do it themselves, one of the largest
consolidators around is Council Travel (205 East 42nd St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-226-8624; www.ciee.org).
 ADVENTURE TRAVEL  
 &HT;    For anyone who needs a rafting, climbing, caving, biking or
sea-kayaking fix, the links provided by GORP, the Great Outdoors
Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), could be useful, as could the
Outdoor Action Guide to Outdoor Resources
(www.princeton.edu/(TILDE)oa/outother.html). It's a quick way to
find out which companies still have space on a bike trip to the
Tetons or a hike in Maine.
 HOTELS  
 &HT;    Weekday and weekend hotel discounts exist, but consumers may
find they have to ask for them.
 &HT;    The same is true for discounts provided for members of
automobile clubs like the Automobile Association of America (AAA)
and organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can offer larger discounts of 10 percent to 50
percent off the ``rack'' or published rate at select city and
resort properties throughout the country. Here's a short list.
 &HT;    Accommodations Express (801 Asbury Ave., Ocean City, N.J. 08226;
800-444-7666; www.accomodationsexp.com)
 &HT;    Branson Nights Reservations (P.O. Box 2321, Branson, Mo. 65616;
800-329-9999; www.branson-nights.com) works just with hotels in
Branson, Mo.
 &HT;    Capitol Reservations (1730 Rhode Island Ave. NW, Suite 1114,
Washington, D.C. 20036; 800-847-4832; www.hotelsdc.com) deals only
with properties in the Washington D.C. area.
 &HT;    Central Reservation Service (505 Maitland Ave., Suite 100,
Altamonte Springs, Fla. 32701;
800-548-3311;www.reservation(AT)america.com)
 &HT;    Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-356-1123; www.express-res.com) works only with hotels in New
York and Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill Lane, Suite 203,

Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer (4715-C Town Center Drive, Colorado
Springs, Colo. 90816; 800-333-5937) has this advice: ``Don't even
think of using miles to go to New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orlando, Chicago or Las Vegas. The same is true for Boston, Denver,
Phoenix or Seattle. These are all top places for people to redeem
their awards, and those awards are pretty much already taken.''
 &HT;    But, on a more encouraging note, he advises looking for seats to
Tucson, Ariz.; Key West, Jacksonville and Sarasota, Fla.;
Indianapolis, Ind.; Portland, Ore.; Nashville, Tenn.; Austin and
San Antonio, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wis.
 &HT;    ``Since San Francisco is hard, consider flying to Oakland
instead,'' Petersen recommends. ``And Honolulu is tough, so think
about flying to Kona. As for Denver, look to Colorado Springs as an
alternative.''
 &HT;    Petersen also has some advice about international travel,
suggesting that travelers look to new airline routes. That means
Dublin and Edinburgh for Continental and the new seven-times-a-week
service to Hong Kong that United Airlines is offering.
 AIRLINE TICKETS  
 &HT;    A good source of bargains for last-minute travelers is the
Internet. American Airlines (www.americanair.com) has Net SAAver
Fares _ last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail.
 &HT;    International deals are listed on Mondays, domestic deals on
Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is offered for free.
 &HT;    Most flights originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago,
Dallas and Miami. These deals are good for long weekend travel from
either Thursday to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week.
And the Web site offers tickets for longer stays.
 &HT;    Look also to U.S. Airways (www.usairways.com) and Continental
(www.flycontinental.com) for weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    TWA (www.twa.com) has Trans World Specials, and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) sends deals out periodically.
Many of these airline sites also offer well-priced car-rental and
hotel deals too.
 &HT;    For price-sensitive travelers, Priceline.com (www.priceline.com)
is the newest source for airline tickets. A traveler logs onto this
site, decides what price he would like to pay for a round-trip
ticket, makes the request and guarantees it with a major credit
card.
 &HT;    Within one hour for domestic travel and 24 hours for
international trips, travelers can learn whether an airline has
agreed to release a seat and which flights and routing are
provided. Tickets are non-refundable, non-exchangeable and do not
earn frequent-flier miles.
 CONSOLIDATOR TICKETS  
 &HT;    This is the time of year when consolidator tickets to major
European cities can offer the best trans-Atlantic values around.
 &HT;    But the downside to these discounted tickets is that they are
usually not refundable, transferrable or good for frequent-flier
mileage credit.
 &HT;    These tickets are also typically non-endorsable, which means in
the event of a delay or cancellation, they cannot be used to travel
on another airline.
 &HT;    Many travel agents will procure these tickets. However, for
those who wish to do it themselves, one of the largest
consolidators around is Council Travel (205 East 42nd St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-226-8624; www.ciee.org).
 ADVENTURE TRAVEL  
 &HT;    For anyone who needs a rafting, climbing, caving, biking or
sea-kayaking fix, the links provided by GORP, the Great Outdoors
Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), could be useful, as could the
Outdoor Action Guide to Outdoor Resources
(www.princeton.edu/(TILDE)oa/outother.html). It's a quick way to
find out which companies still have space on a bike trip to the
Tetons or a hike in Maine.
 HOTELS  
 &HT;    Weekday and weekend hotel discounts exist, but consumers may
find they have to ask for them.
 &HT;    The same is true for discounts provided for members of
automobile clubs like the Automobile Association of America (AAA)
and organizations like the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can offer larger discounts of 10 percent to 50
percent off the ``rack'' or published rate at select city and
resort properties throughout the country. Here's a short list.
 &HT;    Accommodations Express (801 Asbury Ave., Ocean City, N.J. 08226;
800-444-7666; www.accomodationsexp.com)
 &HT;    Branson Nights Reservations (P.O. Box 2321, Branson, Mo. 65616;
800-329-9999; www.branson-nights.com) works just with hotels in
Branson, Mo.

PRIDE IN LA'S BLACK HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An elegant granite wall stands in a courtyard
behind a large parking structure, a couple of fast-food
restaurants, and a local bank in the heart of this sprawling city's
business district. The artist's engravings on the monument relate a
compelling bit of American history, about a woman's perseverance
and intelligence, about her rise from destitution to wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools don't teach anything about Biddie Mason's life or
achievements, however, and her monument isn't listed in most
guidebooks about the attractions of Los Angeles. To learn the
extraordinary story of this freed slave and businesswoman, you have
to reserve a seat on a tour bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to show things about the city that people don't even
know exist,'' says Kenneth Perkins, who began his Historical Black
Los Angeles Tours three years ago, after receiving glowing reports
from a group of local middle-school students who traveled to
Memphis for a similar excursion there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my tour tries to do is what that one in Tennessee does so
well,'' says the 45-year-old travel agent. ``It gives black people
pride in a history most of them don't know much about, if anything,
and it gives everybody else an understanding that we have a history
here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins estimates that about 1,000 customers, about half of them
African-American, have already taken his three- to four-hour tour.
He draws his customers mainly from church groups, organizations for
the elderly, and schools in the Los Angeles area, but tourists from
around the world have also plunked down $27.50 each to see an
unusual array of sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, tours that focus on more-famous places in California,
like Disneyland or Hollywood or Universal Studios, attract far more
people. But there appears to be a growing market for
special-interest trips like those offered by Perkins; that's
evidenced by the fact that, in addition to those already mentioned,
organized tours to black historical sites and related points of
interest also are being offered in cities across the country,
including New York, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of attractions that they feature are not
stereotypical tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, for instance, Perkins takes his groups to
Sugar Hill, a small district full of lovely, large houses and
mansions _ nearly all of them decaying. This area preceded Beverly
Hills as the city's home to the rich and famous, and it became the
trendy place to live for wealthy and famous blacks in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On small vans or large buses, depending on how many customers he
has (with a minimum of six per tour), Perkins also rides through a
three-block piece of L.A. that used to be called ``the Island.''
It's a neat neighborhood of small, wood-frame houses just west of
downtown in which a closely knit group of blacks used to live in
the late 1800s, surrounded on all sides by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Once Perkins decided to start his tour _ ``a light went off in
my head,'' he recalls, when he heard about the middle-school kids
who went to Memphis _ he buried himself in libraries, historical
societies, and the like to research which sites he wanted to show.
``To be honest, I didn't know if I'd find many,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As any good tour operator working around Southern California
would, of course, he found out where movie stars and other
prominent people had lived. But the homes Perkins takes his
customers to see aren't found on the maps peddled in souvenir
shops.
</P>
<P>
   In Sugar Hill, for instance, he points out the one-time
residences of actors like Butterfly McQueen of ``Gone With the
Wind'' and Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to win an
Academy Award. A few minutes later, he shows the modest,
two-bedroom house where Dr. Ralph Bunche, the Nobel Peace Prize
winner, grew up with his grandmother. Then he heads for the
historic firehouse that was California's first to be segregated _
because officials had promoted a black firefighter to lieutenant,
but thought white subordinates probably wouldn't work under his
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just wonderful,'' says Sandra Moodie, a cake artist and
children's magazine founder in London. She says that she wanted to
take Perkins's tour because, when she recently celebrated her 33d
birthday, she had vowed to learn more about her heritage ``and this
offers a unique perspective I couldn't find elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins says his objective is to place as little stress as
possible on the discrimination that blacks endured, though he does
allude to it, and to focus instead on those who saw openings and
succeeded despite the odds.
</P>
<P>
   He says that's why he shows so many of the buildings designed by
Paul Revere Williams, who became California's first black architect
in 1915 and who designed nearly 3,000 structures. Those include the
first African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, the county
courthouse, and elegant estates once inhabited by stars such as
Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, and Lon Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks with pride about every stop on his tour _ from the
dilapidated home (now being renovated) where the Pentacostal Church
of God in Christ got its humble start in 1906; to the Dunbar Hotel
in South Central Los Angeles, built in 1928 by a Jamaican immigrant
named John Alexander Somerville who was the first black graduate of
the University of Southern California. But Perkins makes no attempt
whatsoever to disguise which one is his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biddie Mason is my hero, and she'd be a lot of other people's
hero, too, if they knew about her,'' says Perkins, who offers the
black Los Angeles excursions through his company, which is called
KEP Tours and is based in nearby Lakewood. He runs the tours
regularly each February, during Black History Month, and
periodically throughout the year whenever he can put together a
group of at least six.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was born into slavery in 1818, on a Mississippi
plantation. As a young woman, she walked behind a wagon train when
her owner moved himself and his belongings to Utah, and he brought
her to California in 1852. Here, one of her three daughters fell in
love with a successful African-American businessman, who instigated
a court suit that led to Mason's family being released from
servitude in 1856. California was a free state at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Working as a nurse and a midwife, Mason saved about $250 over
the following decade and used the money to buy swampy land south of
what was then the business center of Los Angeles _ which, Perkins
is quick to point out, itself was founded by men of black origins.
By the time Mason died in 1890, the three-block area she owned had
become the core of the city's fincancial district, and she had
grown very wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   During her 34 years of freedom, Mason raised a family that went
on to prominence, founded the city's first AME church in her living
room, and became a philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly never learned about people like her in school,''
says Ponchita Jubilee-Smith, a longtime resident of Southern
California whose college degree was in history. Though she says she
is glad people today have the opportunity to visit sites like those
Perkins shows on his tours, she adds, ``It would be nice, of
course, for black LA to be part of the standard city tour.''

IN THE END, THE HOSTS HAD THE MOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The success of France has its origins in the 1970s and
'80s, when Les Bleus established a reputation as one of the world's
most stylish international teams.
</P>
<P>
   Those players _ Jean Fernandez, Alain Giresse, Michel Platini,
Dominique Rocheteau, Didier Six, Jean Tigana _ became the coaches
and/or inspiration for the current generation of soccer players who
are the World Cup champions after crushing Brazil, 3-0, in the
final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Platini, the most successful French footballer ever, is more
than the symbolic leader of this group _ he was the president of
the French Organizing Committee and, along with President Jacques
Chirac, the most enthusiastic of VIP presenters at the Stade de
France.
</P>
<P>
   And that was among the keys to France winning this championship
_ the home-country advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Aimee Jacquet developed a conservative, powerful group
that specialized in pressuring opponents into mistakes, then taking
advantage. France has many skilled players, resulting from a
traditional appreciation of the aesthetics of sport, and a
highly-competitive professional league.
</P>
<P>
   But the French have not always been as passionate for soccer as
their neighbors. That changed during this World Cup. The nation
galvanized behind the team as it continued to win, culminating in
what became a 24-hour party in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe to
celebrate the win.
</P>
<P>
   The French were willing to compromise their aesthetic standards
for Jacquet's pragmatism, as long as the strategy succeeded. The
individual technical brilliance of Zinedine Zidane, the solid
defending of Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu,
Lilian Thuram, and goalkeeper Fabian Barthez, and the opportunism
of the group, captured imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s and '80s, the French national team and clubs such as
Saint-Etienne also captured imaginations, but most of their forays
onto the international scene ended in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet solved that problem by reducing the margin for error
with a conservative philosophy, stifling opponents with three
defensive midfielders, and attacking only through random long balls
to a lone striker. Les Bleus also capitalized on leniency from
referees, again a benefit of playing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jacquet and Brazil coach Mario Zagallo were heavily
criticized for their team selections and strategies. Jacquet was
vindicated by success, Zagallo remained under intense pressure, and
concluded his post-match press conference by storming out after
arguing with Brazilian journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brazil's lackluster championship game performance
raised many questions. Ronaldo was excluded from the original
starting lineup, then reinstated less than an hour before the
start. His ankle had been X-rayed the morning of the match, and he
received a general check-up after complaining of aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's ineffectiveness raised questions. If he was unfit, why
did he play? And, once it became obvious he could not perform, why
wasn't he substituted?
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo said Ronaldo's condition had a strong psychological
affect on Brazil, implying that the team's mentality was extremely
fragile. Brazilian critics noted that this could have been
countered with the presence of strong personalities such as
Romario, who was cut from the team in May, or that there were
outside pressures that forced Ronaldo to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Brazil became one of the most disappointing teams
in the tournament, suffering the worst final-game defeat since
1970, when the Brazilians defeated Italy, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   There were other disappointments: Spain, eliminated in the first
round; Nigeria, the best African team, crushed by Denmark, 4-1, in
the second round; Italy, eliminated by France on penalty kicks as
coach Cesare Maldini made Jacquet seem like a risk-taker; the US,
which suffered its earliest elimination ever and trailed for 219 of
the 270 minutes it played against Germany, Iran, and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists field was expanded to 32 teams, and though the
lower-echelon nations experienced little success, they enlivened
the tournament. Croatia's third-place finish was the best by a
first-time entrant since Portugal in 1966. Japan's solid and
sometimes inspiring performance was encouraging, since it will
share the host role with South Korea in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, playing in its second World Cup finals, displayed tactical
discipline and technical excellence in defeating the United States,
2-1, in the politically-charged atmosphere of Stade Gerland in Lyon
June 21.
</P>
<P>
   England unveiled one of the game's brightest young stars,
18-year-old Michael Owen, but its fans caused enough problems to
probably vanquish the country's bid for the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of controversies. African nations protested
what they felt were the victimizations of Cameroon and Morocco,
both subjected to elimination by controversial refereeing
decisions. A group of former players actually attempted to sue in
French courts to have those teams remain in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans' only solace was the naming of Said Belqola of
Morocco as the first championship game referee from their
continent.
</P>
<P>
   So, who will be the France of the future, a team that brought
flair and imagination but ultimately failed in the final major
international sporting event of the century?
</P>
<P>
   There are many candidates _ Chile, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria,
South Africa. Hopefully, Los Matadores Luis Hernandez and Marcelo
Salas, technicians Mustafa Hadji and Jay Jay Okocha, and Quinton
Fortune will teach their children well. Hopefully, they will remain
uninhibited, maintain their sense of La joie de jouer.

WHIPPING UP SOME INTEREST IN THE BRITISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Welcome to the Lancashire coast, summer
resort central. The howling winds, plummeting temperatures,
occasional rain, and leaden skies were enough to drive everybody
indoors Monday at Royal Birkdale GC, where the 127th British Open
begins Thursday morning. If this is a prime summer resort, winter
must be a delight in these surroundings by the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Should this weather persist, it would set up a fun show outside
the more comfortable confines of the clubhouse that resembles a
ship washed ashore with its riggings and roof decks. The architect
who designed it in the 1930s envisioned it as a ship navigating its
way through the sand dunes to the nearby sea.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, who won the game's oldest championship two years ago
at nearby Royal Lythamm &AMP; St. Annes, grew up in the Minnesota
climate and compared the way it was Monday to an April day in the
Land of 10,000 Lakes. Which means March was a lot of fun. ``I'm not
sure this suits anybody's game,'' said Lehman. ``It's awfully
difficult. I played nine holes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my driver, 5-iron and the putter with the six golf
balls. By the time I got to the eighth tee, I was out of golf
balls. It was blowing 45 miles an hour. I wouldn't say the course
was unplayable, but it was very difficult. On the second hole (410
yards), I hit two drivers and didn't get it there. That shows you
how hard it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's blowing between 25 to 30 miles per hour, and if you
play well today, you shoot around par or maybe 1 under. It's very
easy to shoot 77 or 78. I think the best players will come to the
top. When it's blowing hard, you just have to hit the ball solid.
If you don't hit it solid, you have no chance whatsoever of
winning. I don't care how good you play. The best ball strikers
definitely have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you know when you come here this is what you should
expect. Obviously you don't get it all the time. We didn't get it
two years ago. You come and you need to expect to have some wind
and some rain. If you're not ready for that, you're probably not
going to do very well. I think (in these) sort of conditions you
have to take whatever it gives you and make the best of it. It's
very easy to lose your swing when the wind blows.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind was whipping though the press tents, and it seemed the
roof might blow away at any moment. And it raised havoc with the
putting. ``The wind blowing so strong, it can blow it off line,''
said Lehman. ``I remember a couple of years ago in the Scottish
Open when Howard Twitty had a 20-foot putt straight into the wind,
and it went 20 feet beyond the hole. The wind was blowing so hard
and he was leaning into it so much, he knocked it 20 feet by the
hole and right off the green. More than anything, it plays tricks
on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, who won the 1994 US Open at Oakmont and repeated a
year ago at Congressional, termed the conditions ``almost
laughable.'' The wind was right to left on the 480-yard par-4
sixth, and then dead against the players after cutting the dogleg.
``I hit driver, 3-wood,'' said Els. He proceded to tip the cap in
favor of Englishman Lee Westwood, who Els said was on a roll that
has established him as one of the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a little bit of breeze,'' said Els, ``but I
don't call that a breeze out there. I played the back nine 1 over,
and I thought I played quite nicely. I think when the wind is
blowing, it suits a stronger player because you aren't going to hit
all the fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Added US Open champion Lee Janzen. `If it plays like this I
would be amazed if somebody played the whole tournament without a
double bogey. After all, he played his first practice round Sunday
and lost five balls. ``The wind just changes the course entirely.
You have to play all sorts of shots. The wind makes the ball go a
lot shorter for us. You're forced to hit more low, penetrating
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who played his first practice round at Royal
Birkdale in the blustery weather, tuned up en route with a round on
the Old Course at Ireland's Ballybunion GC. Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan,
his caddie, had played there in late April and had such an
enjoyable experience that he coaxed Woods to join Mark O'Meara and
Payne Stewart for a visit. Woods was 1 under for his round.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The companies that make the machines that make
computer chips are weathering the worst industry slump in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current environment is one of the toughest, most
unforgiving that I have ever seen,'' said James Morgan, chairman
and chief executive of Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Dataquest Inc. estimated that
semiconductor-equipment sales would decline 17.3 percent this year.
The industry's revenues fell 7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, things were flying pretty high,'' said John Field,

   Analysts blame a host of factors for the slump, including an

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The companies that make the machines that make
computer chips are weathering the worst industry slump in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current environment is one of the toughest, most
unforgiving that I have ever seen,'' said James Morgan, chairman
and chief executive of Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Dataquest Inc. estimated that
semiconductor-equipment sales would decline 17.3 percent this year.
The industry's revenues fell 7 percent in 1997.

   ``A year ago, things were flying pretty high,'' said John Field,

MISSION STATEMENTS ARE JOB1 -- FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a plaque in the lobby of Arrow Automotive
Industries' &UR;  &LR; headquarters is emblazoned the auto parts maker's
mission statement: ``We make good parts. We ship on time. We all
sleep good at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Developed by top managers a few years ago, the mission statement
appeared on company literature for about five months, remembers
Joel D. Holzwasser, Arrow's vice president of advertising and
public relations and a member of the writing committee at the
Framingham, Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   But then employees lost interest, as did Holzwasser himself.
``I've never been an enthusiast of mission statements,'' he says.
``I think they're kind of hokey.''
</P>
<P>
   To some they're inspirational exhortations, to others they're
useless boilerplate.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, the corporate mission statement has become as
commonplace in the business world as company letterhead. Like the
project proposal and the Microsoft Powerpoint presentation, the
writing of mission statements has been elevated to a management
art.
</P>
<P>
   Every firm from the smallest widget maker to the largest Fortune
500 company seems to have one. In fact, 9 out of 10 firms now have
them, compared to 1 out of 3 in 1985, estimates Tom Brown,
president of Management General, a Louisville consulting firm.
Companies have embraced the statements, emblazoned on everything
from plaques to coffee mugs, as an important marketing tool. An
entire industry of consultants has sprung up to help companies
develop mission statements.
</P>
<P>
   But naysayers argue the statements are balderdash.
</P>
<P>
   Arrow's mission statement, which Holzwasser says is languishing
forgotten on a lobby wall, has gone the route of similar
declarations at other &UR;  &LR; companies, promulgated with great enthusiasm
before slipping into a haze of management buzzword-speak. While
mission statements became hot earlier this decade, today's
employees say they don't always need a formal code to understand
the inner meaning of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Today's mission statements read like a corporate wish list,
citing companies' commitment to lofty &UR;  &LR; ideals such as ethics,
customer satisfaction, employee development, diversity, and
devotion to the larger community. More cynical hopes for the bottom
line also often creep into mission statements.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Lovdal, a vice president with Mercer Management
Consulting in Lexington, Mass. who has worked on numerous mission
statements with clients, has identified what he calls the
``third-third-third rule.'' About one-third of businesses ``have a
mission statement, believe in it, use it as a reference,'' he says.
Another third ``have one but can't find it,'' while the remaining
third scoff at the whole idea, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The typical corporate candidate for a mission statement is a
troubled firm, which, ``as a result of increased competition or
market changes, has to do something different,'' says Dani Monroe,
president of Center Focus International, a Boston consulting firm
which helps businesses write mission statements and develop
employee diversity plans.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting a mission statement can be a drawn-out process, and
large firms often hire consultants like Monroe to help out.
Consultants can charge between $2,000 and $5,000 a &UR;  &LR; day to work on
mission &UR;  &LR; statement projects, Monroe says.
</P>
<P>
   Often, however, founders go it alone. At Staples Inc., chief
executive Thomas G. Stemberg came up with the mission statement
when he founded the company in 1986, according to Ronald L.
Sargent, president of North American operations for the
Westborough, Mass. office supply giant. Every employee at Staples
is issued &UR;  &LR; a laminated, wallet-sized card bearing the statement _
``Slashing the cost and hassle of running your office!''
</P>
<P>
   Collecto Inc., a Norwell, Mass. debt management firm, &UR;  &LR; pledges
in founder and president Paul E. Leary's words ``to provide
receivable services within the highest ethical and moral
standards.'' And employees at the bill collecting company say they
see it as an inspirational missive from the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go out into the marketplace and sell our service,
you have to believe in what you're selling,'' says Thomas M. Walsh,
a Collecto marketing manager who keeps a copy of the mission
statement on the wall of his cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   But not all companies write mission statements as a gospel for
employees. Companies for which a mission statement is primarily a
publicity tool may farm the drafting process out to marketing
consultants or internal &UR;  &LR; advertising departments. At Converse Inc.,
the North Reading, Mass. shoe manufacturer, the romantic-sounding
mission statement _ ``Everything we do is a tribute to the athletes
who gave birth to their sport, to those who made it great and those
who re-invent it every day'' _ formed part of a new advertising
campaign &UR;  &LR; and was launched at a global sales meeting in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was drafted as part of an overall repositioning of the
company that we were working on from a strategic standpoint with
our marketing department and our ad agency,'' says Jennifer Murray,
vice president of marketing communications, who worked on the
statement. ``The writing was done by one of the head creative
directors.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But other firms try to turn mission statement writing &UR;  &LR; into a
consensus-building exercise. At Fairfield, Conn.-based General
Electric Co., tens of thousands of managers passing through the
company's retreat campus in Ossining, N.Y., between 1982 and 1992
contributed ideas to an emerging mission statement. Appearing for
the first time in a 1992 letter from chairman John F. Welch Jr.,
the ``GE Values'' declaration espouses a broad vision of happiness
for all.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statement, GE's managers, among other tenets,
``have a passion for excellence and hate bureaucracy,'' ``live
quality ... and drive cost and speed for competitive advantage,''
``have global brains ... and build diverse and global teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say the statements require several key components.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you first try to do is figure out what you're better at
than anybody else in the universe, what they call `core
competencies,' '' says Robert H. Woosley, a managing member of
Lumen Consulting LLC in Atlanta, who has helped several corporate
clients write mission statements. ``Then you think about the trends
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this mix comes some pronouncement on the company's
strategy or future. Collecto's mission statement promises that the
firm will, among other things, ``accomplish unparalleled results
anchored by a philosophy of performance and client commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But buzzwords tend to lace mission statements as well. Overused
lingo such as ``constituencies,'' ``clear customer focus,''
``effective use of technology,'' ``empower,'' and
``accountability'' crops up frequently.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once the mission statement is written, executives face the
task of selling it to employees. Often, the chief execuitve calls
an employee meeting to formally present the statement, which can
also appear in the company newsletter, on its Web &UR;  &LR; site, or on a
lobby plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, make their mission statements public
with a flair. At Converse, each shoe bears a modified version of
the mission statement printed on the inside of the tongue. Lovdal,
the Mercer consultant, recalls that one client printed the firm's
mission statement on every coffee cup in the cafeteria. Woosley,
the Atlanta consultant, says he has seen mission statements on
pens &UR;  &LR; and t-shirts as well as the bottom of company letterhead.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But gimmicks only go so far toward convincing doubters, who
think mission statements are pointless at best and laughable at
worst. Some workers say a mission statement simply states the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows basically what they should be doing, but this
gives them a road map for what they can expect from us and what we
expect from them,'' says John A. Yezerski, general manager of a
Staples store in Boston, where the firm's mission statement is
posted in the employee break room and on the management suite's
doors.
</P>
<P>
   And others &UR;  &LR; question the necessity of having a mission statement
at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At GE's aircraft engines and parts factory in Lynn, Mass.,
union leader Richard F. Casilli says the corporate mission
statement has little relevance for the factory's 3,000 workers who
are members of Local 201 of the International Union of Electronic,
Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think that's routine corporate talk, always
talking about productivity and efficiency and the global market,''
says the local's business agent. ``People are a little more
practical-minded at our plant. We're focused on making good
engines.''

SPEAKING OUT AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the classes she holds at companies across the country,
consultant Natalie Camper tells a story about a female employee
who, after enduring six years of lewd behavior and suggestive
comments, finally confronted her harassers.
</P>
<P>
   But when the woman threatened to report her colleagues to the
firm's human resources department, the men turned to her and said:
``Fine. We know where your car is, and we know where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they would have gone so far as to damage her car or
break into her home, the threat changed the woman's mind. She
decided not to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The story shows why so many women are reluctant to report sexual
harassment when it happens, and may wait until they are no &UR;  &LR; longer
employed at a worksite to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's groundbreaking U.S. Supreme Court ruling seems
especially suited to tackling this type of problem. It requires
that employers do all they can to prevent sexual harassment. That
means encouraging workers to come forward with their complaints .
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that employers could be held liable for
sexual harassment by a supervisor even if the abuse was never
reported to top management. The court also said that employers
could be held liable for threats a supervisor makes against a
worker for complaining about sexual harassment or for refusing
sexual attentions, even if no action is ever taken and the threats
are not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Using a set of guidelines that supporters are hoping will
revolutionize the workplace, the justices' goal seemed to be
two-fold: To help employers do the right thing by developing and
instituting a policy with zero tolerance for harassment, and making
victims feel safe enough to put aside their qualms and come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   But will victims speak up?
</P>
<P>
   Camper, president of The Camper Group, a workplace consulting
firm, says the high court decision is hardly a panacea. She
believes most women will continue to balk at coming forward with a
complaint for fear their livelihoods _ even their lives _ will be
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the firings and demotions that may occur when women
complain, fear of physical harm still ranks as major &UR;  &LR;  deterrent.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a series of workplace studies on retaliation, Working Woman
magazine &UR;  &LR; found that 25 percent of working women who are sexually
harassed use their leave time to avoid uncomfortable situations; 15
percent quit their jobs because they fear retaliation; &UR;  &LR; and 50
percent try to ignore the offending behavior , with such serious
results as a 10 percent drop in productivity, increased stress; and
a loss in productivity among &UR;  &LR;  the women who work with them.
</P>
<P>
   Although retaliation is against most state and federal laws, it
can take extremely subtle forms, making it difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, for example, the harasser is a `good old boy' who is
highly respected,'' says Camper, ``the woman learns that if she
reports to him she will be viewed as a troublemaker and the result
could very well be the loss of a career. The other problem is this:
The higher you go in a company or the more you've achieved, the
more you are expected to smile and go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Camper: ``For the woman at the top, the risk is even
greater because the losses are greater. The risk for them means
loss of reputation and loss of prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Take neurosurgeon Frances Conley. For 25 years, she put up with
demeaning remarks and harassment from male colleagues at Stanford
University's Medical School. Fearing her career would be damaged if
she spoke up, Conley said nothing. When she finally spoke up, she
was blacklisted by some prominent members of her profession who
felt she was making an unnecessary fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I put up with it as long as I did is I really
wanted to advance. You put up with a lot to try and be one of the
crowd,'' Conley says in ``Sexual Harassment on the Job: What It Is
&AMP; How To Stop It,'' (Nolo Press, January 1998, $18.95).
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where small employers were advised to adopt
sexual harassment guidelines two years ago, the June 26 US Supreme
Court ruling should reinforce what many ought to know: Companies
that take an aggressive stance against sexual harassment have less
to fear than employers who do nothing.

CORONADO ON QUEST TO JOIN 3-YEAR-OLD STUDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, who easily won the $150,000 Dwyer Stakes at
Belmont Park Sunday, is ready to take on the big boys, and the big
boys, Real Quiet and Victory Gallop, may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Forty Niner, out of a Damascus mare, Coronado's Quest
ended 1997 by winning the Cowdin, Nashua, and Remsen, all at
Aqueduct, and went to Florida this winter stamped a prime Triple
Crown threat. As soon as Coronado's Quest saw the palm trees,
however, he flipped, literally. He would not behave in the paddock
or post parade, alternating between refusing to move and bucking
and rearing, in the Hutcheson, Fountain of Youth, or Florida Derby,
all at Gulfstream, and he lost each one.
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, who trains Coronado's Quest for owner Stuart
Janney, declared him out of the Kentucky Derby after the debacle in
the sun. McGaughey, a top horsemen, feared Coronado's Quest would
either kill himself or somebody else if he threw one of his
tantrums in the midst of the Kentucky Derby mob scene.
</P>
<P>
   But something else happened after Coronado's Quest finished a
disappointing fifth in the Kentucky Derby. It was discovered he had
an entrapped epiglottis. The handsome chestnut is undefeated since
an operation cured the problem, winning the Wood Memorial at
Aqueduct and the Riva Ridge at Belmont prior to the Dwyer. Perhaps
more important, he hasn't acted up since the surgery. McGaughey has
a theory that Coronado's Quest might have frozen up going to the
track to race because he knew when he ran, he wouldn't be able to
breathe properly. He thinks fear may have caused his bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Coronado's Quest has been unchallenged since
returning to New York. It wasn't so much that he won the Dwyer over
four hopelessly overmatched foes, it was how he won it. He broke
alertly under Mike Smith from post No. 3, settled nicely along the
rail, took over during the run down the backstretch and showed his
superiority turning for home, drawing away to tally by 5 lengths at
odds of 2-5 ($2.90 to win). The time for the mile and one-16th was
1:422/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This colt is a bomb,'' said Smith. ``He ran great and gave a
real professional performance. He loaded well, broke well, and
behaved perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a bruised foot, suffered the morning before the race, kept
Coronado's Quest out of the Preakness, in which he had been made
the morning line favorite. The same bruise made it impossible for
McGaughey to train him hard enough to make the Belmont Stakes, at 1
1/2 miles, and he instead dominated the 7-furlong Riva Ridge on the
Belmont undercard. Having missed the entire Triple Crown, as Real
Quiet defeated Victory Gallop in the Derby and the Preakness before
Victory Gallop turned the tables in the Belmont, Coronado's Quest
will now get his chance to turn the Big 2 of the 3-year-old
division into the Big 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to consider the Dwyer one of his best races so far,''
said McGaughey, whose charge has a career record of 12-8-2-0 and
$860,790 in earnings. ``The Haskell (Aug. 9 against Real Quiet and,
perhaps, Victory Gallop) will be an interesting race for him and
we'll probably go to Monmouth a few days beforehand just to school
him in the paddock.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks on Coronado's Quest is that he's only won in
New York. He's 2 for 3 at Saratoga, 4 for 4 at Aqueduct, and 2 for
2 at Belmont. This is the same criticism that was leveled at Easy
Goer, also trained by McGaughey, who captured only one race outside
of the Big Apple (the Swale at Gulfsteam) in his distinguished
career. However, what the critics fail to mention is that the
racing surfaces at Saratoga, Aqueduct, and Belmont are all
distinctly different, having nothing in common other than being
located in the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet and Victory Gallop are both big-hearted horses, but
Coronado's Quest presents a challenge to their dominance because he
has two things they don't _ high early speed and a touch of
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Weighty issue
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Sonny Hine, trainer of Skip Away, and
Monmouth officials, which led to the Aug. 30 Iselin Handicap being
lengthened from a mile and one-16th to a 1 1/8 miles, and enriched
from a purse of $250,000 to $500,000, revealed that trainers of top
handicap horses are often told how much weight their horse will be
assigned to carry far in advance of the official announcement. This
is a well-known but seldom discussed fact of life in the handicap
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away carried 130 pounds to victory in the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs, setting a track record of 1:471/5 for 9
furlongs in an outstanding performance. At the time, Hine thought
that would be Skip Away's final race in a handicap event. He was
planning on the Hollywood Gold Cup, Pacific Classic, Woodward
Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup, and Breeders's Cup Classic to round
out the 5-year-old Skip Away's career. Each of those races is
weight-for-age.
</P>
<P>
   However, after shipping from his Belmont base to Hollywood to
win the Gold Cup, Skip Away, who has been something of an iron
horse, came back tired and Hine decided not to ship him back to
California for the Aug. 15 Pacific Classic at Del Mar. That's when
negotiations over the Iselin began and an official told Hine that
Skip Away would be asked to carry 131 pounds, the minimum 1-pound
raise over the MassCap, in the New Jersey race. Frankly, Skip Away
was so brilliant in the MassCap he should have been given 135
pounds for the Iselin, but then Hine would not have run him. So,
hey, how about 132 pounds, at least?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of running a mile and one-16th,'' said
Hine. ``It's not fair to the horse. They want him to carry 131
pounds in the Iselin. It wouldn't be fair if he had to do that
sprinting. The horse has got to come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kulina, vice president and general manger at Monmouth,
acknowledged he had discussed the weight assignment with Hine.
``It's very unfair to talk about that until you know who you are
weighing, but, in this day and age, a 1-pound pick up is about what
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the purse, Hine wanted the increase because it will help
him in his quest to have Skip Away pass Cigar as the greatest North
American money-earner in history. He feels if Skip Away can
accomplish that feat, the Eclipse Award voters will be hard-pressed
to deny Skip Away the Horse of the Year crown he missed last year,
when 2-year-old Favorite Trick won in a controversial vote.
Two-time Horse of the Year Cigar earned $9,999,815, while Skip
Away, who was 3-year-old champion and then handicap champion, has
earned $8,906,360.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave my word that I would come if they changed the distance
of the race and if the purse put me in the position to win $10
million with Skip Away before the Breeders's Cup, and my word is my
bond,'' said Hine. ``If we just won the Woodward and the Jockey
Club Gold Cup, it would only give us $900,000, and we need just
over $1 million to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes made by Monmouth helped pursuade Hine to pass on the
$400,000 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Aug. 8. Hine ran Skip Away,
who is currently on a seven-race winning streak, in both the
Whitney, in which he finished third, and the Iselin, in which he
finished second, last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I push for the Whitney, I'll be pushing too hard,''
said Hine. ``He's coming back to himself but he won't breeze for
awhile. With the Iselin being Aug. 30, I have a lot of time to work
on his feet and his legs and get everything perfect.''

`Bearhart' is no bear
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bearhart, who won the Eclipse Award as the best grass
horse in North America last year and was also Horse of the Year in
Canada, was upset in the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a strong closing win in the Manhattan Handicap on the
Belmont Stakes undercard, Chief Bearhart was away at 3-10 under 124
pounds and Jose Santos, but was compromised by a slow pace and
could do no better than third, beaten a toal of 4 1/4 lengths.
Santos sat last off a pace that saw 6 furlongs run in 1:144/5 and a
mile run in 1:382/5, and Chief Bearhart could not make up enough
ground through the stretch. Cetewayo, a 9-1 shot ($21.20 to win)
who once ran for a $13,000 claiming tag, and John Velasquez
prevailed by 2 lengths over 16-1 chance Officious and Aaron Gryder
in the time of 2:13 2/5 for a 1 3/8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things,'' said Mark Frostad, who
trains Chief Bearhart. ``There was too slow of an early pace and he
just didn't get moving soon enough. The weight he carried may also
have been a factor. He gave somewhat of a mediocre performance. He
fired, it was just that he did it too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Chief Bearhart, who took the $2 million Breeders's Cup
Turf last year, will be the $300,000 Sword Dancer Handicap at
Saratoga Aug. 15.

Free House is back
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who was an outstanding 3-year-old last year, made a
smashing 1998 debut Saturday, winning the $100,000 Bel Air Handicap
at Hollywood by 7 lengths. Bet down to 4-5 ($3.60 to win) in his
first race since bleeding in the Super Derby last September, Free
House and pilot Chris McCarron did not disappoint, laying second
through fast fractions before taking over turning for home to score
in 1:413/5 for the mile and one-16th.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Free House won the Santa Anita Derby and the Swaps, and
he ran 3-2-3, respectively, in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and
Belmont. If he has returned to full form, he will be a serious
player in the handicap ranks and he appears headed for the Pacific
Classic, where he would take on the dynamic duo of stablemates
Gentlemen and Puerto Madero, and, maybe, Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   I was worried about bleeding because he bled in the Super Derby,
but he looks pretty good,'' said trainer Paco Gonzalez. ``He looks
like he's not stressed. I think he is more mature now. He's
stronger, more relaxed. We hope he stays this way.''

FRENCH DRINK IN THEIR LONG-AWAITED CUP WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Everybody's great-aunt died late Sunday night. That's
apparently why nobody from Montmartre to Montparnasse was able to
make it to work Monday morning. If they did, their eyes were rimmed
red from mourning. Or maybe it was from too much champagne on the
Champs Elysees, as everyone stayed up all night _ again _ toasting
Les Bleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``POUR L'ETERNITE'', L'Equipe, the national sporting daily
proclaimed, after France had, improbably and unforgettably, won its
first World Cup soccer crown and hung a final exclamation point on
a tournament that seemed to take an eternity to complete.
</P>
<P>
   It took 33 days _ twice as many as the Olympic Games _ to play
64 matches, more than half of them just to eliminate the Jamaicans
and the Saudis and the Yanks. It took 10 days to reduce the final
eight to one. Wars have been fought in less time than that. ``We've
seen nothing but trees, we're sick of it,'' French midfielder
Emmanuel Petit said, after 70 days of seclusion at the team's camp
in Clairefontaine.
</P>
<P>
   So it has become with the Mondial, which takes two years to
complete, from the first (of 643) qualifying match to the final,
and holds the planet in thrall like nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 37 billion (yes, billion) people in aggregate
watched this Cup, 1.7 billion of them tuning in for the final
alone. Three thousand print journalists and 850 photographers
covered anything that talked or moved. And every seat for every
match in every stadium, from the Stade de France's 80,000-seat
flying saucer to St. Etienne's 36,000-seat cockpit, was sold out
before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 million people applied for the 2.5 million tickets,
and the rest of the world _ especially their British neighbors _
fumed when they realized that two-thirds of them were reserved for
the French. So scams and corruption were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of foreign fans bought travel packages from
fly-by-night agencies that promised tickets and never delivered.
Thousands more bought forged tickets at face-value bargains. And a
member of the French organizing committee's official tour firm
stole a huge bloc of seats and peddled them on the black market.
``The ticket distribution system needs to be drastically
overhauled,'' admitted incoming FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem this time was that the host country had some
of the smallest stadia in recent history. Except for the Stade de
France, which had to be built because no other venue had anywhere
near enough seats for a final, only Marseille's expanded
60,000-seat Stade Velodrome and Paris's Parc des Princes had more
than 45,000, and three of the 10 venues (St. Etienne, Toulouse,
Montpellier) had fewer than 37,000.
</P>
<P>
   Given the enormous demand, limited capacities, high prices, and
blocs of tickets reserved for working media and sponsors, this was
not an event for ``l'homme dans la rue'', the man in the street.
When French captain Didier Deschamps walked into the Stade de
France for the quarterfinal match against Italy, all he saw in the
tribunes were dark suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like they were going to a funeral,'' Deschamps
complained. ``The average guy who lives bleu-blanc-rouge from
morning until night, where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   L'homme dans la rue was in la rue with his face painted in
tricolor, wearing a blue game jersey with Zizou's No. 10 on the
back, watching the match with tens of thousands of others on the
free big screen in the square in front of the Hotel de Ville and
chanting ``On va gagner'' (We're going to win).
</P>
<P>
   What gave this Cup its flavor was not so much what happened
inside the stadia but what happened in the streets, as a whole
country let itself become seduced by the Mondial and gave its heart
to Les Bleus, who had broken it so many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks who knew the Cup and knew the French weren't sure
that ever would happen. ``France hasn't really understood the
importance of the World Cup,'' chief organizer Michel Platini
sighed a month before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Headaches were abundant at the start. The Air France pilots
walked off the job and there were wildcat strikes on the railroad.
English hooligans ran riot in Marseille and German neo-Nazi thugs
raised havoc in Lens, leaving a gendarme near death.
</P>
<P>
   But once Les Bleus started winning and heroes like Zizou
(Zinedine Zidane), Lolo (Laurent Blanc), and Thuthu (Lilian Thuram)
emerged, France forgot all else _ work, sleep, restraint. The Cup
hadn't been held here in 60 years and most people figured it
wouldn't come back in their lifetime. And even if Les Bleus won it
again, it never could be the same.
</P>
<P>
   So as soon as Deschamps hoisted the golden trophy over his head
Sunday night, l'homme dans la rue and everybody else headed for the
Champs Elysees and partied ``pour l'eternite'' until a chill rain
sobered them up and sent them home after dawn to prepare for
Bastille Day Tuesday _ and another great-aunt's funeral.

PROFESSOR THINKS ELECTROMAGNETISM DOWNED FLIGHT 800 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the
possibility that the crash of TWA 800 on July 17, 1996, whose cause
has still not been pinpointed, might have been the result of
electromagnetic interference _ perhaps put out by high-powered
radar systems on nearby Navy ships.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility was first raised in an article and letters by
Harvard University professor of English Elaine Scarry that were
published in the New York Review of Books. James E. Hall, head of
the safety board, said in a letter responding to Scarry's article
that the board ``has considered the possibility'' that some form of
electromagnetic interference ``was a factor in the accident,'' and
that the possibility is still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Scarry suggested that such interference, perhaps put out by one
of at least 10 military craft known to have been in the immediate
area, could have triggered the fatal spark believed to have ignited
fuel in the plane's central fuel tank. While investigators have
identified that tank as the likely point of origin of the
explosion, they have not yet been able to identify a source of
ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Scarry, though she has no personal expertise in technology or
electromagnetic systems, cites several specialists who have
endorsed her conclusion that this possibility should be taken
seriously, including physicists at Harvard, Yale, and the
California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of those physicists, Yale University professor of biophysics
Robert Shulman, said in an interview Monday that ``there are many
ways'' that electromagnetic radiation ``could interfere with the
electronics'' of a commercial plane and that ``the investigation
should include that possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Such electromagnetic interference, while it had not been
publicly mentioned as a possible factor in the TWA 800 crash until
Scarry's article, is well known in military circles as a potential
hazard to airplane navigation systems. For example, a 1992 article
in the trade magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology said that
several US Army helicopter crashes since 1982 ``are thought to have
resulted from interference with flight control systems when flying
near radar or communications transmitters.''
</P>
<P>
   That article said the military was carrying out extensive
research to develop ways of protecting aircraft control systems
against such interference and to develop electronic weapons
designed to direct such interference deliberately toward target
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Rear Admiral (retired) Eugene Carroll,
now deputy director of the Center for Defense Information in
Washington, said he once encountered problems with a shipboard
navigation radar that would occasionally fail for no apparent
reason, leaving the Navy ship he commanded without needed
navigation information. It turned out that the failures were the
result of interference from a different transmitter aboard the same
ship, which was only used intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   That transmitter ``was just overwhelming the radar,'' Carroll
said, but it took a long time to pinpoint the equipment as the
problem's source because of its intermittent usage.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said that such interference, while long recognized as a
potential hazard in the Navy, ``was always ambiguous and
undefined.'' He said that precautions were routinely taken to guard
against it, especially during sensitive operations such as the
loading of munitions, but that there was no clear understanding of
exactly what situations or instruments might produce dangerous
results.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Aegis-class radars on modern Navy ships have
``a very powerful array, they send out a very concentrated beam''
of electromagnetic radiation. There were four Navy ships close to
the scene at the time of the TWA 800 crash.
</P>
<P>
   A sufficiently powerful electromagnetic field can induce a
current in any piece of wire or metal that it crosses, and if that
current is sufficiently large it can sometimes produce a spark.
</P>
<P>
   Carrol said that in the case of that crash, ``it's not
impossible that the configuration was unique'' because of specific
arragements of wiring onboard, possible cracks or wear in
insulation, and the exact position and orientation relative to a
source of radio emissions, and that ``some fluke event occurred
which induced a spark and brought the plane down.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators ``at least ought to look at the potential emitters
out there, the potential sources,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the board said Monday that ``we are looking''
into the possibility of such sources. But he added that the NTSB's
director of aviation safety, Bernard Loeb, said that ``we have
looked at electromagnetic interference from the outset of this
investigation. We feel that the likelihood of an external source of
EMI causing the explosion of TWA flight 800 is extremely remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb added that ``due to our interest in EMI and its effect on
aviation in general,'' the board has asked a military agency
responsible for keeping track of military equipment and
transmissions ``to further investigate possible external sources.''

   HAHN-COLUMN (Seattle) _ For the upcoming PGA gonzo golf gig at
Sahalee at Redmond, Wash., next month, I thought I'd get one of

on how to avoid interacting with whatever live bison that might
appear in the rough.

LOW GRADES IN EDUCATION FOR BAY STATE POLITICIANS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The embarrassment of Massachusetts does not lie in
the fact that one crop of prospective schoolteachers did terribly
on some tests recently.
</P>
<P>
   The real embarrassment is that a state once known for its
maturity and vision is worth studying today for the way its
politicians play games with serious topics.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the test scores were made public, Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci has actually proposed legislation of which
two of the main components are already law.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the same acting governor who just three years ago
was joined with his predecessor, Bill Weld, in a high-profile
effort to get Massachusetts out of the teacher certification
business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, meanwhile, the leadership from the House has
been virtually mute. And from the Senate has come a proposal so
tangential and fiscally questionable (signing bonuses of $20,000
for 250 new teachers a year) as to border on the humorous.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, any college kid watching this eruption of
cheap politics would be forgiven if he shipped his teaching
applications to states where teacher-bashing and education politics
are less a public sport. If the nonleadership at the highest levels
is too much even for the state's education commissioner _ and it
was _ how is someone with the commendable desire to teach school
supposed to feel?
</P>
<P>
   On first thought, perhaps House Speaker Tom Finneran should get
some credit for having the least to say or propose about this. The
harm done by doing nothing is less than that done by some of the
more headline-catching players.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, state Senate President Tom Birmingham at
least stayed on the fringes of activity by suggesting that with
$100 million in a trust fund, the interest could pay $20,000 to 250
top college students willing to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a state of the Commonwealth's size, educators may have
difficulty imagining what the impact would be on hundreds of
thousands of kids from 250 supposedly ``elite'' new teachers each
year. And the rest of us may not understand how some undisclosed
selection criteria can justify treating those 250 better than
others in the top fourth of college seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But given the furious competition for the highest-achieving
graduates from the private sector, and given the likelihood that
some form of signing bonus can play a role in avoiding a massive
teacher shortage over the next decade or so, the idea at least has
merit.
</P>
<P>
   The position of Cellucci is much harder to justify.
</P>
<P>
   His current role of top teacher policeman was not his role in
1995, when the state's mission seemed to be to become chief
cheerleader for Newt Gingrich's attempted revolution. Perhaps
people have forgotten, but Weld-Cellucci were pushing open
enrollment in 1995, along with de facto privatization via vouchers
for elementary and secondary education.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, if I may quote, ``In the new state
government, the Office of Education and Training would get out of
the business of teacher certification and recertification
altogether.'' Perhaps someday the acting governor might explain the
intellectual journey that got him from then to now.
</P>
<P>
   As for now, consider the plank in his latest proposal on college
loan forgiveness for new teachers. It claims that it ``expands''
the existing program to include young people who have graduated
with ``honors.'' Let's see now. The existing program includes all
those who graduate in the top fourth of their class. Has no one
stopped to wonder how many kids are in the top quarter of their
class and don't get honors?
</P>
<P>
   Or take Cellucci's tough-sounding proposal to require the
Education Department to produce by the end of this year a model
plan for local districts to develop new ways of certifying
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds nice, but the fact is, the law requiring this has been in
existence for the better part of five years. It is apparently the
acting governor's position that he needs a new law to tell his own
department what deadline it needs to meet. Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that serious education reform is being
implemented right now in Boston and several communities across the
state. It raises standards much higher for pupils and teachers
alike. A group may do badly on a given test, but that ought to
merely redouble the resolve of the people involved to make this
work. It definitely ought not lead to mindless teacher-bashing,
blame games, and minor-league politics.
</P>
<P>
   All this reform, don't forget, all this standards-raising, and
all this concern about shortage is occurring in the absence of any
real change in the horrid working conditions teachers endure and of
any serious attempt to make their pay and benefits commensurate
with less demanding tasks in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the state's leaders had a golden chance to
expand the base of support for reform, underline its urgency, and
increase their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And they blew it sky-high.

BOSTON SURGEON LENDS A HELPING HAND TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Children's Hospital chief surgeon Richard Jonas is
changing the way China provides health care.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a team for the US charity Project Hope, and working
hand-in-hand with Chinese government officials, Jonas helped build
the first world-class pediatric hospital in China at a cost of $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting specialists from the United States, Canada, and Europe
will teach Chinese doctors the latest in high-tech medicine at
Shanghai Children's Medical Center, then educate them to train
others, making the hospital the leading national teaching and
referral center. Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the ribbon-cutting
ceremony at the facility late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pediatric cardiac surgeon faces an equally daunting
mission: helping the Chinese make sense out of the nation's
health-care funding. Long a Communist country known for its free
health care, China today is looking to the medical center to raise
enough money from patients to cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's evolved into a market capitalist system without a good
insurance system,'' said Jonas, 46, who continues to serve as a
consultant on the hospital project.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, Shanghai has developed the only health
insurance system in China: it covers children under age 4, and only
for half the cost of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are asking for the rest of the money up front,''
Jonas said. And small employers in China still cannot afford to
provide any insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think health care was free in China,'' he said.
However, the unfortunate reality was ``it was completely free
because there wasn't any to get,'' he explained. Jonas wants to get
people to think of quality health care as a right, and to develop a
comprehensive insurance plan adapted to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, boomtown Shanghai is a wealthy, cultured, and fashionable
city, Jonas said, that historically has been a source of new ideas.
He hopes the rest of China will embrace Shanghai's new direction in
health care and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston after his 11th trip to China for the
ribbon-cutting ceremony last month, Jonas remembers his first call
in 1986 from Project Hope, a 40-year-old health-care charity for
children that spends $100 million a year in 30 countries. Officials
from Hope and the Chinese ministry of health asked him to lead a
group of cardiac surgeons and support staff to teach Chinese
doctors and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   He made the trip. And his group did so well that deaths from
simple surgeries in Shanghai plunged to 3 percent from 25 percent.
The number of surgeries soared to 1,000 from 200 a year. Since
heart problems are the most common life-threatening congenital
problem in children, Jonas said, pediatric hospitals need this
expertise as their cornerstone. The Chinese surgeons soon outgrew
their hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1990s, Chinese officials made land available for a
new hospital, and money for construction and operating costs.
Project Hope pledged architectural and engineering support, and
training for the medical and administrative staff _ about one-third
of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was literally nothing there,'' Jonas said. Steam and
water lines with steady pressure, power supplies free of erratic
surges _ everything had to be custom-designed and built.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a 410,000-square-foot hospital with 250 beds that
can care for 250,000 children a year. Surrounded by 13 landscaped
acres, it offers dental programs, laboratories, imaging centers,
and auxiliary functions.
</P>
<P>
   In China, about 140,000 children are born each year needing the
services the center provides. A waiting list in the thousands has
been shortened because of Jonas's success in training Chinese
surgeons who, he said, have learned quickly and are ready for more
complicated procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I already achieved in China will eclipse what I'll ever
achieve here (in Boston),'' Jonas said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas has practiced or taught medicine in his native Australia,
the United Kingdom, Hungary, Singapore, South America, and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is particularly proud of elevating the status of
nurses in China through the first master's program there. He also
introduced a new focus on families with waiting rooms and
counseling for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, parents had been allowed only one hour a week for
visits with their child after a surgery. ``It was upsetting how
distressed they were,'' Jonas said. ``Now they can support a child
and help it to heal.''

JUST WHAT EVERY 16-HANDICAPPER NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the upcoming PGA gonzo golf gig at Sahalee at
Redmond, Wash., next month, I thought I'd get one of those
limited-edition American Bison Leather golf bags that go for a mere
$1,850 per, plus tax, shipping and instructional video tape on how
to avoid interacting with whatever live bison that might appear in
the rough.
</P>
<P>
   This might not do a lot to dispel the notion that golf is a game
for the well-to-do, but American sports fans have always needed a
little pizazz in their respective pastimes, a little class. And you
sure ain't going to get it from Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I'm going to put it on the expense account because the
P-I has pulled out all the stops for coverage on this tournament.
The bag will be useful for carrying my lunch, thermos, sun
umbrella, cell phone and P-I subscription order blanks.
</P>
<P>
   The genuine bison bags _ advertised as a ``must for the
collector or serious golfer!'' _ number only 250, meaning a whole
lot of collectors and serious golfers will have to settle for
crocodile, kangaroo, ostrich or spotted owl skin bags because there
won't be enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll stand out when I get out of the limo at Sahalee and walk
around to the trunk to personally unload my American Bison Leather
golf bag, made by the Denver Buffalo Co. The purists among you will
of course note that the American bison is not considered a true
buffalo, partly because of its large head and the fact that it has
14 pairs of ribs instead of the 13 pairs in so-called true buffalo.
But when you've been reduced to a golf bag, the distinction blurs
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   To mollify those animal rights people, I'll not use the matching
leather club-head covers that look remarkably like bison hooves
sticking up out of the bag on the ends of skinny bison legs.
Instead, in a women's golf catalog, I've found an assortment of
``darling animal-head covers to protect your finest woods or
putters.''
</P>
<P>
   For a mere $24 each (only $9 per for putter size), I'm ordering
the whole darling collection so that my bison bag will be festooned
with the brightly colored fuzzy heads of little beavers, tigers,
Dalmatians, elephants, mallards, lobsters, gorillas, gophers, pigs
and walrus.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of graphite-shaft clubs, titanium club heads and bison
leather bags hits home before you even tee off. But there are
hidden costs to the after-golf life as well, as revealed in the
same women's golf-related-stuff catalog.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is the $65 polished chrome ``golf iron toilet
paper holder'' and the $20 bathroom plunger (``Lucite handle houses
multi-colored golf tees ... plunger topped with golf ball. Great
idea for tournament prizes.'').
</P>
<P>
   There's one more item that, in all honesty, seems a tad
extravagant. But when I saw it advertised in the same magazine as
the bison leather golf bag, I knew I just had to have: an Orbita
automatic Watchwinder. This nifty little gizmo keeps your
self-winding watch wound while you are busy playing golf, sleeping
or watching golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   It does electrically what your rotating wrist movement does, and
that keeps your ticker ticking. Your watch fits over a little
stubby shaft in a case that is heated ``to maintain your watch at
body temperature to prevent condensation.''
</P>
<P>
   And for $495 _ plus shipping and handling _ you can get an
Orbita single-watch case in fine hardwood with a choice of
lacquered emerald green, pecan, cherry, natural or cobalt blue
finish, or with a see-through glass top.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to have three self-winding watches in need of
constant winding and temperature control in a black suede-lined
box, you can get the triple-head case for a mere $1,095, plus tax
and handling.
</P>
<P>
   I'll have to write for the bison leather golf bag accessories
catalog to see if they offer a compact electrical generator for my
watch-winding case.

`SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' IS OFFENSIVE, BUT LOTS OF LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's crude, rude, lewd and totally politically incorrect but
yet still manages to make us laugh in spite of our better
instincts? It's the new Farrelly brothers movie, ``There's
Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their past big screen irreverences, ``Dumb and Dumber''
and ``Kingpin,'' the brothers waste no time probing the depths of
bad taste and miraculously come up with something to offend just
about every walk of life while keeping everyone in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' suffers from the same
indecisions and irregularities in pace and rhythm of their previous
movies (could a critic dare say they're too ambitious in scope?).
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys swear their film, at heart, is just a love story.
And, though it takes swipes at animals, the handicapped and just
about every other kind of socially conscious cause, it has a
goofily romantic heart, humor and canniness about the terrors of
love and vulnerability _ even though they're all presented in a
worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Cameron Diaz, her real-life beau Matt Dillon, Ben
Stiller and a stable of the usual comedic supporting actors: Lee
Evans, Chris Elliott and the Farellys' ace-in-the-hole, the
game-for-anything actress Lin Shaye, who stole the show from Woody
Harrelson as his decadent landlady in ``Kingpin.'' And she nearly
steals the film again as Magda, Mary's overly tan and lascivious
roommate who dotes on her little dog just a bit too much.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Stroehmann (Stiller) has been in love with the beautiful,
perfect, Mother Teresa-ish _ and out of his league _ Mary Jenson
(Diaz) since high school. He once had a prom date with her but fate
prevailed _ he caught his privates in his tux zipper in a moment of
anxiety and it was then he discovered he was a bleeder.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years have passed and Ted is still in love with the
girl who got away. He hires a seedy, lying insurance private
investigator, Pat Healy (Dillon), to go to Miami and seek Mary out.
But a strange thing happens: Pat finds and falls for Mary, too.
Soon, it seems, everyone's in love with Mary and poor Ted may never
have a second chance with the only woman he's ever cared about.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie depends upon Mary being played by an actress
who has the right amount of allure and humanity. Diaz, who was
charming in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' brings a buoyant, sweet
vulnerability to Mary. It's easy to see why these guys fall all
over themselves to be in her presence. Stiller and Dillon provide
ample backup as her erstwhile suitors and create a true, if odd,
chemistry as opposite sides of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Farrellys clutter up the film with too much
peripheral business, the jokes are so unexpected and ingenious _
hair gel will never be looked at in the same way _ that they more
than compensate for the down time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of the audience at a preview screening were, for
the most part, way past 35 and were laughing themselves silly at
the inanities and anal humor that pervades the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's utterly offensive, ``There's Something About Mary''
manages to have a heart despite its disdain for convention.
Following ``The Truman Show'' and ``Bulworth,'' it may just be the
next movie to turn a tepid entertainment industry on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary. Directed by Peter and Bobby
Farrelly. Written by the Farrellys, Ed Dector, John J. Strauss.
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller. 20th Century Fox. 115
minutes. Rated R for language, nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

ENVOY HEADING TO MEXICO TO FILL LONG-VACANT AMBASSADOR'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A career American diplomat will head to Mexico
City later this month to become the U.S. ambassador, filling a key
position that has been vacant for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Jeffrey Davidow will end an often-rocky interval
of without an ambassador to the country considered to be
Washington's most important foreign policy concern.
</P>
<P>
   The previous envoy, James Jones, resigned in June 1997 to accept
a job as president of the international division of the New
York-based Warnaco Group, which, among other things, manufactures
women's underwear at factories based in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's first choice, former Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld, was blocked by Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Jesse Helms. Helms, R-N.C., objected to his fellow Republican's
more liberal views on social issues and the use of marijuana for
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Burned by the rejection of Weld, Clinton took his time looking
for a second choice before deciding on Davidow, a career diplomat
with experience in several Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow won easy Senate confirmation on June 26. A spokeswoman
said he would be sworn in on July 21 and head to his new posting
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   During the gap without an ambassador, U.S. relations with Mexico
hit bumps that an ambassador might have helped smooth, most
recently with the case of Operation Casablanca, a sweeping
money-laundering sting.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin stunned Mexican officials in late May when they announced
that 22 Mexican bankers had been arrested after the three-year
money-laundering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities soon discovered that at least some
undercover work had been conducted in Mexico, without Mexican
permission, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   An angered President Ernesto Zedillo ordered a full
investigation into possible illegal activities and Foreign Minister
Rosario Green told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that
extradition would be sought for U.S. agents suspected of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress passed a near-unanimous resolution supporting
the investigation and prohibiting the extradition of American
agents.

BOSTON SURGEON LENDS A HELPING HAND TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Children's Hospital chief surgeon Richard Jonas is
changing the way China provides health care.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a team for the US charity Project Hope, and working
hand-in-hand with Chinese government officials, Jonas helped build
the first world-class pediatric hospital in China at a cost of $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting specialists from the United States, Canada, and Europe
will teach Chinese doctors the latest in high-tech medicine at
Shanghai Children's Medical Center, then educate them to train
others, making the hospital the leading national teaching and
referral center. Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the ribbon-cutting
ceremony at the facility late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pediatric cardiac surgeon faces an equally daunting
mission: helping the Chinese make sense out of the nation's
health-care funding. Long a Communist country known for its free
health care, China today is looking to the medical center to raise
enough money from patients to cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's evolved into a market capitalist system without a good
insurance system,'' said Jonas, 46, who continues to serve as a
consultant on the hospital project.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, Shanghai has developed the only health
insurance system in China: it covers children under age 4, and only
for half the cost of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are asking for the rest of the money up front,''
Jonas said. And small employers in China still cannot afford to
provide any insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think health care was free in China,'' he said.
However, the unfortunate reality was ``it was completely free
because there wasn't any to get,'' he explained. Jonas wants to get
people to think of quality health care as a right, and to develop a
comprehensive insurance plan adapted to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, boomtown Shanghai is a wealthy, cultured, and fashionable
city, Jonas said, that historically has been a source of new ideas.
He hopes the rest of China will embrace Shanghai's new direction in
health care and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston after his 11th trip to China for the
ribbon-cutting ceremony last month, Jonas remembers his first call
in 1986 from Project Hope, a 40-year-old health-care charity for
children that spends $100 million a year in 30 countries. Officials
from Hope and the Chinese ministry of health asked him to lead a
group of cardiac surgeons and support staff to teach Chinese
doctors and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   He made the trip. And his group did so well that deaths from
simple surgeries in Shanghai plunged to 3 percent from 25 percent.
The number of surgeries soared to 1,000 from 200 a year. Since
heart problems are the most common life-threatening congenital
problem in children, Jonas said, pediatric hospitals need this
expertise as their cornerstone. The Chinese surgeons soon outgrew
their hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1990s, Chinese officials made land available for a
new hospital, and money for construction and operating costs.
Project Hope pledged architectural and engineering support, and
training for the medical and administrative staff _ about one-third
of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was literally nothing there,'' Jonas said. Steam and
water lines with steady pressure, power supplies free of erratic
surges _ everything had to be custom-designed and built.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a 410,000-square-foot hospital with 250 beds that
can care for 250,000 children a year. Surrounded by 13 landscaped
acres, it offers dental programs, laboratories, imaging centers,
and auxiliary functions.
</P>
<P>
   In China, about 140,000 children are born each year needing the
services the center provides. A waiting list in the thousands has
been shortened because of Jonas's success in training Chinese
surgeons who, he said, have learned quickly and are ready for more
complicated procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I already achieved in China will eclipse what I'll ever
achieve here (in Boston),'' Jonas said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas has practiced or taught medicine in his native Australia,
the United Kingdom, Hungary, Singapore, South America, and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is particularly proud of elevating the status of
nurses in China through the first master's program there. He also
introduced a new focus on families with waiting rooms and
counseling for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, parents had been allowed only one hour a week for
visits with their child after a surgery. ``It was upsetting how
distressed they were,'' Jonas said. ``Now they can support a child
and help it to heal.''

PEOPLE WHO LOVE LUCY STICK TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a granddaughter who is crazy about Lucille Ball. Is
there a fan club she can join?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.M., Stephenville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the most popular is the We Love Lucy Fan Club at Box
56234, Sherman Oaks, CA 91413.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old club costs $20 per year and offers a newsletter,
photographs and membership card, said Tom Watson, the club's
president. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   Another place for those who love Lucy is the Lucy-Desi Museum in
Jamestown, N.Y., Ball's hometown. The museum, which was started two
years ago, includes video clips of ``I Love Lucy,'' items from
Ball's wardrobe and audio remembrances from relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Lucy-Desi Museum, 116 E. Third
St., Jamestown, NY 14701.

``Honeycomb.'' I thought it might be Johnny Horton. Do you know who
it is?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Honeycomb was a No. 1 hit for Jimmie F. Rodgers, a singer
with 18 hits on the charts in the '50s and '60s. All of them are
collected on the 1992 album ``The Best of Jimmie Rodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers is sometimes confused with his namesake, the country
music legend Jimmie Rodgers.

FIDELITY INVESTMENTS EXPANDS PLANS FOR SITE IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE, Texas _ Fidelity Investments has disclosed
dramatically ambitious plans for a Westlake office campus, filing
proposals to build a 3.4 million-square-foot complex that could
accommodate more than 10,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based company aims to double its North Texas work
force, Fidelity officials acknowledged Monday. But they declined to
detail plans for the Westlake campus, which would be one of the
largest corporate campuses in Texas, rivaling Plano's sprawling
Electronic Data Systems campus, which is 3.5 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have specific information to give out. Until we can
review those details with city officials, it's not appropriate for
us to discuss it publicly,'' said Lori Hanes, communications
manager for Fidelity operations in Irving. ``In terms of future
growth, we do anticipate possibly doubling our work force in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations for the Westlake site say the
company is considering relocating some units from Boston and other
out-of-state sites here.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could offer the company tremendous savings, Dallas
economist Peter Malin suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, in an annual report, J.C. Penney stated they were
going to save $30 million a year by moving from New York to
Dallas,'' Malin said. ``If Fidelity is moving people from Boston or
other high-cost areas, you can see how this makes sense for them to
consolidate here near the airport or on a campus designed for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax incentives also might play a role in the company's decision.
Fidelity, the nation's No. 1 manager of mutual funds, has a track
record for sparking tax break competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity officials in Boston said they did not know of any plan
to relocate units to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ... (Fidelity) has been a highly visible corporate
citizen in Boston,'' said Ed O'Donald, a spokesman for Boston's
economic development department. ``I think they will continue to
make their home in Boston. But anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Fidelity, Massachusetts has begun offering tax
relief to mutual fund companies to persuade them to keep and create
jobs in the state. In April, for example, Fidelity's Investments
Institutional Services, which handles investments for institutional
clients, began moving workers to Smithfield, R.I., from locations
in Massachusetts. The company garnered tax breaks, credits against
lease payments and bonds floated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The company has ``had discussions'' about seeking incentives
from Texas for its project, Hanes said, but she declined to
elaborate. The company has also sought aggressive tax breaks from
area taxing entities, most recently approaching Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Fidelity's plans in Westlake are contained in
documents that Fidelity filed with the town as part of its
application for rezoning approvals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plans, the mutual fund giant initially wants to
build 600,000 square feet of offices, then expand it to 3.4 million
square feet by 2003 _ and to 6.8 million square feet by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Two Grapevine Mills malls would fit under the roofs of the
Fidelity project. Still, most of the Fidelity buildings would be no
higher than 5 stories, according to the plans.
</P>
<P>
   That facility is significantly larger than indicated by the
company last week, when it said that it wanted to build a campus in
Westlake to consolidate as many as 2,700 regional employees from
six offices in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   An aerial sketch included with the filing shows the proposed
campus fronting Texas 114 for almost a mile between Precinct Line
Road and Trophy Club Drive. The centerpiece tract would be Westlake
Mayor Scott Bradley's Paigebrooke Farm, with four major office
centers encircling a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which boasts 24,000 employees worldwide, has divisions
in the Metroplex that include retail investor services, brokerage
services and an institutional retirement services company. This
spring, the firm began relocating about 60 employees from its
Kentucky regional division to Irving, where it has a regional
headquarters that employs 2,000. It also has a small office in
Westlake/Southlake at the Solana office park.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is seeking zoning approvals for a 311-acre Westlake
site that it has contracted to buy on Bradley's property and Ross
Perot Jr.'s Circle T Ranch. Westlake set a July 27 public hearing
to consider the proposal, which would allow Fidelity additional
leeway in developing within the town's master plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive deal, valued at $35 million in land purchases
alone, faces significant hurdles with Fort Worth and Roanoke, both
of which claim a stake in Perot's 2,500-acre Circle T Ranch after
its contested disannexation from Westlake last year. In recent
weeks, Fidelity, Perot and Westlake officials have lobbied Fort
Worth and Roanoke to drop their legal claims and cede the ranch
back to Westlake.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has said that Fort Worth makes or breaks the deal. In
return for giving up what is viewed as a billion-dollar economic
plum, Fort Worth officials say they need something ``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Fort Worth officials downplayed the fact that
Fidelity's campus proposal is drastically larger than originally
thought. Assistant City Manager Mike Groomer said he did not expect
the city's position regarding the Circle T to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it materially changes the specifics and the
impact it will have on Fort Worth,'' he said. ``Fundamentally,
we're still talking about the same issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Westlake's appeal, Fidelity has said, is that the town
does not levy a property tax. Still, Fidelity also has received
informal assurances from Carrollton and The Colony to extend
10-year, 90 percent tax abatements on the Austin Ranch, another
site contender.
</P>
<P>
   James Spriggs, director of the Greater Irving/Las Colinas
Chamber of Commerce, said he and Irving Mayor Morris Parrish have
met with Fidelity officials to try to sway them to keep some
divisions in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great corporate citizen,'' Spriggs said. ``We told
them we would like to see what we can do to keep some of the
operation here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa McMillan, Tarrant County's economic development
coordinator, acknowledged that Fidelity had approached Tarrant
County about possible tax incentives during the last two weeks. But
county officials are also uneasy about the litigation and want it
resolved before extending any tax breaks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at what tax incentives are available for the
site,'' McMillan said. ``We're still concerned about the litigation
and want everything accelerated legally as far as the land. We
don't want to recognize one city over another.''

TRY MEETING AUTHORS BEFORE THEIR DECLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having filled more than three decades on the books beat for
three newspapers in turn, I've been privileged to meet many notable
authors. (Privilege may not be the right word; not all authors _
notable or otherwise _ are lovable.)
</P>
<P>
   I name-drop authors for effect, and when someone exclaims of my
having met every author, I say, ``No, I've never met Saul Bellow,''
implying that my authorial dance card is otherwise filled.
</P>
<P>
   Counting perfunctory introductions and handshakes they've
forgotten and I haven't, I've met most American authors who count
with the literati, and a good many English and European types,
several South Americans, a few Asians, two eminent (white)
Africans, one Eskimo.
</P>
<P>
   Before I attained a professional foothold on the periphery of
the book-publishing world, I had lucky encounters with authors of
real consequence. I suspect divine intervention in two instances of
my childhood _ when Scott Fitzgerald bought me a movie magazine a
few days before he died, and when I played baseball catch with
William Faulkner, not knowing who he was.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about those encounters, and of having ogled Raymond
Chandler and James T. Cain dining together. Also noted were
memorable conversations in my days as a UCLA undergraduate _ with
Conrad Aiken, William Carlos Williams and T.S. Eliot in successive
weeks (along with some lesser poets on a prestige series). I also
met John Steinbeck on campus; interviewed Pearl Buck just before
her play ``A Desert Incident'' flopped on Broadway; and I saw
Sinclair Lewis riding in a car with his then-mistress Marcella
Powers, so I've done quite well with Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two elbow-rubbings with authors that most impressed me
at those times were with men almost completely forgotten now,
although both were hot stuff in their coinciding heydays.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ames Williams came to my high school on a career-day-type
event to address students with light speculation on writing
careers. (That was University High in West Los Angeles, perhaps
most famous for having graduated, among others, Elizabeth Taylor
(after me), Ann Blyth and Roddy McDowall (before me), Anne Baxter
and Freddie Bartholomew (with my brother), Linda Darnell (with my
sister), Jane Powell (with me) and so many others; this
name-dropping is getting out of hand.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the wisdom imparted by Ben Ames Williams could be
summed up by the write-of-what-you-know cliche, I was awed by his
celebrity. After all, he had written ``All the Brothers Were
Valiant,'' which had regaled me during an adolescent preoccupation
with seafaring adventure. His ``Leave Her to Heaven'' had been a
whopping bestseller (later a hit movie), and high on the chart at
the time of our encounter was ``House Divided,'' Williams' Civil
War novel that was longer than ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose writing career spanned 35 years, was an
untarnished ``name'' author when he died in 1953 in his 65th year.
Robert Nathan, who left us only a few years ago, well into his 90s,
wrote nonstop for 60 years. (His debut novel, ``Peter Kindred,''
was published in 1919, the same year that introduced Williams with
``All the Brothers Were Valiant.''
</P>
<P>
   When I started college, Robert Nathan still was required reading
for English majors. I enjoyed his prose parables, so for me it was
a big deal when Nathan read from his own works in a convocation.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a vogue of the prewar years, turning out scores of
short novels in simple, direct language when most fiction was
long-winded. Fantasy was a frequent ingredient in Nathan's
parablelike tales, several of which were successfully filmed (''The
Bishop's Wife,'' ``One More Spring,'' ``Portrait of Jennie'' et
al.).
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's novelty value eroded as short novels in simple, direct
language became commonplace. Read his stuff today and wonder why
there ever was a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Sic transit gloria mundi.

`SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' IS OFFENSIVE, BUT LOTS OF LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's crude, rude, lewd and totally politically incorrect but
yet still manages to make us laugh in spite of our better
instincts? It's the new Farrelly brothers movie, ``There's
Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their past big screen irreverences, ``Dumb and Dumber''
and ``Kingpin,'' the brothers waste no time probing the depths of
bad taste and miraculously come up with something to offend just
about every walk of life while keeping everyone in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' suffers from the same
indecisions and irregularities in pace and rhythm of their previous
movies (could a critic dare say they're too ambitious in scope?).
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys swear their film, at heart, is just a love story.
And, though it takes swipes at animals, the handicapped and just
about every other kind of socially conscious cause, it has a
goofily romantic heart, humor and canniness about the terrors of
love and vulnerability _ even though they're all presented in a
worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Cameron Diaz, her real-life beau Matt Dillon, Ben
Stiller and a stable of the usual comedic supporting actors: Lee
Evans, Chris Elliott and the Farellys' ace-in-the-hole, the
game-for-anything actress Lin Shaye, who stole the show from Woody
Harrelson as his decadent landlady in ``Kingpin.'' And she nearly
steals the film again as Magda, Mary's overly tan and lascivious
roommate who dotes on her little dog just a bit too much.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Stroehmann (Stiller) has been in love with the beautiful,
perfect, Mother Teresa-ish _ and out of his league _ Mary Jenson
(Diaz) since high school. He once had a prom date with her but fate
prevailed _ he caught his privates in his tux zipper in a moment of
anxiety and it was then he discovered he was a bleeder.

   Thirteen years have passed and Ted is still in love with the
girl who got away. He hires a seedy, lying insurance private
investigator, Pat Healy (Dillon), to go to Miami and seek Mary out.
But a strange thing happens: Pat finds and falls for Mary, too.
Soon, it seems, everyone's in love with Mary and poor Ted may never
have a second chance with the only woman he's ever cared about.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie depends upon Mary being played by an actress
who has the right amount of allure and humanity. Diaz, who was
charming in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' brings a buoyant, sweet
vulnerability to Mary. It's easy to see why these guys fall all
over themselves to be in her presence. Stiller and Dillon provide
ample backup as her erstwhile suitors and create a true, if odd,
chemistry as opposite sides of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Farrellys clutter up the film with too much
peripheral business, the jokes are so unexpected and ingenious _
hair gel will never be looked at in the same way _ that they more
than compensate for the down time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of the audience at a preview screening were, for
the most part, way past 35 and were laughing themselves silly at
the inanities and anal humor that pervades the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's utterly offensive, ``There's Something About Mary''
manages to have a heart despite its disdain for convention.
Following ``The Truman Show'' and ``Bulworth,'' it may just be the
next movie to turn a tepid entertainment industry on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary. Directed by Peter and Bobby
Farrelly. Written by the Farrellys, Ed Dector, John J. Strauss.
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller. 20th Century Fox. 115
minutes. Rated R for language, nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

   &UR; FEATURES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RYE-BREAD (Berlin) _ The Germans have an unequalled passion for
traditional ryes, whether tan, brown or almost black. Most of them
have a malty, slightly sour taste. The best of them are moist when
fresh. When you bite into a dense, delectable slice, you have a
sense that you are eating something primeval, something undying,
something expressive of its origins, like honest wine. By R.W.
Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BARBEQUE (New York) _ What do Kansas City, Chicago and
Oakland have that New York does not? Great barbecue, for one. When
it comes to real barbecue _ meat cooked ever-so-slowly over a low
wood fire until it is imbued with the tantalizing aroma and flavor
of smoke _ these cities thoroughly outdo New York.This is a
crushing fact for New York barbecue lovers. Barbecue may be the
most fetishized of all foods, inspiring countless books, odes and
arguments in which otherwise mild-mannered people rise into
passionate lathers over particular meats, methods, sauces and
sources. But on New York's deficiency they all agree. And so comes
the forlorn question: Why can't you get good barbecue in New York?
By Eric Asimov.

   NY-BOATHOUSE-RESTAURANT (New York) _ As the sun is setting the
final notes of music slide off the dock, skip across the water and
disappear into the trees. A swan glides into view, tracing a
graceful path through the last of the light. Birds swoop and call;
a gondola appears on the horizon.... ``Get a grip,'' says an inner
voice, ``Have you had too much wine? It's only Central Park.'' When
the band is playing on a warm summer evening it is easy to fall
under the spell of Park View, the new restaurant at the Loeb
Boathouse. By Ruth Reichl.

<P>
   PIGS-EATING-WELL (Undated) _ ``Ka-BOSS, ka-BOSS, ka-BOSS.'' On a
sunny summer morning last week, Annie Farrell was using her
all-purpose animal call to round up Large Black piglets. The four
Large Blacks, three sows and a boar, came readily, thinking there
might be some food; the six piglets were having too much fun
foraging. ``They are wonderful pigs, good natured, great mothers,
very protective,'' she said, then stopped herself before adding:
``I don't want to get mushy about them because they are the best
eating.'' By Marian Burros.

THE POLICE FIND BIKES CAN BE A COP'S BEST FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITT  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALLSTON SPA, N.Y. _ When he was a child, Officer Michael J.
DeMartino loved riding his rust-colored Schwinn 10-speed. He never
dreamed then that he would have a career that enables him to patrol
on a black-and-gray 18-speed Smith &AMP; Wesson mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the bike, I can stay in the shadows and observe drug use
or underage drinking,'' said DeMartino, a police officer in this
upstate New York village.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of police departments throughout the county are
using bikes to help fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officers like the bikes for several reasons, including low
maintenance costs and stealth. The police say they make arrests
that are not possible during a car or foot patrol because they can
sneak up on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Officers say bikes are fun. Though they risk being taken less
seriously while furiously pedaling after someone, they say they are
more accessible to the public when out of the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 police departments nationwide use bicycles, an
experiment that started when Seattle began using them in 1987,
according to John A. Fox, state instructor for the Law Enforcement
Bicycle Association. LEBA trainers annually conduct 2,000 40-hour
bicycle patrol safety courses for police departments in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some chiefs look at bikes as toys, or fun time,'' Fox said.
``It's not a fad anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dominelli, executive director of the New York State
Association of Chiefs of Police, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody thinks the bike is a toy, they ought to put that
guy on the bike and let him see if it's a toy,'' Dominelli said.
``It's a hard job. And, you sit on that seat all day long, you know
you've been doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Albany bike Officer John L. Monte says that his arrest numbers
are higher since he began riding. ``Walking, I might do 15 arrests
per month; now on the bike, it's up to 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that bicycles bring officers closer to the people they
are supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate 20 times more public contact for a bike cop versus
a car patrol; five times more than for a foot patrol officer,'' Fox
said. ``Officers add a heightened sense of hearing and smell to
their skill set, senses usually cut off in an air-conditioned
car.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albany police began their 12-bike program 10 months ago,
according to spokeswoman Lt. Lauren Signer. She said that bikes
fill a niche in fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a recent pursuit of a young male on a bike who had
cocaine packaged for sale in Arbor Hill,'' she said. ``Bicycles
give us the ability to deal with these criminals on their own
level. We're matching them in their mode of transport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bike is in between the beat and the car,'' Signer said,
adding that she enjoys the questions residents put to her officers.
``They ask, `How fast can the bike go?' They think it's got a
secret rocket on it or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But riding a bike can be dangerous, even for a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some minor knee swelling, and was back on the bike two
weeks later,'' said Monte, who collided with a sheriff's car last
April. He still prefers doing his tours on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can cover my whole zone six to 12 times per shift,'' said
Monte, who patrols Albany's South End.
</P>
<P>
   Police bikes with accessories, like helmets, uniforms, first-aid
kits and police lights for the handlebars, average $1,200 each;
unadorned police mountain bikes cost about $600.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Kelly of the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., department
says the program is especially suited to his small community
outside Albany. ``The bikes have proven to be unbelievably flexible
in getting somewhere faster than a car, into the one-way streets
and narrow alleys that the city is full of.''
</P>
<P>
   Bike patrols give rise to unusual war stories: Kelly said he
once pulled over a Greyhound bus while on his two-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost hit me. The riders were laughing and I was getting
thumbs up from the back of the bus as I wrote the ticket,'' Kelly
said.

THERE'S SOMETHING DREADFUL ABOUT `MARY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you laughed at the little Benji dog in the full body cast in
the trailers for ``There's Something About Mary,'' you might find a
few more laughs in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might get hit by a car and wind up in a full
body cast yourself _ a situation certainly preferable to shelling
out your hard-earned cash to sit through this dreck.
</P>
<P>
   Not that directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly have much of a track
record to recommend themselves. They found an unlikely cash cow in
the then relatively unknown Jim Carrey _ who managed to propel the
colossally stupid ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (1994) to box-office success _
but faltered with their next effort, 1996's ``Kingpin,'' proving
that Woody Harrelson was more natural-born killer than comic.
</P>
<P>
   The brotherly boneheads have once again surrounded themselves
with an impressive variety of talent _ Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon,
Lee Evans, even the pretty-without-being-empty-headed Cameron Diaz
_ but that only succeeds in making audiences wonder what possessed
these people to appear in this garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller plays Ted, a high school dork whose gallant effort to
protect a mentally challenged youngster from a bully is rewarded
with a prom date with the boy's sister Mary (Diaz) _ who just
happens to be the school hottie.
</P>
<P>
   His dream date turns nightmarish when he manages to zip himself
up while using the facilities. The bit is actually funny for a
while, with Stiller subjected to a parade of wincing adults trying
to figure out how to undo the damage. But as there's no room for
subtlety in the Farrellys' world, you can count on a close-up shot
of the self-inflicted injury _ and that's actually one of the more
tasteful gags.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward more than a decade, and Ted's still pining for his
now long-lost love. Egged on by his ``happily married'' buddy Dom
(Chris Elliott), Ted hires a sleazy private eye to track her down.
Dillon does the honor, tracing her to Miami, but then tries to
sabotage things when he falls for her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this is par for the course when it comes to Mary (there's
something about her, remember?). It turns out she's got an entire
platoon of obsessed suitors/stalkers who'll do or say anything to
have her.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the Farrellys will do or say anything to make you
laugh at these idiots _ anything, that is, except stooping to, say,
wit. Even when they accidentally stumble onto something funny _
i.e. the attack on Stiller by the aforementioned Benji dog _ the
Farrellys' sledgehammer approach manages to bludgeon the bit long
after the laughs have expired.
</P>
<P>
   There are jokes at the expense of the disabled, mentally
retarded, women, gays and, of course, man's best friend. And for
anyone keeping tabs on the Farrelly scorecard of bodily function
jokes _ ``Mary'' should fill out the list nicely. There's enough
crass toilet humor here to make the entire run of Comedy Central's
``South Park'' seem like it was scripted by Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that will stop the maturity-challenged members of the
moviegoing public from flocking to the film and laughing themselves
hoarse at this nonsense. As always, there's no accounting for taste
_ or lack thereof.

GRAND OLD BEACONS DOT COLORFUL COASTAL ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With photo)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUANITA WELSH AND JUDY HENSEL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An East Coast vacation to Connecticut easily can accommodate a
detour to Maine and a sampling of at least two of its treasures:
lobsters and lighthouses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Arizona, where a 2{-hour drive just gets you into another
county, in the East that drive time will take you through half of
Connecticut, in and out of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and on
into Maine.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to take the scenic route to see as many lighthouses
as possible in the short time we had.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 95 heads north toward Augusta, Maine, so, to follow
the coastline, we spent most of our traveling time on two-lane
country roads. U.S. 1, the scenic and best choice, took us right
through the center of quaint little towns such as Damariscotta,
Wiscasset, York, Ogunquit and Kennebunk.
</P>
<P>
   We thought we had pretty good maps with directions to the
lighthouses, but we discovered they were vague. We would have saved
some time if we'd invested in a guidebook with specific directions.
</P>
<P>
   Our first lighthouse sighting turned out to be one for shoppers,
not ship pilots. It was the Lighthouse Depot in Wells, Maine. This
shop screamed ``Stop! See!'' and because we were on a lighthouse
quest, there was no way we could pass it up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge store packed to its second-story rafters and filled
with lighthouse stuff: hand-signed replicas, souvenirs, lighthouse
models, clothing, magnets, books, videos, artwork, toys and
collectibles. They even had 6-foot ornamental lawn lighthouses. It
would take days just to get through it all, but our time was
limited, so we were off to see the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Our first real-thing sighting was the Cape Neddick Light in
York. It also is called Nubble Light, referring to the rocky
island, the Nubble, where it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Nubble Light, which was built in 1879, is the southernmost of
Maine's many lights. The tower is 41 feet, flashes red every six
seconds and can be seen for 13 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we had to settle for a view of this island beauty
from afar because there is no visitor access to the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest lighthouse on the Maine coast is the Portland Head
Light in Fort Williams Park, Cape Elizabeth. It was built in 1791
under orders from President George Washington. It is 72 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   If you have time to see only one lighthouse, this is the one.
</P>
<P>
   It has everything: a beautiful lightkeeper's home, massive
lighthouse and a fabulous view of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   We stood at the edge of the rocky cliffs and watched cruise
ships sail past on their way into Portland's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Until last December, it was possible to rent the second floor of
the lightkeeper's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the last residents' lease was up, it was decided
not to rent it because the museum and museum shop needed it for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Another lighthouse stop was Pemaquid Point, which was 16 miles
from the U.S. 1 turnoff from Damariscotta. However, we easily were
distracted by the many antiques and craft shops, such as The Ducks
in New Harbor, along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the small, cottage-style store was a charming
woman who sold an array of enchanting wooden toys, quilts and dolls
_ all handmade by her family members.
</P>
<P>
   Pemaquid Point Light is breathtaking. The tower is only 38 feet
tall, but its placement on a rocky ledge gives it a focal plane of
79 feet. Pemaquid tower flashes a white, 11,000-candlepower light
beam every six seconds and can be seen up to 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It was commissioned by John Quincy Adams and built in 1827.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Maine coastline is rocky, but the rocks at Pemaquid
were massive. There are signs warning visitors that hiking is done
at your own risk, and could be fatal. Lives have been lost in the
crashing waves. It is a risk, but it's worth the view. Waves
crashed onto the rocks with a fierce pounding, even during low
tide.
</P>
<P>
   There was a small gift shop and restaurant with a
top-of-the-cliffs view of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Our last lighthouse stop was Owls Head Light, West Penobscot
Bay, at the entrance to Rockland Harbor. We were hesitant about
pursuing this one because the pavement ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the dirt parking lot, we had about a
quarter-mile walk beyond that, through the woods and along the
cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   The station was built in 1825 and its first keeper, Isaac
Sterns, made $350 a year. It is now a United States Coast Guard
residence, and although the grounds are open to the public, the
home is not.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty feet tall, the lighthouse was stubbier than the previous
lighthouses we'd seen, but was just as intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the steep stairway leading to the light is a sign
warning visitors of an active foghorn: ``Danger, physical harm will
occur past this point if the alarm sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   We spent two nights near Camden, a charming New England coastal
town. Large, two-story, Victorian-style homes that have been
converted to bed-and-breakfasts line the densely wooded streets.
Downtown Camden is jammed with gift shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Camden Harbor that we satisfied our hunger for local
lobster.
</P>
<P>
   We found the perfect seafood restaurant on Bayview Landing
Wharf, one of three wharves on the harbor, at Bayview Lobster.
</P>
<P>
   It was a no-frills place but had exactly what we were seeking:
picnic tables outside so we could enjoy the view and, of course,
delicious lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Although we had time to visit only half a dozen lighthouses,
there are more than 62 to visit along the Maine coastline. They are
truly sights to behold. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; RED LOBSTER, WHITE TRASH AND THE BLUE LAGOON &QL; 
 &UR; Joe Queenan (Hyperion, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Queenan managed for 14 years to avoid seeing the musical
``Cats''. Then he threw in the towel and attended a matinee. He
discovered that ``Cats'' was bad. Very, very bad. ``Cats'' was what
``Grease'' would look like if all the cast members dressed up like
KISS. He thought ``Cats'' would be the low point in his
experimental foray into popular culture, which he'd decided to make
after years of basking in urbane sophistication as a contributing
writer to ``GQ,'' ``George,'' ``Playboy'' and ``Movieline.'' Then
he bought a Michael Bolton record, and discovered that Bolton was
bad. Very, very bad. Bolton was ``Mandy Patinkin squared.'' Then
Queenan read ``The Horse Whisperer.'' Then he ate at Red Lobster.
This is his memoir of his time in America's cultural wasteland,
where he experienced, among other things, the Osmond Brothers,
Planet Hollywood, a Renaissance Faire, Taco Bell, ``Baywatch'' and
Yanni. It wasn't pretty, but it sure is funny. With his days in pop
culture over, would Queenan go back? ``I would rather spend 10
years in the Black Hole of Calcutta,'' he says. ``Twenty, even.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CAUGHT IN THE NET &QL; 
 &UR; Kimberly S. Young (Wiley, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   They don't know how old you are, they don't know how attractive
you are, and they can't tell whether you're shy or lonely. On the
Internet, you can be anything you want to be, for an audience of
people who are just as eager and invisible as you are. Proof of the
Internet's allure lies in the fact that there is a Center for
On-Line Addiction, which offers help to people who are compulsive
presences in chat rooms, have endless appetites for interactive
games and write e-mail by the hour. Here, Young, who founded the
center and is a psychology professor at the University of
Pittsburgh, offers advice on recognizing Internet addiction and
strategies for weaning yourself from your computer. If none of it
works, she invites you to write to her (ksy(at)pitt.edu) and tell
her all about it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FACES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: MASTER PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THEIR
WORK &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Edward Harris (Abbeville, $45)
</P>
<P>
   This collection of work by 20 extraordinary photographers began
as a series of interviews done by Harris for ``Camera &AMP; Darkroom''
magazine. Each section opens with Harris' portrait of the
photographer (those of Annie Leibovitz and the late Alfred
Eisenstaedt are and were the artists' favorite pictures of
themselves). There are five signature works by each of the 20,
along with their thoughts on photography and anecdotes about how
the images were captured. Included are Andreas Feininger, Mary
Ellen Mark, Horace Bristol, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Eve Arnold,
Helmut Newton, Peter Lindbergh, Marc Riboud, Carl Mydans, Joe
Rosenthal, Gordon Parks, Jean-Philippe Charbonnier, Edouard Boubat,
Eikoh Hosoe, Herb Ritts, Sebastiao Salgado, Jeanloup Sieff and
Elliott Erwitt. With an introduction by Vicki Goldberg, photography
critic for the New York Times. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; YELLOWSTONE AND THE BIOLOGY OF TIME &QL; 
 &UR; Mary Meagher and Douglas B. Houston (Oklahoma, $80)
</P>
<P>
   Meagher and Houston are retired research biologists who set out
more than 20 years ago to document landscape changes at Yellowstone
National Park by using repeat photography. They searched out
locations captured by early photographers (more than half of the
original images were taken before 1901) and rephotographed them in
the same place, and as near as possible to the same date and time
of day. In many cases, the authors made two sets of photographs of
each site, in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, to capture the
effects of the great fires of 1988. Their purpose was scientific:
to give some perspective on the vegetation changes that had
occurred historically in the park. But there's much more to
discover in these simple pictures, including a sense of how much
time is required to truly alter a landscape, and how ephemeral the
human presence has been in a place like Yellowstone. Roads and
ranches have disappeared, along with the men in cowboy hats who
roamed the grasslands on horseback. But not much else has changed.
On the cover is a 1971 photo of Minerva Terrace at Mammoth Hot
Springs, looking northwest to Sepulcher Mountain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; IDIOM SAVANT: SLANG AS IT IS SLUNG &QL; 
 &UR; Jerry Dunn (Owl, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   According to Dunn, roller-coaster enthusiasts use the term
``fine decapo'' to describe the sensation that you are about to
have your head knocked off, ``usually by a beam or tunnel,'' and
``green alert'' as a warning that someone is getting sick on a
ride. Aren't you glad you asked? Prison inmates call a note
received from another inmate a ``kite,'' and meat served in the
prison mess hall ``Mr. Ed.'' Other ``subcultures'' in this book
include bird-watchers, pot smokers, sky divers, jugglers, ice
skaters, musicians, bowlers, gamblers, FBI agents, pickpockets,
skiers and fishermen, all of which, it seems, have been busy
developing their own little caches of slang. We, personally, don't
believe it _ we have a firsthand knowledge of volleyball, but
recognized few of the terms Dunn attributes to its players. Maybe
that's because he researched his book ``live on the Internet,''
which means submissions came from people with unproven expertise
and lots of time on their hands. &QL;

MYSTERY ALSO EXPLORES PUZZLE OF LOVING  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
The Chimney Sweeper's Boy 
Barbara Vine (Harmony Books, $24) 
 
 By LELA STROMENGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does a wife do when, within weeks of the death of her
husband of 34 years, she finds out she has never known his real
name? Real names are pivotal in ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy,'' a
book written under an assumed one.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Barbara Vine is not so much the pseudonym as the alter
ego of veteran British crime writer Ruth Rendell. The publisher of
the Vine books _ this is the ninth _ makes no attempt to conceal
the authorship of Rendell, whose long line of prize-winning
riddlers and thrillers last year won her the Grand Master Award of
the Mystery Writers of America. The ``more feminine, less bossy''
Vine was not created for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than another name; it's another identity,'' Rendell
told the New York Times in 1995. ``Once I was Barbara Vine, I could
do something else.'' Compounded from Rendell's middle name and her
great-grandmother's maiden name, Barbara Vine is the second self of
a woman whose understanding of the magic of names is profound and
who knows what it is to live by the power of language.
</P>
<P>
   So does Gerald Candless, who, though he dies on page 14, is the
central figure of ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy.'' Gerald is that
lucky rarity, a serious writer whose books sell well. He lives in
Devon by the seaside (a beautifully realized and concretely
rendered seaside) with his deeply estranged wife, Ursula. The two
poles of his known life are his distinguished literary career and
his fierce love for their two daughters, ``my girls.''
</P>
<P>
   His girls, on whom he has lavished everything he can think of to
give, adore him in turn, the three forming a charmed circle outside
which the loving and unloved Ursula stands alone, her emotional
life co-opted and her confidence shattered by this brilliant,
ruthless man as by a force of nature.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald has a fatal heart attack at 71, Ursula, at 57, is
left to pick up the strands of what life he has left her, and his
girls _ university lecturer Sarah and the poignantly named Hope, a
lawyer _ to mourn their wonderful ``Daddy.'' Then Sarah, in
researching a biography of him, discovers that Gerald Candless was
not his name and that there are no records of his life before 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery, in a sense the eternal one of a writer's identity
and relationships, is approached through writing: newspaper
clippings, Sarah's memoir, Gerald's 18 novels, the great works of
the past. The intensely bookish Vine/Rendell's devotion to
literature often surfaces in intensely bookish characters. In
Rendell's ``Make Death Love Me,'' a pair of lovers find each other
through a shared passion for Lytton Strachey's ``Eminent
Victorians.''
</P>
<P>
   Less innocuously, the very young Ursula is drawn to Gerald
partly because she sees him as Mr. Rochester to her Jane Eyre.
After their children are born, he puts them to bed with stories
spun from bits of Blake's ``Songs of Innocence.'' Ghostlike lines
from Shelley and Herbert haunt the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But the dominant writer in this book is ever the enigmatic and
fascinating Gerald: Ozymandias, fallen now but in his life a
colossus. His novels supply quotations for the chapter headings and
their plots offer clues to his own secret story. He has lived
through books, as many authors have done. But what are we to read
into that?
</P>
<P>
   Literature may be a mirror held up to life, an enrichment of
life, even a substitute for living, but it cannot be life itself.
It can't love us back. And loving, for Vine's characters, is what
life is about. At the core of ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy'' is a
complex of shifting views of love, ``being in love'' and sex.
</P>
<P>
   A girl falls for a romantic fantasy and has to live with a real
man. A father whose holiest grail is family affection turns a
daughter into a walking contradiction of the axiom that you can't
spoil a child with too much love. A highly sexual and highly
conventional wife lives with a husband who sleeps in a separate
room and locks his door at night. A grandfather confesses, ``I want
to be in love. I want to be possessed and obsessed by it. I want
the sky to change color and the sun to shine all the time. . . .''
A fiftyish Lothario strives compulsively for conquests he doesn't
really enjoy. A pair of casual acquaintances conduct a sizzling
affair by meeting in public to feign animosity, trading insults and
snubs, then leaving separately to consummate their psychodrama in
secret. In this book, people lose their souls through anonymous
sexual encounters, their hearts through mere proximity to anyone
halfway suitable.
</P>
<P>
   All these choices, insofar as they are choices, are made
consciously by intelligent adults, as such choices are made in the
real world every day. The reasons behind them, the moral conflicts
raised by them, the consequences to the chooser and the chosen,
reflect the great conundrum everyone faces sooner or later: the
puzzle of loving.
</P>
<P>
   Vine/Rendell has been this problem's novelist laureate, often
presenting characters so swept up in the maelstrom of some demented
love that it draws them into madness or death. In ``Gallowglass,''
Vine has one point out that ``passion'' doesn't mean what people
think it does. ``It means suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Chimney Sweeper's Boy,'' she lowers the stakes of the
conundrum game, making it more like the one most people play. But
perhaps most people don't think about it clearly enough. For that
reason, Vine deserves full credit for presenting it with clarity
and impact.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, aside from a gentle suggestion that love grows in the
light of knowledge, she doesn't present any solution to it. There
are some mysteries even Ruth Rendell couldn't unravel. &QL;

HUMORIST ROY BLOUNT JR. REVEALS SAD ROOTS OF HIS COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Blount Jr. likes to tell a little story about a conversation
that took place one night over dinner with friends, one of whom was
a fellow humorist. The humorist was bemoaning _ at great length
and, as Blount points out, ``to his own considerable morose
satisfaction'' _ some distressing thing that had happened to him.
One of the women at the table listened for awhile, then said, ``But
I read what you wrote about that! And it sounded like so much
fun!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the humorist solemnly. ``But now I'm among
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Roy Blount. Among friends. He has written a memoir, ``Be
Sweet'' (Knopf, $24), and his fans have taken it home and read it
and somewhere past the early pages they've realized that it is not
entirely what they expected it to be. The book is funny, yes, but
as many reviewers have pointed out by now, it is also sad. And
there is Blount, nodding from the pages, confident of his audience
because where else but with his readers would he be so surely among
friends?
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Be Sweet'' is about Blount's difficult relationship
with his mother, Louise Blount, and how his consequent
self-loathing _ ``sefflo'' to him and other humorists who claim to
suffer the same affliction _ is at the heart of his efforts to make
people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it's something nobody else has done exactly, to go
head-on and write about why you're funny,'' he says from his
Massachusetts home. ``It's sort of the last taboo, and I was
lookin' around for somethin' to violate. Maybe everybody's got a
childhood book they're always writing bits and pieces of. In my
case, it was as much my mother's book as mine. She was always
alluding, with delicious horror, to her childhood. It was the
backdrop to everything we did as children because there was always
something terrible that she'd lived through that was worse than
anything we could ever complain about.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dark side is her dark side. I've been bouncing off that all
my life and I figured it was time to dig down into it, the source
of my humor. Being funny is just a way of relieving fear and
distress and doubt. I don't know. I guess the more you talk about
it, the sillier it sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, 56, speaks in a big, deep voice, with a drawl _ George
V. Higgins described it as an ``almost caloric Southern accent
coagulating like a big warm muddy river choked with catfish in the
sun'' _ that makes him sound friendly even when he's talking about
self-loathing and matricidal guilt. Still, explanations for this
book do not come easy to him. No sooner are the words out of his
mouth than he starts to squirm over them. He takes them back; he
tries again; he abandons a sentence before he is halfway through
it. Often _ mostly when he is talking directly about his mother _
he peters out altogether with a weary ``I don't know'' or ``Oh
God.'' You can't see him over the phone, but he sounds like he's
holding his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a failure of eloquence brought on by the memory of a
formidable and unhappy woman. More likely it's the sound of Blount
editing on his feet. As his fans know, the fine points of language
delight him (it galls him that Knopf removed a hyphen between the
words ``sweet'' and ``potato'' in one of his favorite sentences in
his book, a reference to the ``sweet potato-colored dirt'' of
Decatur, Ga.). It's why he is so driven, he says ``to rehabilitate
the spicy limerick'':
</P>
<P>
   (begin itals) ``Come up and see me,'' said Flower, &QL; 
And then, when I entered her bower, &QL; 
``The shower _ I'm in it _ &QL; 
Just give me a minute...'' &QL; 
I saw her and raised her an hour. (end itals)
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to write light verse,'' he says. ``You can play around
with it and hold it in your hand and fiddle with the commas. That's
the best part. The fiddling. The hard part is to get some kind of
macro-sense of what I'm doing. I mope around and put it off and
gather it in my head. It's regarding the project from afar that's
tough. Once you get into it, it's like killin' snakes _ there's
plenty to do, you start reacting and it's great in the middle of
all that chaos to feel that you've written a really nice sentence
that you can linger over and polish.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Blount has written 13 books and contributed to many
more. He has freelanced for more than 100 publications, written a
screenplay (for ``Larger Than Life,'' starring his friend, Bill
Murray), played bit parts in movies and toured with a band of
writer-musicians that included Stephen King, Dave Barry and Amy Tan
(Blount's big vocal number was ``Wild Thing''). He has appeared on
talk shows _ Johnny Carson once leaned over to him during a
commercial break and confided, unnecessarily, that ``so often,
comedy is rooted in sadness.'' He has been married and divorced
twice, is a father and a grandfather and has survived at least a
decade of what he calls ``serial fizzled relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   With all of this has come a certain wisdom. If his way with
women has not improved much, he is at least beginning to understand
why it is such a struggle (he is incapable of being a sensitive
man, which he defines as one who ``gets a sense of what a woman
wants him to sense, and then pretends to sense it''). He calls
himself ``a jack of various trades and a fool by profession'' and
has learned to take career blips in stride, as when his ``Men's
Journal'' column was canceled by a new publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Parthenon proves,'' Blount wrote, ``columns come and
columns go.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is trying to make peace, long after their deaths, with
his mother and father. ``Be Sweet'' is really a statement to them,
and he knows that it's likely to set them spinning in their graves.
But he has come to believe that ``maybe people in their graves like
to turn over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing this I felt like I was having conversations
with the reader that I'd wanted to have with my parents,'' he says.
``Trying to find a way to tell them how I felt about them without
holding back anything. Without being too sweet. Seems the only way
to tell the truth is to mix some sourness in so that it tastes
real. It was a great relief to me, but also sad to be saying it
now, after they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he will admit: If his mother's unhappiness was the
root of his humor, she was also the force behind his talent with
the written word.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a delight in language and figures of speech, even
though she didn't think of herself as a literary person,'' he says.
``She used memorable phrases and said memorable things, and
instilled an affection for language and provided a certain amount
of provocation so that I'd take a challenging attitude toward
language. I don't love it in any soft-hearted way.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did his literary heroes, S.J. Perelman, Mark Twain and
Robert Benchley, or do present-day friends like Garrison Keillor,
Calvin Trillin or Dave Barry. When they're together, Blount says,
``We talk about our children. We talk about the same things other
people do. But we also tell each other jokes. You do immediately
have something in common. And you like to make each other laugh. Or
at least smile. Humorists don't laugh a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That is left to the people who read their books. When Blount was
a boy, he had no less than three imaginary friends. They're long
gone now, but he doesn't miss them because, he says, he has his
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' he says. ``Well, maybe it's not always so great,
because sometimes your wife wishes you were talking to her instead
of the reader. But you assume that there's some sort of ideal
person out there who is gonna understand what you say. You can get
up and talk in front of an audience and get immediate feedback and
a sense of what is funny. But writing is between you and the
reader. An inner thing. You're trying to lance a different kind of
boil. That's a pretty analogy, isn't it?''

CNN CAN'T GET OUT OF THE HOT SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Cable News Network, its tail lodged firmly
between its legs, continues to be battered and bruised.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, CNN broadcast a story about the Pentagon's use of
nerve gas on U.S. defectors in Laos; a week ago, CNN News Group
Chairman Tom Johnson filed an on-air apology retracting the report
for lack of evidence to support its claims.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the walls have shaken at the Atlanta-based network,
considered one of the most-watched _ and most-credible _ news
operations in the world. But that shake-up doesn't compare with the
credibility whipping it has been taking here.
</P>
<P>
   With little other news trickling from this semiannual gathering
of the country's television critics, issues of TV news ethics and
anchor responsibilities have dominated the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The session conducted by Turner Broadcasting unquestionably
became the tour's hot ticket, even overshadowing Showtime's
``Lolita,'' the controversial reincarnation of Vladimir Nabokov's
tale of a 50ish pedophile and his tragic love affair with a
12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   With journalists wanting to hear from Ted Turner, founder and
brainchild of CNN and now the vice chairman of CNN parent Time
Warner, a packed house waded through three hours of presentations
(CNN's mammoth 24-part documentary ``Cold War,'' movies and
specials on TBS and TNT, the latest animated heroes from the
Cartoon Network). Finally, Turner leaped from his seat to take the
podium, jokingly saying, ``I'll move over here ... make an easier
target standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's move got a huge laugh from the audience, nicely slicing
through an atmosphere tinged with tension and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   At each press tour there's a whipping boy (or girl, in the case
of ABC's formerly beleaguered entertainment chief Jamie Tarses),
picked apart like carrion by hungry hyenas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, that means anyone with the slightest connection to
CNN has been drilled about their thoughts on the channel. And it's
not just about whether the news operation was at fault but rather
how damaging is this to this country's social fabric as we know it?
Pack journalism takes on the mood of McCarthyism. So, where were
you when CNN ran that story?
</P>
<P>
   During one early morning panel, news correspondent Jack Smith
wasn't in his seat two minutes before reminding us that he is not
the CNN producer Jack Smith fired along with two other producers
supervising the nerve gas story. (That Smith and colleague April
Oliver were canned after refusing to resign; executive producer
Pamela Hill handed in her resignation.)
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News correspondent and Vietnam veteran, Smith was
discussing The Learning Channel's ``Vietnam: The Soldiers' Story,''
a riveting documentary about Vietnam told from the soldiers' point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story when I heard about it didn't pass even the most
elementary journalistic smell tests,'' Smith said, explaining why
there were so many objections to the report.
</P>
<P>
   A cable chief, requesting anonymity because of his personal
relationship with the CNN brass, said, ``We always get burned when
we rush to put something on the air or publish something to meet an
artificial deadline.'' The artificial deadline in this case was the
June 7 debut of ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' a joint venture between
electronic and print-news gathering machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is good but not at the sacrifice of accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The emerging subplot is whether a field reporter for a news
organization such as CNN bears enough knowledge of a story to
accept the ultimate responsibility should the story prove false.
Peter Arnett said he narrated the report and asked questions fed to
him by producers, but that was the extent of his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that putting a star reporter on to act like they were
the person that investigated the story, that's a bad practice,''
said Turner, who is now promising sweeping changes at CNN. ``That
whoever the person that did the story and did the research should
appear on camera rather than getting some blow-dried news anchor in
New York to try and persuade people that he or she was on the
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Former CNN correspondent Arthur Kent, who rose to fame for his
Gulf War coverage as the ``Scud Stud,'' found himself answering
more questions about CNN than the ``History Undercover'' series
he's fronting for The History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's helped explain to the viewing public something
very important,'' Kent said. ``That there is more than just the
on-air journalism in the task of news information and gathering,
writing and reportage.''

   RYE-BREAD (Berlin) _ The Germans have an unequalled passion for
traditional ryes, whether tan, brown or almost black. Most of them
have a malty, slightly sour taste. The best of them are moist when
fresh. When you bite into a dense, delectable slice, you have a
sense that you are eating something primeval, something undying,
something expressive of its origins, like honest wine. By R.W.
Apple Jr.

<P>
   NY-BARBEQUE (New York) _ What do Kansas City, Chicago and
Oakland have that New York does not? Great barbecue, for one. When
it comes to real barbecue _ meat cooked ever-so-slowly over a low
wood fire until it is imbued with the tantalizing aroma and flavor
of smoke _ these cities thoroughly outdo New York.This is a
crushing fact for New York barbecue lovers. Barbecue may be the
most fetishized of all foods, inspiring countless books, odes and
arguments in which otherwise mild-mannered people rise into
passionate lathers over particular meats, methods, sauces and
sources. But on New York's deficiency they all agree. And so comes
the forlorn question: Why can't you get good barbecue in New York?

   NY-BOATHOUSE-RESTAURANT (New York) _ As the sun is setting the

graceful path through the last of the light. Birds swoop and call;
a gondola appears on the horizon.... ``Get a grip,'' says an inner
voice, ``Have you had too much wine? It's only Central Park.'' When
the band is playing on a warm summer evening it is easy to fall

Large Blacks, three sows and a boar, came readily, thinking there
might be some food; the six piglets were having too much fun
foraging. ``They are wonderful pigs, good natured, great mothers,
very protective,'' she said, then stopped herself before adding:
``I don't want to get mushy about them because they are the best
eating.'' By Marian Burros.

AT CHILDREN'S INN, `MOMS' MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ Caring for a sick child is enough to run many
parents ragged, physically and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Children's Inn, dealing with serious medical problems
is just part of the daily routine. And the problems are no reason
to cancel a trip to South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a few clothes and a lot of toys,'' Kathleen Kean said
before setting off in a van last week with the six children who
live at the Children's Inn foster home.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary is flexible and the medicine chest well-stocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, will we have to bring pillows and that sort of stuff?''
asked Thomas, a rambunctious 4-year-old with spina bifida, a
congenital defect of the spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we will,'' said Marilyn Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Haider and Kean are the licensed caregivers at the home located
on the grounds of the Benedictine monastery in this community
northwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we went to South Dakota, we got to New Braunfels
(Texas) and everybody was hungry and asking, `Are we there yet?'''
Haider recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The women established the nonprofit organization in 1991, after
identifying a need for facilities for children with dysfunctional
families, emotional problems, or serious medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six children are considered permanent residents who
hope to make the cozy stone house their home until adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth spot, now filled by a seven-month-old San Antonio boy,
is reserved for youngsters placed by the state on a short-term
basis pending reunification with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Life is fast-paced at the Children's Inn, where the emphasis is
on education, fellowship and fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make them independent,'' Kean, 56, said over
the incessant squeaking of ``Chester'' the rocking horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``To infinity and beyond!'' yells John, 7, as he takes the
plastic pony to the limits of stability.
</P>
<P>
   Blind since his premature birth, John was a frail 8 pounds at
the age of five months when he arrived here on heart monitors and a
breathing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely ill as a child, and he didn't talk until he
was 4,'' said Kean, a Sister of St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other children who live here, John now attends public
schools. He loves swimming, riding Chester and tour-bus trips,
providing commentary, from memory, of the sights he cannot see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loving care and attention they give those children is
phenomenal,'' said John's grandfather, John MacDonald of San
Antonio. ``They're just totally selfless.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a healthy respect for the women's willingness to
involve the children aged 12 and younger in activities like
scouting, sports leagues, church events and field trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do things that I would not even care to consider,'' said
MacDonald, 74. ``They mix it up and get down in crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Inn is one of thousands of foster homes across
Texas where an estimated 13,000 children live. But this facility
stands out because of the long-term commitment made to the five
youngsters, which extended to the adoption of two of them _ Thomas
and John _ by Haider four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love them. They've been with us since they were tiny
babies,'' said Haider, 50. ``I couldn't live every day thinking
that these kids have no stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's decision to adopt the youngsters meant curtailing her
service as a Benedictine nun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, people in (the religious) community don't have
commitments to people outside of that community,'' explained
Haider. ``So when I took on the lifelong commitment to the kids by
adopting them, I made the decision not to belong to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Haider is the boys' ward on paper, the women are full
partners in parenting in every other respect.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, each ``mom'' serves as chauffeur, teacher, cook,
disciplinarian and role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time in doctors' offices,'' said Haider, who
is a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   At night, they take turns getting up to adjust feeding tubes,
administering medication or changing diapers for the youngsters who
require round-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   They can keep up with the children now, but the women realize
their pledge of long-term care could tax their energy resources
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision because it's a big commitment, and
because of our age,'' Haider said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look a lot more towards the future and try to plan for
them,'' she said. ``We're not going to be here all the time, and
there's no doubt these kids will need assistance as they grow
older.''

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CLANCY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - On the morning of May 15, Kim Jablonski of Phoenix
woke up unable to catch her breath.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, after an ordeal that included serious heart
surgery, she returned home to a scene that, well, left her
breathless.
</P>
<P>
   It all started that day in May. Reacting quickly to her
breathing difficulties, her husband, Marty, called his neighbors
Kelly and Jake Lang and asked them to watch the Jablonskis' sons,
Scott, 13, and Kory, 10.
</P>
<P>
   He called his next-door neighbors, Lloyd and Marlene Bauerman,
and asked them to keep an eye on his neatly kept house near 33rd
and Maryland avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left with perfect confidence that they would take care of
everything,'' Marty Jablonski said.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know how much they would take care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jablonskis headed to the emergency room at Phoenix Baptist
Hospital, where Kim was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and
an ascending aortic aneurysm, indicated by their association with
her previously diagnosed Marfan's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jablonski was in serious jeopardy. A similar situation, in
which the aorta ultimately burst, took the life of former Olympic
volleyball great Flo Hyman, who also suffered from Marfan's but
never had been diagnosed. Marfan's syndrome is a congenital disease
of the connective tissue that leaves its victims tall and lanky and
causes weakness in the aorta, the main artery of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jablonski's case was so serious, the couple didn't come home
for almost six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that first day, they were in Houston being seen by
Dr. Joseph Coselli. Coselli, widely recognized for his efforts in
treating Marfan's, has performed the surgery that Kim required more
than 1,000 times. He operated on her for 7{ hours that night. She
spent the rest of the six weeks recuperating with her husband at
her bedside in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, the neighbors in the area of tidy red brick homes
got to work. It wasn't unusual for them to pitch in. Most have
lived there for 20 or more years. They had gotten to know one
another because their kids were in school together, and, as one of
them explained, ``It helps when the men like to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really know when the chips are down who your friends
really are,'' said Jake Lang, who was in charge of the Jablonskis'
yard as well as helping watch their sons.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread, the neighbors started to gather. Knowing that
Kim Jablonski had begun working on redecorating a bathroom, Dave
Bell, who lives a couple of doors away, mentioned that he had some
extra tile at home. Lang said he had some spare paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to make ourselves at home,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had come to know Jablonski 24 years earlier, when Bell and
his wife, Tia, first moved in. While they were reroofing the house,
Jablonski stopped over and asked if the Bells had ever done that
before. When they said no, Jablonski acknowledged that he had done
it only once, but that they could use his help.
</P>
<P>
   Such neighborliness gets repaid, over time.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Lang decided Kim Jablonski would need her bathtub when
she got home. She had begun remodeling the tub when she fell ill,
and it was unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Tia Bell said that when her husband told her what he was going
to do, he said he would see her later that night. ``I said, `No,
I'll see you in three weeks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She had anticipated what the men figured out the next day when
they finished the floor in the bathroom and started laying tile in
the kitchen: If they were in for a penny, they might as well be in
for a pound.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Kim Jablonski's father, Jerry Adams, and her
brother, Chris, who each own fiberglass companies, they redecorated
the entire bathroom, adding new tub and tile, new floors, new
vanities and counter tops, new light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   How did they know what she wanted?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Kim quite well, and we knew she liked my bathroom,''
said Lang's wife, Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   They kept it a secret from the Jablonskis. Marty, focused on his
wife's health, never caught on.
</P>
<P>
   As the men started moving down the hall _ where they had laid
new carpeting _ the rest of the neighborhood started to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody started bringing money, and groceries to feed the
boys,'' Tia Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors Fred Willey and Dave Andreini pitched in on dry wall,
painting and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The Jablonskis' home needed the work. Marty Jablonski said that
in the 24 years he has lived there, he never had upgraded the
property. ``I have a Ph.D. in procrastination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So everybody got to work. If they weren't directly involved in
the house, they helped in other ways, making donations of
construction materials or money or providing food for the Jablonski
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our little neighborhood, this shocked me, the way the
neighbors pulled together,'' Tia Bell said. ``Neighbors were coming
from all over. It was amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Kory pitched in by holding a hot dog sale, attracting
people from miles around. They also kept the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Lang said the work started quickly, moving out of the
bathroom, down the hall to the kitchen, then moving into the living
room, dining room and family room.
</P>
<P>
   They laid carpet, put down tile, painted walls, hung vertical
blinds and miniblinds, put up new light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked every night and weekends until midnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were finished in three weeks, then took their time with the
finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece was removing a 50-foot-tall fan palm tree in the
front yard. Before the Jablonskis returned, it had been replaced
with a new, leafy tree. A red brick walk was added to the front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the Jablonskis' surprise when they came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was one of shock. It put me right back in
the hospital,'' Kim joked.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, her husband explained, she needed more time to recover
from her operation.
</P>
<P>
   Home again by the Fourth of July, she still is overcome by the
neighbors' generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed the palm tree was gone, replaced with a new tree.
There was a red brick walkway, and new plants,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I opened the front door. The first thing I saw was tile
in the kitchen, where there used to be bare cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I noticed the new paint, the shades, the vertical blinds.
It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband added, ``No words can adequately describe how
wonderful it is to have friends and neighbors like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to do Kim's heart good. She is expected to recover
fully from the surgery, although she will need frequent checkups
for the Marfan's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the neighbors will be around to help out. &QL;

PEDIATRICIAN TO A NATION: A PERSONAL LOOK AT THE MAN WHO CHANGED
PARENTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dr. Spock: An American Life'' is more than a well-researched
biography of America's favorite baby doctor; it is fascinating
social history that reads like a great adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Spock, who remains controversial even after death
for pushing a vegetarian diet for young children in the latest
edition of his baby book, was an anti-war activist, civil rights
leader, health care reformer and one of the great liberals of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced Freud to many unsuspecting parents, campaigned for
John F. Kennedy, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, stood trial
for aiding and abetting draft dodgers during the Vietnam War,
preached in favor of Medicare and against nuclear weapons, ran for
president of the United States in 1972, and in 1993, at the age of
90, delivered $75,000 worth of donated supplies to the Cuban Red
Cross _ despite an American embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Maier's definitive biography keeps all the history in
mind while telling the very personal story of the pediatrician who
changed child rearing in this country forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new mothers of America were ready for a book that told
them love was as important as discipline, that cuddling was as
important as cleanliness,'' Maier points out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time America's baby boomers _ known as Spock babies _
began having babies of their own in the 1960s, there was only one
baby book, and everyone called the book ``Dr. Spock.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially named ``The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child
Care'' when first published in 1946, the book _ which has sold more
than 50 million copies _ is now in its seventh edition, published
two months after Spock's death in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any president, pope or populist, Spock brought about
a remarkable revolution since 1946, enacting a fundamental change
in how most parents bring up their children,'' writes Maier.
``Spock's book offered an alternative, a more loving way of
bringing up children than the moralistic, sometimes cruel methods
of old.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier's extensively researched book keeps in mind that the name
Spock evokes thoughts of children far more than memories of
political protests or debates about the merits of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   Spock's own family was dysfunctional, Maier points out through
interviews with the popular doctor's children and grandchildren:
Family members were constantly in psychotherapy, both individually
and in groups; Spock's first wife, Jane, suffered a nervous
breakdown and was an alcoholic; his grandson committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The biography is based on extensive interviews with Spock and
his family, friends and colleagues, numerous newspaper accounts,
magazine articles, speeches, personal letters, government
documents, pamphlets and unpublished transcripts, and tape
recordings made by Mary Morgan, Spock's second wife, when the two
of them were writing their 1989 book, ``Spock on Spock: A Memoir of
Growing Up With the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   That book, like earlier attempts at telling Spock's story,
failed in part because Spock suppressed many of the most personal
parts. Perhaps he sensed that time was running out; in any case, he
sent letters to friends and family inviting them to speak freely
with Maier and did not attempt to censor the work in any way.

JOURNALISM MARKETED FOR MASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - I was all ready to make fun of people who care about
who runs ``The New Yorker,'' until I realized that I did.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, when Tina Brown stepped down as editor last
week, the story broke as big news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two columns and a picture on Tina Brown quitting?'' a
colleague asked, as he held up a copy of the ``New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I reckoned; sounds about right.
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer lies with Brown herself. When she moved from
``Vanity Fair'' to ``The New Yorker'' in 1992, the hew and cry
could be heard from all the usual buttoned-down guardians of
cultural literacy, some of whom had actually read ``The New
Yorker'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the old staff left. Others were asked to. (The most
lamentable loss was Ian Frazier, who now pops up less frequently in
``Outside'' and ``The Atlantic'').
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't waste any time giving defenders of Harold Ross and
William Shawn something to gripe about. Topicality ruled. Roseanne
served as guest editor of a special issue. Soon the hallowed pages
of the venerable magazine were rife with color ads, celebrity
profiles, even  &UR; pictures, for goodness' sake.
</P>
<P>
   The dumbing down of American culture was complete, the martini
set crowed. No wonder Jim Carrey was box-office king.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: Did you ever read the old ``New
Yorker``? While acknowledging that the magazine produced some
classic journalism (think ``Hiroshima'' by John Hersey, or ``In
Cold Blood'' by Truman Capote), plowing through those articles week
in and week out was heavy sledding. Too much for me, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   My pal Kim, wise as the day is long, is one of the smartest
people I've ever known, and hands down the best reader. He's
read &UR; everything. He used to subscribe to the pre-Brown ``New
Yorker,'' but canceled his subscription and fired off a letter to
the editor explaining why: The articles were just too damn long.
</P>
<P>
   That's like Michael Jordan quitting basketball because it pays
too well. But it tells you all you need to know about the way the
magazine used to read.
</P>
<P>
   Once Brown settled in, a funny thing happened: The magazine
actually became fun, at least for lowbrows such as myself, people
who don't exactly move their lips when they read, but can't wade
through multipart series on grains.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are weeks when I pick up the magazine, glance at
the table of contents and toss it atop the recycling pile. Other
weeks, I read everything in it. If Christopher Buckley writes
Shouts and Murmurs, I'll even save it and pass it along to friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine's transformation came at a price. As much as
Brown improved ``The New Yorker'' (or desecrated it, depending upon
your point of view), her reign, with its stunts _ Roseanne's
``women's issue,'' inflammatory covers, celebrity puff pieces _
cast a bright light upon a shallow streak that colors journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is just another example of journalist as celebrity, of the
idea that the information isn't as important as who brings it to
us. If the editor has a high-enough profile _ if Brown and her
husband buying a luxury apartment makes news _ then her magazine
must be worth checking out, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, as anyone who has ever tried to read John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s ``George'' can tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the idea exists everywhere in media. Television
``journalism'' wouldn't exist without it. Check out any Sunday
morning news show. It wasn't long ago that a local station trotted
out Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio as a guest sportscaster. Why
do you think attractive news anchors live in a higher tax bracket?
Networks don't dish out all those millions to the likes of Katie
Couric and Dan Rather for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials don't matter as much as smiles and salaries do.
More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   But hope is on the horizon. Pulitzer Prize-winning author David
Remnick, whom Brown recruited to the magazine, will succeed her.
Maybe now the chattering classes will care as much about what's in
the magazine as who runs it. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Here are some of the scams the Federal Trade
Commission has encountered most often:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Business Opportunities _ Usually promise a lot of income for a
small investment of time and money. Some are actually old-fashioned
pyramid schemes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bulk E-Mailings _ Offer lists of e-mail addresses or software
to allow you to make the mailings. What they don't mention is that
the lists are of poor quality, sending bulk e-mail violates the
terms of service of most Internet service providers, and several
states have laws regulating the sending of bulk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chain Letters _ Electronic versions of the old-fashioned chain
letters. They are as illegal as the old-fashioned paper versions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Work-at-Home Schemes _ Two popular versions are
envelope-stuffing and craft assembly. However, nobody will really
pay you for stuffing envelopes, and craft assembly promoters
usually refuse to buy crafts, claiming the work does not meet their
``quality standards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Health And Diet Scams _ Offer ``scientific breakthroughs,''
``miraculous cures,'' ``exclusive products,'' ``secret formulas,''
and ``ancient ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get Something Free _ After paying a membership fee, consumers
learn that they don't quality for the ``free'' gift until they
recruit other ``members.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cable Descrambler Kits _ Offers for sale a kit that lets you
receive cable without paying subscription fees. Two problems: the
kits usually don't work and stealing cable service is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Credit Repair Scams _ For an up-front fee, they offer to clear
up a bad credit record for a charge or show you how to get an
Employer Identification Number. No one can erase a bad credit
record if it's accurate, and using an Employer Identification
Number to set up a new credit identity is against the law.

to allow you to make the mailings. What they don't mention is that
the lists are of poor quality, sending bulk e-mail violates the

states have laws regulating the sending of bulk e-mail.

   &QR;  Work-at-Home Schemes _ Two popular versions are

pay you for stuffing envelopes, and craft assembly promoters
usually refuse to buy crafts, claiming the work does not meet their

   &QR;  Credit Repair Scams _ For an up-front fee, they offer to clear
up a bad credit record for a charge or show you how to get an

MAMA'S GOT A COOL NEW RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot dog! I'm fit to be tied, whatever that means. I heard this
guy in one of those old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns use that
phrase once and I've been waiting years for an opportunity to
repeat it. Well, the moment has finally arrived and, like I said,
I'm just fit to be tied. Uh oh, my husband is looking over my
shoulder right now and he's grinning like an idiot so I suppose
some clarification is needed. Let's just say that I am very
excited.
</P>
<P>
   I'm excited because I got a new vehicle this week. Now, I'm not
one to brag. In fact, I take a dim view of people who spend a lot
of time talking about what they own, where they bought it, and what
it costs. However, for several years now, I have been riding around
in a foreign-made, two-cylinder, two-door matchbox car that was so
small it didn't have brakes. When I needed to slow down or stop,
I'd just open the door and drag my foot on the ground. For parking,
I used the kickstand on the rear bumper or a bicycle chain. I tell
you that car was teeny!
</P>
<P>
   I bought it during the fall clearance a while back, and when
winter came, the heater worked just fine. However, when those hot
days of summer steam rolled around, I could never get the AC cold
enough to cool off my head and my feet at the same time. When I
finally looked under the hood, I understood the problem. Instead of
a traditional air conditioning system, I had a gerbil in a box with
a little ice maker. Every five minutes, the gerbil would suck on a
piece of ice and then blow into this tube that leads to the vents
inside the car. Immediately, I took the car back to the dealer and
complained. They apologized and gave me a bigger gerbil.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the car was the gas mileage. I got 100
miles to the gallon. For $10, I could drive to New York _ if the
weather was cool enough. My children were toddlers when I bought
the car, so they didn't mind the absence of legroom. That was then.
Now they both have legs longer than my entire body. Before I sold
that car, Junior could sit behind the driver's seat and use his
toes to turn on the radio. I knew it was time for a bigger vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   My husband wanted a van. I went to the safe and got the
prenuptial agreement out. There in bold print it said, ``My wife
will never be forced to drive a van or a station wagon or cook a
German chocolate cake from scratch.'' Call me psychic, but I knew
the day would come when I would need that clause.
</P>
<P>
   Then, my love suggested a sport utility vehicle. ``You like
trucks,'' he said. ``These are just big trucks. They're safe,
they're sporty, there's room for the kids, and they have eight
cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean the AC works?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having an elephant with a glacier under the hood.''
</P>
<P>
   The test drive was unconvincing. I did like the power of the
vehicle, but it was so very big. I ran over curbs trying to make
simple turns. I had trouble parking. I was sitting up so high that
I could see things in other cars that I'm sure I wasn't supposed to
be seeing. And I thought nose picking at the red light was bad.
However, the boys loved it and my husband loved it. Knowing it was
American-made was comforting, but it was a different straw that
broke this camel's back. When the salesman turned the thermostat
all the way down and it got so cold that my lips froze together, I
said OK. Actually, I just nodded because I couldn't talk until my
lips thawed.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm sitting at the red light enjoying that new-car smell and
thinking about how cool I am when this nice-looking woman in a
minivan pulls up next to me. That's when I noticed that my
``truck'' was as long as her van. My ``truck'' was as wide as her
van. And my ``truck'' had three rows of seats just like her van.
The only difference was that I have four doors and she has three. I
realized then that I had been tricked into buying a fancy van.
</P>
<P>
   I rushed to the phone and called my husband to complain, but I
couldn't because my lips were frozen again. I heard him on the
other end just laughing heartily.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, that man is clever.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOVIE-ACTORS (Los Angeles) _ A tide of movie and theater
actors, as well as established film writers, directors and
producers, are surging into a medium that they once scorned. And
just as important, the gates of movie studios have been flung open
to television actors and writers after decades of not-so benign
neglect. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OFFLEAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-RYAN-FILM (Undated) _ It's the morning of D-Day, June 6,
1944, just off Omaha Beach. Laden with rifles and unwieldy packs,
some of the men pray, others are sick into their helmets. A few are
visibly shaking. Then the doors to the landing craft fall open, and
Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opens on July 24,
becomes an entirely different kind of movie than the audience
expects. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER-COPENHAGEN (London) _ Why did Werner Heisenberg,
the German who formulated the uncertainty principle, pay a visit to
Niels Bohr, the Dane who made key discoveries in quantum theory, in
the occupied Copenhagen of 1941? The meeting of the two Nobel
Prize-winning physicists could help explain why you and I are not
now living in a world controlled by Son of Hitler and his
cybernetic Gestapo. It certainly supplies Michael Frayn with the
material for one of the boldest, meatiest plays the Royal National
Theater has staged this decade: ``Copenhagen.'' By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   FORBIDDEN-BROADWAY (New York) _ Gerard Alessandrini, 44, has
been Broadway's premier parts collector for a long time. Since 1982
he has been presenting a series of rude, bitchy, yet ultimately
affectionate cabaret-style satires on the Broadway scene under the
moniker ``Forbidden Broadway,'' which he created, writes and
directs. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   WHISTLE-THEATER-LONDON (LOndon) _ ``Whistle Down the Wind'' may
take as its source the Mary Hayley Bell novella that inspired the
1961 Bryan Forbes film starring Hayley Mills and Alan Bates. On
this hearing it is about a haunted man _ known, indeed, as The Man
and portrayed by Marcus Lovett, an American veteran of several
Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals _ in none too sublimated thrall to a
virginal girl-woman, the impressionable teen-age Swallow (Lottie
Mayor). But here, ``the music of the night,'' as the ``Phantom''
lyric puts it, has been supplanted by what a Jim Steinman lyric
terms ``the nature of the beast.'' By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HADID-CINCINNATI (Cincinnati) _ Herbert Muschamp reviews Zaha
Hadid's Museum of Contemporary Art in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PIMPERNEL-TV (Undated) _ Now A&AMP;E Television Networks, which
brought ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Emma'' and ``Tom Jones'' to
television, are producing ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' with the BBC.
The three 90-minute television films of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,''
replete with 1,200 costumes and visually rich locales in the Czech
Republic, promise to be not only lush in the style we've become so
accustomed to with literary adaptations. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SEXY-OPERA-JACKETS (Undated) _ A jet-black man, facing front and
nearly naked but for a spiked leather G-string with matching spiked
sunglasses, and holding a dead white swan; a trio of skinny,
scantily clad, bewigged and beribboned drag queens who could be
drum majorettes in a Gay Day parade; a naked obese woman sitting on
a floor and cuddling a tiny dog between her fleshy arm and
humongous bosom, with heart-shaped trinkets masking her face and
nipples. These are the covers of three new RCA Victor recordings of
orchestral excerpts from Wagner operas. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BEASTIE-BOYS (Undated) _ There is a term in hip-hop, flavor. It
is a good thing. Rappers want to have flavor: panache, style,
something extra that enables them to stand out from the pack. In
their 17 years together, however, the Beastie Boys have developed
something much better than flavor: taste. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   BRISTOL-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bristol, England, has been the
capital of sonic murk and undertow for a decade, and it's not about
to give up the claim. Two new albums from Bristol's
standard-bearers _ Tricky's ``Angels With Dirty Faces'' (Island)
and Massive Attack's ``Mezzanine'' (Virgin) _ insist on the
continuing allure of ambiguity. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION-TRENDS (New York) _ Two trends are in evidence at
auction houses: a surge in prices for Americana, and a growing
demand for anonymity by a new generation of wealthy collectors. By
Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WYETH-ART-MAINE (Rockland, Maine) _ On June 21, the Farnsworth
Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine opened, a place dedicated to
the work of the illustrator N.C. Wyeth, his son Andrew and Andrew's
son Jamie. The 130-year-old church contains the center's galleries;
there is also a private study area, in a separate building, with
storage for art and archives. A review by Deborah Weisgall.
</P>
<P>
   GYSIN-ART-EDMONTON (Edmonton, Alberta) _ He just thought it was
awful, nowheresville,'' William Burroughs said of Edmonton, the
boyhood home of his great friend and collaborator Brion Gysin.
Though Gysin shunned this ``wrong place'' that pummeled away at his
psyche, the city is embracing Gysin as a native son with the first
major North American retrospective of his works, at the Edmonton
Art Gallery through Aug. 31. By Kathryn Shattuck.

MAKING BUGS BUZZ OFF: WHEN IT COMES TO REPELLENTS, DEET CAN'T BE
BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by REPELLENTS-CHART) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the TV commercial back in the '60s in which the
fearless scientist thrust his arm into a cage of hungry,
blood-sucking mosquitoes to demonstrate the effectiveness of a
particular insect repellent?
</P>
<P>
   The arm-in-cage test is not just a television stunt, says Dr.
Jonathan Day, a medical entomologist with the University of
Florida, whose research focuses on the prevention of encephalitis,
a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The testing was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Entomological Laboratories in Florida to find repellents to protect
soldiers in malaria-ridden countries during World War II. The
chemical DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) was patented by the Army
in 1946 and registered for use by the general public in 1957; it's
the active ingredient in such well-known bug sprays as Off!
</P>
<P>
   Day has endured a lot of mosquito bites in 20 years of testing
both chemical (synthetic) and natural (plant-derived) repellents,
as well as gadgets and gizmos like sonic repellers, ``magic''
wristbands and backyard zappers. About 1,000 potential new
repellents are tested each year, and so far none has been found
that compares with DEET in safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And though DEET periodically draws criticism that it is unsafe,
scientists and studies say otherwise. In April, after 40 years of
testing and usage, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded
that when used according to directions, DEET at any strength is
safe to use on people of any age, including children.
</P>
<P>
   ``DEET is the gold standard against which we test new
products,'' Day says. ``It may be that, purely by accident, we
found the best first.''
</P>
<P>
   Most insect repellents sold today rely on DEET or citronella, a
natural plant-based oil, as their active ingredient. They are the
only two insect repellents approved by the Environmental Protection
Agency for topical application to humans.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop people _ and marketers _ from searching for
other potions. Natural substances such as garlic, cayenne pepper,
bananas and vitamin B-1 are often touted as effective repellents,
but Day says there is no research to support their long-term
effectiveness, and in fact most have proved ineffective in
scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   You still taste the same to a mosquito, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide and lactic acid, given off by the human body
through the skin and breath, are the primary long-range mosquito
attractants. They can be detected by mosquitoes from about 120 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   DEET works by jamming the sophisticated sensory receptors on the
antennae of mosquitoes and other biting insects. Once the sensory
system is jammed, movement toward the host ceases and there is no
further attempt to blood-feed until the DEET is cleared from the
receptors.
</P>
<P>
   A few plant oils, particularly citronella, eucalyptus, vanilla,
pennyroyal, geranium and cedar are natural repellents that evolved
along with the plants to keep harmful insects away from the plants
from which they are derived. In high concentrations, they can be
toxic to people, just like they are to bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people out there do get some benefit from the natural
oils, even in low concentrations. There are a variety of factors at
work and so much variation from person to person. You need to find
out what works for you in a particular situation and use it,'' Day
says. ``I get lots of calls from people telling me what works for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because something comes from a plant doesn't mean it is
safer than a synthetic chemical designed to do the same thing, Day
emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of science to any of the things available
to the public that are not DEET-based,'' said Dr. Mark Fradin, who
reviewed 30 years' worth of studies, medical literature, government
documents, case reports and articles for a recent article on
mosquito repellents published in the ``Annals of Internal
Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to mix garlic and peppermint and sell it for
insect repellent, you don't have to prove it works to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fradin says he found one new herbal product in his research,
that seems to be somewhat effective in repelling mosquitoes. Bite
Blocker contains soybean oil as its main active ingredient, along
with some geranium oil and coconut oil. It has been available in
Europe for several years and was released in the United States last
year. Scientists don't quite understand how it works, but somehow
it seems to jam the receptors on mosquitoes' antennae that allow
them to zero in on victims.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has not registered soybean oil as an insect repellent
because it is derived from food-grade soybeans and is considered
safe. They have registered citronella as a weak repellent that
protects up to two hours. The oil has a lemony scent and was
originally extracted from the grass plant Cymbopogon nardus _ never
used for food.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that citronella can be an effective repellent, but
it provides shorter complete protection than most DEET-based
products and must be reapplied frequently, Fradin notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing people need to know is the importance of
following the labels on different products,'' says Marilyn Blood,
marketing director for SC Johnson Wax, developers of the various
Off! insect repellents. ``DEET has been studied for years and has
an outstanding safety record, but toxic reactions can occur with
misuse. Don't use more than you need. Don't reapply unless
mosquitoes actually start bothering you.''
</P>
<P>
   Factors that determine the effectiveness of any repellent
include frequency and uniformity of application; the number and
species of organisms attempting to bite; the users inherent
attractiveness to blood-sucking arthropods; and the overall
activity level of the potential host.
</P>
<P>
   Abrasion from clothing rubbing against the body, evaporation and
absorption from the skin surface, wash-off from sweat or rain, high
temperatures and a windy environment all decrease effectiveness,
Fradin says.
</P>
<P>
   Fradin recommends following basic common sense guidelines,
printed on product labels. He also says parents should apply DEET
products to their own hands and rub them on young children. You
need to cover every square inch of exposed skin for full protection
and you should reapply only as needed when mosquitoes start biting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If efficacy is your No. 1 concern, I would say use a DEET
product no higher than 35 percent concentration. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends 10 percent or less for children,''
Fradin says.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   I live in New York City, the capital of English-speaking
culture. But I can go entire days without ever speaking English.
Today was one of those days. This morning, I didn't have exact
change for the bus ride so I went into a Korean deli and asked the
Ecuadorian behind the register for it.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus, coming down Seventh Avenue, I tried reading a few
pages of ``Three Trapped Tigers,'' by the Cuban writer Guillermo
Cabrera Infante. But I was distracted by the stories of a Dominican
mother, who, on a nearby seat, was telling her young son about his
grandmother's house in Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   I closed my book and decided to notice New York's Latin face.
Behind me, two teen-age girlfriends chatted half in English, half
in Spanish. One of them carried a keychain with the Colombian flag
hooked to the pocket of her backpack; the other was wearing a
necklace of yellow, blue and red plastic beads that ended in the
three-color flag of five Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled how at the Sunday rumba in Central Park, the bata
drums might as easily have been played by a Puerto Rican or a
Dominican as a Cuban. New York, I thought, has shown me so much of
my own culture. It is here, not in my native Colombia, after all,
where I have tried to dance a tango and a ``danzon.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has always been a city of immigrants. A 1998 report by
the Census Bureau shows that one out of five New Yorkers is
foreign-born. If at the turn of the century, they arrived from
Europe, today they are arriving from the Caribbean and from Central
and South America. Most of them come from the Dominican Republic.
They are followed, in the order of greatest numbers, by
Ecuadorians, Colombians, Peruvians, Hondurans, Salvadoreans,
Mexicans, Guatemalans and Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   New York is living the dream of Latin American unity that Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, held most dear _ the belief that a
single people has been divided only by the turmoil of historical
events. And now, curiously, there never has been the opportunity
for Latin Americans to know each other as there is today in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the bus at 14th Street, a wide, store-lined, two-way
path that reminds me of Panama's Avenida Calidonia or the
commercial thoroughfare of any Latin American downtown area. It is
a reflection of the Latino community which, according to the
Department of City Planning, will soon be the largest minority in
New York City _ surpassing even the African-American community,
which currently constitutes about 24 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteenth Street mirrors the needs, the growth and the
idiosyncrasy of the Latino community. Here a Latino finds whatever
he or she might need or yearn for _ from work offers, to law firms
offering green cards, to two Spanish-language bookstores where one
can find the novels that won this year's Alfaguara Prize, Spain's
new prestigious international literary award, as well as the
magazines covering the latest news of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores sell guayaberas, CDs in Spanish, brand names at a
discount. On the sidewalk you are offered cellular phones, games of
Three-Card Monty, compliments, pushes, dirty looks, smiles _ all
Latino-style, in Spanish, and in the accents of many countries.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, I went to a restaurant where they offer the entire
Latin American region in their menu _ from chicken soup,
``empanadas chilenas,'' black and red beans to slivers of yellow
plantain, mango juice and flan.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a ``batido de mamey,'' a milkshake made of a pink
tropical fruit, and asked the Mexican at the counter what was the
difference between a Cuban Sandwich, or a sanduche cubano, and a
Midnight Sandwich, or a media noche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is in the bread,'' the young man from Puebla,
in central Mexico, told me. And I was sure he had never tasted a
Cuban sandwich before coming to New York. ``The Midnight is made
with `pan de huevo,' which is bread made with eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered it because that bread, sweet and yellowy, reminds me
of afternoons in Barranquilla, Colombia, where I was born. The
baker would pass by my house on his bicycle selling pan de huevo,
also made into rolls filled with a guava paste sprinkled with sugar
on top. I have not lived in Barranquilla for 20 years, but it only
takes a sip of the shake _ its smell, its taste _ or the sounds of
the chords of a Colombian vallenato song, to feel as if I am
sitting in the rocking chair on my grandmother's patio.
</P>
<P>
   My experience is not unique. It must be the same for that
Dominican woman who was talking to her son on the Seventh Avenue
bus, or for the hundreds of people who walk or work on 14th Street
every day. It is a surprise even to hear English here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I turned around when I heard a masculine voice say,
in the tone that North Americans use when they go on vacation to
Latin America and their tourist package includes a native dance and
a cocktail of tropical fruit, ``This surely is colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that this is the new face of New York. That
this wonderful convergence of cultures is more than a colorful
novelty. That this is his new country.

the chords of a Colombian vallenato song, to feel as if I am
sitting in the rocking chair on my grandmother's patio.
</P>
<P>
   My experience is not unique. It must be the same for that
Dominican woman who was talking to her son on the Seventh Avenue
bus, or for the hundreds of people who walk or work on 14th Street
every day. It is a surprise even to hear English here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I turned around when I heard a masculine voice say,
in the tone that North Americans use when they go on vacation to
Latin America and their tourist package includes a native dance and
a cocktail of tropical fruit, ``This surely is colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to tell him that this is the new face of New York. That
this wonderful convergence of cultures is more than a colorful
novelty. That this is his new country.

   Cutchogue, N.Y. _ ``Twenty-five years is a long time for a
career in any sport,'' Alex Hargrave said. ``And winemaking is an
Olympic sport.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Hargrave's deceptively casual way of explaining why he
and his wife, Louisa, are ending their remarkable career as Long
Island's pioneer winemakers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the couple _ he was 28, she 25 _ set out their first
vines in a former potato field on the North Fork. They were bravely
_ and in the opinion of just about everyone else, foolishly _
determined to produce wines to rival the best that California and
Europe could offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we were so young,'' Mrs. Hargrave said, curled
up on a sofa in the family home here. ``When you're young, you
don't want to take advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Youthful enthusiasm paid off, as it often does. Starting from
scratch, the Hargraves created an industry that was ecologically
and culturally in tune with the times.
</P>
<P>
   And by demonstrating that vineyards and winemaking were
economically viable, they showed that it was possible for Eastern
Long Island to remain at least partly rural and agricultural.
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves, who were wine drinkers when most Americans did
not know much about the stuff, particularly loved the grape
varieties found in the great wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy:
cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay, pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resolved to go ahead only if we could make those kinds of
wine,'' Mrs. Hargrave said.
</P>
<P>
   They did, in the face of the conventional wisdom, much of it
from state agricultural officials, who warned: don't even think
about growing European grapes on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hargraves had visited other potential sites for their
business that were as close as the Finger Lakes and as distant as
British Columbia. Nothing they saw offered the climate and the soil
of the North Fork.
</P>
<P>
   They bought their first plot of land and in 1973 planted their
first grapes and installed their press and fermenters in an old
potato cellar. They produced their first wine, a cabernet
sauvignon, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Within just a few years, those who had doubted them were giving
them respect instead, and many would-be winemakers followed in
their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 20 wineries on Long Island, most of them within
10 miles of Hargrave Vineyards on Route 48. The wineries draw on
some 1,500 acres of wine grapes, none of which existed 25 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen more wineries are planned, and each week more and
more people, both farmers and wine hobbyists, inquire about getting
into the business, which now produces about 200,000 cases a year in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   That figure should double in the next few years, Hargrave said.
``Every bottle we make these days is spoken for,'' he said. ``Every
good bottle has a home.'' Hargrave Vineyard produces 6,000 to 7,000
cases a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, he continued, ``the North Fork has become a
wine destination.'' He added, ``All year long, people flock to the
wineries to taste, to learn and to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves have had dozens of inquiries about their 84-acre
property, which includes the winery, the aging cellar, some 20
acres of vines, their home, a pool, tennis court and farm
buildings. They are asking about $3 million and said they may close
a deal sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they selling? The end to their wine story has its
roots in its beginning. After graduating from Princeton University
in 1968, Hargrave, whose grandfather was chairman of Eastman Kodak
Co. in Rochester, did graduate work at Harvard University in Asian
studies. By 1969 he had married Louisa, a graduate of Smith
College, whose grandfather was Norman Thomas, the Socialist leader.
</P>
<P>
   While Hargrave was recuperating from back surgery, the couple
decided to leave academia and take on something they could do
together. They chose wine.
</P>
<P>
   In searching for a site, they visited John Wickham, a North Fork
farmer who had grown vinifera table grapes successfully for more
than a decade. Seeing his red Malagas convinced the Hargraves that
they could grow vinifera wine grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Island has always had the potential to be an important
wine region,'' Hargrave said, pointing out that wine grapes were
grown in what is now Queens in the 1830s. But most of the farmers
who were drawn to the region were teetotalers, he said. So
potatoes, not grapes, became the agricultural stars. Until the
Hargraves showed up, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But starting about seven years ago, Hargrave was drawn back to
Asian studies; particularly Chinese culture and specifically the
origins of Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called paleolinguistics,'' he said. Working at night and
during winter breaks from the vineyards, he has been reconstructing
what he calls a hypothetical language from which Chinese and other
languages must have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find time to do the research, but not the writing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that eventually we'd have time to do other
things,'' he added. ``But a winery is like a sailboat _ someone's
always got to be at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hargraves do not anticipate a complete break with the North
Fork and wine; they may serve as consultants. But they do foresee a
change in their life style, which may include his return to
academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apartment in Boston and a cottage here on Peconic Bay sound
pretty good to me,'' Hargrave said.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the Hargraves, who have a son, 21, and a
daughter, 23, must get the 1998 harvest in, bottle the 1997 vintage
and prepare themselves for a new way of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it has something to do with choices, with making sense
of a life,'' Hargrave said. ``Do I want people saying he's a
vintner and his field is historical linguistics?''
</P>
<P>
   They hired a manager, to try and get more free time. ``But we
were still involved because it was the hands-on part that we loved
_ the aesthetics of making wine,'' he said. ``It's so beautiful.
That will be the hard part to give up.''

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES BUSINESSES TO DEAL WITH YEAR 2000 BUG
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning that the millennium bug ``is not one of the
summer movies, where you can close your eyes during the scary
parts,'' President Clinton on Tuesday urged the business community
to fix their computers before they disrupt the nation's economic
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that approaches the new year armed only with a
bottle of champagne and a noisemaker is likely to have a very big
hangover on New Year's morning,'' Clinton said in a long-awaited
speech on the Year 2000 computer problem at the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The president also promised to send Congress legislation that
would protect firms sharing advice on upgrading computers from
lawsuits stemming from use of the material.
</P>
<P>
   When midnight strikes on Jan. 1, 2000, programs that identify
dates by only their last two digits may recognize the ``00'' as the
year 1900. The bug threatens to cripple government agencies,
industrial firms, banks, hospitals and financial exchanges around
the world that use computer calendars to monitor their operations.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, key Republicans on Capitol Hill have been
urging Clinton to put the full weight of his office behind a
high-profile campaign to alert Americans to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded Tuesday by praising the Republicans for their
efforts as they sat in the first row of the auditorium. ``This can
be a model of partnership,'' the president asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the thousands of retired computer authorities whose help
could prove vital, Clinton announced that the Labor Department had
established a Year 2000 talent bank to hook up experts on the
computer glitch with people who need their aid. And Clinton also
noted that the Justice Department ruled earlier this month that
``competitors who merely share information on how to solve this
problem are not in violation of the nation's antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get that message out there loud and clear: no one
should be afraid to help another company to deal with this
challenge,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another key goal of Clinton's speech was to remove the Year 2000
problem from the political agenda. Any massive disruption in
commerce could potentially harm the chances of Vice President Al
Gore, the administration's lead player on technology issues, in his
forthcoming bid to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Clinton, Gore said: ``The year 2000 problem is a
management challenge and a programming challenge. It must not be a
political football. We need bipartisan cooperation to solve the
year 2000 problem, not political rhetoric. More than anything else,
the year 2000 problem has revealed how interconnected and
interdependent we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president sought to temper a sense of urgency
with a dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we act and not be in denial,'' he said.
``It is also very important that we avoid overreaction from people
who hear, 'Oh, my goodness, this problem is out there.' And so we
have to do both things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Horn, R-Calif., who chairs a House subcommittee that
has been probing the federal response to the Year 2000 problem,
said he told Clinton after the speech that ``Franklin D. Roosevelt
would have been proud of you, because what the nation needed to
hear at this time was a ``fireside address' on this critical
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true emergency,'' agreed Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah,
who chairs a special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer
problem. ``I won't nit-pick on whether he should have spoken out
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said ``a private foundation will soon announce a major
effort to coordinate a nationwide response at all levels of
society.'' He said the group was seeking to recruit ``a major
industrial figure'' to lead a broadly based campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago, Bennett had scheduled his own speech on the
problem, to be delivered on Wednesday to the National Press Club
under the working title of ``Paul Revere and Not Chicken Little:
Who's Sounding the Call for the Year 2000 and Who's Not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'll have to revise that speech,'' Bennett said.

APARTMENT MARKET IN HOUSTON BEST IN YEARS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rising rents, higher occupancy rates and strong job
growth are luring developers to build new apartments at a pace
Houstonians haven't seen since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty apartment complexes with more than 15,000 units are under
construction in the Houston area and another 40 projects are
proposed, according to Apartment Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody went hog wild. There is a lot of stuff going on
right now,'' said Marty McAdams of the Marcus &AMP; Millichap real
estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent U.S. Housing Markets newsletter, Houston
was first in the nation in multifamily construction permits in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 4,832 first-quarter apartment permits were more than
1,000 units above the second-place city, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The new projects are everywhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any pocket that's not been covered,'' said
Timm Wooten, executive vice president of Martin J. Fein Interests,
a Houston apartment developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find an empty apartment,'' said Sherry Moore of
Apartment Finders, which helps tenants find places to live. ``The
nice places lease up fast.``
</P>
<P>
   The citywide apartment occupancy rate was 91.5 percent in June,
up from 90.8 percent a year earlier, according to the June report
of Apartment Data Services. The uptick in occupancy comes even as
hundreds of new units are opened every month.
</P>
<P>
   Today's apartment occupancy rate represents a large increase
from a decade ago. In 1988, when the local economy was in the
doldrums, Houston had an 80.7 percent occupancy rate.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment locators say renters have to look harder and they may
not be able to live in the area they want, unless they are willing
to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is stuff available. But your choices are few and far
between,'' said Jim Kluter, vice president of Apartment Living
Locators.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Leatherwood, a 24-year-old first-year medical student at
the University of Texas Health Science Center, said he has been
struggling to find an apartment near the Texas Medical Center. He
wants to be able to ride his bicycle to classes there. Most of the
apartments he had been looking at rent for about $550 a month, but
he had been considering leasing a converted attic in an old house
for $405.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of dealing with the fact that I'm going to spend a
lot more than I wanted to,'' Leatherwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Rents have been rising.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, the average Houston apartment rented for $514, up
6.3 percent from a year earlier, Apartment Data Services said.
However, O'Connor &AMP; Associates placed the city's rent increases at
only 4.3 percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hikes don't match up to the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Then, many Houston apartment dwellers were smacked with
double-digit annual increases in rent. In 1992, rents went into a
flat period where increases were about 2 or 3 percent annually,
until last year when they began rising faster again.
</P>
<P>
   Rent for a brand-new unit in Houston is typically over $800 per
month, depending on the location.
</P>
<P>
   Relief may be in store for Houston consumers. Some experts
expect to see the apartment market soften as huge amounts of new
units being built are finished later this year. The boom can't last
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to soften up next winter. There's no doubt in my
mind,'' said Nancy Tropoli, president of the Apartment Connection,
an apartment locating firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next 12 months we expect to see occupancy rates fall
and rental rates stagnate,'' said Barton Smith, an economics
professor at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Developers aren't building any inexpensive apartments. The newly
built projects are aimed at the more affluent renters and a glut of
upper end apartments could develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are in the process of becoming overbuilt in the
upscale market,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is seeing a large increase over the 4,000 new apartment
units that were opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the heavy construction, another bump in the road
for the apartment market in 1998 will be a slowdown in the economy,
Smith said. After adding about 90,000 jobs in 1997, Houston's job
growth could be half that amount in 1998, Smith said. Pressure from
a softer energy market, repercussions from the Asian economy and
recent layoffs at Compaq Computer Corp. all will damage the Houston
economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting a catastrophe. But the economy and the
apartment market may not continue to perform at outstanding levels.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ward, regional manager for Equity Residential Properties,
notes, however, that Houston landlords have been leasing the newly
built apartments with ease.
</P>
<P>
   With the apartment market humming at such a high speed, it's
difficult for some to utter many negative words about the Houston
apartment market today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apartment market is better now than it's been since 1982.
It's nice to operate in good times again,'' said Eileen Subinsky,
president of the Houston Apartment Association.
</P>
<P>
   Subinsky said the apartment construction in Houston is not
nearly as wild as it was in the 1980s. The market will not go back
to the giveaway days when landlords were offering free TVs and VCRs
to tenants willing to sign a one-year lease, Subinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that Houston continues to add a lot of new
jobs, even if the economy may not burn as brightly in 1998 as it
did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And apartment rental rates and occupancy rates are definitely
high, said Steve Sweet of Gables Residential Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very healthy right now,'' Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McWherter, a realty broker with CB Richard Ellis, said he
has sold Houston-area land for four apartment construction sites so
far this year and he has another transaction in progress.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said in the last three weeks, he has seen the first
sign of fear among developers that they may be building too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of these smaller developers getting
nervous,'' McWherter said.
</P>
<P>
   McWherter said he knows of two small apartment developers that
had options to buy land, but decided to sell the options contracts
to larger developers in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Developers from all over the nation have been flocking to
Houston and the city's native developers are holding their own in
the construction boom, McWherter said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Careful budgeting can keep couples ahead of money
squabbles
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be hard for newlyweds to accept, but it's true: Most
married couples fight about money.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the issue is straightforward, like keeping the
checkbook legible and up-to-date. Sometimes it's more complicated,
like establishing a budget or managing credit cards. Sometimes it's
both financial and emotional _ like finding out which spouse gets
to gratify which wishes.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone survey earlier this year, Minneapolis-based
Lutheran Brotherhood financial services company found that only 28
percent of married couples never disagree about handling their
money.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another truth: Most of these problems can be resolved
without the help of financial advisers, accountants or referees.
More often than not, the hardest part is just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with setting aside the time to talk about money,''
said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Greater Atlanta. ``Discussing the issues calmly can
prevent the situation from overheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's some other timely advice for newlyweds on melding their
financial lives:
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep no secrets. ``Honesty and trust are the hallmarks of a
strong relationship,'' Boas said. ``You need to commit to
discussing your financial positions openly.'' That includes both
assets and liability _ how much you own and how much you owe.
</P>
<P>
   -- Establish ground rules. If there is any chance of conflict,
agree in advance to remain calm, avoid character attacks and
postpone the discussion if things get too heated. The counseling
service also suggests picking a quiet and private place to talk.
</P>
<P>
   -- Share your experiences. ``Tell how money was handled in each
of your households growing up, and how you view money today as a
result,'' Boas said. ``You must realize that families have
different approaches to finances, and you must try to remain
non-judgmental about your partner's experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Agree on priorities. This is a two-step process. The first is
for each spouse, separately, to write down both short- and
long-term priorities. You might include getting out of debt, saving
for vacations and other major spending items, setting up an
emergency fund, starting a family and even saving for retirement.
Step two is to combine your lists, so you agree to work toward the
same goals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Count your pennies. For at least a month, each spouse needs
to keep a day-by-day spending diary. That includes everything, from
utility bills to lunch money. At the end of the month, you'll be
ready to sort out your spending into necessities, niceties and
downright frivolous spending.
</P>
<P>
   -- Develop a budget. Write down in one place all your income
sources and all the expenses you've been tracking in your diaries.
You can find a useful worksheet on the Internet at
http://www.cccsatl.org/money .htm. It is interactive, meaning that
you can type in your numbers and the machine will handle the adding
and subtracting for you.
</P>
<P>
   With these numbers gathered and organized, you're ready to move
from what you have been doing to what you want to do. For example,
you may find you're spending more than you earn. If that's so,
check out your entries and find places to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   You're also ready to start moving ahead. If your first priority
is saving for a rainy day, you can see how much extra income is
available. Or, you can go back into those relatively frivolous
spending categories and cut some more.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stay in touch. As you move along, your priorities will
change. So will your income. You'll need to check how well you're
sticking to your budget, and how you need to adjust it.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this as a joint endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a right or wrong way to manage expenses in a
marriage,'' said Cathy Egan, Lutheran Brotherhood's family
financial specialist. ``To avoid money quarrels, couples need to
mutually choose the method that works best for their situation and
then follow through.''

CALIFORNIA EXECUTES RAPIST WHO KILLED VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD and MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Smiling broadly and professing his innocence to
the end, Thomas M. Thompson was executed by lethal injection in San
Quentin's death chamber early Tuesday for a 17-year-old rape and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fifth convict to be executed in California since the
death penalty resumed six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 17 years, the attorney general has been pursuing the wrong
man,'' Thompson said in a statement to Warden Arthur Calderon 45
minutes before he died. ``In time, he will come to know this. I do
not want anyone to avenge my death. Instead, I want you to stop
killing people. God bless.''
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Dan Lungren, who was at the prison
but did not watch the execution, was unmoved by Thompson's last
words, saying it ended a process that went on far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake about this, Mr. Thompson is a guilty
man,'' said Lungren, a Republican who is running for governor.
``There can be no question of guilt in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 43, was convicted of the 1981 rape and murder of
Ginger Fleischli, 20. He was the first of the state's five men
executed this decade who was not a multiple murderer, the first to
have no prior criminal record and the first to declare his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Fleischli, the brother of Thompson's victim, watched
Thompson die and said it was a fitting punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The execution came nearly 17 years after Thompson raped, then
murdered Ginger Fleischli by plunging a knife several times into
her head.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has always maintained his innocence, but his attorney's
main legal argument to prevent his execution has been that he and
Fleischli had consensual sex so there was no rape. Consequently,
they argued, the death penalty did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Saturday did not
agree, nor did the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, clearing the way
for the execution to take place.
</P>
<P>
   As the execution was carried out inside the heavily guarded,
maximum-security prison, about 250 anti-death penalty protesters
marched outside. There were a couple of pro-death penalty
demonstrators, but there were no major clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ordered the same last meal he asked for in August _
king crab legs with melted butter, Mandarin-style pork spare ribs,
spinach salad, pork fried rice, a chocolate sundae and a six-pack
of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson came within six hours of being executed in August
before the Supreme Court stopped it to allow time for more appeals.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, about two dozen people, including relatives of both
Thompson and his victim, witnessed the execution. Curtains,
shielding the people who had strapped Thompson down and inserted
the IV tubes into his arms, were drawn back at about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, arms outstretched, lay strapped to a table in what
used to be the gas chamber, now reconfigured for death by lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said Thompson seemed calm and mouthed messages to
friends and relatives on the other side of the heavy-duty glass
separating the death chamber from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a friend, Rita Barker, blew kisses to Thompson and
sobbingly mouthed the words, ``I love you'' and Thompson appeared
to reply, ``I know.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled broadly and one witness said he seemed to be trying to
put family and friends at ease. At one point, he mouthed, ``Bye,''
according to one witness.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 12:01 a.m., Thompson received an injection of sodium
pentothal to put him to sleep, pancuronium bromide to stop his
breathing and potassium chloride to stop his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead at 12:06 a.m.

HERB LESSONS ON A PLATTER IN VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent trip to Vietnam taught me a great lesson in how to use
herbs _ and lots of them. It was a lesson that was, quite
literally, handed to me on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after arriving in Ho Chi Minh City, which most locals
still seem to call Saigon, I was taken by a companion's relatives
for my first meal. Dishes began arriving almost immediately, along
with a plate piled high with leaf after leaf of fresh herbs, stems
and all. Some, especially basil, dill, chives and cilantro, were
intimate dinner-table friends. Others, like saw-tooth herb (a
long-leafed version of cilantro), two kinds of mint and varieties
of what seemed to be borage and lovage, were herbs I had long grown
in my garden but had little success in making use of, at least not
in the sort of quantities that nature routinely produces.
</P>
<P>
   That's the continuing problem, one that everyone whose herb
garden is larger than a window box must cope with: Lovage will grow
to 10 feet in its second year. Mint will grow up your leg if you
walk too slowly. Yet, with few exceptions _ pesto chief among them
_ the European tradition of using herbs calls for a few leaves or
sprigs in cooking, or a tablespoon or two as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do with the rest of the bushel _ or for that matter
with the rest of the large clump you had to buy at the market to
obtain two or three pinches for a recipe?
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, where there is enough rain, heat and sun to grow
almost anything in large quantity, herbs are treated much like what
most Americans consider ``eating'' greens. They sometimes form the
bulk of salads and soups and are often used as wrappers, seasonings
and condiments.
</P>
<P>
   At this dinner, spring rolls containing pork, squid or shrimp
were wrapped in whole herbs, or in lettuce with some herb leaves
thrown in. Each bite of grilled pork balls, fried fish cakes or
soft-shell crab was taken with a few herbs. Eventually, the servers
brought huge bowls of a brilliant soup combining pineapple,
tamarind and tomato, and we all tore up our choice of herbs,
sprinkling them on the soup and changing its texture and flavor. By
the end of the meal, the herb platter was empty.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was repeated at the noodle shop I visited the next
morning. Although the offerings were varied _ I had hard-boiled
eggs in caramel sauce, tiny spareribs, fish with lemon grass,
sauteed zucchini-like squash _ the specialty was pho bo, the
ubiquitous beef-and-noodle soup that is eaten at any time of the
day. The base of pho bo is a strong meat stock, and it almost
always contains thinly sliced beef, bean sprouts and rice noodles,
and often tofu, egg, vegetables, pate and other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Though the components are bland, it's the do-it-yourself nature
of pho that defines its character. The soup is always served with
minced chilies, lime wedges and a heaping plate of, yes, herbs,
usually basil, mint, cilantro and saw-tooth herb and often one or
two others. Again, I sat in front of my soup tearing handfuls of
herbs _ a half cup or more _ into it, tasting and retasting for the
right balance of flavors and textures. By the time I was done, I'd
used as many herbs in a bowl of soup as in a couple days of
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, when my herbs started appearing, I was ready. I
began using whole herb leaves rather than nicely minced bits; the
flavor is certainly more intense, and the change is positive (I
don't recommend this with overpowering herbs like rosemary). Then I
began bringing plates of herbs to the table at many meals, where I
encouraged everyone to tear them into salads, shower them onto
pasta, throw them in sandwiches _ always to taste. When that wasn't
enough, I taught myself how to make pho. Of course, I still can't
keep up with my garden's production, but at least I'm making a
dent.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAMESE BEEF-AND-NOODLE SOUP (PHO BO)
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { pound thin rice noodles (labeled ``vermicelli'' or ``rice
sticks'')
</P>
<P>
   8 cups rich beef or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   4 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 1-inch chunk peeled fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, quartered (don't bother to peel)
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless sirloin, tenderloin or round (chicken may be
substituted), cut into 16 thin slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fish sauce (nam pla or nuoc mam, available at
Asian markets) or soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 limes, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   8 scallions, minced
</P>
<P>
   Several Thai or other chilies, stemmed, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   A heaping plate of mixed herbs, washed and dried: basil,
cilantro and mint are most important, but chervil, lovage, parsley,
shiso, dill, marjoram and other tender herbs are all appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   1. Soak rice noodles in hot water to cover.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, combine stock, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, onion
and cloves in saucepan; turn heat to high. When mixture boils, turn
heat to low, and cover. Let cook, undisturbed, for 20 minutes to 1
hour, depending on how much time you have (the longer the cooking,
the deeper the flavor). Strain, and return to saucepan; turn heat
to medium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Bring pot of water to boil. Drain noodles, add them to pot,
and boil for 30 seconds; drain well. Warm 4 large bowls by filling
them with hot water; discard water. Divide noodles among bowls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn heat under soup to medium, and add beef; stir once, and
then turn off heat. (The meat is traditionally left rare; if you
want to cook it more, go ahead, but these slices will cook through
in less than 2 minutes.) Add fish sauce or soy sauce and plenty of
pepper to the soup. Taste, and add salt or more seasoning, if
necessary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Top noodles with broth and meat, and then bring to the table.
Serve, passing lime wedges, scallions, chilies and herbs at the
table, so that everyone can add them to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the sun is setting, the final notes of music slide
off the dock, skip across the water and disappear into the trees. A
swan glides into view, tracing a graceful path through the last of
the light. Birds swoop and call; a gondola appears on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a grip,'' an inner voice says. ``Have you had too much
wine? It's only Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band is playing on a warm summer evening, it is easy to
fall under the spell of the new restaurant at the Loeb Boathouse.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan may have no more bucolic retreat, but the owners,
Frank and Jeanne Cretella, have finally understood that trees alone
do not make the spot special. It is the city surrounding Central
Park that makes the Boathouse seem so magical. And so they have, at
last, transformed the casually rustic Boathouse Cafe into Park
View, a restaurant with finesse. Sitting outside on the terraced
dock and gazing at the skyscrapers that peek over the trees, it is
easy to imagine that Fred Astaire will appear at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Park View is just beginning to take root in Central Park. Open
only since April, it is still immature. On days when everything is
going smoothly, the food and service are good enough to show how
much promise the place has.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the food is disappointing and the service slow, it
is heartening to know that after 12 years the Cretellas have
finally seen the real potential of the place. This year they
invested $500,000 to create a serious restaurant that intends to
welcome diners all year long. For summer, they have covered the
dock with a canvas roof; in the winter, they are planning to serve
a game menu by the new indoor fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Tavern on the Green may be a perfect place for
tourists, but Park View, hidden in the center of the park so that
it can be reached only by trolley or by foot, belongs to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Cretellas, who also own Lundy's in Sheepshead Bay
and the new American Park at the Battery, took over the Loeb
Boathouse and created a casual American cafe. They expanded the
following year and eventually turned the place into an Italian
restaurant. In 1993, it became a seafood restaurant. But during all
those incarnations it never seemed like more than a pretty place
turning out large quantities of food.
</P>
<P>
   Volume is still a problem _ the restaurant serves about 600
meals a day on weekends. But the new chef, John Villa, formerly of
Judson Grill, has done his best to create an interesting menu that
is an ode to the New York melting pot, offering everything from
Vietnamese rice-paper rolls to goat cheese ravioli and a foie gras
terrine.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Peter Cassell, has given the restaurant a patina of
laid-back elegance that seems just right. He is savvy enough to
separate the starry-eyed couples holding hands at water's edge from
the children intent on feeding the birds. And he can discuss the
interesting wine list with admirable passion. What he can't seem to
do is speed up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in his right mind would want to hurry through dinner at
Park View, but I have had nights when I longed for the food finally
to appear. Most evenings my guests and I ate our way through the
bread basket long before the appetizers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Indian spiced salmon tartar, which was ground
too finely and served on soggy papadums, this was not a terrible
thing. I was not in a big hurry for the baked fig salad, either;
the figs wrapped in prosciutto with Gorgonzola and an almond
vinaigrette were too ornate to tempt me.
</P>
<P>
   But when the refreshing rice-paper rolls filled with shrimp and
cellophane noodles finally showed up, I was sorry that my appetite
was not sharper. The terrine of foie gras and hazelnuts also made
me wish that I had not eaten quite so many rolls. But my real
regret came when I was served the marinated sashimi, which is
listed on the menu as ``chef's selection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the sashimi?'' I had asked the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw fish,'' he replied. Pressed to describe what sort of raw
fish was being served, he allowed as to how it was tuna and striped
bass. So I was not prepared to find that the sliced raw fish was
hidden beneath a tangle of pea shoots and peppers; nor was I
prepared for it to be so completely delicious. Malpeque oysters
were good, too, served with an intriguing mignonette of sake and
pickled plums.
</P>
<P>
   As the night gets darker and the lights flicker on, Park View
becomes even more charming. This makes it easy to appreciate
Villa's grilled halibut with radicchio and grilled potatoes in a
caper and green peppercorn vinaigrette. The simply roasted rack of
lamb, covered with herbs and served with a fine potato gratin, is
also excellent. A big chunk of coriander-spiced tuna loin, served
rare with mango salsa, is truly delicious. And Villa's version of
surf and turf, lobster tail with an Asian-accented breast of squab,
is a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   These dishes are successful because they are simple, but some of
the more creative entrees don't work. The red snapper, for
instance, which is poached in milk and served with salmon roe, has
a distressingly soggy texture. Roasted monkfish is overwhelmed by
Moroccan spices (chermoula, preserved lemons and mint). And saddle
of rabbit is rolled around rosemary skewers so that each slice of
roasted meat looks strangely like a gray carrot.
</P>
<P>
   But even when you are eating one of the less fortunate entrees,
the staff at Park View is so pleasant and the setting so swell that
you feel lucky to be there. The live jazz at the adjacent cafe,
which is still called the Boathouse Cafe, is a real bonus. And if
you end your meal with the sweet, rich tres leches cake topped with
white chocolate mousse and a raspberry coulis, or caramelized mango
with coconut sorbet and macadamia crunch, you might just go dancing
off into the dark.

IMPROVISING A SALAD FROM THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fourth of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the former
chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of ``Vegetarian
Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark Bittman.) 
(HLW)  
 By DEBORAH MADISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was the chef at Greens, the vegetarian
restaurant in San Francisco, we were affiliated with Green Gulch
Farm, which was just across the Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin
County. I lived at the farm and worked closely with the head
gardener, and together we found and grew unusual seeds. As a
result, we were able to serve all kinds of exotic vegetables at the
restaurant. Although today it's expected that a restaurant of any
stature will be working with farmers or even have its own farm, in
1979 this was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   After driving the crates of produce across the bridge to the
restaurant, more often than not I found that I had nothing in
enough quantity to feature by itself. So one of my menu standards
was what we called Farm Salad _ a composed salad of raw, steamed,
pickled and grilled vegetables, with a few sauces, usually
accompanied by a wedge of frittata or some hard-cooked eggs, also
from the farm. By necessity, these salads were ever-changing, but
all presented a variety of tastes and textures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I choose vegetables from the farmers' market and my small
garden, and I've vastly simplified the number of ingredients and
the method, using just one dressing for everything. I steam or
parboil most of the vegetables, but there is certainly room for raw
vegetables, grilled peppers or onions, and pickled vegetables or
olives. This dish allows you to improvise based on what's around
and how much you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   These days, I like a pestolike dressing based on fresh, fragrant
marjoram. Like basil, marjoram is widely used in Liguria, the
region around the Italian Riviera. Marjoram has a wonderful,
powerful flavor, and it's tied together here with other typical
ingredients, like capers, pine nuts and olives, in a sauce akin to
one used in the Ligurian salad called cappon magro, which is
usually composed of a variety of fish and vegetables. (If you want
to add cold steamed or grilled fish to the farm salad, it's
perfectly appropriate.) I find it difficult to avoid eating this
delicious sauce with a spoon or spreading it on bread.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sauce recipe below is fairly precise, the vegetable
suggestions are just that: suggestions. If you figure at least 12
ounces of vegetables a person, along with a little protein _ in the
form of hard-boiled egg, fish or a combination _ the meal will work
out fine.
</P>
<P>
   FARM SALAD WITH MARJORAM SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   4 medium beets, or more small ones
</P>
<P>
   12 small new potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound green beans, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   4 to 8 small carrots, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 red onions, peeled and cut into half-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   2 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 {-inch-thick slice good white bread, crusts trimmed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons marjoram leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons drained capers
</P>
<P>
   { cup pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely minced parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pitted olives, like nicoise
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   12 radishes, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   4 to 8 pickled artichoke hearts (canned are fine)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium cucumber, trimmed and cut into eighths
</P>
<P>
   4 hard-cooked eggs, cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   1. In separate batches, steam or parboil beets, potatoes, green
beans and carrots, until each is tender. Plunge into ice water to
cool. Peel beets and potatoes if you like; cut into wedges if they
are large. Cut green beans and carrots into 2-inch lengths if
large. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Grill or broil the onion and zucchini, brushing occasionally
with the 2 tablespoons of olive oil, until tender. Refrigerate
until ready to serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Soak bread in vinegar. In a mortar and pestle or small food
processor, combine garlic, marjoram, capers, pine nuts, parsley and
olives; grind until coarse but not pureed. Add the bread and the {
cup olive oil, and grind some more _ again, the texture should be
coarse. (If you're using a food processor, pulse on and off to
maintain control over the texture.) Season with salt and pepper,
and add a little more olive oil and/or vinegar if necessary, to
thin; the sauce, however, should be pasty rather than creamy.
Refrigerate until ready to serve, for up to a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, bring any refrigerated ingredients to room
temperature. Decorate a platter with the vegetables and egg, and
place the sauce in a bowl in the middle. Serve, using the marjoram
sauce as a dip for the other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

SALVIANO ORVIETO CLASSICO 1996, UMBRIA, ITALY. ABOUT $12. 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Italy leads the world in the production of top quality wines at
moderate prices, as this exceptional Orvieto readily attests.
Orvieto, an hour's drive north of Rome, is a delightful small city,
which gives its name to one of Italy's best-known white wines.
</P>
<P>
   The prescribed formula for Orvieto permits a wide choice of
grapes in the blend, but the base wine is invariably the dull
trebbiano. The Tenuta di Salviano estate rescues this wine, of
which about 40 percent is trebbiano, by adding verdello, grechetto,
chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, malvasia and drupeggio _ a new one to
me. The result is a golden, fragrant, surprisingly complex wine to
go with Italian cheese and seafood.

&HT;        MAINE'S SALMON INDUSTRY NETS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 14 -- Maine salmon farmers scored a major
victory Tuesday as the International Trade Commission left in tact
duties against the largest importers of Chilean salmon.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 vote, the ITC determined that Maine's $45 million
Atlantic salmon industry had been financially injured by Chile's
salmon companies, whom, the U.S. Commerce Department says, have
been dumping their product on the U.S. product at below-market
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision means that the federal government will
continue to impose an average duty of 4.54 percent per pound of
salmon imported by three Chilean salmon producers, a small tariff
by any measure but still significant to Maine's industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has basically saved this industry,'' said Michael J.
Coursey, who represented Maine's interests before the ITC.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's salmon growers contend that more important than the size
of the duty is the increased supervision Chilean salmon will face
from U.S. Customs. ``It's like knowing your income-tax return will
be audited every year,'' said Coursey, of the Washington law firm
of Collier, Shannon, Rill &AMP; Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC board members did not release their opinions, so little
is known about why they voted the way they did. But the lone
dissenting member, Carol T. Crawford, said she felt that Coursey
had not proved that Chilean salmon imports had injured the domestic
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even close,'' Crawford said in a brief interview.
</P>
<P>
   If one more member of the ITC had agreed with Crawford, the duty
on Chilean salmon would have disappeared just six months after the
Commerce Department imposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In an investigation prompted by complaints from Maine salmon
growers, Commerce determined that three Chilean companies were
guilty of dumping their product, and imposed a duty of 5.19 percent
-- which was revised to 4.54 percent earlier this month due to
technical corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC's job was to determine if the U.S. industry had been
hurt by the dumping; otherwise, there was no need for the duty.
After a lengthy hearing in early June, ITC members Lynn Bragg and
Marcia Miller agreed Tuesday to leave the duty in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten back to a level playing field,'' said Joe
McGonigle, head of the Coalition for Fair Salmon Trade, a
Maine-based group.
</P>
<P>
   But Chile's salmon industry is still considering its options.
Either Chile's industry can appeal the decision to the U.S. Court
of International Trade, or get the government of Chile to sue
Commerce and the ITC in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Maine's salmon farmers) are suffering any problems, it's
not because of us,'' said Richard Johnson, of the Washington law
firm Arnold &AMP; Porter, who represented Chile's interests. Johnson
contended that Maine's industry was suffering from increased
competition from Norway, Canada and Chile, but not from price
dumping.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted Maine's salmon industry -- which employs 960
workers, mostly in Washington and Hancock counties -- would see
little benefit from the duty, a prediction McGonigle said was
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has been cut in half in recent years. Those
(salmon) farms went out of business almost exclusively because of
Chilean dumping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a battle that focused on a relatively small part of the
fishing industry, both sides have brought in two of the biggest law
firms in Washington on trade issues. Also on the side of Chile was
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, whose firm of Verner,
Liipfert, Bernhard and McPherson was hired by the National
Restaurant Association and several airlines that benefit from
buying and transporting the cheap salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's congressional delegation united in opposition to Chile's
hired guns. ``Today's decision is a victory for fair trade against
the onslaught of Chilean imports,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms what Maine salmon producers have known all along
-- Chilean salmon is being priced below market value,'' said Rep.
John Baldacci, D-Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chilean salmon growers want to compete in our markets, they
will have to do so fairly,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Chile's attorney, said his clients will not be deterred
and will continue to compete. ``They intend to get back to
business,'' he said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Hail this great ale arriving in Atlanta
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing to get straight is the apostrophe.
</P>
<P>
   It's Tuppers' Hop Pocket Ale, not Tupper's. God is in the
details, one of the philosophers said, and there's something of the
divine in this beer just now arriving in the Atlanta market.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard about Tuppers' Hop Pocket _ or simply the Pocket, as
it's sometimes called _ from friends in northern Virginia and the
D.C. area and might have thought it was a cult beer. That's how
fervent its devotees were. But these were not cultists. They were
reasonably sane people, most of them, with a passion for beer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, Tuppers' Hop Pocket won the gold medal for
American-style pale ales at the Great American Beer Festival in
Denver. No other category was so competitive. In blind tastings,
certified judges ranked Tuppers' Hop Pocket best among 109
entrants. It was no longer that beer from the Washington suburbs
with the curious name. (It comes from an old English term for a
sack in which hops were toted.)
</P>
<P>
   My first opportunity to sit down with this deep, harvest-gold
beer was over the Christmas holidays in Middleburg, Va., a few
miles away from Old Dominion Brewing Co., where it's brewed. What
strikes anyone on first tasting is the magnificent crown, the huge
aroma, the very long, slightly dry finish. Here is a beer that
didn't exist five years ago and only a handful of ales in the world
bear comparison with it.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer still have origins so unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In their nearly 30 years of marriage, Bob and Ellie Tupper have
made it their avocation to taste beers around the world. Not just
taste them, but take careful notes and assiduously catalog them
all. Lagers common and classic, ales of every kind _ the Tuppers
have note cards on beers by the thousand. (They come by this
studiousness honestly _ he teaches history at a prep school in
Maryland, she is an editor at the American Society for
Microbiology.)
</P>
<P>
   But there was one that had eluded them. Neither in the historic
brewing lands _ Germany and Czechoslovakia, Britain and Belgium _
nor in the revivalist microbreweries of the United States had they
found quite what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   What they had in mind, it turns out, didn't exist. At least not
as they conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   So, a few years ago, they approached their friend Jerry Bailey,
founder of Old Dominion in Ashburn, Va., which already was brewing
beers of distinction (while Hop Pocket was winning its gold medal
last year, Old Dominion Lager was winning in its own category).
</P>
<P>
   They described to Bailey a beer that would be emphatically an
ale _ Anchor Liberty was an inspiration _ but with certain lager
qualities. Although Bob Tupper had done some homebrewing, he knew
that only an artisan could put the idea into a glass.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to marry the piney, grapefruitlike character of the
Cascade hop _ pronounced in Anchor Liberty _ to the spicy, earthy
notes of Mount Hood hops. ``It seemed like every time we tasted an
ale we really liked, it had Mount Hoods,'' Bob Tupper says. ``We
thought, `Why aren't more people doing this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Galena and Willamette hops are also part of the recipe, but it's
the Cascades and Mount Hoods that come through.
</P>
<P>
   And there's one thing more: The beer undergoes a secondary
fermentation of up to six weeks _ far longer than most ales. The
result is a voluptuousness few ales achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The person who's never had a Tuppers' Hop Pocket can get a hint
of it by comparing the bouquet and taste of an Anchor Liberty with
those of a Samuel Adams lager. In the one, you have an ale's
fruitiness distinctly accented by Cascade hops; in the other, the
leanness of a lager subtly spiced by Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops
(also Tettnangs), a botanical cousin of Mount Hoods.
</P>
<P>
   But this would be a hint, nothing more. For one thing, Mount
Hoods are a little spicier, more earthy than Hallertaus. For
another, Hop Pocket is more assertive than even Anchor Liberty (60
International Bitterness Units, Bob Tupper estimates). The
hoppiness is balanced by a firm malt backbone, the two of them
together producing an ale of enormous complexity. For my money,
this is the most notable addition to Atlanta's beer scene in years.
</P>
<P>
   Its distributor, Thunder Head Distribution Services, has lined
up accounts at most major package stores as well as grocery stores
such as Harry's Farmers Market. Six-packs will cost about $7.
</P>
<P>
   Places where it will be available on draft include, so far,
Twain's in Decatur; Gravity Pub in East Atlanta; Yakatori, a
Japanese restaurant in Buckhead; Wild Wings Cafe in Marietta;
Monkey Barrel in Gainesville; and the Taco Mac pubs in Sandy
Springs and Snellville.
</P>
<P>
   But these are mere commercial details, necessary only to
experience the ones that are nothing less than heavenly.

 &HT;    For entertaining during summer, do as the Tuscans do: Relax and
be your own guest
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The guests for your small dinner party are due any moment. And
if you're like the most prepared of overprepared hosts, your ``to
do'' list already boasts enough columns of check marks to choke
Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Roast in the oven? Check. Silver polished? Check. Newly
purchased antique clothes collection organized on conspicuous
coatrack (as Stewart suggests in one of her books)? Check.
</P>
<P>
   But you did forget something very important. See, it's not on
your list. Right there, under ``guests'': You forgot to ``insert
your name here.''
</P>
<P>
   Be your own guest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's a dinner party concept you ought to be able to sink
your teeth into. Forget all the formality (and especially the
waxing of floors). Entertain yourself while entertaining friends.
Sit calmly while enjoying everyone's company. Eat well-prepared
food served family style from massive plates without constantly
jumping out of your seat to run to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen. And ``it's the way summer ought to be,'' says
Frances Mayes, author of The New York Times No. 1 best seller
``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' her homage to the wonders of living and
eating in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians take mealtime very seriously as a leisure activity
and a time to visit,'' Mayes says in a telephone interview from her
summer home near Cortona, in Tuscany in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed my cooking radically. I grew up cooking out of
Julia Child. I thought you had to spend all day. In Italy ... I
have absorbed an easier way of cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that ease comes because the hot days of summer lend
themselves well to chilled or room-temperature food, ensuring that
nearly the entire meal can be made days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner you serve for a small, casual gathering of friends
can still feel elaborate and substantial.
</P>
<P>
   But the simplicity and freshness of the ingredients in the
dishes you choose, and the know-how to spread cooking over several
days, can leave you the time to experience the luxury of being your
own dinner party guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer entertaining is an easy, fluid, carefree proposition,''
Molly O'Neill writes in her 1997 book ``The Pleasure of Your
Company.'' ``Guests are willing to be wooed in a more casual way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians of Tuscany have transformed it into an art.
</P>
<P>
   They often forgo strict courses. ``At my house in San Francisco,
one course is served, then it's cleared away, and then another is
brought out,'' Mayes says. In Tuscany, ``they make huge
arrangements on one platter. Antipasti become a regular part of the
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   And that meal, often consumed outdoors over an old table in a
rich garden setting of herbs, flowers and olive trees, takes on a
laid-back, communal nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the day, after the last bone has been tossed to the
dogs, the last bit of sauce scraped from the plate with a crust of
bread, someone ... pushes back from the table and brings out a
fisarmonica or piano accordion. Then the old songs begin,'' writes
Nancy Harmon Jenkins in her cookbook ``Flavors of Tuscany.''
``Children fall asleep in their mothers' arms, and the moon rises
over the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayes refers to such moments as ``delicious stupor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are doing what everyone else in Italy is doing _ millions
of backsides being shined by chairs at millions of tables,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for those times, ``cooking shouldn't be an ordeal,''
says Pino Luongo, creator of New York's Il Cantinori restaurant.
``It should be the pleasure of creating something you want to share
with the people you care most about.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that process of creating leaves time for the cook to
become a guest too, the rewards are as sweet as the world's best
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulders come down,'' Mayes says in describing the feeling
of being equal parts host and guest. ``I lose that kind of force
that I carry around with me that is there charging around in my
life.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Perfect planning can lead to a successful dinnner party
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's your small dinner party. You're the host. And food experts
such as Molly O'Neill say you ``must appear cool and unruffled,
offhand in attitude, disposed to easy and amiable chat.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty easy to say; pretty hard to live up to. But summer's the
time when being your own guest is easiest. Food can be made well
ahead, giving you the time to cool down and unruffle.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick tip list adapted from Jane Brody's ``Good Food
Gourmet'' that will help you on your way to amiability:
</P>
<P>
   -- Plan menu carefully. Start with dishes that can be made in
advance. The more you work ahead, the more time you'll have to
enjoy your own party.
</P>
<P>
   -- Consider refrigerator storage space. You'll have big platters
and bowls of food vying for cooling space, so plan to use up or
discard leftovers from other meals. Now is not the time to get the
urge to add a watermelon to the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plan on no more than one or two dishes that need last-minute
preparation. After company has arrived is no time to head for the
kitchen to preheat the oven and start a dish from scratch. Try to
have all the dishes done in advance, but tossing a salad, say, or
garnishing the meat dish is an easy chore that some of the guests
might even enjoy doing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't attempt more than you can do comfortably. If you're
running behind, for instance, skip making the soup.
</P>
<P>
   -- Formulate your menu game plan to leave time for other chores.
Plot when you'll make dishes in conjunction with setting the table,
gathering flowers, performing basic cleanup and other aspects of
getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't go overboard. For a dinner party with Hawaiian dishes,
Martha Stewart suggests transforming your dining room into a
tropical garden (borrowing or renting large plants and buying a few
exotic succulents). Surely she has lost her mind. You'll have a
better time at your own party if you turn down the decor switch and
let your great-looking and great-tasting food carry the day. Simple
flowers, plates and tableware will help establish a homier feel.
</P>
<P>
   SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Tomato-Bread Soup
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 hour 45 minutes Cooling time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   This dish, from Jenkins' ``Flavors of Tuscany,'' results in a
thick, comforting soup. While the instructions warn against
chilling the dish, you can refrigerate it if necessary and guests
will still rave.
</P>
<P>
   2pounds fresh red ripe tomatoes, cut in chunks
</P>
<P>
   1medium yellow onion, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1medium carrot, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1stalk celery, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4or 5 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2cloves garlic, peeled, crushed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2pound country-style bread, crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   1stalk basil
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil and basil for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes, onion, carrot, celery and parsley in a soup
kettle with about 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil and simmer,
uncovered, about 20 minutes or until vegetables are all very soft.
Midway through cooking, taste and add salt and pepper. Add a little
boiling water from time to time if necessary to keep the vegetables
from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   When vegetables are tender, remove kettle from heat and let cool
a little. Then put sauce through the fine disc of a food mill.
Strain the resulting puree if desired and set aside. You should
have about 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the
garlic and cook, stirring, until it softens (do not let it color).
</P>
<P>
   While garlic is cooking, tear bread into big pieces and add to
pan, together with basil and 2 cups boiling water. Cook the bread
and basil in the water, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up
the bread and, from time to time, adding up to 1 cup more water.
</P>
<P>
   When bread has thoroughly broken down and absorbed the water,
add 2 1/2 cups of the tomato puree and stir it in. Taste again and
adjust seasoning if necessary, adding a little sugar if desired.
Cook over very low heat, stirring frequently, for 1 hour longer,
adding a little more boiling water or hot tomato sauce to keep soup
from sticking. It should be very dense but you should still be able
to eat it with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   When soup is done, set it aside to cool to room temperature (do
not refrigerate). Remove and discard basil.
</P>
<P>
   Taste soup and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve each portion
with a bit of extra-virgin olive oil, garnished with a few basil
leaves.

<P>
   Marinated Zucchini
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 15-20 minutes Chilling time: overnight
</P>
<P>
   From Julia Della Croce's ``Antipasti: The Little Dishes of
Italy'' (Chronicle Books; $18.95), this appetizer can be served at
the same time as the other dishes. Try wrapping the zucchini around
cooked shrimp, expensive buffalo-milk mozzarella and black olives.
Toss a few extra olives on the plate as garnish.
</P>
<P>
   2pounds zucchini, each no more than 6 ounces
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil as needed
</P>
<P>
   5large cloves garlic, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chopped fresh basil, mint or parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Cut off stems and navels from
zucchini and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Generously
brush 2 baking sheets with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Place the zucchini slices on the sheets and brush tops with oil.
Bake on middle rack of preheated oven until tender and beginning to
brown, 15 to 20 minutes, turning slices once halfway through the
cooking and brushing the second side with more oil.
</P>
<P>
   Select serving dish in which you'll be able to put at least 3
layers of cooked zucchini slices. Arrange some of the zucchini in a
single layer. Drizzle generously with olive oil. Strew over some of
the garlic slices and the basil, mint or parsley and sprinkle with
some of the vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to layer zucchini slices, garlic, herbs and vinegar
until all the zucchini and garlic have been used. Sprinkle top
layer with oil, salt, pepper and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and chill overnight. The zucchini will keep well for
several days, but the flavors continue to sharpen.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Bring to room temperature.

</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Vitello Tonnato: Cold Sliced Veal With Tuna Sauce
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys of summer, this dish from Marcella Hazan's
``Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking'' (Knopf, $30) can be
served chilled or at room temperature. Instead of making your own
mayonnaise, you can substitute with store-bought and still achieve
remarkable results. Served in summer's heat, this is one dish you
have to keep an eye on to make sure it doesn't sit out too long.
</P>
<P>
   FOR POACHING MEAT:
</P>
<P>
   Lean veal roast (2-2 1/2 pounds), preferably the top round,
firmly trussed; or turkey breast or pork loin
</P>
<P>
   1medium carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1stalk celery without the leaves
</P>
<P>
   1medium onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   1dried bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   TUNA SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   17-ounce can imported tuna packed in olive oil
</P>
<P>
   5flat anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   1cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons capers
</P>
<P>
   1to 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   GARNISH:
</P>
<P>
   Thin slices of lemon
</P>
<P>
   Pitted black olives, cut
</P>
<P>
   into narrow wedges
</P>
<P>
   Whole capers
</P>
<P>
   Whole parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   Anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   In a pot just large enough to contain the veal (or turkey breast
or pork loin), put the meat, carrot, celery, onion, parsley, bay
leaf and just enough water to cover. Remove the meat and set it
aside. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil, then return the
meat to the pot. When the water resumes boiling, cover the pot,
adjust heat to cook at a gentle, steady simmer and cook for 2
hours. (If it's turkey breast, cook it 1 hour.) Remove the pot from
heat and allow the meat to cool in its broth.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the canned tuna and put in a food processor together with
the anchovies, olive oil, lemon juice and capers. Process until it
becomes a creamy, uniformly blended sauce. Remove the sauce from
the processor bowl and fold it gently but thoroughly into the
mayonnaise. You may not need any salt because both the anchovies
and capers supply it, but taste to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   When the meat is quite cold, retrieve it from its broth, place
it on a cutting board or other work surface, snip off and remove
the trussing strings and cut it into uniformly thin slices.
</P>
<P>
   Smear the bottom of a serving platter with some of the tuna
sauce. Over it spread a single layer of veal (or turkey or pork)
slices, meeting edge to edge and without overlapping. Cover with
sauce, then make another layer of meat slices and cover again with
sauce. Repeat the procedure until you have used up all the meat,
reserving enough sauce to blanket the topmost layer.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.
Veal will keep a week, turkey for 3 days. Bring to room temperature
before serving. When removing the plastic wrap, use a spatula to
even off the top, and garnish with some or all of the suggested
garnish ingredients in an agreeable pattern.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Basil and Lemon Chicken
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' (Broadway Books; $14),
author Frances Mayes includes recipes she's discovered in Tuscany.
This super-easy poultry dish works with the menu we created or can
be used, as Mayes suggests, accompanied by a platter of summer
squash and fresh tomatoes. It's good hot, warm or at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped spring onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup chopped basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1chicken, cut into 6 pieces
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Basil leaves and lemon slices for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, mix onions and
basil leaves. Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper and mix. Rub
mixture onto 6 chicken pieces and place in a well-oiled baking pan.
Dribble with a little olive oil. Roast, uncovered, at 350 degrees
for about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with more basil leaves and lemon slices.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Almond Cake
</P>
<P>
   An intricate dinner calls for a simple dessert. This cake, from
Hazan's ``Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking,'' is a firm but
fairly airy dessert that is catapulted to the heavens when topped
with cold, fresh berries tossed with a little sugar and
refrigerated for several hours to bring out the juices.
</P>
<P>
   10ounces (about 2 cups) shelled, unpeeled almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   8egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Peel of 1 lemon, grated without digging into the white pith
beneath
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   8- or 9-inch springform pan
</P>
<P>
   Butter for greasing pan
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put almonds and sugar in a blender
or food processor and grind to a fine consistency, turning the
motor on and off several times.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg whites with salt until they form stiff peaks. Add
the ground almonds and the grated lemon peel to the egg whites a
little bit at a time, folding them in gently but thoroughly. The
whites may deflate a bit, but if you mix carefully, there should be
no significant loss of volume. Add the flour, shaking a little of
it at a time through a strainer, and again, mixing gently.
</P>
<P>
   Smear the pan thickly with butter. Put the cake batter into the
pan, shaking the pan to level it off. Place the pan in the middle
of the oven and bake for 1 hour. Before removing it from the oven,
test the center of the cake by piercing it with a toothpick. If it
comes out dry, the cake is done. If it does not, cook a little
longer.
</P>
<P>
   When done, unlock the pan and remove the hoop. When the cake has
cooled to lukewarm, loosen it from the bottom of the pan. Serve
when it is completely cold. It will keep quite a while if stored in
a tin biscuit box.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Very Fresh Berries
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easier or better than mixing berries with a little
sugar, refrigerating them, then witnessing guests beating the
summer heat with a knockout dessert. Be sure when you put these
berries on slices of Almond Cake that the sweetened fruit juices at
the bottom of the bowl are also spooned on. Guests love that juicy
juice seeping into their cake. If you're really decadent, add a
scoop of French vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream and
a sprig of mint to each serving.
</P>
<P>
   6ounces fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   1pint fresh blueberries
</P>
<P>
   1pint fresh blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1pound fresh strawberries
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2sprigs fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Wash and drain the raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and
strawberries. Select appropriate salad bowl and into it place
blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. Trim leaves and coarse
tops off strawberries and cut them into sizes similar to the other
fruit. Add to bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon granulated sugar over the
berries and gently toss with a tablespoon. Repeat twice more.
Refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. Garnish with mint sprigs.

 &HT;    Snickers cake more decadent than the bars
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 16: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reason we love Snickers bars is the gooey combination of
chocolate, nuts and soft caramel. That's the same reason you'll
love a Snickers Cake, a decadent descendant of the beloved candy
bar. Reader Michele Tabor asked for it; several of you responded,
including one reader in Boulder, Colo., Barbara Ellwanger Kasc, who
saw the request in a Food section a friend in Atlanta had sent her.
We used the recipe sent to us from Elsie Reader of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The cake is delicious, but it can be lumpy and unattractive. If
that's a concern, consider sprinkling another cup of nuts on the
top. And because it's so moist, we recommend keeping it chilled
until serving.

 &HT;    Heart-pumping rafting, tortuous mountain-biking all part of the
fun
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryson City, N.C.--You've no doubt heard about the three most
important qualities in a piece of real estate: location, location,
location. The Nantahala Outdoor Center nails all three.
</P>
<P>
   Location: In the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest of
western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Location: Along the banks of the cold and rushing Nantahala
River.
</P>
<P>
   Location: Less than 10 miles from the Cheoah Ranger District's
Tsali Trails, world-renowned as some of the best paths for mountain
biking, horseback riding and hiking in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big part of our success _ it is a near-ideal
location,'' said Nantahala Outdoor Center founder Payson Kennedy,
who has seen gross revenue jump from $45,000 when he opened in 1972
to a projected $16 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The NOC offers a wide array of activities for those who like to
suck in their outdoors in big gulps. Located on both banks of the
Nantahala River in the narrow and steep Nantahala Gorge, the NOC is
best known as a whitewater haven.
</P>
<P>
   With 90,000 river guests last year, the NOC is by far the
largest of the 18 companies that offered guided raft trips or
equipment rentals to more than 200,000 customers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That barely suggests, though, the NOC's near-fanatical
popularity among serious river rats, those people you see driving
up the interstate with two or three kayaks fastened to their car
roofs like water-seeking missiles. On just about any given morning
_ no matter the weather, no matter the season _ you can find a
handful of kayakers finessing their skills before dawn in the 45-
to 50-degree ``Nanty.'' On weekends, there's a veritable logjam.
Nearly all of them put in and take out at NOC land.
</P>
<P>
   But the wet set doesn't have a monopoly at the NOC, which in the
past decade has become an area leader in the burgeoning sport of
mountain biking. With more than 70 mountain bikes in its fleet, the
NOC had more than 2,000 rentals last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NOC offers classes in mountain biking, canoeing
and kayaking and operates youth and corporate team-building
programs. Even though it's not part of the NOC, there's horseback
riding available at the nearby Nantahala Village Riding Stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning,'' Kennedy says, ``we wanted it to be an
outdoor center, not just a whitewater center.''
</P>
<P>
   The NOC also aims to become more of a hospitality center. Though
lodging is still regrettably scarce, the center is well on its way:
three restaurants (one offering fine dining, another has
stick-to-your ribs, carbo-and-protein-replenishing fare and the
third, fast food), five modern rental cabins, a hostel-like base
camp with semi-private bunk rooms and communal kitchen, dining room
and bathrooms, an outfitter's store and even a coin-operated
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the feet-numbing river and lung-busting mountains that
bring you here, so let's get started.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantahala River
</P>
<P>
   With rubber rafts tethered to its roof, a bus that has seen
younger days lumbers some eight miles up U.S. 19/74 to the put-in
point. This is a guided tour, meaning that one of the NOC's
seasoned staff members will accompany a small convoy of three or
four rafts down the river.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you'll have the guide in your boat and you
won't have to do much work other than to follow instructions.
Paddle left. Paddle right. All paddle. Stop. The guide takes care
to maneuver the craft through the rocks and rapids that can make
for an exhilarating _ or humbling _ ride.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, the guide opts to pilot another boat,
and four of us _ two adults, two teens _ are the captains of our
own ship. After a quick course on the basics, we are set loose. We
soon will get to know quite a few of the rocks and rapids
chillingly up close.
</P>
<P>
   Water for the dam-controlled Nantahala is released from a power
station just upstream from the put-in spot. The river drops an
average of 38 feet per mile for its eight-mile run. The first half,
with a drop of 49 feet per mile, has more fast water and dynamic
eddies than the more sedate home leg.
</P>
<P>
   All the major rapids have names, and the two biggest ones, both
Class III, are at either end of the trip. The rest of the journey
consists of mild to medium Class I and II rapids.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 yards after putting in you'll have to navigate the
Class III Patton's Run, a hard-right turn named in memory of
Nantahala River pioneer Charlie Patton. You're supposed to stay far
right, on the inside of the curve. We smacked into the rocks in the
middle of the river and got hung up like a rubberized beached
whale. Our deep embarrassment was tempered only by our frenetic
efforts to rock our boat off the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had we extricated ourselves than we had to negotiate
the Isle of Dumping, Tumble Dry and Pop 'n Run. By this time, only
a mile into the trip, we were soaked.
</P>
<P>
   So it went for the rest of our voyage. We got hung up on a few
rocks, spun out on some rapids. We managed to avoid Jaws and the
aptly named Pyramid Rock and shot through Quarry Rapids with nary a
concern. Then somewhere, I believe it was Little SOB Rapid, with
rocks projecting from both sides of the river, we hit something and
the paddle flew out of my hands a good 10 feet into the air and _
kerplunk _ into the river.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two hours, we approached the end of our trip and
stopped to reconnoiter the other Class III rapid, Nantahala Falls.
You're supposed to run the falls by starting on the far left and
cutting diagonally right after the first drop. Ideally, you end up
in the middle of the falls and brace through the violent wave at
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   We came close. Everything was fine, in fact, until we turned
sideways just before we shot over the drop. We went flying all over
the boat like four circus trampoline performers, clutching at the
sides and each other while getting the splash of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but no one went overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tsali Trails
</P>
<P>
   It's pronounced SAW-lee. But after two days of mountain biking
some of its 40 miles of single-track trails, I was pronouncing it
SAW-ree, as in sorry, as in how I felt. You want a leg-killing
mountain bike workout with scenic vistas, backwoods beauty and
lung-popping climbs, this is the place.
</P>
<P>
   Although as thousands of dirt riders agree, it's still possible
to avoid crowds. We hardly saw anyone on a couple of recent midweek
rides.
</P>
<P>
   Initially developed as horse-riding trails, the two-wheeled set
discovered Tsali a few years ago and now greatly outnumber their
four-legged counterparts. But unlike other places where hikers and
horse riders often battle with cyclists, a voluntary scheduling
system keeps the peace here.
</P>
<P>
   Tsali is divided into two segments of two trails each: the Right
and Left loops comprise one segment, while Mouse Branch and
Thompson loops make up the second part. You can bike Mouse Branch
and Thompson on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The Right and
Left loops are open to bikes on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and
Sundays. Horses use the trails closed to bikes. Hikers can walk any
day.
</P>
<P>
   Our riding group of five took the 7.4-mile Thompson Loop our
first day. We started furiously fast on a dirt road for a half mile
before turning into the woods _ and straight up a hill. I gasped
for air and thought about how I was in for a long afternoon. This
would also be the last time I saw the two teens in our group, who
blasted away as if on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The next six miles were a succession of laurel thickets,
rhododendron tunnels, creek crossings and the scarily narrow
mountainside trail through hardwood forests. At one point, we rode
high above Lake Fontana, which looked cool and shimmeringly
inviting. I stopped at a few clearings, ostensibly to take in the
view of the Smoky Mountains on the horizon, though I think my loud
wheezing gave me away.
</P>
<P>
   The last mile or so we spent on a bumpy thrill-ride descent that
brought us back to the dirt road and our van in the parking lot.
The two teens had been waiting for us for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The second day, we took the trail up to the cliff overlook above
Lake Fontana. Any climbing we had done the day before seemed
inconsequential compared to the effort it took to reach the
overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I took a more scenic pace and the two teens left us
choking on their dust. We met up with them atop the overlook, where
we sat to grab a snack and some refreshments while we drank in the
view.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, across Lake Fontana, lay the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park and Clingman's Dome, at 6,642 feet the highest point
in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   We knew it was time to hop back on the bikes and leave when a
flock of turkey buzzards that had been circling lazily across the
lake drifted our way and started maneuvering above us. Even they
could tell we were cooked.
</P>
<P>
   We made it back to the van around sunset, tired, famished and
completely satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I wasn't feeling so Saw-ree after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not much of the nation's business is getting done
in Congress these days _ and while voters and Washington insiders
seem temporarily to prefer it that way, ultimately the country is
likely to favor a sound legislative record over conspicuous
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton squarely blames the inaction on the
Republicans, faulting the majority party for a ``do-nothing
Congress'' callously neglecting urgent public needs. Clinton argues
that GOP incumbents are ignoring their responsibilities by going
along with polls showing voters like the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) recently returned
the favor by contending the current political gridlock is all the
president's fault for being out of town so much. Lott called
Clinton a political ``bystander'' too preoccupied with his personal
legal problems to become adequately engaged in national issues.
</P>
<P>
   This fingerpointing ironically acknowledges the mutual power of
the partisan opponents and concedes that in today's Washington
politics it takes two to tango.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 40 working days remain in this congressional session
while the countdown toward the fall campaigns for survival steadily
increases the pressure for more confrontation, not less. Bad
tempers and bad policies are an unfortunate consequence of the fact
that the combatant teams are reasonably well-matched.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of blame, as on practically everything else in
this highly politicized town, there are two sides. The Republicans
have done everything they could to block the president's
initiatives. They see him as a lame duck, discredited by scandal
and politically impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats have countered by blocking the GOP
agenda, reinforced by the president's veto when necessary. In their
frustration, Clinton and his party have been increasingly united
against the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties' philosophical differences are so intense that
neither side has been interested in compromising on their rival,
incompatible agendas. And they would rather run on their favorite
issues for the fall campaign than a record of muddy legislation
that does not satisfy their key constituencies demanding all or
nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional GOP majority is checked by the presidential
veto, a sufficient Democratic margin in the Senate to sustain a
filibuster and the skimpy, uncertain 11 votes by which Republicans
control the House. The Democrats are checked by their congressional
minority role, which denies them committee chairmanships, the power
to issue subpoenas and control over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The sole major legislative accomplishment this year is reform of
the Internal Revenue Service, which passed both houses with
bipartisan support and which the president has promised to sign.
Nobody defends the dreaded tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders have stalled antitobacco legislation, campaign
finance reform and new authority for patients in dealing with
managed health care plans. Although the president has threatened to
veto any bill containing abortion limitations, subsidies for
parochial schools or sanctions on companies selling missile
technology to Iran, the Republicans have added them to broader
measures anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, for their part, retaliated by attaching the
blocked managed-care bill to an essential administration spending
measure, which Lott then yanked from the Senate floor. Republicans
belatedly plan to propose their own watered-down version, which
Democrats are sure to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., also threatens to tie up
the Senate by pulling similar amendment-attaching stunts to force a
vote on other GOP-blocked measures. In addition the Democrats are
filibustering a product liability bill sought by Republicans and
attacking the GOP for failing to pass funding for education and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is countering by holding up all administration judicial and
diplomatic nominees.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes on Capitol Hill. Round and round, getting
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The president, for his part, has been trying to do incrementally
by executive order what he can't get Congress to do by legislation.
Such actions ``may be good for media publicity,'' Lott sniffed,
``but they aren't good leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Lott conceded, the president's strategy creates at least
the illusion of action, however limited, in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress refused to fully fund his proposal to add new
inspectors to ferret out tainted foods, Clinton unilaterally
ordered that warning labels be put on fruit and vegetable juices
that have not been pasteurized. After the Senate rejected
antismoking legislation, Clinton announced a survey of which brands
teen-agers smoke. After Congress balked at his health care reforms,
he instructed federal agencies to sign up millions more poor
children for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   None of these are blockbusters, but they are better than the
nothing we are getting from Congress.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abram Orwasher is a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said the other day in his little office, ``bread
is rye bread, although I admit that these days it's not the
fashionable thing in New York. It's focaccia, ciabatta, sourdough,
country French, artisan bread, whatever artisan bread is. We sell
to all the big guys _ Zabar's, Dean &AMP; Deluca, Balducci's _ but they
don't buy a lot of rye bread these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're missing out on the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwasher's Bakery still makes rye, in several styles, makes it
the old-fashioned way, by hand, using a rye sour starter that has
never been remade in 80 years, and bakes it in brick-hearth ovens
in the shop's basement. It has been at it since 1916, for three
generations, at the same address, 308 East 78th Street, in what
used to be the Hungarian section of Yorkville. You can buy bread
upstairs off old wooden shelves, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Orwasher talk, you would think he learned to bake
in Germany. He rattles off the ingredients _ just yeast, salt,
flour, water, sour. Period. No bases, no shortcuts, no enhancers,
no emulsifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what an emulsifier is, actually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Orwasher, who learned to bake from his father
and is now 47, tried a new convection oven, but it didn't last
long. He took one look at the first rack of rolls and said,
``Forget it,'' he recalled with a grimace, because ``the things
blew up into fluffy soft yuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ovens are ancient affairs, rebuilt several times,
that burned wood when first built, then coal, now oil. A third, all
shiny stainless steel, shares one thing with the older ones, a base
made of fire bricks, but it is used for other products, like Irish
soda bread and challah, not for rye.
</P>
<P>
   Rye dough is blended in an electric mixer from the 1920s, with a
dough hook that has been broken and welded many times. It is better
for rye flour, Orwasher said, because it is slower. The dough is
kneaded by hand. It is proofed _ allowed to rise _ in large, flat
wooden boxes. Orwasher's makes its own these days, because it can
no longer find a commercial source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovens have personalities,'' he said, standing in front of one
of his temperamental creatures. ``They all have hot spots, cool
spots. In this one, for example, you get the best results with
challah back on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwasher is a feinschmecker who frets over the quality of his
raw materials. He complains that flour is too inconsistent. He buys
caraway seeds only from the Netherlands _ ``not Egypt,'' he said,
``not as good'' _ seedless raisins from California and the best
Australian and Dutch poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
   His own favorite is neither the rye with charred onion flakes on
the outside and more onions in the center, nor the Russian dark
rye, nor even the raisin pumpernickel that his father, Louis,
introduced to New York in 1945, after serving in the Army as a
baker. What he likes best is the 10-pound ``superseeded'' rye, a
tawny, tangy loaf extra-rich in caraway seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the superseeded is never superseded,'' he said,
wincing.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it was. Even traditionalists like Orwasher's
customers watch television, and when ``Seinfeld'' did an episode
about marble rye, which is a loaf of rye and wheat dough swirled
together, marble rye was the order of the day. For a week or so.

<P>
   Ask a tomato lover to describe the best way to eat summer's
tomatoes and the answer will often be sliced, on bread slathered
with mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite method is arranged on a platter, drizzled with
extra virgin olive oil, scattered with torn bits of basil and
dusted with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   So if this is all it takes to indulge in this seasonal treat,
why is it that every summer brings another tomato cookbook? Will
anyone bother to make a tomato galette, tomato and corn chowder or
warm Indian tomatoes with spicy chilies, which are among 250
recipes in ``You Say Tomato'' by Joanne Weir (Broadway Books, $15)?
</P>
<P>
   The adventurous cook who does will be well rewarded.

   These and a number of other recipes in this new book, like a
quick uncooked tomato sauce made by rubbing tomato halves on a box
grater, are worth adding to summer's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   I was drawn to the book because I liked a number of the recipes
in Ms. Weir's previous book, ``From Tapas to Meze'' (Crown, 1994),
and I was not disappointed. Unlike tomato books from previous
years, this one includes some of the new ways chefs are using
tomatoes, like roasting and charring them.
</P>
<P>
   A rich helping of tomato history and lore have been included. A
handy chart shows how many cups of chopped tomatoes you get from
various kinds.
</P>
<P>
   But the definition of a Spanish Romesco sauce is a bit off base:
though it is sometimes made with tomatoes, classically it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the recipe in the book results in a good spicy
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   What I really wanted was information on all those red, yellow,
green, purple and orange heirloom tomatoes on the cover. It was not
in the tomato glossary near the beginning of the book, but nearly
five pages of ``Tomato Varieties'' at the end covered the subject
pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you do not plan to harvest your own, read the chapter
about growing them and then count yourself among the tomato
cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how many of your friends know the difference between
determinate and indeterminate tomatoes? Determinate varieties yield
a single crop and indeterminate ones keep producing throughout the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for tomato lovers, according to this book, most
varieties are indeterminate.

SIMPLE COOKING: A SLIMMER CARBONARA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The excitement once associated with the first
appearance of the true summer vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers
and corn has been diminished by their year-round presence in the
markets. This, of course, is thanks to the fact that it's always
summer somewhere and that long-distance shipping has become
inexpensive and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing beats real seasonal produce, which is by
definition local and therefore more likely to be fresher and
tastier. And zucchini, among the first and most prolific of the
midsummer vegetables, is now at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best and most unusual uses for zucchini is as a
substitute for meat in a kind of vegetarian spaghetti alla
carbonara. Carbonara _ named for the charcoal producers who worked
for weeks on end in the woods and depended on long-keeping
ingredients for cooking _ was, for many Americans, one of the first
pasta dishes they ate that was not swimming in tomato sauce. Tossed
with egg, crisp bacon or pancetta and loads of Parmesan, it was a
revelation. Since then, spaghetti alla carbonara has become
something of a symbol for over-the-top pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Made with zucchini, the dish becomes a little less fat-laden.
But because the backbone of the sauce remains eggs and Parmesan, it
is still rich _ and quite delicious.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those pasta sauces that can be put together in
just about the time it takes to boil a gallon of water. And
although there is almost no technique involved, there are a few
points worth making:
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to cook the zucchini enough to brown it a bit, which
will enhance its flavor. The eggs will cook fully from the heat of
the pasta. But if this makes you at all nervous, do the final
tossing of eggs, cheese and pasta in the cooking pot, over the
lowest heat.
</P>
<P>
   Use top-quality hard cheese, since its flavor will dominate.
Genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano is probably best, but a good hard
pecorino is nice in this dish, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mint is the herb of choice; its fresh taste is the most unusual
aspect of this preparation. But you can substitute parsley or
basil.
</P>
<P>
   SPAGHETTI WITH ZUCCHINI AND MINT
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 small zucchini, about a pound, washed, trimmed and cut
into slices [ to \ inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghetti, linguine or other long pasta
</P>
<P>
   { cup roughly chopped mint, parsley or basil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Salt a large pot of water, and bring it to a boil over high
heat. Put the olive oil into a 10- or 12-inch skillet over
medium-high heat. A minute later, add the zucchini, and cook,
stirring only occasionally, until very tender and lightly browned,
10 to 15 minutes. Season with a little salt and a lot of pepper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Beat the eggs and { cup of the cheese together. Add the pasta
to the boiling water, and cook until it is tender but firm. When it
is done, drain it, and combine it immediately with the
egg-and-cheese mixture, tossing until the egg is cooked. Add the
zucchini, and toss again. Taste, and add more salt and pepper if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. Toss in the herb, and serve immediately, passing the
remaining cheese at the table. &QL;

<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

TEXAS TOWN COLLIDES WITH DESTINY, AND SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAXAHACHIE, Texas _ Common sense would suggest the economy of
this historic town would be as buried and lifeless as the empty
tunnels of the ill-fated superconducting super collider.
</P>
<P>
   It has been five years since Congress killed the $11 billion
project that would have made this the global center for particle
physics.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal agencies spent $2 billion on the project.
Texas expected to see $30 billion in economic activity because of
it. And Waxahachie, about 30 minutes outside of Dallas, was gripped
by collider fever.
</P>
<P>
   When the project died _ only 20 percent completed _ locals
feared the town's economy would die with it.
</P>
<P>
   But Waxahachie, population 20,000, is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Super Wal-Mart. A Home Depot is being built and retail
stores and subdivisions are popping up on the northern and western
edges of town, said N.B. ``Buck'' Jordan, the Waxahachie Chamber of
Commerce executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Temple Re-Con, a fiber cement manufacturer, is building a $65
million plant here. Even old collider buildings are selling. Home
and commercial construction is up, unemployment is down, and sales
tax rebates are skyrocketing, all indicating healthy growth,
according to city and state data.
</P>
<P>
   The town officials are pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our economy is the best it has been in 16 years,''
Waxahachie City Manager Bob Sokoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fears about our demise were greatly exaggerated,'' Ellis
County Judge Al Cornelius said.
</P>
<P>
   The seat of Ellis County, Waxahachie is 30 miles south of Dallas
on Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scenic and easy-going place, where elm-shaded streets are
lined with gingerbread-laced Victorian houses. Folks still shop
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The town's name comes from an Indian word meaning cow or
buffalo, according to historical accounts. The city grew as a
cotton center in the late 1800s, taking advantage of the fertile
black prairie and its location as railroad hub.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton prices plummeted during the Depression and the city's
then-meteoric growth stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the town was best known for its backdrop of
historical homes. Several movies, including ``Trip to Bountiful''
and ``Tender Mercies,'' have taken advantage of its homey
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Things were quiet until 1988, when a high-stakes national search
by the Energy Department culminated in Waxahachie's selection as
the site for the superconducting super collider.
</P>
<P>
   The device would operate like this: Two proton rays, each about
as thin as a strand of human hair, would be whipped to near-light
speeds by 10,000 large, super-cooled magnets.
</P>
<P>
   The collisions would be studied in hopes they would shed light
on the origins of matter. The real-world impact would be in
scientific and economic innovations based on newly-gained knowledge
of sub-atomic particles.
</P>
<P>
   There were other colliders in Switzerland and Illinois, but this
was going to be the Texas-sized version _ bigger, better and
faster.
</P>
<P>
   The gold rush was on. Speculators bought land all over the
county. The Legislature approved $250 million in revenue bonds and
voters approved $250 million more in general obligation bonds to
fund the state's share of the tab. That included $75 million to buy
the land above the collider site, a move that forced nearly 200
landowners off their family farms.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as quickly, it was over. The project had been
approved with the help of Texans in Congress _ Democrats Jim Wright
was the House speaker and Lloyd Bentsen chaired the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, there were different leaders in Congress and the
push was on to control federal spending. Funding was cut, with many
opponents calling the superconducting super collider a boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   The project was officially pronounced dead when President
Clinton signed the 1994 Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Bill on Oct. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sokoll, the city manager, blames the failure on politics and the
scientific community's inability to recognize the threat to the
project of angry legislators.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor in the superconducting super collider's demise was
the inability of Nobel Prize-winning physicists to explain exactly
what the project would do. Congressional debate over the origin of
matter in the universe didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be the smartest scientists in the world, but they
didn't do a good job of selling the project nationally,'' Sokoll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sokoll believes the town survived the debacle, then thrived,
because officials were forced to hone their sales pitch while
seeking the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably learned a whole lot about economic development,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably recognized, more than anything else, that we
really do have a natural place for industry,'' added Jordan, the
chamber director. ``To have the cutting edge of science and
technology in your back yard would've been exciting. It was quite
an education.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The town's proximity to booming Dallas has helped in softening
the loss of the Energy Department project.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and commercial building starts have tripled since the
project was scrapped, according to city figures. Cornelius, the
county judge, says area unemployment is less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax rebates to the city are up 60 percent from last year,
and the 1997 figure is up 53 percent from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As for the collider, the bills are almost paid.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government paid Texas $210 million in cash and gave
the state $500 million in collider assets as part of a 1994
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Porras, general counsel of the Texas Public Finance
Authority, said the state has paid off the revenue bond debt and in
the last two years, retired about $144 million of the remaining
$250 million in general obligation bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings on the collider campus have been sold, said Ron
Calhoun, a General Land Office spokesman, and that money is being
used to pay off the bond debt.
</P>
<P>
   The hole remains. Nearly 15 miles of tunnel, most of it 16 feet
high and 200 feet below the surface, were excavated, Jordan said.
Today, entrances to the tunnel are plugged with rock and debris.
</P>
<P>
   Sokoll says townspeople have no regrets about seeking the prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the ride was fun,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ka-BOSS, ka-BOSS, ka-BOSS.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny morning last week, Annie Farrell was using her
all-purpose animal call to round up her Large Black pigs. The three
sows and a boar came readily, thinking there might be food; the six
piglets were having too much fun foraging.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally trotted over from a nearby field, Ms. Farrell
couldn't help gushing over the Large Blacks, one of the highly
endangered domesticated breeds she is trying to save on a farm less
than an hour from New York. ``They are wonderful pigs, good
natured, great mothers, very protective,'' she said, then stopped
herself before adding, ``I don't want to get mushy about them
because they are the best eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Good eating. That's Ms. Farrell's mantra.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing she has learned in her efforts to save
historic breeds of farm animals from extinction, it is the need to
get people excited about eating the food these animals produce.
It's all well and good to talk about preserving parts of the gene
pool, but the only thing that will make the idea economically
viable is meat tasty enough that people will want to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of a Noah's Ark for epicures.
</P>
<P>
   The pig-calling might have been a scene out of ``Babe,'' but Ms.
Farrell and her patrons, Nancy and Jerome Kohlberg, are deadly
serious about their purpose at Cabbage Hill Farm, 200 bucolic acres
in the backwoods of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The broods at the farm include 29 Large Black pigs, a rare
Gloucestershire Old Spots sow, 32 Scottish Highland cattle, 72
Shetland sheep, 16 Shetland geese, 40 Shetland ducks and very rare
Bronze turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   These are the breeds that factory farming forgot, once popular
but now disappearing in favor of fast-growing animals that yield
the highest profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish cattle are accustomed to being outside in cold
weather, and they have adapted to it by growing a heavy hairy coat
rather than an extra layer of fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the meat tested at two different labs _ the first
report was so surprising we couldn't believe it,'' Ms. Farrell
said. ``The meat has the same cholesterol count as white-meat
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Highland cattle are not actually listed as
endangered by Britain's Rare Breeds Survival Trust, the pioneer
conservation organization, now a quarter-century old. But they are
classified as a ``minor'' breed, meaning they are definitely
outside mainstream agribusiness. ``We are watching them to make
sure they don't head toward our priority lists,'' said Richard
Lutwyche, the publicity officer of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Farrell is looking for butchers who are willing to hang
the Scottish Highland beef she and the Kohlbergs are raising (hint:
the farm's number is 914-241-2658). Fed exclusively on grass, the
beef is filled with the flavor anyone over 40 may remember. Without
grain, the beef is much leaner _ but it is also less tender until
it is hung.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how good rare breed meat is because they are
used to fatty meat,'' she said. The Large Black pigs are far rarer:
``There are only 300 Large Black breeding sows on the planet,'' Ms.
Farrell explained as she continued rounding them up to meet a
visiting veterinarian. The three sows and the boar were imported
from Southwest England. Today they are doing well enough at the
farm that some of the offspring will be sold for meat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrell looked perturbed for a moment: There was still one
pig missing, a sow that answers to the name of Abigail (when it
deigns to answer at all). She is a Gloucestershire Old Spots, also
``extremely flavorful,'' Ms. Farrell added. Like the Large Blacks,
which forage and are happy to root around for themselves, these
pigs are more flavorful than pigs from factory farms that are
fattened on corn.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail may be a good breeding sow, but her hearing is none too
sharp: she either had not heard the calls or chose to ignore them.
Then Ms. Farrell noticed a barely visible snout wiggling inside the
enclosure where the pigs go to farrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, sweetie _ come on Abby sweetie,'' she said, coaxing
her out. Abigail, who preferred snoozing, came out quite grumpily
and was even grumpier when she and the other pigs were vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Lutwyche, in England, points to the Gloucestershire Old Spots
with cautious optimism. ``It was the most popular breed in England
in the 1920s,'' he said. ``There were four or five thousand, but in
the 1960s it had got down to 200 or so, almost all in one herd. Now
we're back up to five or six hundred.'' But it is still on the
trust's ``endangered'' list, its second most critical rating.
</P>
<P>
   What's so special about the Gloucestershire Old Spots? The fact
that they happily live outdoors makes them ideal ``free-range''
pigs. And their foraging skills are another thing in their favor,
saving on feed costs. Their high fat content gives them added
succulence and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All biological systems need to have genetic diversity to make
way for environmental change,'' said Dr. Donald E. Bixby, the
executive director of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy in
Pittsboro, N.C. In other words, you can't respond to shifting
tastes and conditions if the gene pool is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Noah is only one of Ms. Farrell's goals at Cabbage Hill
Farm. She also produces salad greens, herbs and broccoli sprouts,
and farm-raised fish.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the snorts of indignation from just-vaccinated pigs, the
tour moved on to Ms. Farrell's aquaponics department, housed in a
greenhouse. It is a closed recirculating system: the water from the
fish tanks circulates through gravel beds, from which the plants
pick up nutrition. The water feeds the greens and is then cleaned
and returned to the fish tank. There are plenty of delicate, sweet
talapia for sale. (More good eating.)
</P>
<P>
   While the system at the farm is still too small to make a
profit, it is used as a model to teach people how aquaponics works.
The entire farm, in fact, is a teaching laboratory. Visitors have
come from as far away as Israel and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrell, who sold baskets of mesclun at the Union Square
Greenmarket before most people knew what mesclun was, has been
involved in sustainable agriculture for all of her adult life,
though she has no formal training. She was known around New York as
the Veg Lady in the early '80s, when she grew speciality crops,
like white strawberries, for some of the city's best chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Building a showcase for rare breeds and sustainable agriculture
costs money, and Ms. Farrell is fortunate to have patrons like the
Kohlbergs, who share her passions and have the means to further
them through their Cabbage Hill Farm Foundation. (Kohlberg was a
founding partner of the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP;
Co.)
</P>
<P>
   She and the Kohlbergs met about five years ago through friends
and discovered their common interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kohlberg said to me, `What would you do if you could do
anything you wanted?' '' Ms. Farrell recalled. Four months later,
she was at Cabbage Hill Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the farm does chores, even the cattle. They gladly
do the initial ``mowing'' of the fields and are moved from one to
another as their task is completed. They are followed by the
Shetland sheep, who graze more intensively.
</P>
<P>
   Two imperious looking llamas, Felix and Eleanor, zealously guard
the sheep from coyotes, seen in the neighborhood. Coyotes tangle
with llamas at their own risk. ``The llamas either crush them to
death or they kick them,'' Ms. Farrell explained. So much for the
llamas' gentle looks.
</P>
<P>
   Just then there was a cry of ``Help, help!'' Or something like
it. ``That's either a peacock or a woman being attacked,'' Ms.
Farrell said. ``Peacocks are great watchdogs.'' In some places,
peacocks are also considered good eating.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do Kansas City, Mo.; Chicago, and Oakland,
Calif., have that New York does not? Great barbecue, for one. When
it comes to real barbecue _ meat cooked ever so slowly over a low
wood fire until it is imbued with the tantalizing aroma of smoke _
these cities thoroughly outdo New York.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crushing fact for barbecue lovers in New York.
Barbecue may be the most fetishized of all foods, inspiring
countless books, odes and arguments in which otherwise
mild-mannered people rise into passionate lathers over particular
meats, methods, sauces and sources. But on New York's deficiency
they all agree. And so comes the forlorn question: Why CAN'T you
get great barbecue in New York?
</P>
<P>
   I've been asked this question many times, and I've asked it just
as many times myself. You would think that, given the wonderful
diversity of New York restaurants, you would not have to look far
for food as American as barbecue. But whether you are searching for
Alabama pork ribs or Texas beef brisket, the reality is mostly
grim.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire city, only one restaurant, Pearson's Texas
Barbecue, in Long Island City, Queens, serves up 'cue that keeps
pace with what's available in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Pearson's, New York has quite a few places that serve
food that approximates the taste of real barbecue but lacks its
depth of flavor, like keyboard synthesizers that can simulate
orchestras but can't duplicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these places can be very good, like Brothers Bar-B-Que
on Varick Street, Virgil's Real BBQ near Times Square and Brother
Jimmy's, with three locations in Manhattan. But as far as authentic
barbecue goes, they don't come close.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that many New Yorkers lack even a proper
definition of barbecue and mistake backyard grilling, or
``barbecuing,'' for barbecue. ``Barbecue has to be cooked on wood
or charcoal, and it has to be cooked slow enough so it's not
grilled, so you're using more smoke than flame,'' said Lolis Eric
Elie, whose ``Smokestack Lightning: Adventures in the Heart of
Barbecue Country'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1996) is the best book
I've read on the subject. Cooking directly over wood, coals or gas
does not yield the subtle perfume of smoke nor the delicate
tenderness that are the hallmarks of genuine barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion, many restaurants trumpet their ribs or
chicken as ``barbecue,'' when in fact their food has been baked or
grilled. Emily's in Harlem serves terrific spareribs, but they
shouldn't be called barbecue; the ribs are baked.
</P>
<P>
   Without smoke, there is no barbecue, and therein lies the
problem for New York: the city environmental codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of fire codes and a lack of open spaces, they can't
have open pits,'' said Bruce Lane, the co-author with Scott Bryant
of ``New York's 50 Best Places to Eat Southern'' (City &AMP; Co.,
1998). ``Which, to my mind, is the key reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Classically, barbecue is cooked over an actual pit containing
smoldering wood. Today, the pit might be a brick oven above the
ground, or even a custom-made structure of steel and brick, with
all sorts of filtering devices. But the inescapable fact is that
pits produce smoke, which collides with another inescapable New
York fact: neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This equation results in a morass of bureaucracy. A restaurant's
smoke emissions are regulated by the city Health Department's
environmental services division, but the ventilation systems are
regulated by the Buildings, Fire and Environmental Protection
departments, all of which have separate requirements and inspection
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A problem could originate from a couple of different types of
sources, and the areas of expertise for fixing those problems can
lie in different agencies for reasons that can be quite logical,''
said John Gadd, an environmental services spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Logical, maybe, but not cheap, and certainly not easy. New York
is stricter about emissions than anywhere else, said Charles Morris
Mount, a noted restaurant designer in New York, who grew up in
Alabama and misses the barbecue of his youth. And he says, pits
pose problems that other equipment, like wood-burning pizza ovens,
do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbecue lets out a lot of `grease-laden vapors' _ that's how
they term it _ and the pizza oven has minimal grease-laden
vapors,'' he said. ``All smoke is not equal. The neighbors are the
ones that call.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is simply too densely populated for authentic pits, so
restaurants must compromise. Brothers Bar-B-Que, for example, has a
kitchen smoker that uses hickory wood and, in fact, produces an
excellent North Carolina-style pulled pork, with a smoky flavor and
a properly vinegary sauce. It's the best pork shoulder barbecue
that I've had in New York, and yet there are subtle differences
from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a flavor that just can't be approximated by a
smoker,'' Lane said. ``Some have chambers for hardwoods, and that
helps, but it's still not quite the same as being over the embers
in a pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's Texas Barbecue, formerly known as Stick to Your Ribs,
opened in Long Island City in 1992. Ellen Goldberg, the owner, and
her former partner, Robert Pearson, chose that site partly because
it was the only place they could find with no immediate neighbors
and a big open yard that could accommodate a pit. Even so, putting
in a pit was far more complicated than simply digging a hole. They
had to buy a wood-burning pit from a specialist, J.&AMP; R.
Manufacturing, which cost $13,000, and then have it customized for
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City has all kinds of special requirements, like a
whole electrical component, which we never use, that would work as
a convection oven, too,'' Ms. Goldman said. ``I don't know why _
it's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pearson's has not escaped the notice of New York's
myriad inspectors, who seem to have an inexhaustible supply of
rules. ``The environmental services division of the Health
Department gave us a clean bill of health,'' Ms. Goldman recalled.
``But anytime somebody complains, an inspector comes. Sometimes
they come and say everything is fine; half the time they cite us
for a violation, and the fines escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's might be able to pacify the inspectors for good if
they installed a charcoal-filtering system, but that costs tens of
thousands of dollars and hundreds in monthly maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant found out firsthand how costly a Manhattan
venture could be when it opened a branch on the Upper West Side a
few years back. Because of the expense and environmental
regulations, all the cooking was done in Long Island City, and the
meat was trucked to Manhattan. But that left the gloriously smoky
beef brisket dried out, a problem that was not solved before the
restaurant was damaged by a fire, ending the venture.

 NEW YORK: the venture.   &HT;    Given the expense and the complicated regulations, it's hard to
imagine the casual barbecue establishments that you find in Memphis
or Kansas City thriving here. In those places, barbecue joints are
simply a part of the fabric of neighborhoods, whether in the back
of a bar, in a shopping center or on a corner.
 &HT;    In Manhattan, at least, a place like Virgil's, near Times
Square, seems to be from another universe, a place that has more in
common with theme restaurants than with barbecue pits.
Notwithstanding Virgil's sincere veneration for authentic barbecue,
there's a slickness to it that sets it as far apart from a real
barbecue restaurant as the House of Blues is from a South Side
blues joint in Chicago.
 &HT;    Like Chicago blues, barbecue was imported to the North by
migrating Southerners, most of them black. You might think that you
would find barbecue restaurants in neighborhoods settled by former
Southerners, like Harlem; Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and
Jamaica, Queens, but it's not the case. Many of these neighborhoods
have the same problems with population density and city
regulations.
 &HT;    Mississippi Barbecue, a takeout shack on a sparsely populated
stretch of Baisley Boulevard in Jamaica, is an exception, and
judging by the lines that often stretch out the door, a welcome
one. The cook there prepares the barbecue out behind the little
wood shack, and it's a small-enough operation to pose little bother
to neighbors or the city. The spareribs in particular are great for
New York; yet, truth be told, Mississippi Barbecue would be no
better than ordinary in barbecue centers.
 &HT;    ``You'd think that everybody would be copying them, but nobody
has,'' said Jim Leff, whose book, ``The Eclectic Gourmet Guide to
Greater New York City,'' is to be published this October by Menasha
Ridge Press. But Leff, who perpetually scours the city for offbeat
eating places, has noticed a wave of informal West Indian places,
like Seamorhen on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard in Jamaica.
 &HT;    On any given day, the enticing aroma of smoke that arises from
the half oil drum on the sidewalk outside Seamorhen comes from
jerk, the Jamaican variation of barbecue, in which the meat is
rubbed with a blend of chili and spices. The same is true in
Brooklyn, where you're not likely to find American barbecue, but
where you can find Badoo International on Church Avenue in East
Flatbush, where the smoky intensity of the jerk chicken rivals the
best barbecue.
 &HT;    Perhaps jerk will be New York's great contribution to the
nation's appetite for barbecue. It certainly reflects immigration
patterns. The City Planning Office says New York lags behind key
barbecue centers in the percentage of its population born in the
South. But New York far outdistances these cities in its
Caribbean-born population.
 &HT;    That offers little solace to New York's barbecue lovers, though.
Even so, few have gone to the lengths of Patricia Lee, the owner of
Carolina Country Kitchen and North Carolina Country Products in
Bedford-Stuyvesant. She makes her own sweet potato pies and braised
oxtails, but when it comes to barbecue, she has it shipped in from
North Carolina. ``To get the Southern taste here is kind of hard,''
she said.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TRADITIONALIST'S MOTTO: SEEK, AND YOU SHALL EAT
 &HT;    By ERIC ASIMOV
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy to eat good barbecue in New York, but it can be
done. The best option may be by mail-order.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue doesn't always travel well _ chopped or sliced pork
shoulder and beef brisket, in particular, tend to dry out. But
ARMSTRONG'S of Helena, Ark., (870) 338-7746, ships only whole pork
shoulders, which arrive moist and tender. Heat them for about 20
minutes, covered, in a 350-degree oven, and then 15 minutes
uncovered: the result is a wonderfully soft-textured smoky shoulder
that you can pull apart with your fingers, far superior to anything
available in New York. The shoulders average seven to eight pounds
and cost $5.85 a pound, plus shipping. Each arrives with a pint of
Armstrong's hot sauce and a pint of its mild sauce, packed in old
sauerkraut jars. But this meat is so good that you won't want to
obscure the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, here are some of the better places for barbecue
_ American and jerk _ in the city:
</P>
<P>
   BADOO INTERNATIONAL, 5422 Church Ave. (55th Street), East
Flatbush, Brooklyn; (718) 345-7654. This takeout jerk parlor offers
clear evidence that jerk can be barbecue, too. The smoky flavor is
powerful yet not dominant, letting the flavors of the chicken and
the spicy sauce shine through as well.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER JIMMY'S, 1461 First Ave. (76th Street), (212) 288-0999;
1644 Third Ave. (92nd Street), (212) 426-2020, and 428 Amsterdam
Ave. (81st Street), (212) 501-7515. These rollicking bars are more
like never-ending fraternity parties than restaurants, but they do
serve passable though inconsistent pork ribs and chopped pork
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHERS BAR-B-QUE, 225 Varick St. (Clarkson Street); (212)
727-2775. Brothers is a New York Southern restaurant, decorated
with old road signs and the like, but its barbecue is pretty good,
particularly the North Carolina pulled pork, soft-textured with a
subtly smoky flavor and a fine vinegary sauce with a hint of hot
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI BARBECUE, 172-14 Baisley Boulevard, Jamaica, Queens;
(718) 978-8702. This takeout shack makes what may be the best
spareribs in New York, big and meaty with rosy red edges imbued
with smoke. The menu now includes jerk chicken, chopped pork and
other dishes, but the ribs are best.
</P>
<P>
   PEARSON'S TEXAS BARBECUE, 5-16 51st Ave., Long Island City,
Queens; (718) 937-3030. Pearson's has the only authentic barbecue
pit in New York, and the result is superb beef brisket, the cut of
choice in Texas. Slices are moist and tender, with a rosy-brown
crust that gives way to a pink center, evidence that smoke has
penetrated the meat. Pearson's offers other standard barbecue cuts,
like spareribs and chopped pork, but they are no match for the
brisket.
</P>
<P>
   SEAMORHEN, 118-29 Guy R. Brewer Boulevard, Jamaica, Queens;
(718) 723-9181. Another small takeout specialist with a wide menu,
including excellent fried fish. But the lightly smoky jerk chicken
is the best option.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIL'S REAL BBQ, 152 W. 44th Street; (212) 921-9494. This
barbecue emporium offers styles ranging from the familiar spareribs
to barbecued ham and barbecued lamb. It's all cooked over gas (with
some wood tossed in for flavoring), and so it is not genuine, but a
pretty good approximation. Pulled pork shoulder and pork ribs are
the best choices.

`THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY': SLAPSTICK PURSUIT OF AN OLD FLAME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes Western civilization declines in deliriously funny
style. Why bother to list the myriad offenses given by ``There's
Something About Mary,'' the proudly obnoxious new film by Peter and
Bobby Farrelly, when it's easier _ definitely much too easy _ to
enjoy them?
</P>
<P>
   In the raunchy wake of ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin,'' the
Farrelly brothers have made a romantic comedy that's a hoot in
every sense, worth a smidgen of disapproval and a whole lot of
helpless laughter. But the Farrellys are as gleeful as they are
crude, and they certainly aren't witless. The film works
ridiculously well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or
(despite all appearances) authentically inane.
</P>
<P>
   A prom, a crush and a cruel, cruel zipper set ``There's
Something About Mary'' in motion. It seems that Ted Stroehmann (Ben
Stiller in braces), a kind of Everydweeb, is destined to ruin the
biggest night of his young life. Notably unsuccessful in recruiting
a prom date (``If everything else falls apart, maybe'' is the best
answer he gets), Ted suddenly catches the eye of Mary Jenson,
played by Cameron Diaz with a blithe comic style that makes her as
funny as she is dazzling. Miracle of miracles, Mary makes Ted her
designated prom date for that fateful night.
</P>
<P>
   Resplendent in ruffles and a two-tone tux, nervous Ted may think
he's out of the woods after he gets finished sparring with Mary's
contentious stepfather (Keith David). And then _ oops. The zipper
mishap occurs, and it is not in the Farrellys' nature to treat this
as an off-camera event. So Ted becomes the sight gag of Mary's
neighborhood (and the film's biggest wince) just before he is
packed into an ambulance and wheeled out of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Years pass. Ted still loves Mary, so he decides to find her.
While living in Providence, R.I., (the Farrellys' home turf) he
learns that Mary lives in Florida and hires exactly the wrong
private investigator to track her down. Something about the
pencil-thin mustache and air of high fakery about Pat Healy (Matt
Dillon) should scare him off, but Ted is still not famous for his
acumen. ( Stiller's indignant sad sack and Dillon's perfect
sleazeball make a winning combination.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon Healy is chasing Mary and lying about it to Ted, which is
all the storytelling hook this gag-filled comedy really needs. The
Farrellys, who wrote the screenplay with Ed Decter and John J.
Strauss, just pile on the outrages and the wacked-out minor
characters, among whom are a couple more stalkers with Mary on
their minds. Lee Evans, the rubbery English comedian from ``Funny
Bones,'' plays the supercilious academic who adores Mary and doubts
Healy's credentials, especially when Healy begins passing himself
off as a rich, sensitive architect with a house in Nepal. Even
Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers winds up angling for Mary's
affections.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure non-Farrelly fans of sound judgment, there are at
least as many zit jokes here as other types of witticisms, with
Chris Elliott in the abrasive role of Ted's blotchy best friend. As
equal-opportunity offenders, the Farrellys also kid about a serial
killer, mental illness, wizened old breasts and a half-dead dog,
and they make these things unabashedly funny. The dog and its
sun-shriveled owner (Lin Shaye) are the film's looniest characters,
and Mary's mentally handicapped brother is one of its sweetest. The
joke is on Healy when, in trying to impress Mary with his bogus
compassion, he cites ``work with retards'' as his cherished hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Destined for instant notoriety is a sequence that starts off
with masturbation and ends up with hair gel. But by the time it
happens, you're sure to be either in the unaccountably innocent
spirit of ``There's Something About Mary'' or on the way home. I
hope it's not the latter. The Farrellys display a crazy audacity
that's worth admiring, and they take sure aim for the funny bone.
``There's Something About Mary'' may be many things, but dull and
routine aren't among them.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes a welcome touch of the bizarre from the presence
of Jonathan Richman, once of the Modern Lovers, appearing
troubadour-style in peculiar settings (up a tree, at a hot-dog
cart) to sing about Mary and her magic. Don't skip the closing
credit sequence, in which the cast sings and clowns along to
``Build Me Up, Buttercup'' with a good-natured abandon that suits
the film.

<P>
   Some suggestions for the new baseball commissioner
</P>
<P>
   By Kirk Bohls
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   So, after enduring years of cajoling and arm-twisting, Bud Selig
finally relented and became baseball commissioner. He reluctantly
agreed to take a $3 million position, a fancy office, limo service,
lavish expense account, etc. Hate to think what he'd have gotten if
he had wanted the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now Selig has been on the job for a while, and the biggest news
out of his office was a statement saying baseball has no bigger fan
than Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, thanks, Buddy boy, but there's a bit more on your plate
than root-root- rooting for the home team. So get your feet off the
desk. Assuming Fay Vincent didn't leave this in the top drawer
before you and your cronies ran him off, here's an updated
commissioner to-do list to save baseball:
</P>
<P>
   _ Demote all umpires who won't call a strike a strike.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine players who don't run out ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surgically implant some humility in J.D. Drew.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make players stand in the hot dog line once a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Show Ken Griffey Jr. the right way to wear a cap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find someone like Billy Martin to instill some life into these
cookie- cutout managers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take away players' post-game buffet spreads. Make 'em wait in
the McDonald's drive-through lane same as we do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make George Steinbrenner live in New Jersey if he wants to
move his team there so badly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give the players two three-day breaks during the season so
they can still identify their wives and kids. What is the divorce
rate for ballplayers anyway?
</P>
<P>
   _ Prevail upon your once-fellow owners to stop the lip service
and reduce ticket prices from the average cost of $13.60.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insist all players take a nickname like Hack Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a closer for the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a bullpen for the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make John Kruk international ambassador to baseball. Better
yet, make him a TV color guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sue the pants off Mike Ditka if he ever threatens to sing
``Take Me Out To The Ball Game'' again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Punch out any sportscaster who leads off with ``Mark McGwire
went homerless again for the second game in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring back Earl Weaver and his tomato plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investigate why Mike Piazza has not been traded in a month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Officially change the name to the fair pole.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pool the talent on the Expos, Pirates and A's and put the
franchise in Wichita Falls, the new sports capital of the USA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hook Tommy Lasorda and Bill Russell up to a polygraph machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tar and feather the next owner to sell the naming rights of
his new stadium to Bob's Rattlesnake Farm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine Jim Leyland for not putting Kerry Wood on the NL All-Star
team. What is it about marketing that the Marlins manager does not
understand?
</P>
<P>
   _ Give Barry Bonds a personality transplant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make ESPN quit airing those inane Netboy spots. (And tell 'em
Jose Cruz Jr. isn't even in the majors anymore.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Get Ken Burns to do a retrospective on Jeff Maier.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut off at the knees any player who balks at a new contract
and spouts off, ``It isn't about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep Pete Rose out of the Hall of Fame until he admits his
sins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get Kenneth Starr to investigate why anyone goes to Florida
Marlins games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire hit men to take out any sports columnist suggesting Cal
Ripken Jr. take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire a hair stylist for Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you won't abolish the DH, sponsor a ``Take a DH to Lunch''
program so he's not so misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Send a group of All-Stars around the country to
non-major-league cities in the off-season in a massive meet the
players campaign and _ I know this is outrageous stuff _ do not
charge for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investigate to see if the White Sox have a manager. Or a team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get Jim Thome a sock contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clone Ben Grieve and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring back Dizzy Dean and Pee Wee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give Darryl Kile a clue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Force the Rangers to trade their entire AAA team for Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the players pay a salary surcharge _ say, $50,000 per $1
million _ to help pay their share for new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Mark McGwire hits 62 homers, next year let pitchers throw a
wiffle ball at him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring back that hokey Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not expand for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give Tony Phillips one free ``Get out of Jail'' card.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep interleague play, but make sure the Rangers play the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work on throwing out the first pitch. That was lame.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a real job. As commissioner, you will be nothing more than
a walking, talking _ OK, lip-synching _ puppet of the owners.
</P>

 &HT;    Holocause victims' assets linked to Florida insurance
Commissioner
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Twice in the past three years, Insurance
Commissioner Bill Nelson approved multimillion-dollar contracts
with Swiss banks accused of stealing Holocaust victims' assets,
state records show.
</P>
<P>
   And when The Palm Beach Post pointed out the contracts recently,
Nelson said through an aide that he is considering breaking the
pacts.
</P>
<P>
   The politically-sensitive contracts come to light as Nelson
tries to assure South Florida's Jewish voters in an election year
that he is ``at the forefront'' of efforts to gain financial
justice for victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has pushed for new laws making it easier to file claims
and threatened to kick out European insurers that do not pay off
policies belonging to those who died in Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are for loans to help pay insurance claims that
might arise after a major hurricane. Nelson signed orders approving
deals between the banks and the Joint Underwriting Association, the
state-created insurer of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The lead bank and syndicating agent is Union Bank of
Switzerland, with Credit Suisse joining a group of other
international banks. Estimated fees for the Swiss banks: $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   The same banks are banned from state business in California and
facing possible sanctions in New York by Sept. 1 if they do not
improve on a $600 million settlement offer that negotiators for
Jewish groups rejected. The assets from Holocaust victims are worth
more like $1.5 billion in today's dollars, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Nelson renewed contracts with the Swiss banks in
February 1997 even after a $20 billion lawsuit was filed against
them in October 1996 by attorneys representing Holocaust victims.
The suit was front-page news in The Washington Post and Baltimore
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time this was done to save Florida homeowners and make
sure their claims were paid,'' explained Karen Asher-Cohen, an
attorney in charge of Holocaust issues for Nelson. ``The filing of
a lawsuit is not the same thing as a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust issue with respect to the Swiss banks was ``not on
his radar'' at the time, another Nelson aide said, though
Asher-Cohen said it was more a matter of home insurance matters
being more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Asher-Cohen said Nelson is considering sanctions of his own by
Sept. 1 _ he will ask the JUA to drop the Swiss banks from their
agreement if there is no progress in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   That would break the second of two two-year contracts ending in
1999. A spokesman for the Swiss banks, Jeffrey Taufield in New
York, said of Florida's possible sanctions, ``We just think it's
the wrong thing to do in view of all the progress the Swiss banks
have made on rectifying a 50-year-old problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Florida was doing business with the Swiss banks
was a surprise to many, including Melvyn Weiss, a New York attorney
and part-time resident of Boca Raton who is one of the negotiators
with the Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' Weiss said. ``Especially in a state like
Florida that has such an aged and very big Jewish population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised and disappointed,'' said Ted Lapkin,
director of community relations for the Jewish Federation of Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Lapkin was quick not to assign any blame, but ``I certainly
would urge Commissioner Nelson to take all the facts into account
when this contract comes up for renewal. He should let the Swiss
know in no uncertain terms that Florida will not do business with
Swiss financial institutions until the issue of bank accounts is
satisfactorily resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men credited Nelson with his efforts to help settle
Holocaust insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Peppard, counsel for the Anti-Defamation League in Miami,
declined to criticize Nelson's handling of the bank contracts: ``We
believe he has acted in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 survivors of the
Holocaust in the state, mostly in South Florida. Thousands more
family members of Holocaust victims may be eligible for
compensation for bank accounts never claimed or insurance policies
never redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's political opponent in the fall election, Republican Tim
Ireland, blasted his Democratic foe on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Nelson put millions of dollars in profits into the same
banks that have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from those
died in the Holocaust,'' said Ireland spokesman Joe Saviak. ``This
is morally indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland has not made Holocaust issues a prominent theme in his
campaign, aside from an April release calling for more
international cooperation to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the bank contracts may be awkward, but Nelson's
staff say they believe Jewish voters will look at his overall
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``At all times, Bill's been a national leader on Holocaust
issues,'' said Asher-Cohen.

 &HT;    HMO dispute less than expected
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Consumers apparently aren't as upset with the treatment
they get from health maintenance organizations as some thought they
were.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Texas started a landmark independent review
program for consumers who want to dispute HMO treatment denials,
only 147 complaints have been filed with the Texas Department of
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department officials had predicted they would see
4,400 complaints by the end of the year _ about 30 times the number
of complaints that have been filed to date.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, not one lawsuit has been filed alleging medical
malpractice by HMOs in the first year that Texans were permitted to
do so
</P>
<P>
   The Texas program, through which arbitrators give binding,
independent reviews of HMO and insurance company treatment denial
decisions when consumers complain, is one of the first in the
country. Reacting to consumer complaints, lawmakers approved the
program in 1997 and it went into effect in November.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Department officials said Monday they could not
provide a breakdown of complaints by company.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, said the numbers show that
problems about HMOs aren't as bad as some have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would have to say all the talk by the HMOs last
session about how the sky was going to fall was exaggerated,''
Sibley said. ``And I'm happy for them. The whole purpose of what we
did last session was to have physicians and patients make the
decisions, not HMO bookkeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the first 147 cases filed, the independent review by doctors
of the Texas Medical Foundation upheld the HMO in 67 cases and the
patient in 52 cases. The remainder are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The slim number of complaints ``makes a lot of folks wonder
whether there were the serious problems that everybody alleged that
there were,'' said Jeff Kloster, general counsel for the Texas
Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason there may be so few medical malpractice suits is
because suits must involve allegations that occurred after
September 1, 1997, which limits the number of cases that can be
filed, Kloster said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HMOs may be ``more conscientious'' in resolving
issues before they reach the independent review stage, said Lisa
McGiffert of Consumers Union in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that the numbers are rising, however: By May 15,
about 70 complaints had been filed; since then, the total number
has more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason why the number of complaints is relatively
low is simply that consumers don't know about the program, even
though HMOs are supposed to notify consumers about it.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer is preparing to send
bulletins to HMOs and health insurance companies reminding them
that patients should be informed of the independent review process
if a decision by the HMO goes against them on a treatment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Have a dispute with your HMO over treatment?
</P>
<P>
   If a patient or a patient's doctor disputes denial of treatment
by an HMO or health insurance company, he or she may appeal the
decision orally or in writing to a company representative.
</P>
<P>
   The company representative must include the reasons of the
outcome of the appeal. The consumer must also be notified of the
right to seek review of the denial with an independent review
organization under the Texas Department of Insurance program. A
decision by the review organization is binding on both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Further information on the process is available by calling the
Texas Department of Insurance at 322-4266 or (800) 578-4677.

 &HT;    Way2Cheap bankruptcy shows debt of $1 million
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Four months after closing its doors, Way2Cheap Inc. has
gone to bankruptcy court to dispose of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   In its bankruptcy filing, Way2Cheap listed debts of more than $1
million owed to 359 creditors, including banks, parts suppliers and
former employees. Assets were $90,694, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Others with a claim against Way2Cheap can file it with the
bankruptcy court, said Harry Hobbs, a trustee for the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trustee will be appointed and will go out and see what
assets, if any, there are to liquidate for creditors,'' Hobbs said.
``Once that's done, they'll file through all the claims. At this
point, all the claims against Way2Cheap would be resolved in the
bankruptcy court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs said that with such steep debts and so few assets, it's
unlikely most claimants will get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of Austin's fastest growing small computer companies
with revenues of about $7 million in 1996, the company ran into
problems when sales were too weak to meet rising debts. In March,
the company closed its two Austin stores without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown left dozens of customers without computers. Some
ordered and paid for PCs, which they never got. Others had
computers in the stores for service and had to wait weeks to get
them back. Way2Cheap owner Chris Lott and his wife, Beth, filed for
personal bankruptcy last month, citing debts of more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Lotts' attorney, William Peckham, said the
couple had run up mostly credit-card debt _ some personal, some
business-related.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the filings came from sorting out the debts and
liabilities for the personal and business bankruptcies and putting
together the list of creditors, Peckham said.
</P>
<P>
   Way2Cheap had built a reputation with good reviews for its
systems in Windows magazine. In addition to store sales, the
company also sold PCs by mail.

suppliers and former employees. Assets were $90,694, according to

 &HT;    Big tree makes it a small world for some
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was like getting a message from a tree _ a historic and
greatly beloved tree.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I couldn't find the Caroline Avenue oak when we were
in Mobile, Ala.,driving blindly around streets no longer familiar.
When we saw a big stump, we decided disaster had come to Mobile's
most famous tree, also called the Duffee oak, and stopped looking.
</P>
<P>
   But I mentioned it here, and Walter G. Duffee Jr. of
Suwanee,Ga., came through with his own recollection of the oak, and
a letter from an Alabama cousin, who remembers the oak well and
assures us that it still lives.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to see the Duffee oak to believe it, a trunk more
than 10 feet in circumference and branches reaching out in all
directions to both sides of the street. I have no idea how old the
tree is, or who planted it there, but generations of Mobile
children have practically grown up in it. My son remembered that as
a little boy his father took him to see the oak and let him walk up
one of the low-lying branches to the heart of the great tree. His
father, grandfather and probably great-grandfather, all of whom
lived in the neighborhood, knew the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Duffee grew up in Birmingham, but visited the Mobile Duffees
and, of course, knew the big tree. He spread word to the family
when I wrote of the tree, and his cousin, Mary Louise Duffee
Philips, who now lives in Columbus, Ga., wrote reminding him that
the tree stood in front of the Duffee ``farm house'' at 1023
Caroline Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was torn down years ago and an apartment complex
built that goes through the block,'' she wrote. ``My cousin Ruth
Duffee still lives next door, the last surviving Mobile Duffee.'' I
hated to hear that, hoping that my high school Latin teacher, Miss
Edith Duffee, was a member of the family with such a claim to the
oak.
</P>
<P>
   She continues: ``The oak is alive and well, with its seven
trunks merging into one. The limb that crossed the street and
touched the ground on the other side (we used to walk across it as
children) was destroyed years ago by a truck that violated a city
ordinance and came down that street. (Trucks were banned to protect
the tree.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The tree is listed in a book on Historic Trees in America,
published I think by the foresters society. I don't know whether if
is the biggest or the oldest, but it is one of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather, George Willespie Duffee, built the Caroline
Avenue house when he went into the dairy business out of town.''
``He also built two houses on Washington Square, one of the first
`flushing toilets' in Mobile. Running water was from a cistern he
built on the roof, running by gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was my misfortune not to know that my Miss Duffee had a
relationship to the oak, if she did. She was a wonderful Latin
teacher, and I might have tried harder and done better in her class
if I could have associated her with that big wonderful glamorous
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Philips did mention another connection. Her late brother,
Warren Duffee, was an Atlanta newspaperman (United Press, I
believe) when we moved to Atlanta, and he and I had many
interesting visits until he was transferred, I believe, to
Washington or New York. I remember him as an extremely handsome and
gifted reporter.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how a tree can bring people together.

   Dara, praised by colleagues, can still ease out a tune on the
spot
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Dollar
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Olu Dara never sweats it. Heeases . No rush.
</P>
<P>
   It's the defining trait of the performer's career, which has
stirringly touched on everything from avant-garde jazz to musical
theater. That, and his exceedingly dapper attire _ wide-brim hats
and slick, sharp suits. That, and the deliciously smeared
back-alley lyricism of his cornet playing. That, and his conjurer's
knack for weaving a tale from thin air.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may help to explain how the 57-year-old entertainer
managed to make it this far before recording his first album, the
sun-streaked and Mississippi-muddied ``In the World: From Natchez
to New York'' (Atlantic).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done everything I'd wanted to do,'' says Dara, a
National Black Arts Festival regular who pays a return visit to
Atlanta this week for collaborative dance theater programs with his
longtime artistic partner, choreographer Dianne McIntyre. Though
musical theater has been his bread and butter for more than a
decade _ composing for August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,''
co-authoring productions with McIntyre and poet Rita Dove _ Dara's
resume is a storied ramble. The Harlem resident, who grew up in
Natchez, has seen stints in U.S. Navy bands, Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers and the Broadway musical ``Hair!'' as well as playing
scene-stealing cornet and trumpet on classic `80s jazz sessions led
by saxophonist David Murray and composer Henry Threadgill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olu can play in one note what most people can only play in a
whole solo,'' was how Butch Morris, a fellow cornetist who was also
part of the era's ``loft jazz'' scene, described Dara's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But making his own record, Dara says, ``was the one thing I
hadn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the World,'' which prompted a rave from Rolling Stone,
offers a charming mix of folklore and autobiography, sweet nothings
and heartfelt tributes to Zora Neale Hurston, the subject of
several theatrical projects involving Dara, and Duke Ellington
``jungle band'' cornetist Bubber Miley. Like Dara's live
performances, the recorded work is rich in country blues,
Afro-Caribbean cross-rhythms, early jazz swagger and the vocalist's
seductive, relaxed tenor phrasing. Fans of crossover jazz diva
Cassandra Wilson's recent albums will hear a kindred spirit (and
substantial influence).
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing his music is not: it's not self-conscious,''
says John Armwood, a jazz educator and former promoter who first
heard Dara perform in 1973, and later booked him for some memorable
shows at the 1991 Atlanta Jazz Festival. ``His focus has always
been on playing stuff that anyone could feel in their heart.
Whether it was an old person, a child or someone you could call
musically sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Dara's outfits _ the Orka Orchestra and the Natchezsippi
Dance Band _ were popular attractions around New York in the late
1970s and early '80s, the musician's indifference to recording kept
his name unduly obscured. Atlantic Records had long expressed
interest in a Dara project, but if not for the urging of Dara's
son, the platinum-selling rap artist Nas, the album might not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with his peer group, he wanted to show his peer
group that he's authentic,'' says Dara, whose son obviously
inherited those story-telling genes. They collaborated on the
innovative track ``Jungle Jay,'' that rare jazz-meets-hip-hop mind
meld that compromises neither party. ``You know, `just for
history's sake, Daddy, would you do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dara's never been at a loss for material. ``If I had to make an
album now with 10 new songs, I could have it for you around 6
o'clock this evening, guaranteed,'' he says, without a trace of
braggadocio. Dara credits his workaday experiences in theater for
an almost casual sense of discipline. ``People expect me to do it.
They say, `We need a song right now.' It's not like I can go home
and bring it back tomorrow. I would force myself to write a song on
the spot, and found I had a talent for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one quality that causes choreographer McIntyre to dub her
colleague ``a quiet genius.'' She joins Dara, along with dancers
and musicians, in an NBAF program of two recent pieces _ ``Blues
Rooms'' and the Obie Award-winning ``A New People on the Planet'' _
Thursday and Friday at the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
The artists also will take central roles in the festival-closer
``The Big Dance,'' a dance-party-as-history-lesson that has become
a crowd-pleasing staple of the NBAF. The finale should be the place
to catch Dara at his loose-and-limber best, making music on the
spot with a pick-up band. The more structured dance pieces,
however, speak to a unique and sustaining partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in working with Olu is you go back to doing what
is your first love,' says McIntyre, who has employed jazz musicians
in her dances since the 1970s. ``We've stripped down to really the
essence of what we believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of growing more complex, McIntyre's work with Dara glows
with a refined, soulful simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dianne, it's on a higher plane than a marriage between a
man and a woman, because we do everything together, we create
together at all times,'' says Dara, who first hooked up with the
dancer more than 15 years ago, back when he was still numbered
among members of the ``gutbucket avant-garde,'' a group of
aesthetically frisky jazz musicians that had no qualms mixing the
blues tradition with freer forms. That improvisatory spirit
prevails. ``We create stories in the spur of the moment, create
dances and songs. It's unlike any other collaboration. We have like
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``In the World,'' though, means audiences will be
seeing more of Dara beyond the proscenium _ on tour with a band
that began 20 years ago as the Okra Orchestra. ``That created
another life for me,'' Dara says. ``I had no idea it would. New
fans, new people ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, old times are not forgotten. ``If I go to the jam
session, they always say, `Where's your horn?' They never say, `You
want to sing one?' I was always trying to get away from it. I
prefer telling stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues Rooms'' and ``A Brand New People on the Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration between choreographer/dancer Dianne McIntyre and

THE GLORIES OF BACH, FROM GRAND TO PLAYFUL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although it stands to reason that the most ambitious
projects will also be the most difficult, the Lincoln Center
Festival could hardly have imagined the misfortunes that were to
befall its two musical marathons this year. The sad fate of the
Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a recent victim of
bureaucratic wrangling in Shanghai, is by now familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the presentation of the organ works of Bach is also
sad, though the series started on schedule and most promisingly on
Monday evening, when Christopher Herrick gave the first of a daily
series of 14 hourlong recitals at Alice Tully Hall. The project was
conceived for Donald Joyce, a respected New York organist, who took
seriously ill last year and died in March. Herrick, an Englishman
who has recorded Bach extensively and excellently for Hyperion,
graciously stepped in, and he has dedicated the event to Joyce's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The series is billed as the ``complete'' organ works of Bach,
but that term can only be a relative, because of uncertainties of
attribution, the existence of alternative versions and the like.
``Where distinctly different versions of the same work exist, I
have made a choice,'' Herrick writes in the program book.
``Arrangements of pieces by Vivaldi, Corelli, Telemann and Couperin
are included, while those of Ernst and Fasch are left out.
Incomplete works are excluded.'' All reasonable enough, to keep the
series within the confines of two weeks, though one has to wonder
what Herrick has against poor Ernst and Fasch.
</P>
<P>
   The first program, in any case, was a collection of gems,
beautifully calculated to draw listeners back. The imposing
grandeur of the Prelude and Fugue in A minor (BWV 543) and the
chorale partita ``Sei Gegruesset, Jesu Guetig'' (BWV 768) ideally
balanced the blithe piping of the Sonata in E flat (BWV 525) and
the brilliantly spirited gamesmanship of the Toccata, Adagio and
Fugue in C (BWV 564).
</P>
<P>
   The playful gaptoothed subject in that C major Fugue has always
struck one listener as stop-time in the best Joplin manner; the
words ``stamp, stamp,'' could be printed under the rests, as in
Joplin scores, although stamping a foot near organ pedals is risky
business. And in the end, Bach proceeds to fill those gaps even
more playfully with other voices.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick's performances were grand if not always great. The shape
and spirit of each work emerged superbly; the letter occasionally
left something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick is a virtuoso, no question, and he took risks
accordingly. Nor is it fair to expect in live performance the
note-perfection of his recordings. Still, it is too bad that his
slips of finger and foot tended to happen at big moments and full
volume.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his stamina seemed to flag a bit toward the end,
with a few melodies reshaped in the C major Toccata. Or he may
simply have been a bit nervous, in which case he will have plenty
of time to calm down over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Especially gratifying for a nonspecialist was Herrick's general
avoidance of registrations only an organist could love. In the
chorale partita, he presented a virtual parade of registrations,
venturing only once, in the third variation, into one of those
sonorities so steeped in overtones that the fundamental pitch could
only be intuited.
</P>
<P>
   A listener's main reservation had less to do with anything
Herrick did than with the shifting lights thrown on the pipes,
ranging from garish to gloomy in a seemingly arbitrary rotation.
Even if a sepulchral mood were arguable for the subdued D minor
Prelude (BWV 539), it was surely inappropriate for the little
``Fiddle'' Fugue that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Organ recitals can, to be sure, be uneventful affairs for the
eye, since the performer is often stashed unseen in a loft or
behind a console.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at the fine Kuhn organ in Tully Hall, Herrick is
eminently visible, even down to his footwork on the pedals. It
hardly seems necessary for these compact recitals to import the
tawdry trappings of a disco.

 &HT;    RAISING RETIREMENT AGE NOT POPULAR WITH EVERYONE
 &HT;    650&AMP;add
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labor leaders say Congress should consult some
roofers and nurses and other folks who sweat and strain on their
jobs before accepting the advice of demographers and economists to
raise the age for collecting Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political explosion waiting to happen,'' warned
Gerry Shea, an AFL-CIO national adviser for government affairs.
Millions of Americans ``who earn their livings through hard manual
labor'' will protest if their elected leaders push back the
retirement age, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of organized labor will be among the witnesses
Wednesday as the Senate Special Committee on Aging holds a hearing
on proposals to gradually raise the retirement age to 70 or higher
to keep the Social Security system solvent into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office is expected to report at the
hearing that the system could take a significant step toward
long-term solvency by raising the normal retirement age from 67 to
70 and the early retirement age _ where benefits are reduced by
about 20 percent _ from 62 to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Citing increases in life expectancy, most of the proposals for
reforming Social Security have recommended raising the eligibility
age for recipients. Under the plan introduced this year by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., for instance, the age for
receiving full retirement benefits would rise to 70 by 2029. A
bipartisan commission, working with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, even recommended increasing the retirement
age beyond 70 as the average life span increases in the middle of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Once these proposed changes register on the public
consciousness, they are likely to spark an intense national debate,
because they would force most people to work longer than their
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the opposite of what has been happening in
recent decades. The trend has been for Americans to retire younger,
not older, said John Trollinger, a spokesman for the Social
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, 55 percent of workers waited until 65 to retire. Now,
more than 70 percent opt to start collecting reduced benefits at
62.
</P>
<P>
   But that trend must change to ensure the long-term health of the
Social Security system, several studies have warned.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is largely financed by current workers paying
the benefits of retirees. So the longer people stay on the job, the
more they pay into the system and the less they take out. Spending
more years in retirement, though, puts more strain on the system.
</P>
<P>
   When the eligibility age was set at 65 half a century ago, the
average life expectancy was 63.5 years. By 2030, it will have
increased to 79. In 1940, there were 9 million Americans aged 65 or
older, compared to 34 million in 1995. By 2050, there will be more
than 80 million.
</P>
<P>
   But focusing on a higher retirement age puts policy-making ahead
of people, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of business being conducted inside the
Beltway. I don't know how many policy discussions I've attended
where the participants said 'Life expectancy has increased so, of
course, we have to raise the retirement age,'' said Shea, the
AFL-CIO official. ``But this conversation has never included the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans aren't even aware that the age for receiving full
benefits is already gradually being raised from 65 to 67 under
changes adopted in 1983, said Shea. He predicted an angry outcry if
the retirement age is increased again to 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a construction worker, being asked to work to the age of
70 is a serious concern,'' said David Roscow, a spokesman for the
Laborers International Union of North America. People with
``physically tough'' jobs are often not capable of working past the
current retirement age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But tradeoffs will have to be made if the national retirement
system is to survive, the reformers warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they will have to find a job where they can do the work.
Does that seem unreasonable?'' asked Gary Burtless, a Brookings
Institution researcher who will testify at Wednesday's Senate
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has only three options in saving Social Security:
increase contributions, reduce benefits or increase the age of
eligibility, said Burtless.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three are unpopular,'' he conceded. ``But there isn't
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is popular is that people are living longer and healthier
lives,'' he added. ``So these tradeoffs were actually brought about
by good news.''
</P>
<P>
   One hope for the reformers is that surveys indicate a changing
attitude toward the so-called Golden Years. Unlike their parents'
generation, 80 percent of Baby Boomers expect to continue to work
during retirement, according to a national poll released last month
by the American Association of Retired Persons.

THE MIRACLE OF RYE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In Germany, I sometimes think, they don't care which
side their bread is buttered on, or whether it's buttered at all,
as long as it's made from rye.
</P>
<P>
   Rye began life as a weed that invaded and contaminated wheat
fields, but it has proved itself a most useful citizen of the
vegetable kingdom. Rye has qualities that wheat does not: It can be
grown in poorer soils, with less sun and at higher altitudes than
wheat, and it can tolerate damp and drought. It is made to order,
in other words, for northern and eastern Europe, where it has been
widely grown since the Middle Ages, and for parts of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Rye flour makes bread that lasts longer and, for those who love
it, tastes infinitely better. True devotees will eat nothing else;
the Russian food writer Yuri Chernichenko says, ``White bread is
cotton wool.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Poland and the Scandinavian countries all love rye
bread, and emigrants from those countries, along with Germans, took
rye bread with them to the United States. For generations, ham on
rye was the proletarian sandwich of choice in the Midwest, corned
beef or pastrami on rye in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of obsession with French and Italian styles,
New York bakers are beginning to rediscover classic rye breads.
</P>
<P>
   But the Germans have always had an unequaled passion for
traditional ryes, whether tan, brown or almost black. Most have a
malty, slightly sour taste. The best are moist when fresh. When you
bite into a dense, delectable slice, you have a sense that you are
eating something primeval, something undying, something expressive
of its origins, like honest wine.
</P>
<P>
   Germans make more kinds of bread than anyone else, some 300
varieties, a vast majority containing rye flour, said Heinrich
Juenemann, the head of the Berlin bakers' guild. They also eat far
more bread than anyone else _ 185 pounds a year, on average, for
every man, woman and child _ and in the bleak, hungry years after
World War II, when little other food was available, the average was
310 pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misery time,'' Juenemann said, ``is bread time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, people invest bread with a spiritual
significance. Consider these words, painted on a wall outside
Juenemann's office: ``Holy and eternal is bread. It keeps you from
hunger and misery. The Creator himself gave it to us. He who
dishonors bread dishonors life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bread matches people, in a way. It's as hard to imagine a
Frenchman, full of Latin flair, choosing pumpernickel every day as
it is to imagine a stolid German with a baguette or a ficelle on
his table each morning.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard it said (only by gastronomic philistines, of
course) that rye bread is for peasants, white bread for the more
discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was true 200 years ago, though I doubt it. For me,
rye bread was part of the sacred Midwestern German-American trinity
that I grew up with: sauerkraut, dill pickles and chewy rye with
caraway seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Rye bread can make a meal fit for a kaiser, as it does at the
Hotel Adlon, the sumptuous new establishment near the Brandenburg
Gate, where the breakfast buffet includes up to 15 breads from
three local bakers, plus house-baked walnut bread, to say nothing
of Danish pastry from LeNotre in Paris, and bagels, donuts and
muffins from Starbuck's _ for homesick Yanks, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It can make a philosopher happy, too, as I discovered a decade
ago when, thanks to an introduction from a mutual friend, I ate
lunch with Isaiah Berlin at the Garrick Club in London.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the table, the Russian-born scholar asked whether I
liked bread. When I replied that I did, he said the club's bread
was wretched, reached into the ample recesses of his black suit
coat and produced two great chunks of rye, one dark, one light,
both wrapped in wrinkled brown paper bags. It was the best thing we
ate that day, and it went very nicely, thank you, with one of the
club's elegant clarets.
</P>
<P>
   Germans eat rye bread for breakfast, with cheese, ham, salami
and other cold cuts. In the old days, after a cooked meal at
midday, they ate rye bread for supper, too, with cheese, ham,
salami and other cold cuts. Some still do, but the big meal is
often eaten at night now, and lunch is a snack.
</P>
<P>
   German picnic kits are simple too _ just a board and a knife, to
cut the rye bread, cheese, ham, salami and other cold cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At KaDeWe, a Berlin department store whose food hall tries to
stock everything good from everywhere, and comes close to
succeeding, the German bread department sells more than 100 types
of rye.
</P>
<P>
   Thick-crusted 11-pound oval loaves from Pomerania, near the
Polish border, are neatly arranged next to onion bread and olive
bread and pumpkin-seed rye and miniloaves just 2 inches across,
studded with salt and caraway. There is bread baked in KaDeWe's own
ovens and by small bakeries scattered across Berlin. Bread from
Hamburg, from Bamberg, from Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
   The one from Bamberg, in the Main valley east of Frankfurt, is
something special _ a big, round, spicy sour bread, made from mixed
rye and wheat flour by the Schueler bakery there. People come from
all over Berlin for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generate traffic for the whole store,'' said Norbert
Koennecke, the food hall's manager. ``We have 200,000 people living
in our general area, and nothing pulls them in, week after week,
like our German rye breads.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is no bakery anywhere whose display cases can match
KaDeWe's for sheer prodigality. Today, the cornucopia of fresh,
fragrant loaves seems a metaphor for German affluence. But in fact,
the tradition of offering ryes from all over Germany arose in
harder times, during the Cold War, when West Berlin was isolated,
travel was hard and people longed for a taste of home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get deliveries three times a day,'' said Karin Kummerer,
the trim, efficient woman who oversees the operation. ``Even in the
afternoon, a lot of the bread is still warm. People like that _ it
reassures them. They're health-conscious these days as well, so
they sometimes ask you whether the bread has any chemicals it. It
doesn't, I tell them, none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The store sells 400 to 2,500 loaves of rye a day, with Saturday
the biggest day. Most customers buy two to four half-loaves: ``It
would look stingy,'' one explained to me, ``not to offer a choice
at breakfast.'' Given the pains that are taken, the price does not
seem excessive: about $2.50 for a standard, Berlin-style 2.2-pound
rye loaf, called graubrot (gray bread).
</P>
<P>
   Although the rules are not as unbending as those embedded in
ancient laws that govern the brewing of beer in Germany, the baking
of bread in this country is a serious, meticulous business. This is
not Rye Bread 101.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it is illegal to use bleached flour, which is
widely used in the United States. Traditional German bread has only
six basic ingredients: rye flour, wheat flour, baker's yeast,
water, salt and a sour starter similar to that used in making
sourdough bread. No milk, sugar, fat, additives or preservatives,
though the bread lasts up to eight days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Breads containing only rye flour are seldom made, said Marcus
Bertram, KaDeWe's master baker. The taste, he said, ``is just too
strong for most people.'' The texture, he was too polite to add, is
ingotlike. So wheat flour, which has more gluten, is added to
lighten and refine the loaf.
</P>
<P>
   What differentiates one rye from another is mainly the
proportion of rye flour to wheat flour in the dough. Under the
German system, it is white bread if it contains 90 percent to 100
percent wheat flour, and rye bread if it contains 90 percent to 100
percent rye flour. Otherwise, it is white mixed-bread or rye
mixed-bread, depending on whether there is more wheat flour or more
rye flour.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans are nothing if not systematic.
</P>
<P>
   There are other variants as well. These are some of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ The bread can be baked in modern ovens in large batches or in
old-fashioned stone-hearth ovens in small batches. The latter
produces a rougher crust, often almost half an inch thick, and a
more darkly flavored crumb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some ryes are made from whole-grain or roughly crushed rye
rather than milled rye flour, which gives them a considerably
coarser texture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seeds may be added, and the variety available is large _ not
only caraway, but also linseed, pumpkin, sunflower and poppy seeds.
Olives, carrots, oats, walnuts, hazelnuts, raisins, onions and even
ham may also be added.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size and shape _ oval, round, rectangular _ also affects
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it is cool, the bread is handed to the customer in an
open-ended paper bag. And except for behemoths like the 11-pounder
from Pomerania, it is never sliced in the store. That is the
responsibility of the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a test for young German women,'' Juenemann
said, looking over the glasses perched on the end of his nose, blue
eyes dancing. ``If they couldn't cut a loaf of bread evenly, they
couldn't get married.''

<P>
   A good back road beckons in a way no freeway exit can. It does
not promise gas, food or lodging, only chance.
</P>
<P>
   You see a country road that catches your eye as you whip past, a
tempting ribbon that points straight up a hill or dives down into
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   You pass it on your way to work or going to a friend's house but
there is never time or reason to turn off and see where it leads.
</P>
<P>
   So one day you make the occasion, sneak an hour to detour
yourself, go the long way in between appointments. See how it feels
to drive without a destination.
</P>
<P>
   To give a back road total concentration you should probably see
it on foot or bicycle, but some of us are too driven not to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a weekday morning in the summer when there are no school
buses and less chance of impatient drivers. You need to go slow in
order to look through fences, to back up and see if those are
llamas or donkeys. You don't want the air conditioning on for this
one. You want your windows open and your senses tuned. You want to
be able to smell a pond before you see it.
</P>
<P>
   Slow down by the rural cemetery. See a couple walking to the
headstones from a car with out-of-state plates.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a barn slumped to one side, as if it were leaning on its
elbows, probably walloped by the last winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   This is where they must go looking for chicken coops covered
with wisteria and other postcard and calendar scenes.
</P>
<P>
   On back roads the houses don't match. Funky and grand own the
same view.
</P>
<P>
   A rusted car up on bricks is what passes as garden art for some
people, for others, a satellite dish. There's a sign that someone
has a chest of drawers to sell. Another has starters for Swiss
chard and around the corner, someone offering meditation services.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino kept the Northern California hillside green through
midsummer but now there's the familiar patchwork of green and gold.
From a distance the yellowed grass on the hills looks as fuzzy as
Velcro with trees stuck to it.
</P>
<P>
   I meandered for an hour. I didn't come to any magical
intersection but I got to fall more in love with the neighborhood.
Maybe I noticed more because I was paying attention to where I was,
instead of where I was going.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered a couple great places for picnics, found a
Christmas tree farm full of dandelions and crept down a road so
narrow berry bushes brushed into the window. The rest were nice
homey details. A red barn with a weather vane in the shape of a
pig. A man walking to his mailbox in a sleeveless T-shirt like
1950s fathers used to wear and brown pants. A tractor driver with
two kids in the scoop. A white house trimmed in peppermint stripes
that would be shunned in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing part was seeing how much of the land is giving up
its apples to make room for grapes. Much as you like your
zinfandel, it's a shock to come upon a newly prepared hillside,
stripped to the nub, nothing on it but a bulldozer. In some places
the earth looks so raw that if you didn't know that a farmer was
getting ready to plant the county's favorite cash crop you'd think
some alien space ship had landed and burned a whole into the
orchard.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of agriculture, I guess, when you switch crops but
some spots are so barren they look like a Kansas disaster scene
where the locusts ate everything but the house.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the empty spaces will be planted so that in future summers
they'll be rows of grape vines waving their leafy arms in the
breeze. But now the fields look like construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Come over the top of one hill and you can see the uprooted
trunks of downed apple trees, waiting to be hauled away. It seems a
bit disrespectful, a mean way to treat old friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good local debate. How much to give up in exchange for a
wine industry that has brought the area jobs and attention and
tourists by the barrel-load.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry the vineyards are displacing not only trees but
wildlife. Some say that grapevines will be like the southern kudzu
whose vines climb so fast and thick they seem to swallow houses.
</P>
<P>
   But others say change happens and they'd rather see grapes than
houses or worse. Besides, the grape leaves in the fall give us some
of our best autumn color and we've got finer wine selections in our
minimarts than major restaurants in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some places along the road show that the apple is still queen.
The trees are leafed out right now, and the apples are about the
size of baby fists. The trees look solid, like survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, since Sonoma County went to grapes it's been easier
to locate it for visitors. We used to say ``50 miles north of the
Golden Gate Bridge.'' Now we can say ``Wine Country.'' It sounds
pretentious but it's accurate, as long as you add, ``We have
apples, too.''

ABOUT-MARY (Los Angeles) _ The makers of Dumb and Dumber have
become gross and grosser with ``There's Something About Mary,'' an
R-rated comedy (a rarity these days) that smashes taboos with glee.
We talk to the Bobby and Peter Farrelly and find out what's going
on inside their twisted minds. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
MARY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``There's Something About Mary'' calls
to mind the spirit of Brooks and Monty Python and ``Animal House''
in its manic zeal to milk every sacred cow in the name of facetious
fun. You'll laugh. You'll groan. Often at the same time. Yet, this
is the most consistently funny movie the Farrelly brothers have
made.

 &HT;    FTC WANTS TO STAMP OUT SPAM

   WASHINGTON _ Want to make some money? Just send $20 for a list
of people you can e-mail and watch the money roll in. Or at least,
that's what spammers want you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Spam is unsolicited commercial electronic mail, and it is sent
to almost anyone who has an e-mail account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's annoying, it slows down the e-mail system, and a lot of
it is fraudulent,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Bureau of
Consumer Protection for the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Spam _ sent in bulk to millions of e-mail recipients at a time _
usually takes the form of business opportunity offers, chain
letters and work-at-home schemes that offer infinite wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC released a list Tuesday of the twelve most common spams.
The commission compiled the list after an investigation that began
last fall. Using the FTC World Wide Web site and ``word of mouth''
advertisng on the Internet, the FTC encouraged people to send their
unwanted, unsolicited commercial e-mail to a special electronic
mailbox (uce(at)ftc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   The FTC built a searchable database so it could study the mail
and identify possible targets for law enforcement actions. Thus
far, the commission has brought five actions against spamming
companies, one of them resulting in a $2 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The database has also prevented other companies from getting
into trouble. FTC officials believed some of the spammers were
imitating others without realizing their actions might violate
state and federal laws prohibiting deceptive advertising claims in
all media, including e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC sent letters to more than 1,000 spammers identified
through the database informing them of the law and noting their
actions were being watched by law enforcement. Some companies
expressed appreciation to the FTC for sending the letters before
they got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, consumers had forwarded more than 250,000
pieces of spam to the FTC Web site, and continue to do so at a rate
of between 1,000 and 1,500 spams per day.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC says they will continue to monitor the spam that they
receive for use in law enforcement and consumer education.

FARRELLYS AIM `DUMB' HUMOR AT ADULT AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 
  
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were more than a few days during the making
of the gleefully gross new comedy, ``There's Something About
Mary,'' that actor Ben Stiller did not exactly relish the idea of
coming into work. There was the day when a fish hook yanked his
mouth into cartoon proportions. And there was the day when he had
to pretend to get caught in the teeth of a zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be cheerful,'' Stiller says, ``knowing your role
calls for your head to be bashed into a chair or for your thing to
be caught in a zipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Stiller's words repeated to them, Bobby and Peter
Farrelly, who wrote and directed ``Mary'' surely sympathize. But
they hasten to add that Stiller got off easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron Diaz was the one who had the potential career-ender in
the movie,'' Peter says. ``She had to rub the ... how do I say this
... hair gel-like material in her hair. That could have stigmatized
her for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Yeah, it's like Ned Beatty in `Deliverance.' The
only thing he did wrong was be too convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers are nothing if not convincing, which to
their critics is part of the problem. The two Rhode Island natives
mined the depths of lowbrow humor with their first two films,
``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin,'' wild, hit-and-miss movies
about sympathetic losers. The movies won fans with both audiences
and _ surprise _ critics, who found the brothers' in-your-face
humor to be a refreshing blast in an arid, politically correct
landscape. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Beyond 13-year-old humor
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``There's Something About Mary,'' which could be
described as the first stalker romance, the Farrellys have expanded
their reach, possessing the clout to deliver their first R-rated
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was time,'' says Peter, at 41, a year older than
Bobby. ``The only guy who thinks along those lines seems to be
Woody Allen, and obviously he has a different thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seems to set out to make adult comedies anymore,''
Bobby says. ``I think studios want to gear everything to
13-year-old boys. There's nothing wrong with that. We had that age
group in mind with `Dumb and Dumber,' since those guys were about
13 years old themselves mentally. But we've always had a lot of
stuff that we've wanted to do that the MPAA won't let us get away
with. And now we have our chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Mary'' has outrageous scenes, gags that words can't begin
to fully describe and jokes that can't be repeated in a family
newspaper. There are no sacred cows. There are jabs at gay serial
killers, the handicapped and ``retards.'' A dog gets electroshock
treatment and later becomes an amphetamine-fueled whirling dervish.
And, of course, there's the scene with the zipper, a bit already
part of film lore even though the movie hasn't been released yet in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask us, `How far will you go?''' Peter says.
``And the answer is: As far as the audience lets us. It's up to
them. We test a lot, mostly in colleges. And any time the laughter
stops, we cut the scene, sometimes by seconds or sometimes in its
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Mary'' also has _ something the two previous Farrelly
movies lacked _ is an actual story line, sort of a Boy Meets Girl,
Boy Meets Zipper, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Stalks Girl, Boy Gets Girl
Back Again kind of thing. It's a development that also stems from
the brothers' obsession with test screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both `Dumb and Dumber' and `Kingpin' tested in the 90s for
guys and the 40s for women, and with this movie we got the women,
too,'' Peter says. ``I don't know why, but women seem to need a
story. Guys can watch stuff like the Three Stooges and be fine.
Women need more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so needy,'' Bobby adds, mock contempt in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   subhed: Sibling revelry
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys never appear to have been needy in their lives,
even though 15 years ago they were both floundering in sales jobs.
(``We were still enjoying life,'' Peter says. ``Life has always
been nice.'') Bobby, a geological engineering major (a misnomer, he
says, born from his days as a college stoner), was developing
Sunspot, the world's first round beach towel. Peter was selling
shipping space on cargo vessels. Then, after finishing his master's
degree in creative writing, Peter came up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written a book (`Outside Providence,' which will be
released as a film this year starring Alec Baldwin), but I kind of
figured out that I wasn't going to make much money writing fiction
and, besides, it takes too long to write,'' Peter says. ``So I
started writing screenplays with a friend and eventually dragged
Bobby out to L.A. to help because he knows what's funny and what
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys, along with writing partner Bennett Yellin, began
making a comfortable living cranking out unproduced screenplays.
Eddie Murphy purchased one, writer-director David Zucker another.
But it wasn't until they sold ``Dumb and Dumber'' that Peter and
Bobby finally got to see their work on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With their debut, the brothers took no chances, demanding that
they direct the movie, even though neither had ever been to film
school or shot so much as a TV commercial. (``Hollywood isn't like
a regular industry where they do background checks,'' says Bobby,
who is married and has two children. ``We could have been escaped
convicts for all they could tell.'') The Farrellys figured they
knew the story and they knew how to tell a joke. (``What else is
there?'' Bobby asks.) The rest would somehow just work itself out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Flying blind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a panic attack the night before,'' says Peter, who
has been married for a year. ``We called David Zucker and he told
us to relax. He also told us to let everyone on the set know that
we didn't know what the hell we were doing and get their support.
We did, and we've been with the same crew ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only admirers. Jim Carrey credits the Farrellys
for putting his career on the map, and his ``Dumb and Dumber''
co-star Jeff Daniels appreciated the chance to drop his drawers and
dramatic chops and play stupid. (``He wasn't our first choice,''
Peter admits. ``We wanted Michael Richards, but he kept telling us
the story was a tragedy like `Of Mice and Men.' He called us after
the premiere and said, `You know, you guys were right.''')
</P>
<P>
   When ``Kingpin'' failed to ignite the box-office (``It wasn't
marketed very well,'' Bobby says), the Farrellys were courted by
20th Century Fox executive Tom Sherak, who gave the brothers a free
hand in bringing their vulgarity to full fruition. The studio is
pleased enough with the results to have signed the filmmaking team
to a three-year, writing-producing-directing deal. (Next up:
``Stuck on You,'' a comedy about Siamese twins.)
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest fans, though, might be Mom and Dad. Peter and
Bobby credit their parents for honing their humor, although no one
in the family could have guessed at where they would take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents were strict about stuff like TV, but what they
weren't strict about was humor,'' Peter says. ``We could tell any
joke. If it was funny, it was OK. We would sit around the dinner
table, my parents, Bobby and me and our three sisters and just have
a lot of laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Our father just has a brutal sense of humor, and
my mother can take any kind of joke. In fact, it used to piss our
sisters off. They'd be trying to stop us, screaming, `Mom! Don't
encourage them! They're sick.'''
</P>
<P>
   They still are. Only now, their audience is bigger than the
immediate family.

FTC URGES CONSUMERS TO WATCH OUT FOR `DIRTY DOZEN' E-MAIL SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)

 By NICOLE TSONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After examining over 250,000 e-mails from around
the nation, the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday warned e-mail
users about the 12 most common fraudulent get-rich schemes being
touted by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ``dirty dozen'' e-mails bear a close resemblance
to unsolicited offers already conveyed by telephone and regular
Postal Service mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 e-mail examples were collected at an FTC e-mail address
created to study and help prevent e-mail fraud. The address,
uce &LR; ftc.gov, receives 1,000 to 1,500 e-mails daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said fraudulent e-mail is easy and inexpensive to send
_ and e-mail addresses are accessible for anyone who has access to
the Internet.
</P>

   David Medine, associate FTC director, said it's easy for senders
of unsolicited e-mail to harvest e-mail addresses because ``anytime
you put your address out there on the Internet, there are automated
programs capturing those e-mail addresses and adding them to a

<P>
   The jargon of cyberspace identifies unsolicited e-mail as
``spam.'' Its senders are ``spammers.'' Using the address lists,
spammers solicit by sending spam.

<P>
   _ Business opportunities: They offer a lot of money for a small
amount of time and money that are usually too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making money by sending bulk e-mail: They offer money for
simply e-mailing a lot of people, but bulk e-mail violates e-mail
service rules for most Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chain letters: Chain letters generally claim to make money
simply by sending the letter to a certain number of people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work-at-home: Two popular versions for making money from the
comfort of home include envelope stuffing and craft assembly, but
``nobody will really pay you for stuffing envelopes, and craft
assembly promoters usually refuse to buy the crafts, claiming the
work does not meet their `quality standards,''' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health and diet: Bogus cures offered via e-mail, guaranteed to
cure all ills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Currency trading: These deals offer the chance to ``make
unlimited profits exchanging money on world currency markets,''
Bernstein warned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get something free: Computer or phone card offers are common
in this scam. The consumer is urged to sign up for membership fees
but then receives nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment opportunities: The senders suggest they have inside
financial information or they promote high rates of return with no
risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Descrambler kits to allow you to receive cable TV signals
without paying subscription fees. The kits generally do not work,
and stealing cable signals is against the law, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guaranteed loans or credit: Promoters may offer credit cards,
regardless of credit history for a fee, or offer home-equity loans
that turn out to be lists of lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit repair: For a fee, the sender offers to clear up a bad
credit record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vacation prize promotions: Deluxe vacations for a cheap price
which never turn out to be the luxury vacation touted by the
advertisement.

FTC URGES CONSUMERS TO WATCH OUT FOR `DIRTY DOZEN' E-MAIL SCHEMES

   WASHINGTON _ After examining over 250,000 e-mails from around
the nation, the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday warned e-mail
users about the 12 most common fraudulent get-rich schemes being
touted by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ``dirty dozen'' e-mails bear a close resemblance
to unsolicited offers already conveyed by telephone and regular
Postal Service mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 e-mail examples were collected at an FTC e-mail address
created to study and help prevent e-mail fraud. The address,
uce &LR; ftc.gov, receives 1,000 to 1,500 e-mails daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said fraudulent e-mail is easy and inexpensive to send
_ and e-mail addresses are accessible for anyone who has access to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Medine, associate FTC director, said it's easy for senders
of unsolicited e-mail to harvest e-mail addresses because ``anytime

THERE IS `SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' 
OUR RATING: THREE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Courage and comedy aren't two words that are
usually linked. But in politically correct times when most movies
assiduously avoid crossing the delicate line of vulgarity in fear
of losing mass appeal (and that all-important PG-13 rating), it is
positively heroic when a couple of guys manage to call to mind the
days of Mel Brooks and ``Springtime for Hitler'' and create a film
that manages both to joyfully entertain and creatively offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' has all the spirit of Brooks
and Monty Python and ``Animal House'' in its manic zeal to milk
every sacred cow in the name of facetious fun. You'll laugh. You'll
groan. And often at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there would be no reason to celebrate ``Mary'' if it
were merely tasteless. (Karen Finley and other NEA gravy trainers
are learning that harsh reality now.) This is the most consistently
funny movie the Farrelly brothers have made, coming on the heels of
guilty pleasures ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin.'' ``Mary'' will
probably be tagged with the title ``Gross and Grosser,'' a
distinction it admittedly earns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Farrellys, who wrote and directed the film together,
populate their movie with surprisingly sympathetic characters,
which often makes the wicked humor kind of touching _ albeit in a
sick, twisted way.
</P>
<P>
   The movie puts a '90s spin on the age-old story of Boy Meets
Girl. Basically, it's ``Sleepless in Seattle'' with a court
restraining order thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' opens with an inspired, 20-minute time capsule
introducing the characters in their nerdy, mid-'80s high school
days. We meet Ted (Ben Stiller), a gangly geek with a bad haircut
and braces who has the hots for dream girl Mary (Cameron Diaz).
When Ted sticks up for Mary's mentally handicapped brother, she
rewards him by asking him to the prom. That sets up an unfortunate
incident involving Ted's zipper, and he never gets to see Mary
again.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 13 years and Ted is still dreaming about Mary. His
loathsome pal, Dom (the perfectly cast Chris Elliott), suggests Ted
hire a private investigator to track her down. The goofball he
enlists, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), ends up falling for Mary himself,
which puts into motion a love triangle that eventually expands to
include other idiotic suitors. You see, there is, indeed, something
about Mary, and it seems to attract every man on the Eastern
seaboard with an IQ of less than 50.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is too long and, like most good sketch comedies, its
humor misses as often as it connects. But there are several scenes
that will have you laugh so hard that you'll start to cry. Or maybe
it will work the other way around. Certainly, you will never look
at hair gel the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz brings great comic timing and a sweet vulnerability to
Mary, and Stiller and Dillon prove to be troopers in the face of
all sorts of indignities. Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, Markie Post (!),
Elliott and Jonathan Richman as a wandering troubadour (and
makeshift Greek chorus) straight out of ``Cat Ballou'' round out a
wonderfully funny supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film's crude tastelessness won't play with
everyone. Sometimes you'll even hate yourself for laughing. But
laugh you will _ often and hard. ``There's Something About Mary''
is the funniest movie of the year, and it mixes in just enough
sweetness with its bodily fluids to make it good, deranged fun. &UR;  &QL;

   Steamy conditions will cover a large portion of the central and
eastern states Wednesday as winds from the Gulf of Mexico circulate
very humid air toward the Canadian border. A cluster of showers and
thunderstorms will surround a high altitude low pressure area over
lower sections of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. Some of the
storms will produce excessive rain that will lead to local
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms will also ignite from eastern
North Carolina to Florida as a jet stream disturbance off the
Atlantic Coast aids in lifting very humid air over the area. The
remainder of the Southeast will be partly sunny and warm with a
slight risk for afternoon thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-degree heat and hazy sunshine will embrace much of the
eastern Great Lakes and Northeast on Wednesday. An exception will
be along the southern New England and Great Lakes coasts where
cooling breezes off local waterways hold readings in the 80s.
Father west, spotty strong thunderstorms will erupt from Iowa to
northern Michigan as sultry air is lifted by an approaching cool
front.
</P>
<P>
   Ascending currents of unstable air induced by the uneven heating
of the varied terrain will fuel isolated potent afternoon storms
from New Mexico and northern Texas to the Front Range of the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, intense heat will grip much of California and the
Southwest as a warm ridge of high pressure builds over the region.
The Northwest will be dry and seasonably warm with patchy low
clouds at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LAZY SUMMER DAYS
</P>
<P>
   During the spring and early summer, the atmosphere shifts gears.
For most of the winter, storms move steadily at 30 mph to 40 mph.
The jet stream, a ribbon of winds between five and seven miles
above the earth that steers weather systems, is driven by
temperature contrasts between the Tropics and the Arctic, and
between continents and oceans. In summer, when these contrasts are
weak, the winds at 30,000 feet are much less. As a result, the
weather systems during the lazy days of summer typically move about
half as fast of those in the cold season. &QL;

COUPLE SAY KC POLICE MAKE THEM AFRAID TO DO SPIRITUAL MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John Kean and Jill Harmon of Kansas City,
known as John and Jill Butterflies, sat on Kansas City sidewalks
and distributed pamphlets to spread spiritual love, equality and
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our creator does not value us for what we own,'' states one
pamphlet, ``but for the love we share.''
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts were not well received by Kansas City police.
</P>
<P>
   They charged Kean and Harmon three times under three different
laws. The couple sued the city twice and won. Despite their legal
successes, the couple's experiences with police _ who once sent a
helicopter to hover over them _ have left them afraid to return to
the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Police department attorney Dale Close said officers did nothing
wrong. ``Every time a ticket has been issued it's been issued for
some act prohibited by an ordinance,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   Kean and Harmon's struggle has raised questions about the city,
the police and free speech. U.S. District Judge Ortrie D. Smith
said so last month in a ruling on one of their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been browbeaten into forgoing conduct protected by
the First Amendment,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has declared unconstitutional city ordinances that
regulated sidewalk vendors and pamphlet distribution. He also
wondered why he had to intervene twice to protect the couple's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not Nazis, Klansmen or pornographers,'' he wrote.
``Their message heightens awareness about serious social issues and
offers positive and hopeful responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the court's view, these are messages the city should want
to be disseminated.''
</P>
<P>
   He ordered Kansas City to pay them $35,000. Last week their
lawyer submitted his bill for $65,000 more in city money. That's on
top of more than $31,000 in damages and lawyer fees in the earlier
case.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's lawyer, Robert Popper, said his clients weren't
after money. They had offered to settle if the city apologized,
trained police on the First Amendment and reviewed some possibly
unconstitutional laws, said the professor at the University of
Missouri School of Law in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Police now have orders not to enforce the laws declared
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   City attorneys declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kean and Harmon, they remain charged under a third law _
blocking a sidewalk. And Kean said he'll probably challenge the
city on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Kean and Harmon spoke last week about their message and how they
became champions of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to have their pictures taken, they said, because
they do not want to become celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remain simple people,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   At the interview, Kean, 34, had hair past his shoulders and wore
a T-shirt, blue-tinted glasses and a necklace of small beads. He
earned a degree in political science eight years ago from the
University of Missouri-Kansas City. He sought more meaning in life
after a personal tragedy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, 21, wore a necklace shaped like a butterfly. She said
she grew up in Pleasant Hill, met Kean and the two agreed to start
their mission together two years ago. They adopted their spiritual
names, John and Jill Butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold March day in 1996, they started handing out pamphlets
with simple messages and pictures. (MORE)

FOREIGN STUDENTS FEEL EFFECTS OF ASIA'S FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
 _ 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ ... being run by her brother, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teh's story is typical, Stoltenberg said. Many students from
Asia come from families that own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To help students most in need, the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service decided in June to temporarily relax its
regulations for students holding visas from South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The change makes its easier for needy students to work off
campus and allows them to study part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Thomas Burns, director of
international student affairs at UMKC. ``Even during the Chinese
Tiananmen Square period, students were not given that type of
economic relief.''
</P>
<P>
   UMKC is alerting employers in the area about the relaxed rules,
Burns said, and is hoping they are interested in hiring some of the
students in need.
</P>
<P>
   Worakamol Hemsmiti, a 24-year-old graduate student from Thailand
at UMKC, said he knows some Thai students who plan to work more
this fall. He considers himself lucky, he said, because his parents
have assured him they can support him until he graduates in
computer science in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to work, but not much,'' Hemsmiti said. ``They have
collected money for a long time to send me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoltenberg said he was not surprised that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service did not offer relief to students from China
and Japan, even though some could be suffering financially as well.
The United States typically reaches out to help only those in
developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Universities said that the students most in need seemed to be
the ones pegged for relief by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been seeing more Indonesian students coming in than any
other,'' said David Brandt, an international student adviser at the
University of California in Berkeley. ``In Indonesia, the situation
has gone from bad to worse, and it isn't getting any better. At
least in the other countries, the situation has somewhat
stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley has 66 students from Indonesia; its international
community numbers about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, KU's international advisers have talked with many
worried students since last fall, said Daphne Johnston, associate
director of international student services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said goodbye to many at Christmas,'' Johnston said, and
``we noticed a sharp decline in new arrivals in January, especially
Koreans.... We expect we'll see the biggest reduction in numbers
this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students who have had to drop out have been extremely
distraught, Johnston said: ``I just got a letter from one who had
to leave in December, and she desperately wants to come back and
has no way to fund herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is hurting undergraduates most because they generally
have to pay their way themselves. Graduate students, on the other
hand, almost always receive a teaching or research assistantship or
funding from some kind of grant.
</P>
<P>
   KU hooked up its students with a grant program offered by the
National Association of Foreign Student Advisers. Five of eight KU
students who applied received the grants, which required matching
funds from KU.
</P>
<P>
   In January, MU came up with $100,000 from private gifts and
grants, which it used to help 75 students. About half of them got
tuition grants ranging from $500 to $2,000, Heyl said; the rest
received short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   He was not sure whether MU would do anything to help students
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many universities across the country are helping in a variety of
ways, said Blumenthal, of the Institute of International Education.
The institute is offering zero-interest loans to students who
qualify, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teh is working full-time this summer at KU's Watson Library. And
she expects to attend KU part-time this fall so she can continue to
work at least 20 hours a week. With no scholarship and no financial
aid, she doesn't have much choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard,'' Teh said.

 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chinleng Teh was one of Malaysia's lucky
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Her family was able to set aside enough money from its furniture
business to send her to college in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the middle of her studies at the University of Kansas,
Teh and her family find themselves hurt by the financial crisis
that hit Southeast Asia last fall. The value of Malaysia's
currency, the ringgit, has dropped by roughly half against the U.S.
dollar. That means the family will need almost twice as many
ringgits to cover Teh's tuition bill of $4,500 this fall.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Teh, 22, has taken a job. But she worries she will have to drop
out of school before completing her degree in religious studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep praying that God will let me stay, but things like that
are really hard to say,'' said Teh. ``I'm not sure what the
situation will be next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A national e-mail survey last March of 128 colleges and
universities showed that some students from Southeast Asia already
had dropped out of school in January. Schools reported declines of
up to 10 percent for Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, and up to 20
percent for South Korea, according to the Institute of
International Education, which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (enrollment figures) will show in the fall is hard to
say,'' said Peggy Blumenthal, the institute's vice president for
educational services. ``The economic situation is certainly having
an impact on their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many universities, including KU and the University of
Missouri-Columbia, expect fewer students will show this fall.
</P>
<P>
   MU could lose 50 to 100 Asian students, which would represent a
sizable number of its international community of 1,227, said John
Heyl, director of MU's international center.
</P>
<P>
   The university is trying to build up its international
community, Heyl said, so a loss of that magnitude would be
distressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that a global community that represents something
like 7 to 8 percent of the student community is a good critical
mass that can add to the cultural diversity of the campus,'' Heyl
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that shrinks too far, you can lose some of the effects
that come from a critical mass,'' such as cultural programming and
the promotion of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Growing numbers

   The number of foreign students attending colleges and
universities in the United States has increased many times over
since 1954. However, they still make up only 3.2 percent, or
486,000, of the total enrolled, according to the latest figures
compiled by the Institute of International Education.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest number, 4,657, attend Boston University. At least
25 other institutions have enrollments greater than 2,000. KU has
1,481, a few more than MU. Kansas State University, meanwhile, has
883 and the University of Missouri-Kansas City has about 750.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 percent of foreign students nationwide come from the
countries most seriously affected by the Asian crisis: South Korea,
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Each of the countries has seen
the value of its currency fall by about 50 percent since last fall.
Indonesia's has fallen the most, by perhaps as much as 70 percent,
said Clyde Stoltenberg, a professor of business at KU with a
special interest in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Teh, the KU student, says her family's business in Malaysia is
suffering because the economy there is not good and people do not
want to spend money on furniture. That is forcing her family to
keep much of its money tied up in the business, which is being run
by her brother, she said. (MORE)

WOMEN NEEDED TO SERVE ON STATE COMMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Women's Public Service Network of Greater
Kansas City is looking for a few good women, not to join the
military but to serve on state commissions and boards.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan organization wants to ensure that qualified
women are considered for statewide appointments in Kansas and
Missouri. The 50-member network was established in 1988 to promote
effective public leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always tried to find ways we can become more involved
with the political process,'' said Rachael Steele, project
coordinator and the former assistant to U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth of
Missouri. ``Women are a large part of the population and they need
to be represented on these boards. They have different
viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials usually appoint people they already know to
these positions. As a result, men tend to select other men because
they are unaware of female candidates even though female officials
don't have difficulty finding other women, said former Jackson
County Executive Marsha Murphy, a chairwoman of the project
advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the complaint from public officials that they don't
have enough women in the pool, and we wanted to remedy the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that even though there are many highly
qualified women, they do not apply because they are unaware of the
positions since they are not politically involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who are not political activists, but
who are interested in being active citizens and can serve,'' Murphy
said. ``We're educating women so they know they don't need to run a
campaign to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest challenges in finding more candidates is
convincing the women that they have the credentials to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women worry about their qualifications much more than the
men do,'' said Murphy. ``Women frequently say, `Do I have enough
experience?' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The network is working with other organizations to spread the
word. It also is providing application forms to potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The organization will forward those names to the existing talent
banks. In Missouri, the Institute for Women in Public Life housed
at the University of Missouri-St. Louis keeps a computerized
database.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office in Kansas maintains its own database of
persons interested in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials recognize the value of diversity on these boards.
They want to appoint more women to state boards and commissions. So
it's up to us to put aside our insecurities and excuses and apply.
</P>
<P>
   Call Steele at 931-0105 for more information or for a public
service personal profile form.

`ONCE UPON THE RIVER LOVE': IN A LAND WHERE LOVE HAD NO PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrei Makine begins his new novel, ``Once Upon the River
Love,'' with an almost operatic act of love, and then he follows
quickly with the statement that love simply did not take root in
the ``austere country'' where he grew up. ``Love for love's sake,''
we are told by Makine's narrator, ``had, I think, simply been
forgotten _ had atrophied in the bloodbath of the war, been
garroted by the barbed-wire entanglements of the nearby camp,
frozen by the breath of the Arctic.''
</P>
<P>
   In that brief contrast of heated eroticism and a frigid past are
embedded the haunting images and the powerful themes of this
impressive coming-of-age tale set in the taiga, the virgin pine
forest of Eastern Siberia in the days of the Soviet Union. Makine's
new book overlaps somewhat with his highly acclaimed previous work,
``Dreams of My Russian Summers,'' in which a precociously aware boy
learns about France, and therefore about a more beautiful world
than that of the Soviet Union, while sitting at the feet of his
French-born grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Makine's new narrator is another precociously aware boy, a
hot-blooded, all-seeing, tender-minded adolescent named Mitya who
listens to the stories of a village woman named Olga and is thereby
propelled to a rebellious yearning for something more than the
place of prison camps and parched souls where he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Dreams of My Russian Summers'' marked Makine's arrival on
the literary scene, ``Once Upon the River Love'' indicates that he
will remain there. Written in French, rather than Makine's native
Russian, and marvelously translated by Geoffrey Strachan, it is an
accomplished, affecting work, psychologically complex, written in a
lyrical, sparely impassioned prose that serves as a kind of
magnifying glass on a fabulously exotic experience.
</P>
<P>
   Makine writes with just that touch of distance, that lightening
element of self-mockery that the adult brings to the most piercing
visions of boyhood. His new book is a portrait of the artist as a
young savage, a boy dressed in a fur hat and a sheepskin coat who
smells of cedar smoke. But he achieves a literary sensibility in a
region that, during the long years of the Soviet dictatorship, was
emblematic of human hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen, sixteen ... Here is what I was,'' Mitya says. ``A
strange alloy of the winds, silences, and sounds of the taiga, of
places visited or imagined. Someone who already knew, thanks to
Olga's library, that feudal chatelaines had long bodices, like the
bodice of the unhappy Emma Bovary. That the shoulders of a bathing
odalisque were tinged with amber.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitya passes the time with two friends, both of them marvelously
realized by Makine. One is a would-be poet named Utkin with a lame
leg, a shoulder that pointed to the sky and all of the complexes
that such physical deformities might encourage; the other is a
dashing would-be guerrilla fighter called Samurai. The three boys
live in ``a strange universe, without women,'' a place where the
word ``have'' is used to describe a man's sexual relationship with
a woman, as in: ``You know that Maria on the cash till? I've had
her.'' Mitya notes: ``Love seemed to us to be something carved from
the gray dusk of a dreary district center, where all the streets
led out into wastelands covered by wet sawdust.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitya compensates for the severity of the landscape by
fabricating a world of dreamy eroticism. He entertains fantasies of
a beautiful stranger whom he believes he sees in silhouette through
the window of the Trans-Siberian express. He notices a forlorn
figure of a woman who meets the local ferry every afternoon hoping
that her strayed husband will be on it. He remembers a wolf killed
in the forest and a frozen tear he saw in the corner of the
animal's eye. He sees the sun as an orb impaled on the watchtowers
of the prison camp, or entangled in barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   One day, just after Mitya has embarked on a disastrous inaugural
sexual experience, a French movie starring Jean-Paul Belmondo plays
in the cinema in the county town 22 miles away. The boys trek there
on snowshoes. Makine, reminiscent here of Milan Kundera, freights
every scene, including the most ostensibly nonpolitical, with the
weight of both political and esthetic rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnificent apolitical thighs,'' Mitya says of the beautiful
heroine whom Belmondo saves from disfigurement at the hands of the
enemy. ``Serenely amoral. Thighs outside History. Apart from all
ideology. Without any utilitarian ulterior motive. Thighs for
thighs' sake.'' It is the very pointlessness of Belmondo's
exploits, contrasted with the inevitable newsreels of medal-pinning
ceremonies in the Kremlin and the mandatory reports on the looming
radiant future, that gave them their irresistible iconoclastic
force. In the end, helped by Olga and Belmondo, all three of
Makine's youthful characters make their escape from Siberia, each
of them following a path ordained by their contrasting characters.
But these escapes are given a cast of melancholy, of rueful wisdom,
by Mitya's adult understanding of two things: one, that there is no
earthly paradise, despite the promise represented by Belmondo and
Olga's library; and the other, that the world left behind, the
``beauty and silence'' that prevailed along the River Amur, held
both the seeds of youthful revolt and the treasures of youthful
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Makine overdoes it in places. His opening scene, for example,
involves a degree of stylistic hyperventilation that is
inconsistent with the controlled force he normally displays. But
this is a minor fault. ``Once Upon the River Love'' marks a further
development in what is turning out to be an exciting literary
career. Makine leaves us with that rare sense of having been
drenched, entombed like a Siberian village under the heavy snow, in
an entirely unfamiliar, exotic world, captured and held there so
that it will long linger in the memory.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the salad greens grown by Eberhard Mueller, the
chef at Lutece, now available to the public, will his dressing be
next?
</P>
<P>
   The mesclun, the same mix of baby lettuces like lollo rosso, red
romaine and summer crisp that Mueller has at the restaurant and
also sells to the Four Seasons restaurant, is on the shelves on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at Gourmet Garage, 453 Broome St. (Mercer
Street), 2567 Broadway (96th Street) and 301 East 64th St.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Paulette Satur, grow the greens at Satur Farms,
their 18-acre property in Cutchogue, and they bring it in, rinsed
and dried. It is $6.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheap right now because we don't feel we have it 100
percent the way we want,'' Mueller said. ``The price may go up.''
He said his mesclun is a French mixture. ``In New York you often
see mesclun with Oriental greens like tatsoi and mizuna, which they
don't do in France,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Though the mesclun is grown according to organic methods, it
can't be certified, Mueller said, because the farm was not organic
before they bought it two years ago, and three chemical-free years
are required for certification. Because the lettuce mixture is
delivered within 24 hours of picking, the leaves retain their
intense flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller and Ms. Satur will soon start harvesting tomatoes, too.
They have 650 plants of heirloom varieties. ``But I'm not ready to
quit my day job,'' he said. ``I like it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvements at Vinegar Factory
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An urban farm has had its problems. Two weeks ago,
The New York Observer raised the issue of the materials that Eli
Zabar used to construct the plant bed in the rooftop greenhouses of
the Vinegar Factory, 431 East 91st St.
</P>
<P>
   Though the soil came from an upstate organic farm, the boxes
were made of pressure-treated wood, which is impregnated with
chemicals, including chromium and arsenic. (The Northeast Organic
Farming Association of New York prohibits the use of the wood for
garden beds on certified organic farms.)
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Eames-Sheavly, a horticultural educator at the Cornell
University School of Agriculture, said that she does not recommend
using such wood in vegetable gardens, because of concerns about the
danger from the materials in the wood.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of concerns voiced by shoppers, Zabar has now lined
the beds with plastic. Ms. Eames-Sheavly said that a plastic lining
should provide adequate protection from the chemicals. Zabar has
also had the soil, his lettuce and some tomatoes tested in a
laboratory, which stated, in its report, that it found ``no
leaching of arsenic from wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vinegar Factory is now selling heirloom tomatoes harvested
on the roof. Last week there were big, rippled purple Russian Annas
for $4.99 a pound, and red and orange cherry tomatoes for $5.99 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   A Greenmarket Volume
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joel Patraker, the manager of the Union Square
Greenmarket, is putting together a book of recipes and
recollections about New York Greenmarkets that is to be published
next year by Viking. Though he has plenty of his own material, he
says he is hoping that shoppers at Greenmarkets will contribute
photographs, shopping or cooking tips to the book. Contributions
can be sent to ``The Book,'' Box 320, Cooper Station, New York NY
10276, or faxed to (718) 398-6729.
</P>
<P>
   A Culinary Alliance
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., has formed
an alliance with L'Ecole des Arts Culinaires et de L'Hotellerie de
Lyons, a culinary arts and management school in Ecully, France (a
suburb of Lyons). It was founded in 1985 as one of France's first
modern professional schools. The new alliance is expected to
include exchange programs for French and American students.

LIGHTS! FABRIC! MONUMENTAL ACTION!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Washington Monument, the plain Jane of the
capital's tourist attractions for more than a century, is about to
get a glitzy new look.
</P>
<P>
   With help from 800 lights and some strategically placed fabric,
the towering obelisk will become an ever-changing piece of
environmental art late this year. It will shimmer on sunny days,
darken when storm clouds roll in, and glow at night.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-catching alterations are all for show. Behind the lights
and the decorative scaffolding, the monument is getting a $9.4
million facelift for the new millennium. Workers will seal cracks,
replenish crumbling mortar and repair damage inflicted by years of
exposure to wind, rain, snow and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like Cinderella at the stroke of midnight, the monument
will shed its adornments shortly after the turn of the century and
resume its role as a model of simplicity in a city known for
self-aggrandizement.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service is going to extraordinary lengths to
make the two-year restoration as painless as possible for the
million-plus tourists who visit the 555-foot tower each year.
Rather than erect ``rusty old scaffolding,'' as park service
official Arnold Goldstein put it, the company in charge of the
project will disguise the workers' platforms with decorative
netting and fabric.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the monument will appear to be sheathed in
oversized bricks. The blue fabric and transparent netting are also
designed to reflect the color of the sky and the glow of 800 lights
that will be attached to the scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of an artistic endeavor, to have the lines flow,
to have it look more pleasing,'' Goldstein said. ``It should look
quite nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cost of the restoration will be paid by Target
stores, Coca-Cola, Visa and other corporate sponsors. The
scaffolding will start going up in August, and the job is supposed
to be finished by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service already has upgraded the monument's elevators
as well as the heating and cooling systems. The final phase of the
renovation will include revamping the observation deck near the top
of the obelisk. The monument is expected to remain open to tourists
throughout the project, except for brief interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing structurally wrong,'' Goldstein said. ``Even
if we didn't do this, the monument is structurally sound. It
wouldn't move or fall or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the world's tallest unreinforced masonry structure is
beginning to show its age. Construction on the monument started in
1848, but the work stalled six years later when money and interest
in the project dwindled. The uncompleted tower remained stuck at
152 feet for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The monument was finally completed in 1884, but the
start-and-stop construction process left a distinct color change
about a third of the way up the obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who also oversees the Lincoln Memorial and the
Jefferson Memorial, said the most pressing problem at the monument
is water leakage. Tourists in the observation deck are pelted with
drips on rainy days.
</P>

   Workers will also repair damage to the monument's 36,000 stones.
Inside the monument, they will restore some of the 192
commemorative stones that were donated by each of the states and
various countries, organizations and individuals. The Texas stone,
which includes the state seal and the date 1845, commemorating
admission to the Union, appears to be in good shape, but others
have been damaged by souvenir-seekers and vandals.

   ``You can see everything!'' said 8-year-old Brittany Halterman
of Bellflower, Calif., after a recent visit with her aunt. ``We saw

   Goldstein said he is determined to keep the tourists happy

   NEW YORK _ ``Some Like It Hot'' promises to turn into something
hotter when downtown performers like Everett Quinton, Dominique
Dibbell, Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw, Lois Weaver, Carmelita Tropicana
and the playwright Craig Lucas, among many others, team up for a
one-night-only staged reading of the famed film comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1959 Billy Wilder film, starring Jack Lemmon, Tony
Curtis and Marilyn Monroe in the tale of two fugitive musicians who
join an all-girl band, featured only two male-to-female
cross-dressers and one diva, the reading at 7:30 Wednesday night at
the New York Theater Workshop (79 East Fourth St.) promises
gender-bending female-to-male-to-female cross-dressers and more
than 20 divas, including five Marilyns. Kevin Malony directs the
madness, and the Circus Amok Band plays on.

   NEW YORK _ Vanessa Redgrave and her mother, Rachel Kempson, are
to perform with other show-business notables at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine (1047 Amsterdam Ave., at 112th Street) at 8
p.m. Monday in a $50-a-ticket benefit for the people of Kosovo.
Scheduled to join Ms. Redgrave are Mandy Patinkin and Lee Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by the Albanian-American women's
organization Motrat Qiriazi to raise money for food, clothing and
medicine for the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
account for 90 percent of the population and are fighting Serbian
forces.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although it stands to reason that the most ambitious
projects will also be the most difficult, the Lincoln Center
Festival could hardly have imagined the misfortunes that were to
befall its two musical marathons this year. The sad fate of the
Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a recent victim of
bureaucratic wrangling in Shanghai, is by now familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the presentation of the organ works of Bach is also
sad, though the series started on schedule and most promisingly on
Monday evening, when Christopher Herrick gave the first of a daily
series of 14 hourlong recitals at Alice Tully Hall. The project was
conceived for Donald Joyce, a respected New York organist, who took
seriously ill last year and died in March. Herrick, an Englishman
who has recorded Bach extensively and excellently for Hyperion,
graciously stepped in, and he has dedicated the event to Joyce's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The series is billed as the ``complete'' organ works of Bach,
but that term can only be a relative, because of uncertainties of
attribution, the existence of alternative versions and the like.
``Where distinctly different versions of the same work exist, I
have made a choice,'' Herrick writes in the program book.
``Arrangements of pieces by Vivaldi, Corelli, Telemann and Couperin
are included, while those of Ernst and Fasch are left out.
Incomplete works are excluded.'' All reasonable enough, to keep the
series within the confines of two weeks, though one has to wonder
what Herrick has against poor Ernst and Fasch.
</P>
<P>
   The first program, in any case, was a collection of gems,
beautifully calculated to draw listeners back. The imposing
grandeur of the Prelude and Fugue in A minor (BWV 543) and the
chorale partita ``Sei Gegruesset, Jesu Guetig'' (BWV 768) ideally
balanced the blithe piping of the Sonata in E flat (BWV 525) and
the brilliantly spirited gamesmanship of the Toccata, Adagio and
Fugue in C (BWV 564).
</P>
<P>
   The playful gaptoothed subject in that C major Fugue has always
struck one listener as stop-time in the best Joplin manner; the
words ``stamp, stamp,'' could be printed under the rests, as in
Joplin scores, although stamping a foot near organ pedals is risky
business. And in the end, Bach proceeds to fill those gaps even
more playfully with other voices.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick's performances were grand if not always great. The shape
and spirit of each work emerged superbly; the letter occasionally
left something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick is a virtuoso, no question, and he took risks
accordingly. Nor is it fair to expect in live performance the
note-perfection of his recordings. Still, it is too bad that his
slips of finger and foot tended to happen at big moments and full
volume.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his stamina seemed to flag a bit toward the end,
with a few melodies reshaped in the C major Toccata. Or he may
simply have been a bit nervous, in which case he will have plenty
of time to calm down over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Especially gratifying for a nonspecialist was Herrick's general
avoidance of registrations only an organist could love. In the
chorale partita, he presented a virtual parade of registrations,
venturing only once, in the third variation, into one of those
sonorities so steeped in overtones that the fundamental pitch could
only be intuited.
</P>
<P>
   A listener's main reservation had less to do with anything
Herrick did than with the shifting lights thrown on the pipes,
ranging from garish to gloomy in a seemingly arbitrary rotation.
Even if a sepulchral mood were arguable for the subdued D minor
Prelude (BWV 539), it was surely inappropriate for the little
``Fiddle'' Fugue that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Organ recitals can, to be sure, be uneventful affairs for the
eye, since the performer is often stashed unseen in a loft or
behind a console.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at the fine Kuhn organ in Tully Hall, Herrick is
eminently visible, even down to his footwork on the pedals. It
hardly seems necessary for these compact recitals to import the
tawdry trappings of a disco.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLULAH, La. _ Here in the middle of the impoverished
Mississippi Delta is a juvenile prison so rife with brutality,
cronyism and neglect that many legal experts say it is the worst in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The prison, the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, opened
just four years ago where a sawmill and cotton fields once stood.
Behind rows of razor wire, it houses 620 boys and young men, age 11
to 20, in stifling corrugated-iron barracks jammed with bunks.
</P>
<P>
   From the run-down homes and bars on the road that runs by it,
Tallulah appears unexceptional, one new cookie-cutter prison among
scores built in the United States this decade. But inside, inmates
regularly appear at the infirmary with black eyes, broken noses or
jaws or perforated eardrums from beatings by the poorly paid,
poorly trained guards or from fights with other boys.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are so meager that many boys lose weight. Clothing is so
scarce that boys fight over shirts and shoes. Almost all of the
teachers are uncertified, instruction amounts to as little as an
hour a day, and until recently there were no books.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a fourth of the inmates are mentally ill or retarded, but
a psychiatrist visits only one day a week. There is no therapy.
Emotionally disturbed boys who cannot follow guards' orders are
locked in isolation cells for weeks at a time or have their
sentences arbitrarily extended.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions, which are described in public documents and
were recounted by inmates and prison officials during a reporter's
visit to Tallulah, are extreme, a testament to Louisiana's
well-documented violent history and notoriously brutal prison
system.
</P>
<P>
   But what has happened at Tallulah is more than just the story of
one bad prison. Corrections officials say the forces that converged
to create Tallulah _ the incarceration of more and more mentally
ill adolescents, a rush by politicians to build new prisons while
neglecting education and psychiatric services, and states' handing
responsibility for juveniles to private prison companies _ have
caused the deterioration of juvenile prisons across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Dunlap, president of the National Juvenile Detention
Association, which represents the heads of the nation's juvenile
jails, said, ``The issues of violence against offenders, lack of
adequate education and mental health, of crowding and of poorly
paid and poorly trained staff are the norm rather than the
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the problem, the U.S. Justice Department has begun a
series of investigations into state juvenile systems, including not
only Louisiana's but also those of Kentucky, Puerto Rico and
Georgia. At the same time, private juvenile prisons in Colorado,
Texas and South Carolina have been successfully sued by individuals
and groups or forced to give up their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, an
offshoot of the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed suit against
Tallulah in U.S. District Court to stop the brutality and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigations by the Justice Department, some of the
harshest criticism has been leveled at Georgia. The department
threatened to take over the state's juvenile system, charging a
``pattern of egregious conditions violating the federal rights of
youth,'' including the use of pepper spray to restrain mentally ill
youths, a lack of textbooks, and guards who routinely stripped
young inmates and locked them in their cells for days.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in the inmate population forced Georgia's juvenile
prison budget up to $220 million from $80 million in just four
years, but the money went to building new prisons, with little left
for education and psychiatric care. ``As we went through a period
of rapid increase in juvenile crime and record numbers of juvenile
offenders,'' said Sherman Day, chairman of the Georgia Department
of Juvenile Justice, it was ``much easier to get new facilities
from the Legislature than to get more programs.''
</P>
<P>
   After reacting defensively at first, Gov. Zell Miller moved
quickly to avert a takeover by agreeing to spend $10 million more
this year to hire teachers and medical workers and to increase
guard salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, whose juvenile system is made up of Tallulah and
three prisons operated by the state, is the Justice Department's
latest target. In hundreds of pages of reports to a federal judge
who oversees the state's entire prison system under a 1971 consent
decree, Justice Department experts have depicted guards who
routinely resort to beatings or pepper spray as their only way to
discipline inmates, and who pit inmates against each other for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two years after the Justice Department began its
investigation and a year after it warned in its first public
findings that Tallulah was ``an institution out of control,''
consultants for the department filed new reports with the Judge
Frank Polozola of U.S. District Court in Baton Rouge, warning that
despite some improvements, conditions had deteriorated to ``a
particularly dangerous level.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a former warden at Louisiana's maximum-security prison,
acting as a consultant to Polozola, found conditions at Tallulah so
serious that he urged the judge to reject its request to add
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not make these recommendations because of any sympathy
for these offenders,'' former warden John Whitley wrote. ``It
shocks me to think'' that ``these offenders and their problems are
simply getting worse, and these problems will be unleashed on the
public when they are discharged from the system.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE PRIVATE PRISON: When the Profits Are the Priority
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst conditions in juvenile prisons can be found
among the growing number of privately operated prisons, whether
those built specifically for one state, like Tallulah, or ones that
take juveniles from across the country, like boot camps that have
come under criticism in Colorado and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent of the nation's juvenile prisons are operated by
private, for-profit companies, Dunlap of the National Juvenile
Detention Association estimates. But as their numbers grow along
with privately operated prisons for adults, their regulation is
becoming one of the most significant issues in corrections. State
corrections departments find themselves having to police
contractors who perform functions once the province of government,
from psychiatric care to discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Colorado officials shut down a juvenile prison
operated by Rebound Corp. after a mentally ill 13-year-old's
suicide led to an investigation that uncovered repeated instances
of physical and sexual abuse. The for-profit prison housed
adolescent offenders from six states.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arizona and California authorities are investigating a
privately operated boot camp in Arizona that California paid to
take hundreds of offenders. A 16-year-old boy died there, and
authorities suspect the cause was abuse by guards and poor medical
care. California announced July 8 that it was removing its
juveniles from the camp.
</P>
<P>
   And recently Arkansas canceled the contract of Associated Marine
Institutes, a company based in Florida, to run one juvenile
institution, following questions of financial control and
accusations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions and state laws have
long mandated a higher standard for juvenile prisons than for adult
prisons. There is supposed to be more schooling, medical care and
security because the young inmates have been adjudged delinquent,
rather than convicted of crimes like adults, and so are held for
rehabilitation instead of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But what has made problems worse here is that Tallulah, to earn
a profit, has scrimped on money for education and mental health
treatment in a state that already spends very little in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly perverse,'' said David Utter, director of the
Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana. ``They have this place that
creates all these injuries and they have all these kids with mental
disorders, and then they save money by not treating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Roberts, the lawyer for Tallulah's owner, Trans-American
Development Associates, said that some of the Justice Department's
demands, like hiring more psychiatrists, are ``unrealistic.'' The
state is to blame for the problems, he said, because ``our place
was not designed to take that kind of inmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roberts said, ``There has been a drastic improvement'' in
reducing brutality by guards. As for fights between the inmates, he
said, ``Juveniles are a little bit different from adults. You are
never going to stop all fights between boys.''
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with Polozola responding to the Justice
Department experts and Whitley, the state attorney general's office
disputed allegations of brutality and of high numbers of retarded
and mentally ill inmates at Tallulah.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Cheney Joseph, executive counsel to Gov.
Mike Foster, warned there were limits to what Louisiana was willing
to do. ``There are certain situations the Department of Justice
would like us to take care of,'' he said, ``that may not be
financially feasible and may not be required by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ENTREPRENEURS: An Idea Born Of Patronage
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a prison here was put forward in 1992 by James R.
Brown, a Tallulah businessman whose father was an influential state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the poorest areas in a poor state, Tallulah wanted jobs,
and like other struggling cities across the country it saw the
nation's prison-building spree as its best hope.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana needed a new juvenile prison because the number of
young people being incarcerated was rising steeply; within a few
years it more than doubled. Adding to the number, mental health
experts say, were hundreds of juveniles who had no place else to go
because of massive cuts in psychiatric services outside of jail.
Mental health authorities estimate that 20 percent of juveniles
incarcerated nationally have serious mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   To help win a no-bid contract to operate a prison, the company
Brown formed included two close friends of Gov. Edwin Edwards _
George Fischer and Verdi Adam _ according to a businessman involved
in the venture's early stages, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men had any particular qualification to run a
prison. Verdi was a former chief engineer of the state Highway
Department. Fischer had been the governor's campaign manager,
cabinet officer and occasional business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Tallulah opened in 1994, and the town of 10,000 got what it
hoped for. The prison became its largest employer and taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the company formed by Brown, Trans-American,
pursued a strategy of maximizing its profit from the fixed amount
it received from the state for each inmate (in 1997, $24,448). The
plan was to keep wages and services at a minimum while taking in as
many inmates as possible, according to the businessman involved in
the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit prisons often try to economize. But the best-run
companies have come to recognize that operating with too small or
poorly trained a staff can spell trouble, and experts say state
officials must pay close attention to the level of services being
provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the responsibility belongs to the state,'' said
Charles Thomas, director of the Private Corrections Project at the
University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they monitored conditions at Tallulah and
first reported many of the problems there. But in fiscal year
1996-97, according to the state Department of Public Safety and
Corrections, Tallulah still listed no money for recreation,
treatment or planning inmates' return to society. Twenty-nine
percent of the budget went to construction loans.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 45 percent of the $32,200 a year that California
spends on each juvenile goes to programs and caseworkers, and none
to construction. Nationally, construction costs average 7 percent
of juvenile prison budgets, Dunlap said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means either that Tallulah's construction costs are
terribly inflated, or the services they are providing are
extraordinarily low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   THE INSIDE: Hot, Crowded, Spartan, Neglectful
</P>
<P>
   Part of Tallulah is a boot camp, with boys crammed so tightly in
barracks that there is room only for double bunks, a television set
and a few steel tables. Showers and urinals are open to the room,
allowing boys who have been incarcerated for sexual assault to
attack other inmates, according to a report in June by a Justice
Department consultant, Dr. Bernard Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The only space for the few books that have recently been
imported to try to improve education is a makeshift shelf on top of
the urinals. Among the aging volumes that a visitor saw were
``Inside the Third Reich,'' ``The Short Stories of Henry James''
and ``Heidi.''
</P>
<P>
   From their wakeup call at 5:30 a.m., the inmates, in white
T-shirts and loose green pants, spend almost all their time
confined to the barracks. They leave the barracks only for marching
drills, one to three hours a day of class and an occasional game of
basketball. There is little ventilation, and temperatures in
Louisiana's long summers hover permanently in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The result, several boys told a visitor, is that some of them
deliberately start trouble in order to be disciplined and sent to
the other section of Tallulah, maximum-security cells that are
air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Guards put inmates in solitary confinement so commonly that in
one week in May more than a quarter of all the boys spent at least
a day in ``lockdown,'' said Nancy Ray, another Justice Department
expert. The average stay in solitary is five to six weeks; some
boys are kept indefinitely. While in the tiny cells, the boys are
stripped of all possessions and lie on worn, thin mattresses
resting on concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The crowding, heat and isolation are hardest on the 25 percent
of the boys who are mentally ill or retarded, said Dr. Hudson, a
psychiatrist, tending to increase their depression or psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tallulah has made some improvements in its treatment of
the emotionally disturbed over the past year, Hudson said, it
remains ``grossly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison still does not properly screen new arrivals for
mental illness or retardation, he reported. The part-time doctor
and psychiatrist are there so infrequently that they have never
met, Hudson said. Powerful anti-psychotic medications are not
monitored. Medical charts often cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   And the infirmary is often closed because of a shortage of
guards, whose pay is so low _ $5.77 an hour _ that there has been
100 percent turnover in the staff in the past year, the Justice
Department experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Other juvenile prisons that have come under investigation have
also been criticized for poor psychiatric treatment. But at
Tallulah this neglect has been compounded by everyday violence.
</P>
<P>
   All these troubles are illustrated in the case of one former
inmate, Travis M., a slight 16-year-old who is mentally retarded
and was also treated with drugs for hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Travis said in an interview after his release, guards
hit him because his medication made him sleepy and he did not stand
to attention when ordered. Sometimes they ``snuck'' him at night as
he slept in his bunk, knocking him to the cement floor. Sometimes
they kicked him while he was naked in the shower, telling him
simply, ``You owe me some licks.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis was originally sentenced by a judge to 90 days for
shoplifting and stealing a bicycle. But every time he failed to
stand for a guard or even called his grandmother to complain,
officials at Tallulah put him in solitary and added to his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 months, a judge finally ordered him released so he
could get medical treatment. His eardrum had been perforated in a
beating by a guard, he has large scars on his arms, legs and face
and his nose was so badly broken that he speaks in a wheeze. A
lawyer is scheduled to file suit against Tallulah on behalf of
Travis.
</P>
<P>
   One reason these abuses have continued, Utter said, is that
juveniles in Louisiana, as in a number of states, often get poor
legal representation. One mentally ill boy from Eunice was
sentenced without a lawyer, or even a trial. Poorly paid public
defenders seldom visit their clients after sentencing, Utter said,
and so are unaware of conditions at places like Tallulah.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that almost all Tallulah's inmates are from
poor families and 82 percent are black, Utter noted, a problem that
afflicts prisons nationwide to one degree or another. ``They are
disenfranchised and no one cares about them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW GUARD: A Retreat From Brutality
</P>
<P>
   In September, Tallulah hired as its new warden David Bonnette, a
25-year veteran of Angola State Penitentiary who started there as a
guard and rose to assistant superintendent. A muscular,
tobacco-chewing man with his initials tattooed on a forearm,
Bonnette brought several Angola colleagues with him to impose
better discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, there were a lot of perforated eardrums,'' he
said. ``Actually, it seemed like everybody had a perforated
eardrum, or a broken nose.'' When boys wrote complaints, he said,
guards put the forms in a box and pulled out ones to investigate at
random. Some were labeled, ``Never to be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   But allegations of abuse by guards dropped to 52 a month this
spring, from more than 100 a month last summer, Bonnette said, as
he has tried to carry out a new state policy of zero tolerance for
brutality. Fights between boys have declined to 33 a month, from
129, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, Ms. Ray, the Justice Department consultant,
reported that there had been a recent increase in ``youth defiance
and disobedience,'' with the boys angry about Tallulah's
``exceptionally high'' use of isolation cells.
</P>
<P>
   Many guards have also become restive, the Justice Department
experts found, a result of poor pay and new restrictions on the use
of force.
</P>
<P>
   One guard who said he quit for those reasons said in an
interview, ``The inmates are running the asylum now. You're not
supposed to touch the kids, but how are we supposed to control them
without force?'' He has relatives working at Tallulah and so
insisted on not being identified.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration boiled over last week, during a tour by Sen.
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who is drafting legislation that would
require psychiatric care for all incarcerated juveniles who need
it. Despite intense security, a group of inmates climbed on a roof
and shouted their complaints at Wellstone, who was accompanied by
Richard Stalder, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of Public
Safety and Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Stalder said he planned to create a special unit for mentally
ill juvenile offenders. One likely candidate to run it, he said, is
Trans-American _ the company that operates Tallulah.

GERMAN CAPTURES STAGE AS TOUR RETURNS TO FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LORIENT, France _ Every French bicycle racer dreams of winning a
stage of the Tour de France on July 14, the national holiday.
Tuesday, Xavier Jan came about as close as he could: half the
length of a bicycle, which was good for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have much luck,'' said the 28-year-old Frenchman, who
rides for La Francaise des Jeux. ``Yes, it would have been
wonderful on the Quatorze Juillet,'' July 14.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the new Europe, the one with no national boundaries
and a forthcoming universal currency. So the huge crowd of French
people in Brittany sounded more or less sincere as it cheered the
victory of a German, Jens Heppner of the Telekom team, instead of
one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   With a little less than three-quarters of a mile of the 105-mile
third stage left, Heppner and Jan accelerated away from their
partners in a long breakaway by nine men, three of them French. The
two leaders played cat and mouse, watching each other, until the
final 150 meters, when Heppner jumped ahead and crossed the line
first.
</P>
<P>
   Third, two seconds behind and at the head of the remaining six
riders, was George Hincapie, an American with the U.S. Postal
Service team. He said afterward that he had cramped in his right
thigh near the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could tough out a sprint but I couldn't chase and
catch those two and then sprint,'' said Hincapie, a 25-year-old New
York City native who now calls Charlotte, N.C., home. His highest
finish in three Tours de France moved Hincapie, the American
national champion, into second place over all.
</P>
<P>
   He is two seconds behind the new leader, Bo Hamburger, a Dane
with Festina, who was also part of the nine-man breakaway and
finished fourth. In third place over all is Stuart O'Grady, an
Australian member of the Gan team, who finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner, 33, is a team worker for Telekom, usually in charge of
shepherding Jan Ullrich, the winner of the last Tour. He joined the
breakaway, which lasted 124 kilometers, as a routine protective
measure for his team, guaranteeing that if the riders won by a big
margin, a Telekom representative would be among them.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers finished one minute 10 seconds ahead of the main
pack as Heppner, who moved to fourth place over all, was timed in 3
hours 33 minutes 36 seconds in the southward run through Brittany
from the port of Roscoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour put the ``de France'' back into its name at Roscoff on
Tuesday, ending the second Year of the French in Ireland much as
the first one ended exactly two centuries ago: The visitors sailed
off in the night. This time, though, they left behind happy
memories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1798, a small Napoleonic force was sent to aid an Irish
uprising against the British and, when it began to fail, the French
hoisted anchor and left the rebellion's leaders, notably Wolfe
Tone, to face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The visit went much better this time. All along the routes of
the prologue and the first two stages in Ireland, the French flag
was flown with the Irish and bilingual signs proclaimed ``Bienvenue
a Tipperary, Welcome to Tipperary,'' or wherever.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of spectators were immense and the race's staging areas
were awash in folk dancers, long ranks of friendly people with
pikes to denote their Viking past and plentiful food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   After the second stage into Cork on Monday, the 186 remaining
riders and their team officials were flown to Brittany. The 2,000
other members of the entourage and their many cars and trucks were
put aboard three ferries to cross the Channel overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sailing, an Irish bagpipe band on shore began
serenading the visitors. Many Bretons are Celts, too, and a French
bagpipe band aboard one ferry took up the lament.
</P>
<P>
   As the last strains of ``The Minstrel Boy to the War Has Gone''
were just dying, the ship pulled away from the slip. Ashore, the
organizing committee for the Tour's visit released hundreds of
balloons, some blue, some white and some red for the French colors.
</P>
<P>
   The balloons were still rising as the ferry began a slow turn
starboard, away from Ireland and toward France. &QL;

BEAUMONT ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT MEN CHARGED IN JASPER DRAGGING
DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Veteran Beaumont defense attorneys will
represent three white men charged with capital murder in the highly
publicized slaying of a black man who was dragged for almost three
miles behind a pickup outside Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Jr., 49, was killed early June 7 while he was on his
way home from a family gathering. The dragging of his body over a
rough country road tore off his right arm and head.
</P>
<P>
   Bill King and Shawn Berry, 23-year-old Jasper residents, and
Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs were indicted by a
Jasper County grand jury last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, state District Judge Joe Bob Golden appointed
attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. to defend King and Douglas
Barlow to defend Brewer. Berry earlier hired Joseph C. ``Lum''
Hawthorn to be his defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Golden had earlier appointed Jasper attorneys for the three
defendants, but had to appoint new attorneys after they were
indicted on capital charges. State law requires attorneys
representing clients in death penalty cases to have special
certification. No Jasper lawyers have that certification.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs, 60, who holds his undergraduate and law degrees from
Baylor University in Waco, represented Joe Dugas, a Port Arthur
refinery worker sentenced to die by a Corpus Christi jury for the
1978 kidnapping and murder of five members of a Winnie
family. &UR;  &LR; Dugas died in 1983 when he was shot and killed after
trying to escape while being taken from Beaumont back to his death
row cell in Huntsville. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cribbs also defended David Lee Holland, who was executed in
1993 for the 1985 slaying of two clerks at a Port Arthur savings
and loan office during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow, 44, holds an undergraduate degree from Texas A&AMP;M
University and a law degree from the University of Houston. He
represented Michael Lee Lockhart during the Ohio man's appeal for
his conviction for killing a Beaumont policeman in 1987. Lockhart
was executed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow is serving as a special prosecutor in the appeal of James
Vanderbilt, a former rookie police officer twice convicted of
abducting and fatally shooting Katina Moyer, the 16-year-old
daughter of former state Rep. Hudson Moyer in Amarillo in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn, 56, is a former FBI special agent who also was an
assistant district attorney and assistant U.S. attorney. He holds
an undergraduate degree from Lamar University and a law degree from
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he defended Beaumont civic leader Rosine McFaddin
Wilson, who was accused of murder in the shooting death of a fired
ranch caretaker. A Houston jury convicted her of involuntary
manslaughter and sentenced her to five years probation and a $5,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn was also instrumental in getting a brace of pilfered
pistols back to the Lone Ranger. The pearl-handled pistols used by
actor Clayton Moore in his ``Lone Ranger'' television show in the
1940's and 50's were in a suitcase that disappeared from Houston's
Hobby Airport on Christmas Eve 1986. Hawthorn returned the pistols
after an unnamed client bought them and realized they were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said Tuesday he hasn't studied Brewer's case enough to
comment on it. Cribbs could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said Berry wasn't a participant in Byrd's killing.
Although he owns the truck from which Byrd was chained and dragged,
Hawthorn said the young man contends he tried to stop his two
companions from harming Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been accused of guilt by association,'' Hawthorn said.
``He took no active part in this crime. In fact, he tried to stop
it.''

ARTS ABROAD: UNPUBLISHED POEMS BY A YOUNG, OVERHEATED BORGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The essays, short stories and poetry
of Jorge Luis Borges are an elaborate maze of paradoxes and clues
as intriguing as they are ambiguous. If his literature defies easy
understanding, so too does his life. He lived as a hermit, toyed
with his interviewers and refused to embrace any literary or
political doctrine for any sustained period.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that the sudden appearance of two
unpublished poems he wrote as a teen-ager while living in
Switzerland and tinkered with over 10 years has inspired excitement
in the Argentine literary press even though the consensus is that
neither poem has much literary merit. Indeed, it seems that Borges,
who died in 1986, made a conscious decision never to publish them.
</P>
<P>
   But the poems remain enticing, in part because for some reason
Borges did not destroy them along with dozens of other early
writings. They also are the earliest poems by Borges known to have
survived and the only ones scholars know of that exist from his
brief enchantment with German Expressionism, from 1916 to 1918,
when all his published works were either translations of other
writers or critical essays.
</P>
<P>
   One, ``The Little Red Box,'' an erotic description of rough,
macho sex, may shed light on Borges' lifelong, problematic
relationships with women. The other, ``Landing,'' expresses the
anguish of an artist responding to the horrors of World War I. Both
are scribbled in different-color inks and were revised and signed
three times, in 1918, 1919 and 1928. And both include some
illustrations the writer apparently copied from a professional
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The poems are inflated by bombastic phrasing and breathless
adolescent emotions. ``My heart is a sponge inflamed by tears,''
young Borges wrote in the final stanza of ``Landing.'' In ``The
Little Red Box'' he begins, ``His sharp rapacious eye watches from
above the flesh of the distant prey.'' The prey is a woman, and in
love ``the impulse squeezes, the movement crushes.'' Many of the
stanzas make no grammatical sense, but are simply a rush of images,
many of which are sexual.
</P>
<P>
   The poems came to light after Alejandro Vaccaro, an Argentine
biographer of Borges and collector of the author's memorabilia,
bought the manuscripts for $50,000 from an Argentine rare book
collector at a Paris book fair six weeks ago. The collector, Victor
Aizenman, refused to tell Vaccaro where he obtained the poems.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Aizenman said, ``I have a source very close to
the Borges family.'' He added that his contact ``has been
stimulating me with the idea that more such early writings exist
that will eventually become available, but my source is very
discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Borges' widow has sole publication rights over her
husband's writings, Vaccaro cannot publish the poems. He said he
would donate them to a museum or other literary institution
someday, while admitting that he hoped the publicity surrounding
the poems could polish his image and help him fulfill his dream of
becoming president of the Boca Juniors, the most popular soccer
club in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive and humorous twists behind the poems are
appropriately Borgesian, although the quality of these traumatic
soundings of an obviously excitable 19-year-old is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borges was a great writer not because he wrote these poems,
but because he rejected them,'' said Roberto Gonzalez Echeverria, a
professor of Hispanic and comparative literature at Yale
University. ``One can see why these tentative texts, redolent with
the metaphoric excesses of the avant-garde, would have repelled
him.'' Nevertheless, he added, ``Since it is Borges, we should
celebrate having them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro agreed that the poems merely represented ``small steps
Borges took on his march to becoming a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every line Borges ever wrote is important,'' he added. ``We
need to know how Borges developed, and where he came from.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the time Borges wrote the first drafts of the two poems, he
was living with his family in Geneva and Lugano. It was a
particularly traumatic time for the young writer, since he had just
lost a beloved grandmother. He also wrote the poems a few months
after he had his first sexual experience, one set up by his father
with one of his own mistresses, which apparently ended with
embarrassing frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry reflects Borges' deep if temporary link to the
Expressionist movement, many of whose artists and writers were
trying to deal with their anger toward those they held responsible
for the horrors of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   James Woodall, the English author of an acclaimed 1996 biography
of Borges, speculated that perhaps Borges did not immediately
publish the poems because he did not have ready outlets or because
he might have been reticent about embarrassing his family by
publishing work with a salacious content. Woodall noted that by the
time Borges had published three books of poetry in the 1920s, he
had already moved away from Expressionism and embraced Ultraism, a
Hispanic form of Futurism noted for its elaborate metaphors and
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Borges went back to the poems for a final revision in
1928, Woodall concluded, ``he might well have decided they were
just not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   After his final efforts on the two poems, Borges published no
poetry for 30 years. Toward the end of his life he wrote several
exquisite sonnets, but none were similar to either of the early
poems. Why, then, did he save those youthful verses? ``It may be
pure chance that these poems survived,'' said Gonzalez Echeverria.
``We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   How Borgesian.

`BEST MAN': IN A GROUP HOME, AT 70 STILL THE STAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The important news for those who saw ``Best Boy,''
the fine documentary that won an Academy Award in 1979, is that
Philly is alive and kicking, or dancing when occasion invites.
Philip Wohl, known to everybody in his family and in his Queens
neighborhood as Philly, was 50 years old when his cousin Ira Wohl
first decided to tell his story; now, at 70, he is the endearing
hero of a sweet sequel, ``Best Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier work found Philly, mentally retarded since birth, at
a crucial moment. The parents who had cared for him all his life
were old and ailing, and he was about to be moved into a group home
for the retarded. When we meet him anew, his parents are dead, and
his sister, Frances, a widow who lives near the home, has taken on
the role of parent.
</P>
<P>
   Philly has not merely adapted to his new life but is
flourishing. His enthusiasms _ for coffee and danish, singing,
tidying up _ seem zestier than ever, and as this report reveals, he
is ready for new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving as producer, director and editor, Wohl
fills us in on the scattered Wohl family, but it is his cousin's
star power that carries his film.
</P>
<P>
   Philly is a natural. There is much that he cannot express, but
there is nothing foolish about what he says; he has a grasp of the
essentials, whether it is the memory of the parents who protected
him for so long or the warmth of the friends he has made in his new
home. His words are basic and blunt, but they suggest depths of
feeling. He is a man who inspires affection and repays it.
</P>
<P>
   We join Philly on ``family day'' at the home, where he has
become a considerable presence; at a disco party, where he shows
off and mugs for the camera; on a visit to Coney Island, where he
dances on the Boardwalk; on a trip to the cemetery, where he joins
in the prayer for his dead parents; at a talk on Judaism at the
92nd Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment that must move even viewers who have had enough of
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' he and Frances join in a duet of
``Sunrise, Sunset.'' Philly participates spiritedly in everything;
at 70, he is still the best boy.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of these cheering 90 minutes, Philly makes his
first flight on an airplane, to visit Los Angeles and his cousin
Ira, who notes that this is the first family visit he has ever
received.
</P>
<P>
   Wohl tells us that he is an only child with no son of his own,
and so he decides to give his cousin a bar mitzvah. Finally the
family and the residents of the home get together at the bar
mitzvah party, and ``Best Man'' ends on a tearful yet exhilarating
high with Philly, ever the star, presiding. ``Good song!'' he
announces.

US RIDER FINISHES THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was so close, but not close enough for American rider George
Hincapie to take over the lead in the Tour de France Tuesday. The
US Postal Serivce team rider finished third in the race and moved
within two seconds of the overall lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a near miss for us, but it really put us in a position
to grab the (leader's) yellow jersey tomorrow,'' team spokesman Dan
Osipow said by telephone. ``There are three sprints with time
bonuses, and we intend to go after the jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the time of the race, time bonuses are given
during the first nine stages.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie, 25, who became US champion in June and is on top of
the National Racing Calendar standings, was with a pack of nine
riders who made a dash for the finish line in the 105-mile stage
that ended in Lorient, France.
</P>
<P>
   But Jens Heppner of Germany and Xavier Jan of France pulled away
from the break with less than 2 miles to go, and Heppner bolted
over the line first, in 3 hours 33 minutes 36 seconds. Next was
Jan, and Hincapie sprinted to take third. That left him trailing
only the new Tour leader, Bo Hamburger of Denmark. Germany's Erik
Zabel, the Tour leader entering Tuesday's stage, fell back to 10th
place, 1:02 behind Hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie was upset over the way Heppner and Jan worked together
to set the pace of the small group and accused the two of failing
to push hard during the fast pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a sprint like that at the end, it is different because
everyone is so wasted except for those two other guys,'' Hincapie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Hincapie won the stage, he would have received 20 bonus
seconds and claimed the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cramped with about 10 kilometers to go,'' he said. ``I
floated in the back until my legs came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The only American ever to wear the yellow jersey is three-time
Tour winner Gred LeMond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to make George No. 2 (today),'' Osipow said.
</P>
<P>
   The stage on Bastille Day marked the Tour's arrival in host
country France after three days in Ireland. Hundreds of thousands
of people lined the course, celebrating Bastille Day and the party
hangover of France winning soccer's World Cup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's stage is a 156-mile race as the Tour heads south
along the western coast of France.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the racing, talk on the Tour concerned news that a
masseur for the Festina team, charged last week with smuggling
doping products into France, had told police he had been acting on
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Willy Voet had confessed it was not the first time
he smuggled banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   Team boss Bruno Roussel said he was ``stunned'' by the
revelations and had asked to speak to police as soon as possible
``to set the record straight.''

`PIMPERNEL' AGAIN, BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19.)  
 (JT)  
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The gilt and crystal chandeliers
sparkle, the marble walls shimmer, and the elegant china on the
dining table is straight out of the 18th century. This is a set for
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' the ever-popular story of love and
double lives, action and derring-do, in the aftermath of the French
Revolution. Apparently there can never be too many versions of the
story, which was immortalized by Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon on
film in 1935 and has been produced on stage and screen many times
since. There is even a musical version currently on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Now A&AMP;E, which brought ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Emma'' and
``Tom Jones'' to American cable television, is producing ``The
Scarlet Pimpernel'' with the BBC. The three-part, six-hour
mini-series, replete with 1,200 costumes and visually rich locales
in the Czech Republic, promises to be lush in the current
literary-adaptation style. One of the main attractions of filming
the Pimpernel's tale yet again, at a cost of $9.1 million, a
princely sum for television, is the opportunity for a high-class
adventure story.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all his disguises and rescues, the Pimpernel was really
like the first crusader, the first Superman,'' explained Delia
Fine, A&AMP;E's vice president for film, drama and the performing arts.
``When you put the combination of adventure and romance against the
horrors of the French Revolution, it stands the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while not everyone may remember the story line, the
recognition level of the name Scarlet Pimpernel in many parts of
the world is extraordinarily high.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the story, set in 1792, is Sir Percy Blakeney, a
foppish English aristocrat who is in reality the elusive Scarlet
Pimpernel, rescuer of innocent French aristocrats from the
guillotine. He is a master of disguise, whisking counts and
countesses from under the nose of Chauvelin, the French
government's most hard-headed zealot. Blakeney's wife is the
intelligent and beautiful Marguerite, a French actress who quotes
Rousseau and once had an affair with Chauvelin. The strained
marriage that we initially see between Percy and Marguerite is
transformed into one of love and trust as they work together under
life-threatening conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of this new version are Richard E. Grant, whose most
recent film role was as the Spice Girls' manager in ``Spice
World''; Elizabeth McGovern, the American actress who while still a
teen-ager rushed to fame in Robert Redford's ``Ordinary People''
and most recently appeared in the 1997 film ``The Wings of the
Dove,'' and the English actor Martin Shaw, who was on Broadway in
1996 in ``An Ideal Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. McGovern, now married, a mother and living in London _
``Not many go from Hollywood to Hammersmith,'' she says with a
laugh _ the role of Marguerite is a chance to get inside the head
of a woman in a mature relationship. ``It's about people who have
passions and go for it; it's not about people who sit around and
think,'' she said during a break from the 90-day shooting schedule
in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always fighting,'' she said of Marguerite and Percy.
``But they love each other passionately. This is a portrait of a
marriage, not a love affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGovern, 35, said she was relieved to be able to be an
``actress and not the cutest, most idealized woman'' that most
Hollywood scripts demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a woman not in her 20s, the stories on television often
are more actor-friendly and often give the chance to play a real
part,'' Ms. McGovern said. ``This is a well-written relationship.
She's a grown-up. Not many parts are written for grown-up women.
And she's in the center of the action, which is something all
actresses are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   For Shaw, playing Chauvelin represents the challenge of turning
a character that has traditionally been played as an unremittingly
dark villain without any redemptive qualities into something more
nuanced. Shaw says he tries to make the character a bit more
believable and to highlight his motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the main baddie, the head of the secret police of
Robespierre, a cynical opportunist who was once a revolutionary,''
Shaw said. But even as such a malevolent zealot, Chauvelin retains
one ideal: his love for Marguerite, about whom he is obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   To give more currency to Chauvelin to contemporary audiences,
Shaw said, he plays the character as a 34-year-old, much younger
than in past productions. ``He's much more interesting viewed as a
1950s Maoist.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' promise plenty of
gorgeous scenery and staging. The Czech Republic was chosen for
most of the shooting because its castles and Prague itself are much
closer to the look of Paris in the 1790s than present-day France.
Paris, like Prague today, still had a medieval feel to it, said the
mini-series' BBC producer, Julian Murphy. Many of the castle
interiors are still in good condition _ like the Clam Gallas Palace
in Prague, where the crew spent a day shooting _ and many of the
palaces in the countryside are derelict enough to suggest
post-revolutionary France. The producers have avoided the
tourist-laden town squares that the Czech authorities have recently
redecorated in pastel pinks, blues and yellow and instead have
chosen more dilapidated areas or have filmed at night.
</P>
<P>
   The costume designers have had a whole new look to translate. By
the 1790s, all the corseting and restricted fashion of French dress
had given way to easier, almost punklike looks. Everybody's hair is
flowing or in loose ponytails. As for the dialogue, don't expect
anything too specific to the period or the book, which was written
in 1900 in London by Baroness Orczy, a Hungarian emigre. The story
always fascinated, but the writing was never considered great
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Jane Austen wrote great dialogue, people felt obliged
to put that in and be faithful to it,'' said Ms. McGovern. ``With
this we can be freer.''

THERE IS `SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' 
OUR RATING: THREE STARS
</HEADLINE>

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Courage and comedy aren't two words that are
usually linked. But in politically correct times when most movies
assiduously avoid crossing the delicate line of vulgarity in fear
of losing mass appeal (and that all-important PG-13 rating), it is
positively heroic when a couple of guys manage to call to mind the
days of Mel Brooks and ``Springtime for Hitler'' and create a film
that manages both to joyfully entertain and creatively offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' has all the spirit of Brooks
and Monty Python and ``Animal House'' in its manic zeal to milk
every sacred cow in the name of facetious fun. You'll laugh. You'll
groan. And often at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there would be no reason to celebrate ``Mary'' if it
were merely tasteless. (Karen Finley and other NEA gravy trainers
are learning that harsh reality now.) This is the most consistently
funny movie the Farrelly brothers have made, coming on the heels of
guilty pleasures ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin.'' ``Mary'' will
probably be tagged with the title ``Gross and Grosser,'' a
distinction it admittedly earns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Farrellys, who wrote and directed the film together,
populate their movie with surprisingly sympathetic characters,
which often makes the wicked humor kind of touching _ albeit in a
sick, twisted way.
</P>
<P>
   The movie puts a '90s spin on the age-old story of Boy Meets
Girl. Basically, it's ``Sleepless in Seattle'' with a court
restraining order thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' opens with an inspired, 20-minute time capsule
introducing the characters in their nerdy, mid-'80s high school
days. We meet Ted (Ben Stiller), a gangly geek with a bad haircut
and braces who has the hots for dream girl Mary (Cameron Diaz).
When Ted sticks up for Mary's mentally handicapped brother, she
rewards him by asking him to the prom. That sets up an unfortunate
incident involving Ted's zipper, and he never gets to see Mary
again.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 13 years and Ted is still dreaming about Mary. His
loathsome pal, Dom (the perfectly cast Chris Elliott), suggests Ted
hire a private investigator to track her down. The goofball he
enlists, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), ends up falling for Mary himself,
which puts into motion a love triangle that eventually expands to
include other idiotic suitors. You see, there is, indeed, something
about Mary, and it seems to attract every man on the Eastern
seaboard with an IQ of less than 50.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is too long and, like most good sketch comedies, its
humor misses as often as it connects. But there are several scenes
that will have you laugh so hard that you'll start to cry. Or maybe
it will work the other way around. Certainly, you will never look
at hair gel the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz brings great comic timing and a sweet vulnerability to
Mary, and Stiller and Dillon prove to be troopers in the face of
all sorts of indignities. Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, Markie Post (!),
Elliott and Jonathan Richman as a wandering troubadour (and
makeshift Greek chorus) straight out of ``Cat Ballou'' round out a
wonderfully funny supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film's crude tastelessness won't play with
everyone. Sometimes you'll even hate yourself for laughing. But
laugh you will _ often and hard. ``There's Something About Mary''
is the funniest movie of the year, and it mixes in just enough
sweetness with its bodily fluids to make it good, deranged fun. &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were more than a few days during the making
of the gleefully gross new comedy, ``There's Something About
Mary,'' that actor Ben Stiller did not exactly relish the idea of
coming into work. There was the day when a fish hook yanked his
mouth into cartoon proportions. And there was the day when he had
to pretend to get caught in the teeth of a zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be cheerful,'' Stiller says, ``knowing your role
calls for your head to be bashed into a chair or for your thing to
be caught in a zipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Stiller's words repeated to them, Bobby and Peter
Farrelly, who wrote and directed ``Mary'' surely sympathize. But
they hasten to add that Stiller got off easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron Diaz was the one who had the potential career-ender in
the movie,'' Peter says. ``She had to rub the ... how do I say this
... hair gel-like material in her hair. That could have stigmatized
her for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Yeah, it's like Ned Beatty in `Deliverance.' The
only thing he did wrong was be too convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers are nothing if not convincing, which to
their critics is part of the problem. The two Rhode Island natives
mined the depths of lowbrow humor with their first two films,
``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin,'' wild, hit-and-miss movies
about sympathetic losers. The movies won fans with both audiences
and _ surprise _ critics, who found the brothers' in-your-face
humor to be a refreshing blast in an arid, politically correct
landscape. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Beyond 13-year-old humor
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``There's Something About Mary,'' which could be
described as the first stalker romance, the Farrellys have expanded
their reach, possessing the clout to deliver their first R-rated
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was time,'' says Peter, at 41, a year older than
Bobby. ``The only guy who thinks along those lines seems to be
Woody Allen, and obviously he has a different thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seems to set out to make adult comedies anymore,''
Bobby says. ``I think studios want to gear everything to
13-year-old boys. There's nothing wrong with that. We had that age
group in mind with `Dumb and Dumber,' since those guys were about
13 years old themselves mentally. But we've always had a lot of
stuff that we've wanted to do that the MPAA won't let us get away
with. And now we have our chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Mary'' has outrageous scenes, gags that words can't begin
to fully describe and jokes that can't be repeated in a family
newspaper. There are no sacred cows. There are jabs at gay serial
killers, the handicapped and ``retards.'' A dog gets electroshock
treatment and later becomes an amphetamine-fueled whirling dervish.
And, of course, there's the scene with the zipper, a bit already
part of film lore even though the movie hasn't been released yet in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask us, `How far will you go?''' Peter says.
``And the answer is: As far as the audience lets us. It's up to
them. We test a lot, mostly in colleges. And any time the laughter
stops, we cut the scene, sometimes by seconds or sometimes in its
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Mary'' also has _ something the two previous Farrelly
movies lacked _ is an actual story line, sort of a Boy Meets Girl,
Boy Meets Zipper, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Stalks Girl, Boy Gets Girl
Back Again kind of thing. It's a development that also stems from
the brothers' obsession with test screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both `Dumb and Dumber' and `Kingpin' tested in the 90s for
guys and the 40s for women, and with this movie we got the women,
too,'' Peter says. ``I don't know why, but women seem to need a
story. Guys can watch stuff like the Three Stooges and be fine.
Women need more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so needy,'' Bobby adds, mock contempt in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   subhed: Sibling revelry
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys never appear to have been needy in their lives,
even though 15 years ago they were both floundering in sales jobs.
(``We were still enjoying life,'' Peter says. ``Life has always
been nice.'') Bobby, a geological engineering major (a misnomer, he
says, born from his days as a college stoner), was developing
Sunspot, the world's first round beach towel. Peter was selling
shipping space on cargo vessels. Then, after finishing his master's
degree in creative writing, Peter came up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written a book (`Outside Providence,' which will be
released as a film this year starring Alec Baldwin), but I kind of
figured out that I wasn't going to make much money writing fiction
and, besides, it takes too long to write,'' Peter says. ``So I
started writing screenplays with a friend and eventually dragged
Bobby out to L.A. to help because he knows what's funny and what
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys, along with writing partner Bennett Yellin, began
making a comfortable living cranking out unproduced screenplays.
Eddie Murphy purchased one, writer-director David Zucker another.
But it wasn't until they sold ``Dumb and Dumber'' that Peter and
Bobby finally got to see their work on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With their debut, the brothers took no chances, demanding that
they direct the movie, even though neither had ever been to film
school or shot so much as a TV commercial. (``Hollywood isn't like
a regular industry where they do background checks,'' says Bobby,
who is married and has two children. ``We could have been escaped
convicts for all they could tell.'') The Farrellys figured they
knew the story and they knew how to tell a joke. (``What else is
there?'' Bobby asks.) The rest would somehow just work itself out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Flying blind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a panic attack the night before,'' says Peter, who
has been married for a year. ``We called David Zucker and he told
us to relax. He also told us to let everyone on the set know that
we didn't know what the hell we were doing and get their support.
We did, and we've been with the same crew ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only admirers. Jim Carrey credits the Farrellys
for putting his career on the map, and his ``Dumb and Dumber''
co-star Jeff Daniels appreciated the chance to drop his drawers and
dramatic chops and play stupid. (``He wasn't our first choice,''
Peter admits. ``We wanted Michael Richards, but he kept telling us
the story was a tragedy like `Of Mice and Men.' He called us after
the premiere and said, `You know, you guys were right.''')
</P>
<P>
   When ``Kingpin'' failed to ignite the box-office (``It wasn't
marketed very well,'' Bobby says), the Farrellys were courted by
20th Century Fox executive Tom Sherak, who gave the brothers a free
hand in bringing their vulgarity to full fruition. The studio is
pleased enough with the results to have signed the filmmaking team
to a three-year, writing-producing-directing deal. (Next up:
``Stuck on You,'' a comedy about Siamese twins.)
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest fans, though, might be Mom and Dad. Peter and
Bobby credit their parents for honing their humor, although no one
in the family could have guessed at where they would take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents were strict about stuff like TV, but what they
weren't strict about was humor,'' Peter says. ``We could tell any
joke. If it was funny, it was OK. We would sit around the dinner
table, my parents, Bobby and me and our three sisters and just have
a lot of laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Our father just has a brutal sense of humor, and
my mother can take any kind of joke. In fact, it used to piss our
sisters off. They'd be trying to stop us, screaming, `Mom! Don't
encourage them! They're sick.'''
</P>
<P>
   They still are. Only now, their audience is bigger than the
immediate family.

`MASTERPIECE THEATER' GOES AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ For the first time in its 27-year history,
``Masterpiece Theater'' will present American literary
masterpieces, starting next year, executives of the Public
Broadcasting Service announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the largest grant ever given by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, $15 million, as well as financing from Mobil
Corp., the regular sponsor of ``Masterpiece Theater,'' the program
will present dramatic adaptations of such works as Willa Cather's
``Song of the Lark,'' Langston Hughes' ``Cora Unashamed'' and Henry
James' ``American.'' Production of the shows is expected to take
place in both Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The works are to be presented under the title of ``Mobil
Masterpiece Theater's American Collection.'' PBS and Mobil
executives said they had long been urged by viewers to include
American literature in the long-running series, which has always
focused on adaptations of British literature.
</P>
<P>
   Robert O'Leary, the general manager for global public affairs
for Mobil, said: ``We all have a sense that this has been long
overdue. I know that we at Mobil always get letters from viewers
asking why we don't include works by American writers. It's great
to be addressing this at last.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the decision to add the ``American Collection'' had
helped push Mobil to renew its commitment to ``Masterpiece
Theater'' one year early. He did not specify the amount that Mobil
donates but he said that over the history of the program Mobil had
contributed more than $250 million. The executive producer of
``Masterpiece Theater,'' Rebecca Eaton, announced Tuesday that
Mobil had extended its support for the show through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said that he hoped the new productions of American
literature would elicit the same response from American actors that
the British adaptations did from British actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best things to come out of this would be if
American actors saw these adaptations the way British actors do,
almost as an extension of their stage careers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Song of the Lark,'' a novel, is expected to be the first
of the American works presented on the air, Ms. Eaton said. No
specific date was announced for the program.

THE WORLD SEES A KINDER, GENTLER HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the ups and downs of her husband's six
years in the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton has enjoyed the
steady support of many American women who see her as a career model
or an inspiration for marital loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Republican women _ hardly cheerleaders for the First
Lady _ Hillary Rodham Clinton received an approval rating of 45
percent in a Los Angeles Times poll taken in February. Overall,
respondents gave her thumbs up by a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists love her. A group of women's rights advocates meeting
in Boston in April took a straw poll of possible female
presidential candidates, according to Newsweek magazine. Hillary
Rodham Clinton's name was not on the list, but she won the most
votes as a write-in.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady's sometimes controversial role as
feminist-in-chief forms the backdrop Wednesday of her visit of
locales in the Albany area and Upstate New York that are associated
with the history of feminism.
</P>
<P>
   Her aggressive stance on women's issues has ruffled feelings
from time to time. For instance, in January 1992 on the CBS program
``60 Minutes,'' she reaffirmed her faith in her husband who had
been accused of adultery but then avowed that she was not ``some
little woman, standing by her man like Tammy Wynette.'' Wynette
fans were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the future First Lady defended her
high-powered career as a lawyer at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm: ``I
suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, but
what I decided was to fulfill my profession.'' Women who chose the
cookies-and-tea option _ and the men who loved them _ were angered.
</P>
<P>
   It looked for a while as if the governor of Arkansas was married
to a hard-driving, politically correct feminist out of touch with
mainstream American womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Clintons entered the White House in January
1994, Mrs. Clinton had gone a long way toward burying the Bess
Truman and Mamie Eisenhower model of first ladies, content to stand
in their husband's shadows.
</P>
<P>
   This incarnation reached its apex in 1994 when the First Lady
boldly stepped out from those shadows to spearhead the White
House's health care task force, which put forward a complex plan to
make health insurance universally available. Congress didn't buy it
_ and the legislative defeat was a prime factor in the Democrats
losing control of both the House and Senate that November.
</P>
<P>
   That marked a turning point. From then on, Mrs. Clinton sought
to adopt a lower profile, less focused on policy controversies. Her
efforts were only partially successful, mainly because of the
on-going investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Starr's probe was centered on her work at the Rose Law
Firm back in Little Rock. The result was that she was asked to
testify in 1996 before a federal grand jury about the mysterious
reappearance at the White House of her long-missing Rose Law Firm
billing records.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, she became the butt of late-night comedian
jokes when author Bob Woodward revealed in his 1996 book, ``The
Choice,'' that Mrs. Clinton had brought in a psychic who got her to
hold an imaginary conversation with the late Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Clinton won re-election handily with his wife
conspicuously inconspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Clinton well into his second term, Hillary Rodham
Clinton has long since downsized her image, reinventing herself as
the administration's advocate-in-chief for issues that everyone can
support _ in one manner or another.
</P>
<P>
   Her best-selling book, ``It Takes a Village,'' refocused the
spotlight on child care, an issue about which she has long held
strong views. Last October, as she turned 50, Mrs. Clinton chaired
a major White House conference on the subject, exploring ways to
make child care available particularly poor women leaving welfare
to enter the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   This effort has borne no resemblance to the health care task
force. It is way short on social engineering and long on personal
appearances by the First Lady at day care centers where she is
photographed amid smiling children.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Clinton insists there has been no retooling
of her public self. ``I continue to do what I want to do and what I
consider important,'' she told Time magazine last October. ``I
never thought I was living anybody else's role or anybody else's
expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, harsh political reality still intrudes. After the
brouhaha over the president's alleged sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky exploded last January, a
spark of the old Hillary Rodham Clinton flashed on the screen. When
a federal court asked Starr to examine the matter, Mrs. Clinton
attacked him as ``politically motivated'' and ``allied with the
right-wing opponents of my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, just hours before she sat at the head table for the
annual White House Correspondents Association bash, Mrs. Clinton
underwent five hours of questioning at the White House by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as part of her ``Save America's Treasures'' tour,
the First Lady starts the day at the house of Kate Mullany, an
Irish immigrant who organized a union of women laundry workers in
the 1860s. She also is scheduled to visit the Auburn, N.Y., house
of Harriet Tubman, the legendary organizer of the ``Underground
Railroad'' that smuggled slaves to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is to end the day in Seneca Falls, N.Y., birthplace
of the effort to secure equality for women. She will speak at a
ceremony marking the 150th anniversary of ``The Declaration of
Sentiments,'' in which over 100 women in 1848 declared women and
men to be equals.
</P>
<P>
   So in a way, Hillary Rodham Clinton is coming full circle back
to her feminist beginnings in the public eye, circa 1992. The only
difference is this time, there is to be no confrontation, no
jarring quotes.

THREE VICTIMS OF FIREBOMBING BURIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland _ Chrissie Quinn would not bury her
little boys here because she couldn't bear the thought of having to
return to the town where they were murdered, of walking on the same
ground as those who killed them.
</P>
<P>
   But the church in Rasharkin, next to the graveyard where the
boys will rest forever, is being renovated, and so Chrissie Quinn
bowed her head and came here to Ballymoney one last time Tuesday,
to the Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick, for their funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   She stood next to her 13-year-old son, Lee, who escaped the fate
of his three younger brothers because he spent the night at his
grandmother's. She kept her eyes down, seemingly unable to look at
the three small white caskets, so tiny they all fit in one hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Richard, 9-year-old Mark, and 8-year-old Jason
Quinn, who between them were as old as the Troubles, were
dispatched from this world after holding up a mirror to Northern
Ireland. Like Chrissie Quinn, many people had to avert their eyes,
because the images were too disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of the Quinn boys forced many people here to step
back and take stock. Was this an aberration, given the
determination of the overwhelming majority to use new political
institutions to seek accommodation and reconciliation? Or will a
small, intransigent and sometimes murderous minority be allowed to
subvert the democratic wishes of others?
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to contemplate such questions Tuesday, so heavy was
the grief on this, yet another overcast, almost chilly summer's
day.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where people categorize themselves and others by
religious and national allegiance, the Quinn brothers were an
anomaly. They were born to a Catholic mother but lived in a
Protestant neighborhood, a fact that police say led someone to
firebomb their home in the predawn hours of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The local Catholic school was closer to their home, but their
mother sent them to the Protestant state school, in part so that
they would fit in better locally. In their innocence, the boys
transcended tribal loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being raised neutral, if there is such a thing in
this place,'' said Rev. Peter Forde, the priest who officiated at
their funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The boys gathered wood for one of the bonfires that loyalists
hold to celebrate the ``Glorious 12th,'' when Protestants celebrate
the 1690 victory of King William of Orange over the forces of
Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   After the boys watched the bonfire and came home late Saturday,
Chrissie Quinn stayed up until 3:30 a.m., so fearful was she that
Protestant extremists might target her house as they had more than
120 others across Northern Ireland in the past week. An hour after
she went to bed, someone threw a firebomb into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her efforts and those of her Protestant boyfriend to
save them, the boys died screaming. Their deaths shocked Northern
Ireland, and the world. Two men, one with loyalist paramilitary
links, both of them from the Carnany housing project where the
Quinns lived, are being questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
   Although Catholic families are burned out of their homes every
July, when loyalist fervor peaks around the time of the July 12th
celebrations, many lay blame for the boys' deaths with the
hardliners who refuse to call off their protest in Portadown. Since
July 5, the Orange Order has engaged in a standoff with the
security forces who are blocking them from marching through a
Catholic neighborhood. Violence has flared every night of the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The hardliners in Portadown accept no responsibility for
creating the climate that led to the murders of the Quinn boys, but
moderate Orangemen are melting away, leaving the hardliners
increasingly isolated. The murder of the boys has chastened many.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Patrick Walsh was in Lourdes when he got news of what
happened to the Quinn boys. He flew back to deliver the homily at
their funeral, making it clear he believed the Orangemen who
racheted up tension with apocalyptic rhetoric bore some
responsibility for the horrific deaths of three innocents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weapons of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of
murderous destruction,'' Bishop Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, Andrea Ramsey read a poem composed by local
schoolgirls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have so much evil at their fingertips?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, Mark and Jason, in our memory you will stay. I can
still feel the cold, wet lips from when I kissed you and then you
ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 500 people packed into the church burst into applause when
the poem ended. Some of the several hundred people outside the
church burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Father Forde was joined in prayer by a Methodist minister and a
Presbyterian minister, a rare ecumenical moment in Northern Ireland
which demonstrated that Protestants and Catholics are united in
grief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time to make the eight-mile journey to
Rasharkin. John Dillon, the boys' father, and Frank Quinn, their
uncle, shouldered one of the tiny caskets, each of them stroking
the side of the coffin tenderly. Both men sobbed. Lee used the back
of his hands to wipe away tears.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn stepped from the church, supported by her mother,
Irene. This time, her head was up. She had work to do. She had to
bury her sons.

BRISTOL'S BROODING INNOVATORS DEFY EXPECTATIONS AND LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19.)  
 (JT)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol, England, has been the capital of sonic murk and
undertow for a decade, and it's not about to give up the claim. Two
new albums from Bristol's standard-bearers _ Tricky's ``Angels With
Dirty Faces'' (Island) and Massive Attack's ``Mezzanine'' (Virgin)
_ insist on the continuing allure of ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disk jockey and production collectives Soul II Soul
and Massive Attack emerged from Bristol, the city's aural signature
has been a slow, deep bass line _ reggae with English reticence _
below hazy sounds that drift through the mix like troubled
memories.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the music was labeled ``trip-hop,'' which
followers made into a fashionably self-conscious easy-listening
music. But the Bristol originators moved to outflank their
imitators. Their music, like their favorite sounds, refuses to
declare itself, lurking between genres with serene defiance. ``I
can't meet expectations of these radio stations 'cause I move in
different vibrations,'' Tricky proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky, who rapped with Massive Attack in 1991, has since
emerged as a producer, songwriter and brilliant self-made crank (he
is to perform in New York on July 21 at the Hammerstein Ballroom).
For most rappers, hip-hop is a display of extroversion, or at least
a way of flaunting a conspicuous cool. Not for Tricky: he raps like
someone muttering to himself, in a voice so low and scratchy it
could strip the floorboards. Every so often, a woman's voice
(Martina Topley-Bird or, as a guest, Polly Jean Harvey) arrives
with some melody, like a glimpse of a more elevated sphere.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Angels With Dirty Faces,'' Tricky spends most of the songs
grumbling about his career. He snarls at record companies, radio
stations and the press: ``Is this making music or making money? I
can't make my mind up.'' Since he's only a cult figure, not a
million-selling pop star, Tricky's complaints sound tendentious. He
even instructs his listeners. ``For all those who want to analyze
me,'' he intones, ``start it off in the hips/Move to my lips.'' But
he's right; the rhythm tracks are consistently arresting.
</P>
<P>
   Built from live musicians (including Marc Ribot on twangy,
clanky guitar and Perry Melius on unpredictably syncopated drums),
tape loops, drum machines and samples, Tricky's tracks swerve
between propulsion and disorientation. They evade current genres to
hook up with the bleakest blues and with the claustrophobic funk of
Sly and the Family Stone's ``There's a Riot Going On.'' Every song
has an ominous hollowness and, at the same time, an off-center
swing, lurch or throb.
</P>
<P>
   As Tricky charges, ``You trample on my soul,'' in ``Money
Greedy,'' the track scurries ahead in double time, as chattering
wah-wah guitars seethe with barely suppressed rage. ``Demise''
bounds along in 5/4 time on a ticking syncopated drum, a bass vamp,
a steel drumlike keyboard lick and guitar chords that stutter and
catch like a faulty car ignition. Blues licks are everywhere: in
``Mellow'' with stop-and-start drums in constant contention, and in
``Singing the Blues'' with the sound of a bass clarinet chortling
along behind the guitar. In ``Talk to Me,'' he whispers while Ms.
Topley-Bird sings above a track that undulates like the ocean below
a lifeboat, vast and indifferent. Through the album, Tricky's music
conjures solitudes, torments and struggles that are far broader
than his private gripes.
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack is determined to expand trip-hop while
maintaining its atmosphere of steamy foreboding. Like Tricky,
Robert Del Naja and Grant Marshall of Massive Attack rap in deadpan
whispers, but where Tricky has let songs unravel into vamps with
vocals, Massive Attack has held on to song forms, enlisting singers
for melodies. Its third album, ``Mezzanine,'' is an aural revue,
with singers as diverse as the reggae crooner Horace Andy and Liz
Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. Massive Attack has also integrated
rock guitars into its songs. In ``Dissolved Girl,'' while the
singer Sara Jay ponders love in what could be a trip-hop song by
Portishead or Morcheeba, distorted guitars loom and then roar out
of the quiet bass line, turning a ballad into a hard-rock stomp
before melting away.
</P>
<P>
   Andy's tenor has a slowly building vibrato that can sound ardent
or troubled: yearning for love in ``Angel,'' as guitars build a
Pink Floyd-like drone and crescendo, or fretting about a neighbor
in ``Man Next Door,'' with the aching chorus, ``I've got to get
away from here.'' And Ms. Fraser is an unlikely but ideal
collaborator for Massive Attack. Her airy voice and leaping,
quasi-Celtic melodies are grounded by Massive Attack's stolid bass
lines and by sounds, low in the mix, that hover like thunderclouds.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Group Four,'' Massive Attack opens up the structure. Ms.
Fraser's tunes _ sometimes jazzy, sometimes Celtic _ and Massive
Attack's raps alternate over a measured bass line; they could be a
couple's stray thoughts or two strangers' internal monologues. The
song is a pure Bristol product: an enigma with a beat.

POP REVIEW: WITH PILLOW TALK, BOYZ II MEN HOLD THEIR PAJAMA PARTY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Fans waited an entire hour for the pajamas during
Boyz II Men's performance at Radio City Music Hall on Monday night.
The anticipated costumes weren't really pajamas anyway, just loose
white loungewear in diaphanous silk. And almost immediately, the
four Boyz pulled them off to reveal black tank tops and preripped
jeans, in keeping with their tentative new image as hip-hop-loving
roughnecks. It was as if they'd forgotten that the pajamas are what
it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   Boyz II Men are the great ambassadors of pajama pop, a subgenre
of rhythm-and-blues that has thrived since the swinging 1970s. As
one might expect of a style evoking sleepwear, pajama pop is
sexual; in the virtual stripteases performed by Next, the hot group
that preceded Boyz II Men onstage, it can come close to soft-core
porn.
</P>
<P>
   The night's headliners, however, have always stressed pajama
pop's gentler side. Its basic innovation was to temper classic soul
vocalizing and grooves with light jazz harmonies and
instrumentation, to tame the urgent desires expressed in soul and
turn it into genteel persuasion. Silk pajamas cover the bodies of
these singers, just as their elegant intimacies cover their raw
lusts.
</P>
<P>
   Boyz II Men have milked this suave eroticism, hitting platinum
sales with the tear-jerker ``End of the Road'' and the polite
come-on, ``I'll Make Love to You.'' When they revisited these hits
at Radio City, the reasons for their success became clear. Unlike
many other groups who begin as teeny-bop stars, the foursome _
Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Nathan Morris and Michael McCarey _
possess genuine vocal talent and harmonized beautifully. They also
proved to be crowd-pleasing hams, by turns grandiose, vulnerable,
sassy and roguish.
</P>
<P>
   The love they expressed extended to everyone in the family. For
the many children present, there were athletic dance moves and
fireworks-style special effects. For matriarchs, there was
``Mama,'' a son's loyalty oath. For men, there was friendly advice.
``Don't be afraid to sway,'' Stockman advised. ``Girls like to see
fellas that are moving.'' Such words explained pajama pop's appeal
to men: like Hugh Hefner, another famous nightwear fan, Boyz II Men
exemplified a prowess achieved through good taste and careful
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   All of this would have made for a potent show, but Boyz II Men
strayed from their area of expertise. The group's faster songs
lacked focus, and the modified hip-hop-style costumes they wore for
half the show did not suit them. Boyz II Men have always had a
dance-oriented side, but their attempts to turn tough ring hollow.
During such moments they seemed more like yell kings than soul men.
The group needs to find another way to expand upon its pajama game.

 &HT;    Braves ondeck: vs. New York Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 12:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (9-7, 3.30; 4-3,
4.33 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. RHP Masato Yoshii (4-4, 3.65; 0-1, 3.00
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle likes this place. He is 4-2 lifetime at Shea with
an ERA of 2.70 during 12 appearances. His career road ERA
everywhere else is 3.87. And that includes his last start in New
York on the last day of the 1997 season, when he gave up five runs
in five innings. This is his first appearance against the Mets this
season. Neagle has won just once in his last three starts, despite
giving up just five earned runs in his last 20 innings. His run
support has dried up. In his last five starts, the Braves have
managed just one run twice and were shut out when he faced the
Yankees on June 16. The league appears to have caught up with the
Mets' Yoshii. The 33-year-old rookie went 4-1 during his first nine
starts but has gone 0-3 in his eight starts since. The Braves beat
him 4-1 on July 4th at Turner Field (6 IP, 7H), although half of
the Braves' runs were unearned. Like Hideo Nomo, he has developed a
recent problem with the strike zone, walking 16 men in his last 28
1/3 innings.

 &HT;    Delta to split stock, repurchase shares
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines plans a 2-for-1 stock split, as well
as a $750 million stock repurchase program in which the carrier
will buy back about 7 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, announced Tuesday, drove Atlanta-based Delta's stock
to a new high of $142.37 1/2. Shares closed at $142, up $6.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said the stock split -- its first since 1981 -- will be
paid Nov. 16 for shareholders of record on Nov. 2, assuming
shareholder approval. The move will make Delta stock more
affordable to smaller investors, and companies that split their
stock generally post better long-term returns.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, metro Atlanta's largest corporate employer with
about 26,000 locally based workers, could not provide the number of
Georgia shareholders. Most workers hold shares under an employee
ownership program, as well as stock options awarded under a
three-year incentive plan begun in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The split will double the number of those options and cut the
exercise price in half.
</P>
<P>
   The stock repurchase will occur over the next 18 months and will
be funded from Delta's cash reserves, which stood at $1.6 billion
on June 30, a spokesman said. The program will be in addition to an
existing buyback plan to acquire shares for reissue as employee
options.
</P>
<P>
   Repurchases are typically done by companies to decrease the
number of outstanding shares, boosting future per-share earnings
and the stock price. The company had 75.75 million shares
outstanding as of April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's stock is up about 19 percent this year, but returns have
lagged those at other carriers including American, Continental and
US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's reaffirmed its debt ratings for Delta
following the repurchase announcement and said the move ``signals a
more financially aggressive posture'' by Delta under Chief
Executive Leo F. Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Delta reports fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings Thursday,
and analysts expect strong results buoyed by low fuel prices and
heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Delta shareholders will vote on the stock split at the Oct. 22
annual meeting, expected to be held for the first time in New York
City. Delta traditionally has had the meeting in its corporate
birthplace, Monroe, La., although it was in Atlanta in 1995 and
executives had indicated they would rotate it among larger cities.

 &HT;    All golfers not big fans of England's climate
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Most of them love it despite the cold,
despite winds howling off the sea, despite the occasional lack of a
definite landing area. Some play the British Open because it's a
major dripping with tradition. Some simply play because they're
exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoch, on the other hand, would rather be sweating in
Madison, Miss., at the Deposit Guaranty Classic. Or sweating
anywhere, for that matter. A man who ranks cold weather right there
with four-putts and tax audits, Hoch is at Royal Birkdale this week
only because the five-year contract he signed with Yonex this year
specifies that he play in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch cares about neither tradition nor what other people think.
All he knows is that cold weather and his game are not compatible.
Playing the British Open last in 1995 at St. Andrews in cool, windy
weather, Hoch tied for 68th and trashed the sacred ground where
golf germinated, saying, ``I think they had some sheep and goats
there that died, and they just covered them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone get carried away and presume an attitude transplant,
Hoch said Tuesday, ``I've already let them (Yonex) know that
there's an upcoming British that I wasn't going to play in (St.
Andrews in 2000). ... I can't remember what year it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters laughed at that comment, Hoch didn't want anyone
to think he had anything against Scotland. Just the course and the
coarse weather bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot people don't know is that I'm (part) Scottish,''
Hoch said. ``My grandmother was from Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   A British reporter suggested that his grandmother ``might turn
over in her grave'' if he bypasses St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she does,'' Hoch said, ``she's turned over for the third
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a matter of feeling for Hoch. When it gets cold, he
loses the feel for his short game. When wind-chills drop
drastically, Hoch feels like he's putting with a popsicle. A few
years ago he had the blood circulation to his hands checked, but
found no medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just not my type of weather,'' Hoch said. ``I'm not
sure it's anybody's type of weather, but I'm sure there are a lot
of other players that can play much better in this kind of stuff
than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   There's irony to the fact Hoch has an obligation to play this
year. The past two British Opens at Royal Troon and Royal Lytham
have brought atypically warm weather. This week the weather is so
cold and windy, even the Brits are complaining about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's comments three years ago brought negative comments from
some PGA Tour colleagues. Brad Faxon, for one, suggested that
players who skip the British Open shouldn't get Ryder Cup points
for competing elsewhere that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was wrong,'' Hoch said. ``... We're independent
contractors, so to speak, and we get to play where we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch actually likes Royal Birkdale, which is tighter than some
British Open venues and rewards finding the fairway. And what if he
were to somehow drive out his negative thoughts and win?
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought that could easily happen until I got over
here and saw the weather,'' he said. ``I thought that would show
that God has a sense of humor, wouldn't it?''

 &HT;    Kuchar can't fathom millions
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar, 20, admittedly can not comprehend
the numbers that are being thrown at him by agents wishing that he
turn professional. ``I'm not too familiar with exactly what those
numbers mean,'' he said Tuesday. ``They're saying millions. I don't
really know what a million is going to do for me. I've always
played around with a couple of thousand to get by on tuition and
buying books and buying food for myself. I really don't know how
far a million could get me.'' He may find out soon enough. Some
expect him to turn pro before the U.S. Amateur next month. Ex-Tech
man Stewart Cink, whom Kuchar has counseled about the matter of
turning pro, said, ``It's going to be hard for him to turn down all
that's being thrown at him. For the long term, if he's going to
turn pro, probably the best time is very soon.'' Then again, Cink
said, ``I've told him if his game is good enough to turn pro out
here right now, it will be good enough in two years. It's not a
sprint; it's a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Open prep
</P>
<P>
   Comfort zones with links-style conditions might be present for
both Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods this week. Granted, the weather
was different in Orlando, Fla., but last week before coming to
Ireland, they played The Old Course at Grand Cypress, a St.
Andrews-type layout. O'Meara shot 63 and lost money to Woods, who
shot a 62. On Monday, enjoying unreal downwind conditions, Woods
sailed a drive on Birkdale's eighth hole, which extends 457 yards,
to within eight yards of the green. It was all relative, though.
O'Meara had just carried a 338-yard 1-iron at No. 8. More often,
though, the British crowds will cheer for crafty shotmaking, rather
than brute force _ American or Brit. ``People in the UK are very
knowledgeable,'' O'Meara said. ``Over here you don't always have to
hit it to two feet to get a response from the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo's aching elbow survived a practice round Tuesday, but
not without some pain. He purposely hit tee shots into the rough to
avoid sharp contact with the ground from divots. ``I shall be
trying to hit all the fairways when Thursday comes _ not miss
them,'' said the three-time champion. ... Bill Glasson's elbow,
still recovering from surgery, hasn't held up as well and forced
his withdrawal. England's Barry Lane replaced him in the field. ...
David Duval, on the fury that Royal Birkdale has brought with wind
and cold this week: ``I read something in the paper that people
lost a lot of golf balls yesterday. I was one of them. I lost five.
The biggest is in the crosswinds. You hit it, it gets blown across
the fairway, bounces in the really high rough and you've lost your
golf ball.''

TEXANS ACCUSED OF THREATENING PRESIDENT WITH BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
FACE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Three self-proclaimed members of the Republic of
Texas separatist group are scheduled to appear in federal court
Wednesday for allegedly plotting to assassinate President Clinton
and other senior officials using cactus needles dipped in
biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys are expected to use the preliminary hearing to
try force the FBI to provide more evidence about why the men should
be charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Wise, 72, of Olmito; Jack Abbott Grebe Jr., 43, of Los
Fresnos; and Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, of Harlingen, have been held
without bail at the Cameron County Jail since they were arrested
July 1 on charges of conspiring to use of weapons of mass
destruction and using weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that a ``Declaration of War'' was relayed by
e-mail in June in which the men threatened to attack Clinton, the
FBI director, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S.
Attorney General and their families, according to documents
unsealed Monday in federal court at Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your FBI employees and their families have been targeted for
destruction by revenge,'' reads a sample message that FBI officials
allege was meant for the agency's director, Louis J. Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-traceable, personal delivery systems have been developed
to inject bacteria and/or viruses for the purpose of killing,
maiming, and causing great suffering,'' the message said, according
to the documents that were part of an affidavit for search
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were to be carried out using cactus thorns dipped in
substances such as anthrax, rabies and HIV-tainted blood, according
to the documents, then shot at a target.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys declined to comment on the charges. U.S.
Magistrate John Black issued a gag order earlier this month that
forbids lawyers from discussing the case with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service declined to give statistics on how often
Clinton is threatened, but it said all threats against the
president are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet provides ``recipes'' for biological weapons
enabling a person without specialized training to make one from
botulism or anthrax, FBI Agent Frank Sharkey states in the federal
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents, including hazardous materials specialists, made
arrests and searched the men's homes after an unnamed government
witness tipped authorities to the alleged plot, according to the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if investigators found anything to back up their
case, but they seized several books on chemistry and electronics, a
syringe and a jar of an unknown substance.
</P>
<P>
   The government witness contends the defendants introduced
themselves as members of the Republic of Texas and attempted to
recruit the witness into the organization to join the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   Emigh allegedly wrote several versions of the Declaration of War
in May, and the government witness was asked to help find ways to
sent it without it being traced, according to the recently unsealed
documents.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12 and 26, Wise and Grebe supposedly met at the
government witness' house to send the threats using e-mail,
according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Wise and Grebe allegedly told the witness that the first target
would be Migadalia Lopez, a Cameron County Court-at-Law judge.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed tailing Lopez to find out where she shopped and
where she ate breakfast to ``more easily target her for
assassination,'' the document states.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez' staff declined to comment, but Eloy Cano, a chief deputy
at the Cameron County Sheriff's Department, said steps had been
taken to ensure her safety.

WESTWOOD MIGHT BREAK THROUGH AT BRITISH OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's young, polite, talented and witty. He relishes pressure
situations and still seeks the counsel of the mentor who has honed
his swing since his days as a junior golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he finds himself riding a hot streak as he heads
to this week's British Open in quest of the first major
championship of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, those words could have been used to describe a
25-year-old named Justin Leonard. The Dallas resident went on to
hoist the claret jug at Royal Troon Golf Club in Troon, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the same description fits comfortably around
the shoulders of another 25-year-old. But with Lee Westwood, there
is the added pressure of trying to make history in his own back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood, a vital contributor in Europe's 1997 Ryder Cup
triumph, grew up in Worksop, England, a 90-minute drive from Royal
Birkdale Golf Club. The 124th winner of golf's oldest major
championship will be crowned Sunday at Royal Birkdale. And it is
Westwood, not Nick Faldo or Colin Montgomerie, who is viewed as the
Brit most likely to keep the coveted claret jug in the land of its
origin for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Most 25-year-olds would wilt under the weight of such lofty
expectations. Westwood welcomes the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He talks openly of winning this week and downplays any concern
about being the latest hero-in-waiting for a sports fandom reeling
from gut-wrenching near misses in the World Cup (England's
controversial loss to Argentina) and the Wimbledon men's semifinals
(Pete Sampras over England's Tim Henman).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind. If anything, it gives me a confidence boost,''
Westwood said of being considered atop the current list of Europe's
elite players. ``I'd rather be in that group than not in that
group. It's nice when people start talking about you like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his chances at Royal Birkdale, Westwood did not mince
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any point coming into a tournament
unless you think you can win it,'' he said. ``And I think the way I
am playing, if I play well this week, then I can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. Since November, Westwood has won seven
tournaments on four continents, including last week's Loch Lomond
event in Glasgow, Scotland. He's coming off his career-best effort
at a major championship, a tie for seventh at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leonard, he radiates a quiet confidence and a taste for
pressure situations that is rare at any age. Like Leonard, he
should be considered a prime candidate for a major breakthrough at
25.
</P>
<P>
   In characterizing his prized pupil, Randy Smith once described
Leonard as the type of athlete who would insist on taking the
buzzer-beating shot at the end of a basketball game with the
outcome on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wilt under that kind of spotlight. He
absolutely craves it,'' Smith said. ``The more intense the
spotlight, the better he likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   John King, the man who has tutored Westwood throughout his
career, understands the sentiment. Hanging proudly in his office at
Worksop Golf Club, where King is the head golf professional, is a
photo of King lecturing a group of junior golfers. All are sitting
at rapt attention except Westwood, whose gaze is fixed on the
camera, with a wry smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   King said Westwood ``has always loved the limelight ... and
never seems affected by pressure'' while on the golf course. Those
traits were first displayed to U.S. audiences during the 1997 Ryder
Cup, when Westwood teamed with Faldo to defeat Tiger Woods and Mark
O'Meara, 3 and 1, in a pivotal four-ball match.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood, who finished 3-3 in Ryder Cup matches, also claimed
his first PGA Tour title at the Freeport-McDermott Classic on April
5. The victory in New Orleans came in just his seventh start on the
PGA Tour. In 10 career appearances at PGA Tour events, Westwood has
four top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to the 1997 British Open, Westwood has finished
10th, 29th, 44th and seventh in his last four major championships.
In Westwood's estimation, his Ryder Cup success has lifted his
level of play in every subsequent tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing every hole in the Ryder Cup is like playing the last
hole in a tournament needing a par to win,'' Westwood said. ``Any
time I am in contention now, I can go back on that experience of
playing in the Ryder Cup. I've got confidence now that I never had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough confidence that Leonard, now 26, recognizes Westwood as a
legitimate threat to achieve the same type of career breakthrough
at Birkdale that he enjoyed last year at Troon. Age, in Leonard's
estimation, is an insignificant factor when judging potential
winners of major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at anybody as a young guy or an old guy. Golf
isn't really a sport where age makes a huge difference,'' Leonard
said. ``Sure, the difference between a 15-year-old and a
30-year-old is big. But once you are a professional, ... I think it
depends on the individual. Age is not as big a factor as some
people make it out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a 26-year-old preparing to defend his first major
championship. With a talented, 25-year-old closing fast in his
rearview mirror.
CHIP SHOTS
Pak-ing them in
</P>
<P>
   How big a star is LPGA rookie Se Ri Pak, who is coming off a
record-setting victory at the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic?
</P>
<P>
   Big enough that Pak, 20, has had to give up eating at her
favorite restaurant to avoid autograph seekers. A native of South
Korea who won 30 amateur events and six professional tournaments in
her homeland before joining the LPGA tour this season, Pak has
established Orlando, Fla., as her U.S. residence.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Pak's favorite Korean restaurant in the city also is
frequented by tour buses filled with Korean visitors to Walt Disney
World. K.R. Kim, Pak's manager, said his client has been besieged
for hours at a time while dining. And this was ``before'' Pak won
her second major championship of the season (the U.S. Women's Open)
and moved atop the LPGA season earnings list with her triumph at
the Kroger Classic ($645,170).
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see her, she won't have any food and the bus doesn't
leave,'' Kim said. ``She's happy with \Rfast food\S now.''
Tiger-like triumph
</P>
<P>
   Pak's 11-stroke victory Sunday has been likened to Tiger Woods'
12-stroke romp at the 1997 Masters, a valid comparison in that both
were eye-popping, record-setting achievements by tour rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are subtle, significant differences in the two
achievements and in the rookie seasons of the two golfers. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   Woods lapped the field in a major championship, where a wide
disparity between front-runners' scores is rare. Pak got hot in a
regular tour event, where scoring conditions are more favorable and
routs are more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Pak's effort included the lowest single-round (61) and 72-hole
totals (261) in the history of the LPGA tour. Woods did not eclipse
either mark for PGA Tour competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Pak achieved her distinction as a 20-year-old rookie in a season
that has seen her win two (LPGA Championship, Women's Open) of
three major championships contested thus far. Woods won the 1997
Masters as a 21-year-old rookie but did not win another major that
season.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished his rookie season with four victories, a second,
a third and three other top-10 efforts to set a PGA Tour season
earnings record ($2,066,833). In weeks when Pak has not won this
season, she has not cracked the top 10, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Comparisons between the two feats and players are
interesting but pointless. It's like the age-old comparison of
apples and oranges. There is not enough commonality to declare one
superior to another.
</P>
<P>
   But it is safe to say that these two triumphs stand as the most
dominant, 72-hole golfing displays of this decade. And, if they are
ever to be duplicated or eclipsed, Woods and Pak head the list of
players likely to do it.
SHORT PUTTS
</P>
<P>
   Of the five major championships awarded in 1998, four have gone
to residents of Orlando, Fla. The lone exception is Pat Hurst, who
hails from Incline Village, Nev., and won the LPGA's Nabisco Dinah
Shore event. Se Ri Pak took the other two LPGA titles, and the PGA
Tour winners have been Mark O'Meara (Masters) and Lee Janzen (U.S.
Open). That could bode well at this week's British Open for the
likes of fellow Orlando residents Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Payne
Stewart, Scott Hoch, Corey Pavin and Ted Tryba. ... Hoch, by the
way, will be playing in only the third British Open of his 20-year
career. Why the sudden change of heart by a player who has never
finished better than 68th at the event? His equipment supplier,
Yonex, tempted Hoch with incentive clauses based on his performance
in the event. ... In his lone PGA Tour outing since switching back
to traditional blade irons, Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks shot
four rounds in the 60s while finishing 12th at the Canon Greater
Hartford Open. It marked the first time this season that Brooks
broke 70 in more than two consecutive rounds. Brooks will attempt
to extend the streak at the British Open, where he has finished
fifth (1996), third (1995) and 20th (1994) in three of his past
four appearances. ... Jim Furyk has 21 top-10 finishes in the past
18 months, tops among PGA Tour participants in that span.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ A day after Orangemen in their
bowler hats staged their jaunty annual parades throughout Northern
Ireland, a procession with an anguished pace followed three small
coffins up a hillside road Tuesday to a country churchyard here.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the white coffins, with polished brass nameplates on top,
were the bodies of Richard Quinn, 11, and his brothers Mark, 10,
and Jason, 9. They were burned to death in their beds in the early
hours of Sunday morning by a firebomb thrown in the ground-floor
window of their two-story row house in nearby Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few Catholics in a predominantly Protestant housing
project, the boys were the latest victims of this province's
sectarian violence, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,200
people. Two men have been arrested, and one of them is suspected of
links to a fringe Protestant paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news of the deaths of these three boys has touched the
hearts of people across the continents,'' the Rev. Peter Forde told
the mourners, who thronged every aisle and standing area of the
Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick. A loudspeaker brought the
Requiem Mass to people outside who could not fit in. The church,
itself a target of arsonists in past years, has stained-glass rose
windows that are fortified with metal grills.
</P>
<P>
   The sorrowful silence was broken only by sobs from friends and
family members who stared at the boys' coffins in pain and
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn, 29, the boys' mother, sat expressionless in the
first pew, comforted by her remaining son, Lee, 12. He survived
because he was staying that night at the house of his grandmother,
Irene Quinn, in Rasharkin.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were carried into the nave as the steeple bell
tolled dirgeful single notes. People throughout the church pressed
handkerchiefs to their faces, and children clutched their parents.
The coffin bearers, teen-agers and young men, shook with grief, and
substitutes rushed to shoulder their burden.
</P>
<P>
   The most distraught of them, a man with tattoos and facial
jewelry named John Dillon, 28, was said to be the estranged father
of one or more of the boys, all of whom had taken their mother's
name. He was left to mourn alone, at times taking up the front line
of pallbearers and tearfully patting the coffins. All references to
remembrances for special prayers during the services talked of
``Chrissie, Lee and the extended family.''
</P>
<P>
   The scripture readings spoke of resurrection. An achingly sweet
poem composed by two teen-agers from the housing project where the
dead boys lived asked: ``Why would someone do this? is the question
on our lips. Who would have so much evil at their fingertips?''
</P>
<P>
   Forde invited Presbyterian and Methodist ministers to help him
lead the service. ``One could even say that we are all united by
this horrible event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Patrick Walsh, of the diocese of Down and Connor, said he
had spent the past week visiting parishes ``where people have been
living under a constant cloud of fear, anxiety and tension _ so
many intimidated, so many homes attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to disputes over Protestant marches, disputes
that have provoked arson attacks on Catholic churches and homes,
and letters with bullets and threatening notes sent to Catholics
living in Protestant areas. The mob violence culminated in the
killings of the boys on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airwaves, the printed page, have been saturated with
noises _ strident, harsh, discordant noises _ carrying words of
hatred, of incitement or recrimination, words not found in the
vocabulary of Christianity,'' Walsh said. Leaving no doubt that he
saw linkage between defiant protests and violent acts, he said,
``The weapons of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of
murderous destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the Protestant Orange Order and government
security forces at Drumcree, outside Portadown, is in its 10th day.
The number of protesters and rioters has been greatly reduced, but
the Orange leaders say they are determined to carry on despite
calls from Protestant clerics and politicians to withdraw out of
respect for the boys.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At issue is the right of the Portadown Orange Lodge members to
return from Drumcree parish to their downtown headquarters along a
road that goes through a neighborhood of Catholic housing projects.
The government's Parades Commission ordered them to return by
another route but they refused. The Orangemen have been camped at
the site since July 5, when they encountered the barricades and
troops placed in their way.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night the Rev. Ian Paisley, hard-line leader of the
Protestant cause, turned aside suggestions from Ronnie Flanagan,
commissioner of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, from David Trimble,
the new first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and from
others that the protest contributed to mob violence that had ended
in the killing of the Quinn boys.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at Drumcree lighted by bonfires, Paisley urged the
demonstrators to maintain their stand and said politicians seeking
an end to the protest were ``dancing on these young fellows'
graves.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Irish Republican Army had committed ``much
worse crimes'' against Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Orange Order's own religious leaders stepped up the
pressure on the protesters to end their standoff at Drumcree, which
has been a flash point of violence for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Backing the calls to leave the scene, the clerics said, ``We
place on record our utter revulsion at the murder of the three
little boys in Ballymoney and extend our sincere sympathy to the
parents and to all the bereaved family.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, from the Representative Group of Orange Order
Chaplains, continued: ``We also express to the Roman Catholic
community in Northern Ireland our deep sorrow that so many of them
have been intimidated out of their homes and that several of their
churches have been burned. Our bitter shame at all this, allegedly
carried out in the name of Protestantism, is not in any way
lessened by the fact that many of our own people are the victims of
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's service at the Church of Our Lady ended with a moving
antiphon. From the altar Forde said, ``Now in peace let us take our
little boys to their final rest in Rasharkin,'' and as the coffins
filed back down the center aisle, a soprano in the choir loft sang,
``Suffer Little Children to Come Unto Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were lifted into a single hearse and taken seven
miles to a street corner 100 yards down the hill from the cemetery,
and the pallbearers took up their doleful duty for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   With a final prayer, the white coffins were lowered into a
single large fresh grave, and hundreds of bouquets were placed on
top. Three floral tributes spelled out the boys' nicknames, Tavish,
Marky and Ace.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Miss Quinn had asked that the boys be buried
here so that she would never have to return to Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Carnany Estate, where the Quinns lived in
Ballymoney, Samuel Montgomery, 8, pedaled his bicycle up to a
visitor at the soot-blackened facade of the grey stucco home where
the boys died. They had been his friends, he said, and the bike
still leaning against the fence belonged to ``the wee one.''
</P>
<P>
   He peered through the boarded-up window and asked if they were
still inside. Told no, he paused. Then he brightened. ``They're
going to heaven today, right?''

MANY INVITATIONS TO PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All of a sudden, everyone in late-night television
is getting invited to appear in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost everyone. Late night's most popular star, Jay Leno,
is not included in this year's push to prime time. Conan O'Brien,
however, will get his first prime-time special for his show's fifth
anniversary on the air in September. And CBS will broadcast a
five-year anniversary show with David Letterman in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even ABC's ``Nightline'' is going prime time, with a special
series of reports that will be a reprise of that program's highly
praised investigations of life in American prisons.
</P>
<P>
   NBC announced Tuesday that O'Brien would star in his first
prime-time special Sept. 15 at 10 p.m. ``Late Night'' executive
producer Jeff Ross said the show would be mainly a collection of
the best moments in the O'Brien show's five years on the air, along
with some new material, with a sprinkling of guests.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision to ask O'Brien to take his act to prime time is
confirmation of the network's commitment to him as one of its
franchise stars.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment was a long time coming; for the first several
years O'Brien worked on short-term contracts with NBC. Ross said
that ``just being asked to do this by NBC was huge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien arrived at NBC in 1993 as a totally untried performer;
he had been a comedy writer, never a comedian. His skills were
widely criticized as rough, but he slowly gained acceptance, and
more lately praise, for his fresh approach to comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as has been the custom whenever a late-night star is
asked to step into prime time, O'Brien had some trepidation about
the request. ``I guess our feeling is, it's better for us than it
might be for the network,'' Ross said. ``Prime time has a different
scale; you have to be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the opportunity and what it meant for the show's
relationship with the network, Ross said O'Brien had concluded that
whatever risk was involved was worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his days at NBC in the 1980s, Letterman had similar
reservations about doing specials in prime time, fearing that his
style was tailored for late-night audiences and might generate
disappointing ratings in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   But his NBC specials, and three he has done for CBS since then,
have all been critically praised and successful in the ratings. Rob
Burnett, Letterman's executive producer, said the comedian would
star in a 90-minute prime-time special in the November sweep rating
period to mark his fifth year on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, NBC announced that Leno would star in a prime-time
special on his fifth anniversary as host of the ``Tonight'' show,
but Leno soon killed the idea, saying he preferred to keep the show
in its regular time period.
</P>
<P>
   The shift of ``Nightline'' into prime time for the first time is
not related to any special anniversary, but has more to do with the
need for more news programming in prime time during the summer
months.
</P>
<P>
   ABC announced this week that ``Nightline'' would broadcast
special updated repeat editions of programs about crime in America
for five weeks on Thursday nights starting Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News spokesman Eileen Murphy said ``Nightline'' had been
looking for an outlet to rebroadcast some of its programs that are
not tied to daily breaking news events. ``For a while they were
considering going to one of our cable channels like A&AMP;E or the
History Channel,'' Ms. Murphy said. But then ABC itself stepped in
with the decision to find a prime-time home for the ``Nightline''
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under the title ``Nightline in Prime Time: Crime in America,''
these are programs that focus on the prison system and will include
a series of shows in which the anchor, Ted Koppel, spent time on
Death Row, in solitary confinement and in other parts of jails.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel will add new introductions to each of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is clearly including the ``Nightline'' shows as part of a
strategy to use as much news programming as possible in the summer.
News magazines are in general becoming more and more a staple of
summer programming at the broadcast networks as the repeats of
entertainment shows _ especially hourlong drama shows _ attract
lower and lower ratings in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   On each of the five Thursdays when ``Nightline'' will fill the
10 p.m. time slot, ABC will fill the 9 p.m. hour with another
repackaged news program, a compilation of reports from its news
magazine shows on related topics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Aug. 6, the 9 p.m. show will include reports on
``The Art of the Con,'' revealing how telemarketing swindles target
consumers. The next two weeks, the shows will be reports on
consumer issues: how to be a better buyer and how to avoid being
taken. Another show, on the theme of ``Man and Nature,'' will
include previous reports on how to survive house fires, tornadoes
and other crises.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of repackaging news magazine reports into a themed hour
has worked particularly well this summer for CBS's ``48 Hours,''
which has taken some previous programs, labeled them ``48 Hours
Mysteries'' and put them on Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The shows have done well there, even on occasion attracting
higher ratings than original programs by the incumbent news
magazine in that time period, NBC's ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's edition of ``48 Hours Mysteries'' was the highest
rated so far this summer and again beat NBC's ``Dateline.''

LAWMAKERS PROPOSE $700 MILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS   AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Declaring that Democrats are not ``phobic'' over
cutting taxes, legislative leaders Tuesday proposed a nearly $700
million tax reduction package that won a strong endorsement from
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, but was ridiculed by fiscal
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's treasury overflowing, House Speaker Thomas
Finneran and Senate President Thomas Birmingham unveiled a plan
they said is ``progressive'' in its treatment of working families
and ``historic'' because of its size.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Democrats also said the plan provides for using some
of the state's huge revenue windfalls to build up the state's
stabilization _ or rainy-day _ fund and to invest in capital
projects, such as the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good day for the taxpayers of Massachusetts,''
Birmingham told a State House press conference. The plan would,
among other things, cut investment income tax from 12 percent to
5.95 pecent and double personal exemptions on earned income.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who has been seeking a $1.2 billion tax cut, said the
Democratic package is ``basically what I have been fighting for
over the past year.'' But he said he would continue to press for
his larger tax cut plan to reduce the state income tax from 5.95
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Finneran and Birmingham said it was possible for such a cut
in the income tax, although neither would be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the last word on taxes,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci Tuesday faced demands from fiscal conservatives asking
him to veto the Democratic tax plan, in part because it contains
Finneran's bid to increase the size of the rainy-day fund. The more
money that is squirreled away for future economic downturns, the
less money returned to taxpayers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outrageous,'' said Barbara Anderson, executive director
of Citizens for Limited Taxation &AMP; Government, adding that
Finneran's provision is, in effect, a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, Cellucci can not selectively veto that provision when
the tax plan, but must accept or reject the whole plan even though
he objects to the rainy day fund increase.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson called on Cellucci to reject the entire $700 million
tax plan because of the stabilization fund change. She said he
should demand the Legislature enact his income tax cut plan. ``We
should hold out for what they should be doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's almost certain Cellucci will not heed Anderson's plea.
Aides said Cellucci did not like Finneran's rainy day fund idea,
but would accept it to get a major tax cut _ a cornerstone to his
bid for a full four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also received support from a fiscal watchdog group.
``Veto the largest tax cut in the history of the Commonwealth?''
said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers'
Foundation, funded by major Massachusetts corporations. ``That
makes aboslutely no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also rejected a demand from Republican gubernatorial
foe, State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, to veto the plan because it
did not cut the income tax to 5 percent, the rate before it was
raised to pay for the fiscal crises of the late 1980's. ``I am not
going to put a much needed tax cut for families ... at risk,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Cellucci had ``rolled over'' for the Democratic
leadership. ``Instead of drawing the line in the sand, he raised
the white flag of surrender very early on in this process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Cellucci, by vetoing their plan, would raise public
pressure on the lawmakers to enact a bigger tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we fight for something we take the case to the public, we
do everything we possibly can do to make sure the people in this
building feel the heat,'' Malone said, describing what he said is
his style of battling the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic tax cut package _ phased in over two years _
would double the exemption for earned income, saving between $131
for a single filer to $262 for joint filers; and cut in half the 12
percent tax rate on interest and dividend income.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would increase the size of the rainy-day fund from 5
percent of current revenues to 7.5 percent, allowing reserves to
grow from $950 million to a maximum of $1.42 billion. The value of
that line item: $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the proposal would cut unemployment insurance rates by
$116 million. Of that, $18 million would be dedicated to a
workforce development program.
</P>
<P>
   And the state tax code also will be brought in line with the
federal tax code in several areas, including educational and Roth
Individual Retirement Accounts and capital gains on the principle
sale of a residence.

 TWAIN NOW A GIANT ON THE SCREEN, TOO  (Eds: Spelling of `sivilized'
in 1st graf is CQ.) 
(nk) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here now in the high noon of fence-whitewashing
season, when sivilized people like Becky Thatcher and Aunt Polly
might seek refuge in the shade of a porch, comes the latest Imax
adventure. It's a colorful, noisy, globe-trotting,
three-dimensional celebration of _ Mark Twain?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who adopted the pen name Mark
Twain, will take his place on the eight-story-tall screen,
superseding the flicker of previous Imax extravaganzas that have
portrayed the quest for the summit of Everest, the hunt for the
Titanic and the pedal-stomping proclivities of professional race
car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere of the film, ``Mark Twain's America in 3D,'' on
Friday in Manhattan is a testament to the continuing mass appeal of
the cynosure of Hannibal, Mo. Improbably, 88 years after his death
and 122 years after the publication of ``The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer,'' America is sustaining a Twain boom that betrays no sign
of abating.
</P>
<P>
   ``His popularity is growing,'' said Shelley Fisher Fishkin,
professor of American studies and English at the University of
Texas at Austin, the editor of the 29-volume ``The Oxford Mark
Twain'' (1996). ``Twain scholarship is increasing, articles are
coming out by the dozens, there are new films in the works, and
Twain is the subject of exchanges on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the Twain phenomenon _ fueled by the author's
wicked wit, enduring seductiveness and flat-out subversiveness _
keeps captivating audiences in each new generation. Twain himself
put it this way: ``My books are water; those of the great geniuses
are wine. Everybody drinks water.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Justin Kaplan, a Twain biographer: ``It is too
easy to sentimentalize him as the foxy grandpa of American letters,
the author of wholesome books for the young. Twain was a man with
an extremely dark imagination and a low threshold of annoyance.''
Kaplan won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his
study, ``Clemens and Mark Twain.''
</P>
<P>
   To some scholars, the 20th century bears the mark of Twain. They
see the current nostalgic hoopla over this Victorian as an emblem
of the intense millennial preoccupation with the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   But though that era has been idealized as the golden age of
invention, exploration, colonization and the mass industry that
fueled a pivotally unifying civil war, Twain grappled with many of
the messy issues that still torment the fin de siecle American
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the millennium approaches,'' Fishkin said, ``scholars are
looking back a century ago and seeing Twain as a truth-teller.
There is virtually no issue on the horizon right now that Twain
didn't deal with then, in his work.'' The roster includes animal
rights, the impact of technology, the tension between heredity and
environment, the boundaries of gender and America's interracial
debate.
</P>
<P>
   A century and a half after the famously riverine Twain worked as
a printer's apprentice in Hannibal, he has Java-star status on the
Internet. For example, the Mark Twain Forum (reachable through many
search engines) provides information of interest to Twainians, as
Clemens buffs call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It offers links to dozens of Twain sites including the Mining
Company Guide (http://marktwain.miningco.com/), which posts the
latest Twain flashes, like the movement in Manila to celebrate
Philippine-American Friendship Day by building a Mark Twain
monument, or the popularity of juvenile horse-riding in a Japanese
amusement park called the Tom Sawyer Bokuju.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Internet bulletins about the latest attempts to
banish ``Huckleberry Finn'' from bookstores and library shelves,
including the recent move by the Pennsylvania State Conference of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to
remove the novel from required-reading lists in the state's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Often Showing Up As Himself in Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Public television station WGBH in Boston is preparing a
documentary on ``Huckleberry Finn,'' and Ken Burns _ of baseball,
Lewis and Clark and Civil War fame _ is working on a two-part Twain
documentary to appear on PBS in 2001; even a Hollywood producer is
approaching Twain scholars for advice on an animated Twain movie.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful is the Twain presence that contemporary writers have
made him a character in their fiction. They include Gore Vidal, in
his novel ``1876''; Joyce Carol Oates in her novel ``A Bloodsmoor
Romance''; the ``Riverworld'' series by the science fiction author
Philip Jose Farmer; and the Mark Twain mysteries of Peter J. Heck,
author of ``Death on the Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And not only was Twain a character in ``Bonanza'' and
``Cheers,'' but also a time-travel episode was built around Twain
on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twain has more marquee value than ever,'' said Mark Katz, a
vice president of Sony Pictures Classics, which co-produced and is
distributing the Imax film. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Old Photographs, New Techniques
</P>
<P>
   The Imax documentary _ which is told in Twain's words and
reaches across two centuries, as did Twain's life _ will make its
debut Friday at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square; it will be playing on
10 large-format screens across the country by the end of the year.
The film interweaves the life and times of Twain, as depicted in
black-and-white archival photographs, with full-color portrayals of
the lives of current-day enthusiasts who revel in the 19th-century
Zeitgeist and seek to recreate it.
</P>
<P>
   Its producers see the $6 million Twain film, the first Imax
biography, as something of a breakthrough in the evolution of a new
entertainment medium. Imax _ which, like its predecessor Cinerama,
never saw a roller coaster it didn't want to film _ is still
dismissed by some as a novelty medium. ``But we think of the format
as an alternative cinematic art form that is undergoing a
maturation process,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Low, the 3-D film's 47-year-old director, says the
documentary allows theatergoers ``to look into the eyes of their
ancestors and wonder what they were like; these are not actors, and
this is not fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 1998 film is based on an extraordinary 19th-century
trove of three-dimensional stereopticon negatives from the
collection at the University of California-Riverside, California
Museum of Photography, many of which present Twain himself, in all
his fierce attention, as if he were poised to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been enhanced with archival two-dimensional
photographs of the era that have been digitally converted into
three-dimensional images. This is believed to be the first time
such images have been used on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The film appears even as Twain buffs are girding for a
summerlong binge of Clemensiana. For example, this weekend the city
of Hartford, Conn., will hold its annual Mark Twain Days festival,
with, naturally, cane-pole fishing events, and frog-jumping and
fence-painting contests sponsored by the Mark Twain House there.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the most high-profile Twain bash of the season was
mounted on Monday night at the Players, the New York City club that
Twain helped found in 1888 and where he lived in 1904. (His pool
cue is enshrined in the billiard room.) At a Victorian fund-raiser,
200 guests saw the Imax film, then consumed 19th-century food and
were serenaded by banjo, tuba and trombone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never pass up an opportunity to attend an event in my
honor,'' said Twain himself, greeting the guests in a splendid
white suit. When pressed, he allowed that he might be masquerading
as an actor by the name Munro Bonnell.
</P>
<P>
   The real Twain ``would unleash his barbs at the slightest
provocation'' at considerable risk to his reputation, said Kaplan,
the biographer. Twain had reason to be provoked, having lost much
of his money to poor investments, and most of his family to
illness. That included his daughter Jean, who died at 29, during an
epileptic fit on Christmas Eve. Twain died three months later, in
the year of the return of Halley's Comet, 1910: he had been born 75
years before, in 1835, during the year of the comet's previous
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   From the Riverboat To the Automobile
</P>
<P>
   The new documentary portrays Twain as a quintessentially
American presence whose life marked the milestones of the 19th
century. Twain's arc spanned the era of the riverboat on the
Mississippi to that of the motorcar on Fifth Avenue. He fought in
the Civil War (briefly, for the South), became wealthy and famous,
lost most of his fortune and lived until the era of powered flight.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Twain is still a world-class controversy-magnet, not
only for the way he refers to blacks in ``Huckleberry Finn,'' but
also for his portrayal of female characters.
</P>
<P>
   Some black academics, including Julius Lester, a professor at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, have adamantly
proclaimed Twain's racism, and feminists have charged that his
sexism was epitomized by shallow portrayals of women. The novelist
Jane Smiley has attributed Twain's grand reputation to the hype
generated by a small group of literary critics who canonized
``white, Protestant, middle-class male authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Other black scholars, like David Smith, a professor of English
at Williams College, have pointed out that Twain portrayed the
interracial friendship of Huck and Jim positively and indicted the
ethical myopia of white characters who claimed to be moral while
condoning a racist system of law and custom.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatest works have relatively limited roles for female
characters, but some of Twain's lesser-known works show a greater
range,'' contended Fishkin, whose most recent book, ``Lighting Out
for the Territory'' (1997), explores these controversies. ``Calling
him a sexist or a racist is selling him very short. He was
neither.''
</P>
<P>
   Views of Progress And Its Dark Side
</P>
<P>
   Though Twain once said that ``the 20th century is a stranger to
me,'' some see the author's sensibility as especially modern
because ``he was conflicted, divided, ironic and not at peace with
himself,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   A century before cyberphiles rushed to buy Windows 98, Twain was
clearly an early adopter, intrigued by the cutting-edge
technologies that produced cash registers, typewriters and
photography. He claimed to be the first author in the world to
apply a typing machine to literature and proclaimed himself the
first book author to use phonographic dictation (for ``The American
Claimant'').
</P>
<P>
   In that 1892 book, he posited a wild-eyed inventor who dreamed
up ideas that prefigured the fax machine, the photocopier and DNA
cloning. But Twain also wrote about the dark side of progress,
envisioning, for example, a technological dystopia in ``A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of Twain's accomplishments was that he was
``wildly funny,'' Kaplan said. ``This was a man who worshiped
laughter as a weapon. Twain was not afraid of  &UR; hurting &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``we need Twain now,'' Kaplan added with a laugh.
``Imagine the kind of satiric and logical intelligence he would
apply to the whole Kenneth Starr-Monica Lewinsky business. Twain
would be having a ball.''

REPORTS SITES CLEANLINESS OF MASSACHUSETTS BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're planning a trip to the beach in one of Massachusetts'
70 oceanfront communities someday soon, you can feel confident the
water will be safe _ or the beach will be shut down if it is not.
</P>
<P>
   A new nationwide report from the Natural Resources Defense
Council concludes local governments, and in particular the
Metropolitan District Commission, which runs Boston Harbor beaches,
are doing a fairly good job testing the water regularly for
pollution compared to other states.
</P>
<P>
   But at least seven communities were faulted for having no
regular testing. Nearly half test water only once or twice a month.
And many use what is considered to be an outdated 1950s standard
for sewage contamination at beaches, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Harbor could be the model water quality monitoring
program for the whole country, but we're not there yet in terms of
coastwide monitoring across the state,'' said Joan LeBlanc of the
Boston Harbor Association, which participated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens have a fundamental right to know about the water
quality of our public beaches,'' said Joan Malik of the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group. ``We must do more to
ensure that every parent on the beach today can be certain that the
coast is clear and the water is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   As the $4 billion harbor cleanup project has made city beaches
once again safe for swimming most days, the MDC has instituted a
program of posting pennants to tell swimmers whether the water is
safe (blue) or contaminated (red), usually because rainstorms have
overwhelmed sewers.
</P>
<P>
   While the report's call for regularly testing every mile of
every beach may sound like a worthy goal, in some places it might
be a waste of time and money, some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report faults four Martha's Vineyard
communities _ Chilmark, Edgartown, Gay Head and West Tisbury _ for
having no monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jo-Ann Taylor, coastal planner for the Martha's Vineyard
Commission, said there's a good explanation: ``There's no reason
for it, especially in those towns. There's nothing that would cause
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any industry. We don't have any sewage plants
that are discharging to the ocean,'' Taylor said. ``On the
south-facing side of the island, there's nothing between the beach
and Portugal.''
</P>
<P>
   The three other communities faulted for not having regular
monitoring programs were Newburyport and Rowley, which own parts of
Plum Island, and Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   Newburyport harbormaster Ralph Steele said, ``This is the first
I've heard of any concern on anybody's part.'' He noted that the
city sewer department regularly tests discharges into the Merrimack
River, and last month asked him to shut down the beach after
torrential rains overwhelmed the sewage plant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Massachusetts public beaches _ chiefly in East Boston,
Dorchester and Quincy _ were closed at least 140 days because of
elevated bacteria levels from sewage overflows.
</P>
<P>
   That compared to 152 in 1996, 132 in 1995, and about 60 in each
of the four preceding years. Shifting weather patterns and spotty
reporting compliance make it difficult to declare any trend of
increasing or decreasing beach closures.

   WASHINGTON _ Less than a decade after being touted as an
economic superpower whose manufacturing prowess and virtuous saving
habits had destined it to lead the global marketplace into the 21st
Century, Japan has become the whipping boy of the world economy,
roundly and routinely scolded by central bankers from Washington to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Japanese voters piled on, drubbing the long-ruling
Liberal Democratic Party in a parliamentary defeat that forced the
resignation of Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's sixth prime minister in
five years, in a harsh political reckoning for the sins of low
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's economy is, indeed, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   It's generated little new wealth or jobs in seven out of the
past eight years, has actually been contracting since late last
year and will do well, analysts predict, to expand by a
half-percentage point in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't foresee any prospect of growth in any meaningful way
for at least the next 18 months,'' said Bradley Belt, director of
international finance and economic policy for the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
''There are obviously some very significant structural problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, dire as Japan's short-term outlook appears, the
nation's economy, the world's second-largest, retains some bedrock
strengths that many analysts claim will pull the country out of its
torpor and power it back toward prosperity. Within two or three
years, some analysts believe, the 90s could be looked upon as the
period when Japan struggled to reshape its economy into a machine
capable of roaring back as an even stronger global competitor than
it was during the heady 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a hell of a lot of unrecognized value,'' in Japan at
the moment, said William Farrell, president of Dynamic Strategies
Asia, a consulting firm based in Leesburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese did not just go brain dead,'' said Farrell, who
has worked closely with Japan for two decades. ''They're going to
come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   That's far from the consensus view.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, U.S. officials from Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin on down have publicly excoriated the Japanese for failing to
reform their economy, stimulate domestic consumption and confront a
tsunami of bad debt that has swamped the country's banking system
and left it adrift in the horse latitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Peeved that Japan's ills have contributed to the broader
economic crisis in Asia and fearful that continuing troubles in
Tokyo could deepen the region's woes, even officials in Beijing --
who oversee the world's largest remaining communist nation -- have
taken aim at Japanese capitalism in recent weeks, warning darkly
that a devaluation in China's currency could result unless
''stability'' returns to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for the concern.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banking system is riddled with bad loans -- valued at
some $600 billion -- not likely to be repaid, the sour legacy of
Japan's go-go 80's, when banks were flush with cash and eager to
lend it to anyone who could show projected sales increases or a
balance sheet pumped up with real estate or stocks. Sales
projections, like assets, turned out to be vastly overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks, moreover, are heavily exposed to regional
economies such as Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, that are
suffering daunting economic downturns, meaning billions more in
international bad debt has yet to be swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Japan, for it's part, has piled up $2.8
trillion worth of debt, equal to 75 percent of gross domestic
product, or GDP (the measure annual economic output) of $3.7
trillion for the year ended March. That's higher, as a proportion
of the size of the economy, than even the U.S. debt, which, at $5.4
trillion, is roughly 67 percent of last year's GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for Japan's public and bank debt are probably
conservative. Many analysts say that Japanese accounting procedures
are too opaque to fully assess.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of hidden numbers there that you just can't get
to the bottom of,'' said James Carlson, vice president for public
policy research with the New York investment firm, Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its difficulties and uncertainties, however, Japan
retains formidable economic resources.
</P>
<P>
   Japan remains globally competitive, if not dominant, in a host
of important manufacturing industries, including automobiles,
consumer electronics, telecommunications, computers, industrial
machinery and semiconductor production equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It has the richest coffers of foreign reserves -- $220 billion
at last count -- of any country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It owns $800 billion more worth of overseas property, stocks and
bonds than foreigners own in Japan and it remains the world's
largest creditor nation, earning some $58 billion last year in
interest payments and dividends from its overseas investments and
loans.
</P>
<P>
   There is the vaunted Japanese workforce, among the
best-educated, highly motivated anywhere, performing in a closely
knitted country where social ills like violent crime and illicit
drug use are at levels among the world's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fall of the Japanese yen, which has lost 20 percent of
its value against the U.S. dollar over the past year, helps Japan's
aggressive exporters, by making Japanese goods cheaper, in dollar
terms, and thus more attractive, in theory at least, to American
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a basket case here at all,'' said Arthur
Alexander, president of the Japan Economic Institute of America, a
Washington-based information arm of the Foreign Ministry of Japan.
''It's individually wealthy; it's nationally wealthy; it has
skills, capabilities; there are a lot of strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that difficult reform measures lie ahead for
Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ridding the banks of bad loans -- much like the U.S.'s own
half-trillion dollar savings and loan crisis -- will be among the
most painful. The Japanese government hopes to begin a process for
doing that in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And, analysts agree, the deeply indebted government needs to
mortgage its future even further to fund permanent tax cuts --
Hashimoto promised reductions before Sunday's elections and it's
not likely his successor, once picked sometime later this month,
would dare to renege -- at the same time it's committed to pumping
billions of additional dollars into public works aimed at
jump-starting the listless economy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, much of the world may be suffering from a distorted
view of Japan's problems, said Hiro Ito, research associate with
the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a perception that the whole economy's in trouble,''
said Ito, who is Japanese. In fact, he said, ''there's a huge gap
between the strong, competitive industries and the weak, regulated
industries. And the later is dragging down the former.''
</P>
<P>
   Ito, author of a recently published book, entitled ''A Cure for
Japan's Sick Banks,'' sees healing those institutions as the key to
setting the broader economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little optimistic,'' Ito said. ''Japan might take about
two to two-and-a-half years to solve its bank loan problems. Once
Japan deals with that, the economy might start recovering.''

TREASURIES FALL AGAIN, HURT BY BY CURRENCY DEVELOPMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities fell for a second straight day
Tuesday, hurt by the dollar's decline against the yen in
foreign-exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Despite favorable economic news on consumer prices and retail
sales, the dollar's diminished value contributed to a bond sell-off
that pushed the 30-year Treasury yield to the highest level in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the market remained focused on developments in
Japan, where the resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on
Monday has contributed to some optimism that his yet-to-be-named
successor will take dramatic steps to stimulate the economy. The
dollar fell to 140.02 yen from 141.42 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's worst recession since World War II has been an
underlying force pushing Treasuries and the dollar's value higher
in recent weeks because United States assets are seen as safe-haven
investments from Asia's economic travails. If Japan starts to
strengthen, that could erode foreign investor demand for Treasuries
and the dollars needed to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The run-up in prices in the bond market over the past weeks
has come as a result of a flight to quality,'' said Robert
Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at
J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla. ``So when that
begins to unwind you would expect the opposite to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By close of the New York market the 30-year Treasury bond was
off 13/32 to a price of 105 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, was up to 5.71 percent from 5.69 percent
Monday. It was the highest since 5.73 percent June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline, traders said, the underlying outlook for
bonds remains strong because there are few signs of rising
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   Economic reports released Tuesday reinforced that view. The June
consumer price index and retail sales data both rose by a
less-than-expected one-tenth of 1 percent.

CHILD LEAD POISONING, INFANT MORTALITY DROP DRAMATICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has made dramatic progress toward ending the public
health scourge of lead poisoning in children, federal officials
said Tuesday, with just 6 percent of young children now showing
unsafe levels of lead in their blood compared to 88 percent two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Infant mortality rates have also hit an all-time low, teenagers
are having fewer babies, and more black high school students are
graduating than in the past, according to the government's annual
state-of-our kids report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news was good, however: Smoking is up among young
people. So is use of illegal drugs and alcohol. And 800,000 fewer
children had health insurance in 1996 than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more positives than negatives in our report, but
there are some clear warning signs like smoking and drugs,'' said
Dr. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, one of the agencies that prepared the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with others indicators, like high school completition and
parents reading to their kids, things are getting better but
they're not as good as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, the second of its kind, was modeled on the
commonly-quoted Index of Leading Economic Indicators and was
designed to paint a broad portrait of the well-being of America's
70 million children. To do that, it included the latest data on 29
different measures of health, education, economic security and
social environment.
</P>
<P>
   The data tell a series of dramatic stories of public health
successes and failures, but none is more surprising than the one
about lead poisoning. From 1976 to 1980, an estimated 88 percent of
children aged 1 to 5 had blood lead levels of at least 10
micrograms per deciliter _ a level that specialists say, based on
their evolving understanding of just how dangerous lead can be, is
enough to cause lowered intelligence and behavioral problems. By
the period 1988 to 1994, however, just 6 percent had elevated
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an incredible story ... it's a dramatic public health
gain,'' said Alexander. ``It's a result of legislation that got
lead out of paint, out of solder for plumbing and, most important,
out of gasoline.'
</P>
<P>
   It's also a story that only became apparent a year or two ago,
when data from the 1988-1994 national survey was released,
Alexander said, and it ``has not been widely discussed outside of
public health circles'' and was not included in last year's
state-of-our-children report. What about the trend since 1994? The
percent of children with elevated blood levels, Alexander added,
``probably is even lower now.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of teenagers bearing children has been
another major worry in recent years, but it, too, is less of a
concern now. While birth rates among teenagers 15 to 17 increased
substantially from 1986 to 1991, it declined from 39 to 34 births
per 1,000 between 1991 and 1996, according to Tuesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal was even more dramatic among black teenagers: they
averaged 83 births per 1,000 in 1991, but just 65 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On other measures the results were mixed. In 1996, 7.4 percent
of infants were born at weights light enough to put them at risk,
the highest level reported since the 1970s. But infant mortality
rates have continued to decline. That seeming inconsistency
apparently is the result of our doing a better job caring for
high-risk infants, said Edward Sondik, director of the National
Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get a little older, those infants are more likely than
ever to get the recommended childhood vaccines. In 1996, 77 percent
of children aged 19 to 35 months got the vaccines, up 3 percent
from 1995 and 8 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There's also no mistaking the trend with the use of tobacco,
alcohol and drugs. Regular smoking among 12th graders, for
instance, was heading down until 1992, but has risen steadily since
then. That's the same year use of illicit drugs began heading back
up among that age group, while with drinking, the increase began a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just older kids who are engaging in the risky
behavior. In 1997, 14.5 percent of eighth graders reported having
five or more drinks in a row within the previous two weeks, while
13 percent said they had used illegal drugs in the last 30 days.
The data for this age group in 1992 were about 13 percent for heavy
drinking and 7 percent for illicit drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are not believing the message that it's dangerous,'' said
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the areas where progress has been made, as well as
those where there has been slippage, is ``when we find the right
pressure points, the key factors, it seems to make a difference''
in changing children's behavior, said Sondik. ``But it's something
you have to continually track,'' he added, or that progress will be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical message of Tuesday's report, Sondik said, is
that there are big gaps in the progress various subgroups of the
population have made on the public health measures. Blacks are more
likely to suffer continued problems than whites, for instance, and
poor children generally are sicker than rich ones, in part because
they are less likely to be covered by health insurance. Even with
an issue like lead poisoning, where huge progress has been made,
poor children face 3 1/2 times the risk of poisoning as rich ones,
mainly because their homes are more likely to contain lead-bearing
paint and to have paint chips get into areas where they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to work on reducing the hazard of lead paint
in older housing,'' said Susanne Martinez, program director at the
non-profit Children's Defense Fund. ``This report shows that it
makes a difference. You can have a really bad problem and you can
work at it.''

RED SOX SLIDE CONTINUES AS THEY LOSE TO DEVIL RAYS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ They've done it with baling wire and
mirrors, spare parts and extra heart.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked, for half a season.
</P>
<P>
   But five losses in their first six games since the All-Star
break, while no reason for anyone to be throwing a panic party, do
raise a few questions about the Red Sox as presently constituted,
none more urgent than this:
</P>
<P>
   Are opposition pitchers the only people around here aware that
the Red Sox badly need another proven righthanded hitter, and if
that knowledge has indeed reached the offices on Yawkey Way, how
quickly is Dan Duquette prepared to act?
</P>
<P>
   The general manager, who traded veteran Jim Leyritz and replaced
him with Billy Ashley, a player in whom manager Jimy Williams has
shown little confidence, has said he's looking for a
righthanded-hitting outfielder. But in the wake of Tuesday's 5-4
loss to the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Duquette may want to
accelerate that search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try and do a better job on the offensive side,''
said Mo Vaughn, whose return to the lineup has dovetailed with the
team's dive since the All-Star break, even though he is hitting
.348 (8 for 23) with two home runs and four RBIs in that time. ``I
hope our pitchers don't get too frustrated with us. We have to hold
together and be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue may have taken on even greater urgency after Reggie
Jefferson, the lefthanded-hitting DH, pulled himself out of the
lineup in the seventh inning because his back problems flared up
again. Another righthanded hitter would allow the slumping John
Valentin (0 for 11, 1 for 16) to return to the No. 2 hole he
prefers, give needed protection to Vaughn, and even allow Williams
the option of restoring Nomar Garciaparra to the top of the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too good,'' said Jefferson, who on June 27 hurt his
back trying to twist out of the way of a fastball thrown behind him
by Florida pitcher Jesus Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   That pitch hit Jefferson in the base of the helmet but inflicted
more damage to his lower back than his head. He had a cortisone
injection in the affected area, but after just one hit and seven
strikeouts in 15 at-bats since the break, Jefferson yielded to
pinch hitter Midre Cummings with the potential go-ahead run on
second base. Cummings struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it did a week ago,'' Jefferson said. ``It's
tightening up again.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the Red Sox, who return home after
collectively batting .226 while losing four straight to the Orioles
and splitting a pair with their expansion cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay ended an 11-game losing streak when Bret Saberhagen
failed to hold a 3-0 lead and relievers Ron Mahay and Carlos Reyes
gave up three straight hits in the bottom of the ninth, the last a
liner through the box by Miguel Cairo that nearly felled Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo's game-winning single followed a double by Paul Sorrento
off Mahay that left a vapor trail through the legs of first baseman
Vaughn as it made its way into the right-field corner and sent
Bobby Smith to third. Sorrento, booed the night before, had four
hits during the matinee, including a fifth-inning home run off
Saberhagen, who until then had allowed only a single by Sorrento in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball could have killed me,'' Vaughn said of Sorrento's
double. ``I don't know where it was hit, but as soon as I looked,
it was by me. I couldn't tell you much about it. I'm glad I didn't
get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It killed Saberhagen that he was unable to put away the Devil
Rays after being staked to a 3-0 lead. The Sox got on the board in
the first when Tampa Bay center fielder Randy Winn booted Vaughn's
single, allowing Garciaparra to score from first. They made it 2-0
in the second on Scott Hatteberg's opposite-field triple and Mike
Benjamin's sacrifice fly and went ahead by three in the fifth when
Damon Buford, starting in place of the injured Darren Bragg
(groin), doubled and scored on Darren Lewis's double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to lose when you know they've lost 11 in a
row and haven't gotten hits with runners in scoring position,''
Saberhagen said. ``We've lost two games to these guys, and I've
pitched in both of 'em. That doesn't sit well with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays bunched together a bloop single, a bunt hit, and
three straight line-drive singles off Saberhagen to take a 4-3 lead
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were on cruise control until that sixth
inning came along,'' Saberhagen said. ``They put the ball in play,
and I didn't bury them when I should have.''

NEW ENGLAND SENATORS CRITICIZE HOUSE SPENDING CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four moderate Republican senators from New England
Tuesday criticized the proposed spending cuts in the House budget
plan as ``unwise,'' in an opening skirmish among the GOP over the
size of the federal tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Senators John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont,
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, came out against
the House Budget Resolution, which proposes deep cuts in domestic
spending to pay for $101 billion in tax cuts over five years.
</P>
<P>
   They raised their objections in a letter to Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to urge that fiscal responsibility rise
above fiscal temptation,'' Jeffords said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, being made public the day Domenici met with his
House counterpart, Representative John Kasich &UR;  &LR; of Ohio, to work out
differences in their budget bills, displayed the first significant
objection from Senate Republicans to the House tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If the four Republicans vote with Democrats on the final version
of a budget bill, the GOP majority in the Senate would be reduced
to one vote. The New England senators said at least two other
Republicans shared their concerns and would join them in voting
against the spending cuts needed to pay for the tax break proposed
by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The New Englanders said they were troubled by the additional
spending cuts called for in the House plan, because an estimated
$25 billion of the spending cuts would affect programs that help
low-income families and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spending reductions envisioned by the House would
effectively shred the safety net for low-income families and
children,'' said Chafee in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very very hard to carry this out without causing
considerable pain,'' he said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   While House Republican leaders have made large tax cuts a
priority, the House has not yet determined how to pay for them. The
Senate Budget Resolution calls for $30 billion in tax relief over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said the initiative by the New England moderates is to
help Domenici find common ground with Kasich for a tax-and-spending
plan for the next five years, because the House version would not
pass in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said he was concerned that momentum is building in the
Senate to support a budget plan closer to the House version than
the Senate on tax cuts. Senate Republican leader Trent Lott agreed
to a compromise with conservatives, including Senator John Ashcroft
of Missouri, on a $60 billion tax cut _ double the size Domenici
has said is affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the letter from the New Englanders, Ashcroft,
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire and three other conservatives
sent their own letter to Domeneci insisting that $101 billion in
tax relief was ``achievable.'' They vowed to oppose any budget
compromise that contained less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tax cuts will produce more revenues,'' Smith said in
an interview.

HAYWORTH (Undated) - Arizona's J.D. Hayworth, who had been trying
to tone down his image, returns to his old self with a fund-raising
letter calling Bill Clinton ``an unprincipled, philandering
president'' who has presided over ``the most corrupt administration
in U.S. history.'' The letter has outraged Democrats who are still
smarting over Indiana Republican Dan Burton calling Clinton a
``scumbag.'' ``This kind of bitter partisanship and mean-spirited
name-calling is shocking, even coming from Hayworth,'' said Mark
Fleisher, head of the state Democratic Party. The letter comes
after Hayworth was voted the second biggest ``windbag'' in Congress

edition of ``Washingtonian'' magazine. By MIKE MURPHY. Story will

BILINGUAL (Undated) - Concerned that only a small fraction of
bilingual students are becoming proficient in English, more than a
dozen Tucson parents and educators have begun pushing for a ballot
initiative to end bilingual education in Arizona. Their worries are
based partly on findings by the Arizona Department of Education
last month that just 2.8 percent of Limited English Proficient
students in the state learn enough English to enter the academic
mainstream. Mary Mendoza of Tucson, one of the leaders of the
group, said the figure is not surprising. ``There's no academic
component to bilingual programs,'' she said. ``There's no education
in them. Their goal is to keep Mexican students illiterate.'' By

the work of their hearts: Translating the Bible into Havasupai.
They have lived with views of vivid blue sky by day and brilliant
stars by night, a short hike from the spectacular blue-green Havasu
Falls. They have raised two daughters in a home smaller than a
double garage with few modern conveniences. They have earned trust
and friendship and learned the Havasupai language, carefully
guarded by a tribe that does not want its words scattered outside
the canyon. And with the help of a few tribal members, they have
drafted about 6,500 Bible verses _ most of the New Testament and 17
chapters of Genesis _ into Havasupai, a language so different from
English that each verse is translated meaning to meaning rather

LOTT URGES SPECIAL COUNSEL TO PROBE CHINA'S ROLE IN 1996 U.S.
ELECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday that
``new information,'' which he refused to detail, had emerged about
China's effort to influence the 1996 presidential election, and he
called for appointment of a special counsel to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's allegation was part of an intense attack the Mississippi
Republican launched against Clinton administration technological
dealings with China, including the claim that the Communist regime
in Beijing had benefited militarily from lax U.S. export controls.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his charges, delivered in a Senate speech, were based
on Senate committee investigations that are continuing and which
the Democratic administration has sought to stymie by refusing to
provide requested documents and testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would block Senate consideration of Clinton
nominees from ``non-cooperative agencies'' and that he and others
in the Republican leadership are ``actively examining our subpoena
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill said
Lott's contentions were ill-founded and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said Lott's remarks were ``not a
serious statement by a serious person'' but an attempt ``to connect
a lot of dots that, frankly, don't connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said, ``It's
partisanship at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lott's points were based on his interpretation of public
testimony before Senate committees over the past six weeks, but
that was not the case with his allegation that could be most
damaging to Clinton and his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``New information has come to light about China's efforts to
influence the American political process,'' Lott said. ``This new
information should remove all resistance to naming an independent
counsel to investigate the evidence and the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot comment in any detail about the nature of this
information,'' Lott said, but he said it had come to light since
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee finished its inquiry into
funding irregularities in the 1996 presidential campaign. ``And it
is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for an outside, impartial investigation by an
independent counsel into serious and credible charges of direct
Chinese government financing of the 1996 elections. It is time to
end the stonewall and get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said such allegations are being investigated
properly by the Justice Department. During Clinton's recent trip to
China, President Jiang Zemin denied any attempt by the Chinese
government to influence U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his Senate speech covered ``major interim judgments''
based on committee hearings since he formed a Senate task force in
late May to look into questions about possible transfers of
sensitive technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., co-chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, challenged Lott's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that the committee has reached some kind of
conclusion. It most assuredly has not,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-committee inquiry was sparked by allegations that a
U.S. satellite company, managed by the largest individual
contributor to the Democratic National Committee in the 1996
election cycle, had given China technical advice on improving the
accuracy of its troubled missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Since receiving the information, Lott said, Chinese missile
``launch reliability has been 100 percent. I agree with U.S.
government assessments that indicate this is not pure
coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the practice by which U.S. satellites are sent to
China to be launched on Chinese government rockets. Questions have
arisen about what technical details, with military as well a
commercial civilian applications, the Chinese may have learned
during such launches or post-launch reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration's export controls for satellites
are wholly inadequate,'' Lott said. ``They have not protected
sensitive U.S. technology. National security concerns are regularly
downplayed and even ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said China ``has received military benefit from U.S.
satellite exports'' and the Clinton administration has ``ignored
overwhelming information regarding Chinese (nuclear weapons)
proliferations, and has embarked on a de facto policy designed to
protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions under
U.S. proliferation law.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that Clinton ``is confident that the licenses &UR;  &LR; that
he's granted have not contributed to China's ability to design,
develop, operate, maintain, modify or repair satellite launch
vehicles ....
</P>
<P>
   ``We've addressed these issues and made it quite clear that the
license waivers granted by the Clinton administration, pursuant to
a policy developed by President Reagan and first implemented by
President Bush, had been consistent with U.S. interest and had been
consistent with our desire to be competitive in the global
satellite and technology market.''

   MARKET (New York) _ The stock market rallied sharply Tuesday as
several companies reported good or better-than-expected earnings
for the second quarter, easing concerns about the drag from Asia's
economic turmoil. The surge was enough to push the Dow Jones
industrial average to a new high, making it the last of the big
three indexes to climb back into record territory. By Jonathan

U.S., 20 OTHER NATIONS URGE CONTROLS ON SPREAD OF SMALL ARMS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ The United States joined 20 other countries
Tuesday in calling for measures to control the illicit and legal
sales of small arms and light weapons, pointing to their
uncontrolled spread and excessive accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was the first of its kind by governments acting in
concert. And although they failed to issue a statement of ``common
understanding,'' even after it had been watered down in two days of
closed meetings, the strongest advocates of controls on the
small-arms trade were pleased with the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a step,'' the director of Belgium's foreign aid
agency, Marc Van Craen, said. Van Craen noted that it had taken 13
years to pass a United Nations convention on children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-one countries reached a common understanding that we
have to do something about the plague of small weapons and a broad
agreement on what needs to be done,'' Van Craen said. ``But, of
course, once you get into the details the difficulty starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those difficulties were foreshadowed here during the
efforts to draft a statement of common understanding and
discussions on a treaty proposed by Canada that would restrict
small-arms sales. Reflecting the virtual absence of any
international legal controls, the treaty would bar only sales to
``nonstate actors'' like rebels, terrorist groups and criminal
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the United States and other countries had
misgivings about the proposed treaty, fearing that it would impinge
on foreign policy and commercial interests by barring covert sales
in support of liberation groups and sales to companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Col. Sirakoro Sangare, a military adviser to
the president of Mali, where a long civil war recently ended,
praised the Canadian proposal. Other countries said they felt that
the proposal did not go far enough because it did not deal with
sales to dictatorial governments or to regions with conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the floor, not the ceiling,'' said Steven Lee, a
member of the Canadian delegation and the director of the Canadian
Center for Foreign Policy Development. ``What we've tried to do is
put the puck on the ice and get the game started.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing virtually everyone here agreed on was that it was
going to be a long and difficult game.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles can be glimpsed in a comparison of the first and
final drafts of a document entitled ``An International Agenda on
Small Arms and Light Weapons: Elements of a Common Understanding.''
It was that document that failed to receive approval, after the
United States, Britain and some other countries said they would
have to send it back to their capitals for review.
</P>
<P>
   The final draft noticeably plays down the role of
nongovernmental organizations in controlling the small-arms trade.
It was nongovernmental organizations that forced governments to
enact a ban on land mines, and the United States does not want that
to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The first draft, which Norway circulated when the parley began,
notes ``the increasing number of governmental initiatives,'' and
refers to nongovernmental organizations as ``important partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The final draft says, ``governments bear the primary
responsibility for addressing these issues,'' and adds that
nongovernmental organizations ``contribute to our work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of the United States, Britain and South
Africa, language was removed on asking governments to release
information on small-arms production and holdings.

TRIAL DATE SET IN BRUNNER ROBBERY CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Sept. 11 trial date was set Tuesday for Kenny Brunner, the
former Georgetown basketball player, after he pleaded not guilty to
charges he robbed Los Angeles City College basketball coach Mike
Miller of $1,500 and attempted to murder him.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, who is being held in L.A. County jail on $550,000 bail,
will have a pre-trial hearing on July 28, at which time his
attorney, Jerome Bradford, is expected to ask Superior Court judge
James Dunn that the charges be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn on Tuesday also ordered LaDale Lunnie, who was charged with
robbery in the case, to stand trial. Lunnie told police he helped
Brunner with the robbery, in which Brunner is accused of pointing a
gun at Miller in his LACC office and firing it. The gun, however,
did not go off.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner, a point guard, was a high school All-American at
Dominguez High in Compton. He started as a freshman for Coach John
Thompson at Georgetown before leaving abruptly in midseason. He
later transferred to Fresno State but left after he was suspended
upon being charged in a robbery in Fresno.

CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO BULLY VOTERS, U.N. IS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. political and human rights officials
following preparations for elections in Cambodia on July 26 say the
country's electoral institutions have been heavily weighted in
favor of the Cambodian People's Party of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen also controls all broadcasting and has barred coverage
of opposition campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing to the Security Council on Monday, Francesc
Vendrell, who oversees Asian political affairs, said that voter
intimidation by Hun Sen's party had been widespread and that his
supporters still operated in a climate of impunity that had led to
dozens of killings and disappearances, diplomats who heard his
briefing said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to send a cautionary
message to Cambodia in the next few days, a spokesman said Monday.
The United Nations organized and ran Cambodia's first democratic
election, in 1993, the largest such operation ever undertaken by
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen U.N. election monitors are based in Cambodia to watch
this year's process. About 300 international observers are expected
to monitor the voting, a number that political and human rights
officials said was probably insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But statements by King Norodom Sihanouk and pledges by thousands
of volunteer Cambodian election observers to stay close to the
tallying of votes _ including sleeping overnight with ballot boxes
_ during a counting process that could take days have had some
effect in convincing people that they can vote as they choose,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement June 17 by the king, whose son Prince Norodom
Ranariddh leads the political opposition, told Cambodians not to
worry about threats and to feel confident that the secrecy of their
votes would be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has told voters that if they vote against him, all
development in their villages will cease, an official at the United
Nations in New York said. Some of his supporters have been more
violent in their threats, beating and in some cases torturing and
killing local opposition leaders who were trying to campaign for
election.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and two leading U.S. institutes for promoting
democracy abroad agree that while the election process is seriously
flawed, the voters may still surprise the government.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in Phnom Penh, the two U.S. groups, the National
Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute,
said in a statement that ``systematic and widespread political
intimidation and violence'' had hampered opposition competition in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the two institutes, affiliated with the Democratic and
Republican Parties, said that despite the significant coercion,
``the outcome of the election is not a foregone conclusion, and it
merits international attention.'' The two groups oppose a boycott
by monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has reduced its involvement in the
European-dominated Joint International Observer Group, which is
coordinated by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   American observers say the larger political environment, not
just the conduct of polling, must be judged when assessments are
made as to whether the elections are fair.
</P>
<P>
   The United States includes in that political environment the
violent coup of a year ago and the still unresolved killings or
disappearances of 100 opposition politicians, including supporters
of Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen, his junior partner in the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Americans also say the control of all armed forces by Hun Sen's
party contributes to an uncertain climate for voting.

<P>
   The announcement by Credit Suisse trumpeting its recruitment
coup came two weeks after it enticed the three leaders of the group
_ Frank Quattrone, George Boutros and Bill Brady _ into joining it.
The three had left Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. more than two years ago to
join Deutsche.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche reached a confidential
agreement late on Monday allowing for almost the wholesale transfer
of the German bank's technology group _ 132 employees including
secretaries. Now they are even negotiating the transfer of the
lease for the group's worldwide headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone and his two senior colleagues, who mailed letters to
clients in March assuring them that they would stay at Deutsche,
seemed pleased with their new bosses. ``We can really make a
difference with a firm that wants to be a leader,'' Quattrone said
in an interview Tuesday, maintaining that Deutsche has scaled back
its investment banking ambitions since he joined. ``Deutsche's
strategy of Europe first was not consistent with our strategy of
building a worldwide technology franchise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone declined to comment on what financial incentives he
and his colleagues received to make the switch, but he described
reports of promised sums as high as $250 million as ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned that international securities firms that have
tried to build their franchises quickly by assembling teams of
talented people have often stumbled, as the recent experience of
several big foreign banks _ including Union Bank of Switzerland,
Deutsche Bank, National Westminster Bank PLC and Barclays PLC, both
of Britain _ have shown. After expensive hiring binges, each of
these firms has pulled back from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are zero examples of European banks that have been able
to build a franchise from within by buying people,'' said Evangelos
Kavouriadis, European banking analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP;
Co. But he quickly added that the Credit Suisse purchase of the
entire First Boston firm ``provides the only example of a
successful entry'' into Wall Street by a European firm.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche said little about the departures Tuesday. ``We are
pleased to have reached an amicable agreement with Credit Suisse
First Boston and Frank Quattrone,'' said Macy Egerton, a
spokeswoman for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf-Ernst Breuer, Deutsche's chief executive, said over the
weekend that his firm would seek to fill the gap created by recent
defections, perhaps by acquiring an international investment bank.
Analysts already have speculated that such Wall Street firms as
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc.
would fit its needs.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of Quattrone's clients seem quite prepared to make
the switch with him to Credit Suisse. ``We are looking at the team,
Frank and his team, they are the people with the proven record,''
said Richard Kraber, chief financial officer of Wind Rivers
Systems, a California software company that Quattrone helped to
take public and one that has used many of Deutsche's banking
services. ``If you ask me whether the institution prevails over the
individuals, the answer is no. We will go with Frank.''

Olusegun Obasanjo, having just emerged from three years in the
prisons of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, was inclined to be
patient. Freedom was sweet ``Look at what has become of this
country,'' said Obasanjo, who ruled Africa's most populous nation
from 1976 to 1979 and gained lasting esteem through the rare act of
handing over power to a civilian government. ``We are one of the
world's biggest producers of oil, and we have no fuel. We have more

AMID BLUSTERY WEATHER, HOCH BRACES FOR BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Scott Hoch stood by the 18th green Tuesday
at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club with his hands in his pockets
trying to stay warm. He looked as if he had just stepped out of a
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The chilly weather is a major reason why Hoch, one of golf's
most consistent money makers, has only played in two British Opens
since he joined the PGA Tour in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch does not like cold weather. He does not like the St.
Andrews golf course, one of the fabled sites on the British Open
rotation. And because Hoch believes in speaking his mind and
playing where he chooses, his decision to shun the British Open in
past years to play in warm-weather tournaments in the United States
has not made him a fan favorite in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hoch signed a five-year contract with Yonex last
winter, one of the stipulations called for Hoch to play in all four
major championships, including the British Open. So there was Hoch
on Tuesday at his third British Open, dealing with the elements,
dealing with probing questions and preparing for the year's third
major, which begins Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Hoch was candid. While he was impressed with the Royal
Birkdale layout, he was not pleased with temperatures in the 50s
and winds gusting to 25 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Hoch would rather play golf near his home
in Orlando, Fla. But wouldn't it be interesting if Hoch, the
reluctant British Open player, won his first major at the
tournament he has avoided so often?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would show that God has a sense of humor,'' Hoch said,
smiling at the thought. ``I thought that might happen, until I got
over here and saw the weather. This is not my type of weather. I'm
not sure it's anybody's type of weather. But I'm not just here
trying to go through the motions. I've always felt I've had a game
good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's game has been good enough to win eight tournaments on the
PGA Tour and six tournaments internationally during a successful
and steady career. From 1994 through 1997, only Tom Lehman, Phil
Mickelson, Davis Love III and Greg Norman earned more on tour than
Hoch, who took in slightly more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hoch has never won a major, and his biggest disappointment
came during the 1989 Masters, when he missed a two-foot putt that
would have won on the first playoff hole, and eventually lost to
Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   In his two previous British Opens, Hoch missed the cut in 1990
and tied for 68th in 1995. So, winning here this year, at age 42,
would rank as the highlight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the British Open is the most important
tournament in the world,'' Hoch said. ``The atmosphere you can't
beat. There's none other like it. That's the part I've missed by
not playing. The crowds are probably the most knowledgeable of all
we play _ this and Augusta. They're very supportive of their game
over here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in the galleries this week will be supportive
of Hoch, who has become an easy target because of his infrequent
appearances. Yet, most people were polite to Hoch during Tuesday's
practice rounds, and many asked for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of them said, `We better get your autograph, because
you're not here that much,''' Hoch said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch believes some of the criticism has been unfair. He has
traditionally done well in summer events on the PGA Tour played
opposite the British Open, and traveling to Europe in midsummer
more often would have forced Hoch to miss some of his favorite
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time of year where I make hay,'' Hoch said. ``When
you play over here, it's very difficult to play in any tournament
before or after. Plus, I love hot weather. My hands seem to lose
feeling quicker than other guys. I've had them checked for
circulation problems, but they haven't found anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hoch has skipped the British Open, and he has taken the heat
for it. Asked if he would have played this year's Open if not for
his contract, Hoch smiled and said: ``I'm not sure. Maybe I would
have. Just the grief I have taken alone may have made me come.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not an actor who can go and play up to people, just
because I want to change their opinion. I'm truthful. I get myself
into trouble being honest. Other guys, you ask them a question,
they're going to skirt the issue. Some other guys out here are a
lot different to the press than what they really are. I wouldn't
say they were actors, but they know how to play the game. That's
one class I missed in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Yonex would expect him to play the British Open in 2000
at &QC; St. Andrews, a course that Hoch still loathes, Hoch said: ``I've
already let them know there's an upcoming British that I wasn't
going to play in. I'll probably have to do something for them,
maybe go to Japan. But I'm sure they wouldn't want me to play where
I don't care to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Hoch plans to make the best of his experience.
When the interview ended, he went back to signing autographs,
hoping the British fans understood that his past absences were
nothing personal. He he also hoped for warmer weather by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If conditions are like this, it'll be difficult for me,'' Hoch
said. ``All I know is, it's warmer in Orlando.'' &QL;

 &HT;    LOTT CHARGES OF EXPORT ABUSES SPARK PARTISAN SPAT
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Tuesday that
the Clinton administration's ``wholly inadequate'' export policy
had resulted in the transfer of sensitive technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's statement on the Senate floor ignited a political tinder
box, with each party blaming the other for endangering national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican's unexpected delivery of the findings
of what he termed an ``interim report'' of various Senate
investigations prompted leading Senate Democrats to assail him for
releasing classified information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is partisanship at its worst,'' said Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. ``I am disappointed by the inaccuracies of the
statements and the recklessness of these statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats noted that Lott unveiled the findings just as
the wide-ranging investigation into campaign fund-raising abuses
_some involving China and other Asian nations _ appears to be
sputtering to an end without any high-ranking White House officials
implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense policy experts expressed concern that an opportunity to
examine whether the nation's security has been placed at risk may
be lost amid the partisan rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those questions is: Did Loral Space and
Communications and Hughes Electronics, in helping figure out why a
satellite launch failed in February 1996 in southern China, convey
information that helped the Chinese improve the accuracy of their
nuclear missiles?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much willingness to accuse the other side of
partisanship. We need to discuss the facts,'' said Henry Sokolski,
who was the top Pentagon expert monitoring nuclear proliferation
during the Bush administration and who now runs the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the partisan outbreak on the Hill to two children
denying blame over a broken vase, Sokolski said, ``It's kind of
like two kids pointing at each other saying 'he did it,' when the
point is they are standing there in their bare feet with broken
glass everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger in all of this, Sokolski said, is that the focus will
be diverted away from closely examining the export policies of both
the Clinton and Bush administrations. ``It would be a shame if we
get stuck here in partisanship,'' he said. ``We need to address
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his floor statement, Lott said that the Senate had
conducted 13 hearings and heard testimony from 32 witnesses in four
Senate committees. From that testimony, he said, it clearly was
time for Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sharply criticizing the Clinton White House, Lott
said that China's military had benefited from the satellite exports
and that the administration had ``ignored overwhelming information
regarding Chinese proliferation'' and ``embarked on a de facto
policy designed to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from
sanctions under U.S. proliferation law.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of where the Clinton administration has looked the
other way, Lott said that testimony before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee earlier this month revealed that Defense
Department monitors are not required to be present at satellite
launches in China. ``No one in the U.S. government knows what
transpired at these launches or if U.S. laws and polices on
technology transfer were followed,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's satellite export control system relies on the good
will of the Commerce Department, a department which has repeatedly
demonstrated its willingness to ignore national security concerns
on satellite exports,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   American satellite makers contend that transferring the
jurisdiction of approving satellite launches in China from the
State Department to the Commerce Department was crucial to their
business, with some comparing the State Department application
process to a ``roach motel,'' the type of place where you check in,
but never check out.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for the satellite industry. An economic
analysis by the Maryland-based Futron Corp. estimates that revenues
from the U.S. commercial satellite market, now valued $5.7 billion
could be worth more than six times that amount by 2003.

THERE IS `SOMETHING ABOUT MARY' 
OUR RATING: THREE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Courage and comedy aren't two words that are
usually linked. But in politically correct times when most movies
assiduously avoid crossing the delicate line of vulgarity in fear
of losing mass appeal (and that all-important PG-13 rating), it is
positively heroic when a couple of guys manage to call to mind the
days of Mel Brooks and ``Springtime for Hitler'' and create a film
that manages both to joyfully entertain and creatively offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' has all the spirit of Brooks
and Monty Python and ``Animal House'' in its manic zeal to milk
every sacred cow in the name of facetious fun. You'll laugh. You'll
groan. And often at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there would be no reason to celebrate ``Mary'' if it
were merely tasteless. (Karen Finley and other NEA gravy trainers
are learning that harsh reality now.) This is the most consistently
funny movie the Farrelly brothers have made, coming on the heels of
guilty pleasures ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin.'' ``Mary'' will
probably be tagged with the title ``Gross and Grosser,'' a
distinction it admittedly earns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Farrellys, who wrote and directed the film together,
populate their movie with surprisingly sympathetic characters,
which often makes the wicked humor kind of touching _ albeit in a
sick, twisted way.
</P>
<P>
   The movie puts a '90s spin on the age-old story of Boy Meets
Girl. Basically, it's ``Sleepless in Seattle'' with a court
restraining order thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' opens with an inspired, 20-minute time capsule
introducing the characters in their nerdy, mid-'80s high school
days. We meet Ted (Ben Stiller), a gangly geek with a bad haircut
and braces who has the hots for dream girl Mary (Cameron Diaz).
When Ted sticks up for Mary's mentally handicapped brother, she
rewards him by asking him to the prom. That sets up an unfortunate
incident involving Ted's zipper, and he never gets to see Mary
again.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 13 years and Ted is still dreaming about Mary. His
loathsome pal, Dom (the perfectly cast Chris Elliott), suggests Ted
hire a private investigator to track her down. The goofball he
enlists, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), ends up falling for Mary himself,
which puts into motion a love triangle that eventually expands to
include other idiotic suitors. You see, there is, indeed, something
about Mary, and it seems to attract every man on the Eastern
seaboard with an IQ of less than 50.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is too long and, like most good sketch comedies, its
humor misses as often as it connects. But there are several scenes
that will have you laugh so hard that you'll start to cry. Or maybe
it will work the other way around. Certainly, you will never look
at hair gel the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz brings great comic timing and a sweet vulnerability to
Mary, and Stiller and Dillon prove to be troopers in the face of
all sorts of indignities. Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, Markie Post (!),
Elliott and Jonathan Richman as a wandering troubadour (and
makeshift Greek chorus) straight out of ``Cat Ballou'' round out a
wonderfully funny supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film's crude tastelessness won't play with
everyone. Sometimes you'll even hate yourself for laughing. But
laugh you will _ often and hard. ``There's Something About Mary''
is the funniest movie of the year, and it mixes in just enough
sweetness with its bodily fluids to make it good, deranged fun. &UR;  &QL;

<P>
   BERNARDSVILLE, N.J. _ Lisa Smith leads what she calls a ``very
ordinary life.'' Here is a glimpse: In the past four months, she
ran 150 miles across the Sahara Desert in temperatures of up to 130
degrees, got stung by a scorpion along the way, but kept going and
staggered across the finish line with a fever of 103. She slogged
400 miles through the Montana wilderness on a weeklong ``adventure
race'' that included white-water kayaking, snowshoeing on glaciers
and riding 100 miles on a mountain bike. And she raced 50 miles
along the spine of Long Island in 6 hours 43 minutes in a
super-marathon, where she won and set a new course record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, it is time for something really difficult. Death
Valley is calling.
</P>
<P>
   For athletes like Smith _ part of a tiny band of little-known
super endurance runners who stake their claims on the frontiers of
human physical possibility _ the Death Valley ultra-marathon called
``Badwater'' is the evil dark star and siren song temptress of a
sport that most people probably barely even know about, let alone
fantasize doing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The race, which begins Thursday, starts at the lowest point in
the continental United States, 282 feet below sea level, in high
summer _ the time of year that gives Death Valley towns like
Furnace Creek their names and reputations _ and stretches across
the desert for 135 miles, climbing 8,500 vertical feet to the base
of Mount Whitney, whose peak is the highest point in the lower 48
states.
</P>
<P>
   For an added treat, 40- to 50-mile-per-hour headwinds are not
uncommon. The course literature says runners should be prepared for
a 100- degree variation in temperature, from 130 or more at
beginning to freezing or below at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest race in the world,'' said Smith, a
37-year-old massage therapist and sports trainer who is running
Badwater for the third time. ``Something about this race just gives
you a power that you have to find within yourself. Once you've done
it, nothing seems that difficult anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Super distance running is predicated on the notion that just
about everything in life, including the plain vanilla 26.2-mile
regular marathon, is too easy. The sport, which offers little in
the way of celebrity or prize money _ partly because finishing at
all is considered nearly as prestigious as winning _ has a long
history as a kind of eccentric cousin to regular track and field.
The sport's roots, historians say, extend to the late 1800s and
what was called pedestrianism, in which amateur and professional
athletes competed in sometimes weeklong running marathons around a
track, or city-to-city races of 500 miles or more.
</P>
<P>
   What has' happened, however, is that old-fashioned running has
merged, in both style and substance, with harder-edged sports like
mountain bike racing and rock-climbing. Harsh settings and
promotional literature that relies on words like ``extreme'' have
become part of ultra-running's package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a big deal to finish a marathon,'' said Ted
Corbitt, who is credited with helping revive interest in
ultra-marathoning in the 1960s and 1970s. ``But there's been an
evolution. People wanted more challenges, and they're willing to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, the Badwater race _ formally known as Hi-Tec Badwater
for the shoe-company that created it in 1987, and which still
sponsors it _ has added meaning for her. Of the expected field of
31 American and international competitors, there are only three
women, and two of them trained together here in this same small
northern New Jersey town. Smith and Julie Teiger _ a 44-year-old
mother of four _ met in an aerobics class at the Bernardsville
YMCA. The third woman is Anita Allen, 44, of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were soul mates,'' Teiger said of Smith. ``Our arm swings
would be in sync when we ran, and our breathing would be quite
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith worked as a coach and trainer with Teiger, who now lives
in Utah, and this year persuaded her friend _ through what Teiger
described as a full-court press of will and optimism and contagious
spiritual strength _ to test herself against foot racing's worst.
The two women arranged to reunite last weekend in Las Vegas in
preparation for the five-hour drive together to Badwater's starting
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared; I am really scared,'' Teiger said in a telephone
interview late last week from her home in Park City. ``But I am
going on trust in Lisa, because she said I can do it.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith should know what to expect. She has lived it, finishing
twice _ though last year she had walk part of it backward, up the
steep final grade to Mount Whitney _ because her ankles and
quadriceps were simply not working for proper forward locomotion
after 125 miles or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the terms Smith used to describe that journey, sitting over
the table in her apartment here in this quiet leafy suburb, were
spiritual. Badwater, she said, is about magic and the forces of the
world that come alive after so many hours pushing and prodding at
the limits of mind and body. Nearly everyone hallucinates, for
example. One runner last year swore he had run at one point across
the Golden Gate Bridge, and recalled every detail. Smith saw goats
fly over head last year. She heard Indian chants, and babies
crying. You know you have arrived at Badwater's heart, she said,
when the visions start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most incredibly spiritual place,'' she said. ``It
makes you want to live in the moment, experience the moment, live
with it, take it, suck it all in.''
</P>
<P>
   Teiger said that on her friend's advice, she will go to Badwater
with a spiritual agenda ready and in place to try to shape,
perhaps, her own marathon-inspired visions. She plans to think
about the pioneer women who settled the West and who had to face
challenges far beyond the calculated, artificial environment of a
road race, however arduous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had miserable shoes, no water, carrying a baby on the
hip, maybe burying a baby on the way,'' Teiger said. ``And here we
are with our fancy shoes and a car that follows us, carrying water
_ we've got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who crossed the finish line in just over 37 hours at
Badwater last year to finish third _ about eight hours behind the
winner _ is hoping to break 34 hours this time, and part of her
strategy, in keeping with the harsh spirit of the race, perhaps, is
to do it without any sleep. The first year, Smith slept for two
hours. Last year she caught a 45-minute nap, and only then because
her mother, Dorothy Smith, who was part of her racing crew,
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the inviting, air-conditioned camper that beckoned
for Smith's rest stops has been replaced by a van, and Dorothy
Smith will not be there to worry. Lisa said it was just too hard
for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard on me to see how hard it was on her watching me,''
she said of her mother. ``You know you're going to suffer out
there, you're definitely going to suffer, but for me it's suffering
that I know I'll get through and I'll work through. For her, it was
the kind of suffering like, `Oh my God, she's going to die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Smith, who lives near Chicago, where Lisa grew up and
lived before moving to New Jersey about 12 years ago, agreed that
it was indeed trying for a mother's soul to watch a daughter run
Badwater. But as bad as it was, she said, it was just as dazzling
to see Lisa return to life when it was over, like a desert flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove down the mountain, went to dinner, and I think she
was about recovered,'' Dorothy Smith said. ``I went to bed before
she did.''

 &HT;    Tech turnovers puts Cremins in hot seat
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seven underclassmen have left the Georgia Tech
basketball program in the past five years _ not an uncommon rate in
the ACC, but one that incites coach Bobby Cremins' critics and
concerns Tech athletics director Dave Braine.
</P>
<P>
   When starting point guard Travis Spivey announced two weeks ago
that he was transferring after one year at Tech, it fed the
perception that Cremins, under intense pressure to get the Yellow
Jackets back in the NCAA Tournament on a regular basis, is running
off players who don't live up to his high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm concerned with the perception,'' said Braine, who has
met with Cremins on several occasions. ``(But) the only ultimatum
I've delivered, if you want to call it that, was to get more
players and more depth. ... I'm not satisfied with the program, but
I'm never satisfied with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins takes the blame _ but only for recruiting players who
can't cut the tough academics at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guilty of bringing in young men who are not comfortable
(in the classroom),'' Cremins said. ``I need to take a harder look
at their transcripts. I could kick myself for some of the mistakes
I've made. I hope I haven't hurt those players who have
transferred. I took risks that were unfair to everybody involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) people who know me, they know ... I would never run a
player off. If he wanted to stay here, I would honor his
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven players who left Tech early, one turned pro, three
left for basketball reasons, and three left because of academic
problems _ although only one was on academic probation at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small forward Martice Moore (1992-94) transferred to Colorado
after his sophomore season, seeking more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Point guard Stephon Marbury (1995-96) turned pro after his
freshman season and was the fourth pick in the NBA draft that year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forward Juan Gaston (1995-96) transferred to Clark Atlanta
after his freshman season because of academic problems. ``We knew
he was a risk (academically), but we decided to try it anyway,''
Cremins said. ``I take full responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Center Bucky Hodge (1994-96) transferred to Central Florida
after his sophomore season in search of increased playing time.
(Pablo Machado, the 1996 Mr. Georgia Basketball who lost his
starting job to freshman Alvin Jones last season, is considering a
transfer for a similar reason.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Shooting guard Gary Saunders (1995-97) missed the start of his
sophomore season while on academic probation and transferred to
Seton Hall after the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Point guard Kevin Morris (1996-97) struggled in his only
season against ACC competition and transferred to Georgia State of
the Trans America Athletic Conference last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey never was on academic probation, but has said he was
never comfortable in the classroom at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Would Cremins have encouraged Spivey, who averaged 5.6 points
per game last season, to transfer if he had averaged 21? ''If he
was struggling in the classroom, yes. If he was solid in school,
no,'' Cremins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the academic workload was not the only reason Spiver left.
He also was displeased that Cremins ``recruited over him'' this
season, signing Berkmar point guard Tony Akins. ``I felt it was in
my best interest if I transferred,'' Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins defends the practice of transfers. ``You know,
transferring is very common and very healthy,'' he said. ``I don't
hesitate to encourage it when it's the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though players must sit out a year after transferring, it's
a fairly common practice around the ACC and nation _ and it works
both ways. Roshown McLeod transferred to Duke from St. John's and
had a great career, becoming the Hawks' first-round pick in this
year's NBA draft. Mike Chappell left Duke for Michigan State
because he wanted more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   And Jason Collier, a solid student and two-year starter at
Indiana, left the program and landed at Tech, where he'll be a
starter next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at out players who transferred (from Tech),'' Cremins
said. ''Almost all of them were starters. Basketball was not the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The players who have left the Tech program appear to harbor no
animosity toward Cremins. ''I don't have a problem with coach
Cremins,'' Spivey said. ''It was my decision to leave. He said he
wanted me to do whatever I felt was best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Saunders recommended our program highly to (high school
phenom) Al Harrington,'' Cremins said. ``Kevin Morris attended
several of our games last season and we talked a couple of times.
Juan Gaston is a great kid. I can't wait for college coaches to
call me about Travis Spivey. I hope Saunders does great at Seton
Hall. I hope Kevin Morris helps Lefty's program.''
</P>
<P>
   Braine has not put Cremins on any kind of warning, but said, ``I
do think this is a very important year. (But) it's not a demand.
I'm not telling him he has to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins is upbeat about next season, despite the loss of
four-year seniors Matt Harpring and Michael Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   ''This past year was really important to me,'' he said about
Tech's 19-14 finish _ a turnaround from the 9-18 disaster of the
season before. ''Two years ago, we were not a good basketball
program. I was upset by the lack of chemistry. I saw a lot coming
back this past year. We played four freshmen and were one win away
from the NCAAs and got to the third round of the NIT.

 &HT;    Swimmer a big fish in an unusual pond
 &HT;    By Jon Gallo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six years ago, Bobby Brewer heard his swimming career
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the word around the pool - that I was done, that I
was finished,'' he said. ``I was 18 years old and just out of high
school and people were laughing at me. I had college coaches
mailing me letters saying I had just made the worst decision of my
entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer hadn't done anything wrong while swimming at Morrow High
School, except for being the nation's top backstroker and a
four-time All-America selection. He was bombarded by phone calls
from the nation's top collegiate programs, followed by on-campus
trips. He was a swimmer every coach wanted, one who could make a
top program into a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brewer did the unthinkable, something no state swimmer with
his acclaim had done before. He signed with the University of
Georgia, joining a Bulldog team that hadn't finished higher than
26th at NCAAs in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is without question the most important signee this program
has ever had,'' Georgia head coach Jack Bauerle said of Brewer, who
competes in the upcoming Goodwill Games. ``He showed everyone that
great swimmers come to our program. I can't imagine how much
confidence that must have took for him to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   After visiting some of the nation's premier programs, such as
Southern California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, Brewer decided
that his future looked brightest closest to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go to a place where I was going to be just
another superstar,'' said Brewer, who still holds 17 state high
school records. ``I wanted to go to a place where I could build a
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer promptly laid a new foundation at Georgia, as the
Bulldogs placed 15th and 16th at the '93 and '94 NCAA
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an immediate impact,'' Bauerle said. ``He came in here
and gave us credibility when we didn't have it. He got us going in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, everything Brewer built crumbled. Heading into his junior
year, he ruptured a disk in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating more than anything else, like everything I
had worked for since I started swimming when I was 7 years old was
gone, `` Brewer said of his injury that led to a medical red-shirt
and 1995 and a relapse that forced him out of the pool for nearly a
month during 1996, which he had taken off to train for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer finished ninth at the Olympic Trials and watched the
Atlanta Games from his home. For a swimmer who in 1993 was ranked
eighth in the world, coping with failure was something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about quitting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't, and he helped lead Georgia to a school-record
third place at the 1997 NCAAs, followed by a seventh-place showing
this year. He then graduated with a degree in psychology, after
earning five All-American honors and 11 All-American honorable
mentions in the backstroke, distinctions he earned swimming
backstroke both individually and on Georgia's medley relay teams.

   BOSTON _ Want to check out your electrician? Make sure your real
estate agent is properly licensed? Or perhaps find out whether your
hairdresser has been disciplined?
</P>
<P>
   State officials Tuesday unveiled a new $320,000 web site that
should provide an easy way for consumers to gain basic information
about the 590,000 professionals licensed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the future people will look back and see this as
one of the pivotal points in government opening up to the public,''
said Daniel A. Grabauskas, the state's director of consumer
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The site's address is www.state.ma.us/reg. State officials said
the site will allow licensees to interact with the boards that
regulate them and let consumers learn more about the people they
hire in a cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
   The information available to consumers is fairly basic. For
example, someone looking for an electrician can search by county or
town for a list of electricians in that area. The consumer can then
select a licensee and find out what type of license he or she
holds, whether that license is expired or active, and whether any
disciplinary actions have been taken against the licensee in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 of the 45 professions regulated by the Division of
Registration _ including nurses, dentists, plumbers, pharmacists,
social workers, real estate agents, and marriage therapists _ the
web site also offers consumers tips on getting the most for their
money.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a funeral director, for example, consumers are urged
to shop around because prices can vary widely. The tips also tell
consumers that state and federal law requires funeral directors to
provide an itemized price list and that Massachusetts now allows
consumers to rent rather than buy a casket.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Registration's web site also offers links to other
state web sites that provide information on doctors and home
improvement contractors, as well as consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those without access to computers can obtain the same
information, but they will have to call or visit the board offices.

FARRELLYS AIM `DUMB' HUMOR AT ADULT AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 
  
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were more than a few days during the making
of the gleefully gross new comedy, ``There's Something About
Mary,'' that actor Ben Stiller did not exactly relish the idea of
coming into work. There was the day when a fish hook yanked his
mouth into cartoon proportions. And there was the day when he had
to pretend to get caught in the teeth of a zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be cheerful,'' Stiller says, ``knowing your role
calls for your head to be bashed into a chair or for your thing to
be caught in a zipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Stiller's words repeated to them, Bobby and Peter
Farrelly, who wrote and directed ``Mary'' surely sympathize. But
they hasten to add that Stiller got off easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron Diaz was the one who had the potential career-ender in
the movie,'' Peter says. ``She had to rub the ... how do I say this
... hair gel-like material in her hair. That could have stigmatized
her for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Yeah, it's like Ned Beatty in `Deliverance.' The
only thing he did wrong was be too convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers are nothing if not convincing, which to
their critics is part of the problem. The two Rhode Island natives
mined the depths of lowbrow humor with their first two films,
``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``Kingpin,'' wild, hit-and-miss movies
about sympathetic losers. The movies won fans with both audiences
and _ surprise _ critics, who found the brothers' in-your-face
humor to be a refreshing blast in an arid, politically correct
landscape. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Beyond 13-year-old humor
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``There's Something About Mary,'' which could be
described as the first stalker romance, the Farrellys have expanded
their reach, possessing the clout to deliver their first R-rated
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was time,'' says Peter, at 41, a year older than
Bobby. ``The only guy who thinks along those lines seems to be
Woody Allen, and obviously he has a different thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seems to set out to make adult comedies anymore,''
Bobby says. ``I think studios want to gear everything to
13-year-old boys. There's nothing wrong with that. We had that age
group in mind with `Dumb and Dumber,' since those guys were about
13 years old themselves mentally. But we've always had a lot of
stuff that we've wanted to do that the MPAA won't let us get away
with. And now we have our chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Mary'' has outrageous scenes, gags that words can't begin
to fully describe and jokes that can't be repeated in a family
newspaper. There are no sacred cows. There are jabs at gay serial
killers, the handicapped and ``retards.'' A dog gets electroshock
treatment and later becomes an amphetamine-fueled whirling dervish.
And, of course, there's the scene with the zipper, a bit already
part of film lore even though the movie hasn't been released yet in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask us, `How far will you go?''' Peter says.
``And the answer is: As far as the audience lets us. It's up to
them. We test a lot, mostly in colleges. And any time the laughter
stops, we cut the scene, sometimes by seconds or sometimes in its
entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Mary'' also has _ something the two previous Farrelly
movies lacked _ is an actual story line, sort of a Boy Meets Girl,
Boy Meets Zipper, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Stalks Girl, Boy Gets Girl
Back Again kind of thing. It's a development that also stems from
the brothers' obsession with test screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both `Dumb and Dumber' and `Kingpin' tested in the 90s for
guys and the 40s for women, and with this movie we got the women,
too,'' Peter says. ``I don't know why, but women seem to need a
story. Guys can watch stuff like the Three Stooges and be fine.
Women need more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so needy,'' Bobby adds, mock contempt in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   subhed: Sibling revelry
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys never appear to have been needy in their lives,
even though 15 years ago they were both floundering in sales jobs.
(``We were still enjoying life,'' Peter says. ``Life has always
been nice.'') Bobby, a geological engineering major (a misnomer, he
says, born from his days as a college stoner), was developing
Sunspot, the world's first round beach towel. Peter was selling
shipping space on cargo vessels. Then, after finishing his master's
degree in creative writing, Peter came up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written a book (`Outside Providence,' which will be
released as a film this year starring Alec Baldwin), but I kind of
figured out that I wasn't going to make much money writing fiction
and, besides, it takes too long to write,'' Peter says. ``So I
started writing screenplays with a friend and eventually dragged
Bobby out to L.A. to help because he knows what's funny and what
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys, along with writing partner Bennett Yellin, began
making a comfortable living cranking out unproduced screenplays.
Eddie Murphy purchased one, writer-director David Zucker another.
But it wasn't until they sold ``Dumb and Dumber'' that Peter and
Bobby finally got to see their work on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   With their debut, the brothers took no chances, demanding that
they direct the movie, even though neither had ever been to film
school or shot so much as a TV commercial. (``Hollywood isn't like
a regular industry where they do background checks,'' says Bobby,
who is married and has two children. ``We could have been escaped
convicts for all they could tell.'') The Farrellys figured they
knew the story and they knew how to tell a joke. (``What else is
there?'' Bobby asks.) The rest would somehow just work itself out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
subhed: Flying blind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a panic attack the night before,'' says Peter, who
has been married for a year. ``We called David Zucker and he told
us to relax. He also told us to let everyone on the set know that
we didn't know what the hell we were doing and get their support.
We did, and we've been with the same crew ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only admirers. Jim Carrey credits the Farrellys
for putting his career on the map, and his ``Dumb and Dumber''
co-star Jeff Daniels appreciated the chance to drop his drawers and
dramatic chops and play stupid. (``He wasn't our first choice,''
Peter admits. ``We wanted Michael Richards, but he kept telling us
the story was a tragedy like `Of Mice and Men.' He called us after
the premiere and said, `You know, you guys were right.''')
</P>
<P>
   When ``Kingpin'' failed to ignite the box-office (``It wasn't
marketed very well,'' Bobby says), the Farrellys were courted by
20th Century Fox executive Tom Sherak, who gave the brothers a free
hand in bringing their vulgarity to full fruition. The studio is
pleased enough with the results to have signed the filmmaking team
to a three-year, writing-producing-directing deal. (Next up:
``Stuck on You,'' a comedy about Siamese twins.)
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest fans, though, might be Mom and Dad. Peter and
Bobby credit their parents for honing their humor, although no one
in the family could have guessed at where they would take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents were strict about stuff like TV, but what they
weren't strict about was humor,'' Peter says. ``We could tell any
joke. If it was funny, it was OK. We would sit around the dinner
table, my parents, Bobby and me and our three sisters and just have
a lot of laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bobby: ``Our father just has a brutal sense of humor, and
my mother can take any kind of joke. In fact, it used to piss our
sisters off. They'd be trying to stop us, screaming, `Mom! Don't
encourage them! They're sick.'''
</P>
<P>
   They still are. Only now, their audience is bigger than the
immediate family.

TRANSFER OF SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans said Tuesday their preliminary
investigation found the Clinton administration ``violated US
policy'' by providing China with sensitive satellite technology
that included military benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in a surprise floor speech,
also said GOP investigators had obtained ``new information''
showing that China tried to influence US elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott didn't provide much detail, he did say the next phase
of the investigation would look at why at least three US satellites
have been launched in China ``with no US monitors present.'' Lott
said the absence of US monitors, which previously has been
reported, is ``directly contrary to previous administration
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry said Lott's announcement
``struck me a little bit like Alice in Wonderland time.'' McCurry
said the Mississippian's floor speech was ``not a serious statement
by a serious person.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as happened last year when Republicans claimed they had
evidence about foreign influence in Democratic campaigns, the GOP
Tuesday declined to make public any back-up evidence to support
both the allegations about satellite technology and foreign
campaign contributions. Republicans said they are partly bound by
security regulations to keep the information secret.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they had not been allowed to contribute to the
interim report and that no actual report was approved or written.
Instead, the report amounted to Lott's release of a seven-page
statment of what he said various Senate committees have learned so
far about the satellite and fund-raising matters.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, said the evidence regarding the satellites was
good enough to ``remove all resistance to naming an independent
counsel to investigate the evidence and the allegations.''
Republicans have previously requested that the attorney general ask
for an independent counsel to examine Democratic campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also blasted the White House for failing to cooperate with
the investigations. Unless cooperation is forthcoming, Lott said,
he will be ``forced to consider other measures,'' including a
freeze on administration nominations and the use of new subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Lott's
action was ``partisanship at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lott's statement focused on allegations that the Clinton
administration violated US policy by allowing an American company
to transfer satellite technology to China that could be used for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opened his speech by noting that when Vice President Gore
was a senator in 1989, Gore criticized the Bush administration for
allowing three US satellites to be exported to China. ``Allowing
these launches is not in the best interests of our country or of
our relationship with China,'' Gore said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said the Clinton administration has proceeded to do
just what Gore complained about a decade ago, allowing China to
launch satellites provided by Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Loral's chairman, Bernard Schwartz, is one of the biggest donors
to the Democratic Party. Republicans are investigating whether
there is a link between the campaign contributions and Clinton's
issuance of a waiver that allowed China to launch the Loral
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said an unnamed senior official of the Defense Trade and
Security Administration told a congressional committee last month
that the government has failed in its effort to control the
transfer of US technology with military implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formal process ... has failed in its stated mission, to
safeguard the national security of the United States,'' the
official said, according to Lott. However, the testimony was not
released, making it impossible to know the context of the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
international security heard testimony last week that Defense
Department monitors are not required to be present at launches of
US satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said this contradicts administration claims, although Lott
noted there is no statute requiring US monitors to be present.
Furthermore, Lott said China had derived significant benefits from
the launch of US satellites. He noted that China had five launch
failures between 1991 to 1996. But since China benefited from the
knowledge obtained during the launch of US satellites, China has
suffered no launch failures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the assertion that China received a military benefit from
US satellites, the Senate majority leader said, ``We have
established a great number of crossover benefits between a
commercial space launch program and the development of ballistic
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's sweeping charges were reminiscent of the way Senator Fred
Thompson opened his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings
last year by declaring he had proof China sought to influence
Democratic election campaigns. But Thompson failed to publicly
provide such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lott said investigators had obtained information about
the influence of China in US elections that is ``new since Senator
Thompson concluded his review.'' Lott declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said Lott was making misleading
statements about the panel's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that the committee has reached some kind of
conclusion,'' Kerrey said. ``It most assuredly has not.''

Olusegun Obasanjo, having just emerged from three years in the
prisons of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, was inclined to be
patient. Freedom was sweet ``Look at what has become of this
country,'' said Obasanjo, who ruled Africa's most populous nation
from 1976 to 1979 and gained lasting esteem through the rare act of
handing over power to a civilian government. ``We are one of the
world's biggest producers of oil, and we have no fuel. We have more

Mocha Express wins Lone Star's big award 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mocha Express seemed to be on a downhill slide when the season
at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie began two months ago. The
4-year-old racehorse had shown promise but started the year by
finishing no better than fifth in three races in Arkansas and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Tim Harder had to lower his expectations. He simply
hoped the colt would fit in alongside the stakes horses at Grand
Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   But Mocha Express not only fit in, he dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Mocha Express was named Lone Star's horse of the
meeting for the thoroughbred season that concludes Sunday. He also
was named the meet's champion older horse and would have been
champion Texas-bred, too, if that category existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe he might have been in the running for it after
his last race,'' said Harder, who trains Mocha Express for his
father, Roger, and for Don Strate, both of Spokane, Wash. ``But I
never would have figured on it at the beginning of the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express clinched the awards by stepping out of the
Texas-bred ranks and whipping unrestricted company July 4 in the
Lone Star Park Handicap. Among his victims was Anet, last year's
horse of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express also won the Assault Stakes for state-breds and a
grass allowance race and was second in the Premiere Stakes and
Crescent Stakes. He bankrolled $200,000 in purses at the meet, more
than he had accumulated in his 14 previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of six other divisional titles also were released
yesterday after voting by the media and the track's racing office
and publicity department.
</P>
<P>
   Yaqthan took honors in the turf horse category. Smolderin Heart
and Cinemine were voted the top 3-year-old and 3-year-old filly,
respectively, with Arctica an easy winner among older mares.
Spiritbound was the champion sprinter, and Vagabond Shoes was
champion claimer.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on the top 2-year-old and 2-year-old filly will be
conducted Sunday, enabling results of Saturday's Silver Spur Stakes
and Sunday's Middleground Stakes to be factored in.
</P>
<P>
   Yaqathan and Smolderin Heart each made one appearance at Lone
Star but made it count. Yaqthan came from Kentucky to win the May
25 Dallas Turf Cup, and Smolderin Heart arrived straight from
Arkansas to take the April 19 Lone Star Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Cinemine and Arctica were two-time stakes winners at the
meeting, Spiritbound won a grass sprint stakes and twice ran six
furlongs on dirt in 1:09 3-5, and Vagabond Shoes goes today for her
fourth victory of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, their seasons don't end with Lone Star's
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express is scheduled to leave on a July 23 flight to
Seattle by way of Dayton, Ohio, to compete at Washington's Emerald
Downs in the Aug. 23 Longacres Mile. That traditional event was
once the signature race of the historic Longacres track, which was
torn down several years ago to make way for a Boeing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is a big deal up there,'' Harder said. ``Down here,
they don't really have a big race that's full of tradition, because
they've only been running a couple of years. Up there, Longacres
ran for a long time, and it was a really beautiful track. The race
is a remnant of Longacres, and it's got a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea what kind of horses they'll have up
there. I would think he'll fit in pretty good with the local
horses, but they usually send two or three from California. Usually
it's a pretty tough race.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it also kind of kills two birds with one stone. The owners
want to see him run close to home, and we needed to find some kind
of race anyway. This one just fits into the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, schedules have a way of changing at a moment's notice
when horses are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Mocha Express hardly looked like a candidate for
a cross-country trip, but look at him now.
Suspension begins
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Corey Lanerie will begin tomorrow serving a seven-day
suspension for careless riding.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension imposed by Lone Star stewards stems from the
spill in Saturday's Allen Bogan Memorial. Lanerie rode Desert Air,
who drifted into the path of odds-on favorite Smiling Time on the
backstretch and caused him to clip heels and stumble, unseating
jockey Eric Perner.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air finished first, but was disqualified to third in the
four-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suspension, Lanerie could still see action at Lone
Star this weekend under the state's ``designated stakes'' rule.
Because his careless-riding suspension is less than 10 days, he
qualifies under the rule to accept mounts at Lone Star on Saturday
and Sunday, but only if he is named at time of entry to ride horses
in stakes races on those days.
</P>
<P>
   Lanerie's suspension is scheduled to run through July 22. But if
he rides Saturday and Sunday, for example, his suspension will then
be extended to July 24.
A possibility
</P>
<P>
   Arlington International owner Dick Duchossois is floating a few
trial balloons to test the legislative waters for a possible
reopening of his suburban Chicago track in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Duchossois still insists the $200 million racing palace, which
was closed this summer, needs help from the state if it is to
reopen and compete with riverboat casinos legalized in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers ignored his pleas a year ago, but Duchossois might
have a new bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   An auto racing track is being built to coexist with the horse
track at Sportsman's Park in Cicero, which absorbed Arlington's
traditional summer dates along with next-door neighbor Hawthorne
Race Course in Stickney. Because of the construction, Sportsman's
might not be ready to hold a horse meeting next year. And that
makes the return of Arlington even more vital to the Illinois
thoroughbred industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that road must first go through Duchossois, who isn't an
easy man to please.
A yen for horses
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Japan might be in the tank, but plenty of yen are
still available for a good Sunday Silence colt.
</P>
<P>
   Former American champion Sunday Silence is now the champion sire
in Japan, and at an auction there yesterday, one of his colts sold
for $1.35 million, and a filly went for $1.28 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's big money, indeed, but it still sounds more impressive to
say 190 million yen.
Calling the shots
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar has boosted the purse of its July 25 San Diego Handicap
to assure the presence of Silver Charm. It had been a $150,000
race. Now the purse will be $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   That change came a week after Monmouth Park allowed Sonny Hine,
trainer of Skip Away, to name his purse and distance for the Aug.
30 Iselin Handicap. Hine chose to double the purse to $500,000 and
increase the distance from 1 1/16 miles to 1 1/8 miles. If Hine had
asked for a head start, it might have been granted, although Skip
Away doesn't need one.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Will horse owners hire agents to negotiate with
racetracks?

POWELL RAISES CAUTION FLAG ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was a conservative Republican in a stridently
liberal gathering, a black leader who Tuesday confessed to the
national convention of the NAACP -- the nation's most enduringly
important minority organization -- that he was missing in action
for the great civil rights battles of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Colin Powell conquered.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Army general was showered with adulation by 3,500
delegates, even as he raised a caution flag on affirmative action.
Powell, striking a moderate note at a gathering in which rhetoric
has trended to the militant, said he sees a continuing need for
race-based programs, but believes such policies will never bear
fruit unless steps are taken first to buttress home life and the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice is simple: Either getting back to the task of
building all children or just keep building more jails,'' Powell
said, in a speech that had moved some in the crowd to wish he would
rethink his reluctance to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no point in creating (affirmative action)
opportunities if we bring up children who can't use the English
language. If this generation of youth don't take advantage of those
opportunities, what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's was an artful blend of support for social programs
backed by Democrats and family values ordinarily underscored by
Republicans. By turns personal and topical, it seemed to fall
somewhere between a testimonial and a campaign stump speech _ and
to judge by the three standing ovations he received, it proved
effective on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he thought America should take pride in its racial
progress, having done what ``no other country on the face of the
earth has done.'' On the other hand he made it clear he understands
the pain of racism and the need for continuing remedies to address
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need,'' he said, ``to keep affirmative action to compensate
for almost 300 years of preferences that were directed against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, speaking of his upbringing in Harlem and the South
Bronx, Powell said of himself: ``He knew he was black and he had
everything in his life to remind him of it, and to remind him of
what being black meant in America. ... He knew there were places he
couldn't go, he thought there were dreams that he dare not dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he said, ``I can't say that we have overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   He voiced regret at not having been on the front lines of the
civil rights struggle, in what he called the ``great battles of the
South.'' But he said he fully identifies with the struggle for
racial equality today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just a struggle for the NAACP or for African
Americans alone, this is a struggle for all of America to rid
ourselves of the legacy of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff now serves as
the head of America's Promise, a volunteer organization that offers
mentoring and other programs to youth. Powell linked the work it is
doing to uplift young people to the opportunities that could lie
ahead should affirmative action remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's speech, coming on the fourth-day of the NAACP
convention, which ends Thursday, gave some attendees the first real
chance to get a feel for a man who has in some measure remained a
mystery to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many black Americans have viewed Powell with a detached
skepticism since he declared himself a Republican in 1996 _ after
resisting the temptation to run for president _ because they
associate him with the party of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, North
Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and a Congress that has sought to
rollback affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I heard the man speak and saw him up close, I just
thought he was another black Republican,'' said Tempthia Battle,
president of the NAACP's South Middlesex, Mass. branch. I didn't
want any part of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, after Powell ``related his life experiences, I could relate
to him so much better. It was a powerful experience for me,''
Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Moore, a Miami airline ticket agent attending the
convention, said also had praise for Powell. ``He has not forgotten
what he stands for as an African American. He's not taken on the
total view of the Republican party; he has his own identity,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deloris Roach, an assistant coordinator of a minority program
for the Veteran's Administration in Cleveland, said she thought
Powell was ``courageous'' for admitting in front of the group that
he was AWOL during the civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But were he ever to run for president, her vote would be hard to
get. ``Even though he's black, he's still a Republican. I don't
think I'd go for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, for his part, made no suggestion at all that he was
seeking potential votes with his speech. He is, however, in the the
market for new voters _ saying that showing up on election day is
crucial to the future of minority America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote Democrat, vote Republican, split your ticket but just
vote so your voice will be heard,'' he said.

A FORMER PRESIDENT, OUT OF JAIL, SURVEYS NIGERIA'S CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ In the so-called presidential wing of Nigeria's
international airport, a former president recently released from
jail lay slumped on Tuesday awaiting a flight delayed because there
was no jet fuel to propel the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, having just
emerged from three years in the prisons of the late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha, was inclined to be patient as he prepared for a trip
outside the country. Freedom was sweet, Abacha dead, and the
air-conditioned waiting-room comfortable. Then there was a power
cut, the lights went out and the cool air gave way to the heavy
heat of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what has become of this country,'' said Obasanjo, who
ruled Africa's most populous nation from 1976 to 1979 and gained
lasting esteem through the rare act of handing over power to a
civilian government. ``We are one of the world's biggest producers
of oil, and we have no fuel. We have more power stations than we
need, and no electricity. Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, like its former president did for several hours on
Tuesday, waits, in the dark, for some deliverance. The death last
month of Abacha ended a nightmare. The death this month of the
leading opposition figure, Moshood K.O. Abiola, shattered a dream.
In the resulting void, rioting has now given way to an almost
surreal chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of cars waiting for gas, often long, have grown and now
stretch for several miles. Rumors swirl as to when Abacha's
successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, will announce the program for
a transition to democracy that he has promised. Opposition groups
spend countless words on plan after fanciful plan for democratic
reform. Abiola's many wives have begun to bicker over his large
estate. Nigeria, where one in six Africans lives, lurches.
</P>
<P>
   In this disorder, Obasanjo, aged 63 and retired, is widely
viewed as one bulwark, an elder statesman for a disoriented nation,
although he said he had no immediate political ambitions. The
general was arrested in 1995 along with several other people on
charges of complicity in a coup plot and remained in jail until
June 16, eight says after his nemesis, Abacha, died.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested with him were Gen. Shehu Yaradua, a former
chief of staff who, like many other political prisoners, died last
year in jail under suspicious circumstances. Officially, ``cardiac
arrest'' killed him. The alleged instigator of the coup plot, Col.
Lawan Gwadabe, remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha was more than evil, more than sadistic, he was actually
mad,'' Obasanjo said. ``Look at what he did to the nation's oil
industry. He closed down our four refineries so that Nigeria would
have to import refined fuel and he could make a fortune on those
import deals. As a result we are paralyzed because we have no
fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry officials here confirmed that Abacha had allowed
the refineries _ two in Port Harcourt, one in Owerri and one in
Kaduna _ to fall into such disrepair as to be unusable.
</P>
<P>
   He then organized the import of gasoline through his own agents,
charging hugely inflated prices for the fuel in Nigeria on which he
and his family took large commissions. The cost to this country of
105 million people was enormous: not only was it no longer
producing its own gasoline, it was paying inflated prices to buy it
and seeing the money disappear into Abacha's personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first acts of Abubakar, the new military ruler, was
to replace Abacha's shadowy import agents with several major oil
companies, including Mobil, Shell and Elf, the officials said. ``As
a result,'' said one official, ``the price has now fallen from $40
a ton to $10.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears that the gasoline has not yet made it to the
pumps, or is being hoarded there out of the fears of arson or
ransacking that accompanied the riots after Abiola's death. Just
when the hoarding will ease remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the date _ almost certainly this week _ when
Abubakar will announce his plan for a democratic transition. Since
his release, Obasanjo has met several times with the new ruler and
said he believed that Abubakar genuinely wanted to return the armed
forces to the barracks as soon as possible. They have ruled Nigeria
for 28 of its 38 years of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe General Abubakar understands that an entirely new
democratic structure for the nation must be created, and that he
cannot wait a day beyond Jan. 1, 1999, to hand over power to a
civilian president,'' Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
   He was, however, critical of calls from several opposition
groups for power to be handed over by Oct. 1 to a civilian
government of national unity that would revise the constitution,
establish a new federal structure for Nigeria, oversee the creation
of new political parties and organize elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Oct. 1 may be a little over-hasty,'' Obasanjo said.
``And, if we can go to democracy in one step, why take two steps?''
But he added that the armed forces ``must convince people _ really
convince them _ that this time nobody will put his dirty finger in
the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1993 elections, which Abiola appeared to have won, the
armed forces annulled the vote. The effect on Nigeria has been
crippling.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha proved to be a ruinous leader. And because the annulment
convinced many people that a man from the southern Yoruba tribe
like Abiola will never be allowed to rule, it exacerbated ethnic
tensions. The army's upper ranks are dominated by men from the
northern Hausa and Fulani tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great pity that, at every crisis, big or small, people
talk of Nigeria breaking up,'' Obasanjo said. ``The enormous
challenge facing us now is to get beyond these mutual suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   At last, the general's flight was called. He was on his way to
Botswana and then South Africa, where he has been invited to be
with an old friend, Nelson Mandela, on his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' Obasanjo said, ``I can be a stabilizing influence,
a conscience for our nation.'' But as the plane taxied away, the
lights were still out in Lagos and stability scarcely imaginable.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas whether he is
running for president and he insists that, really and truly, he has
not made up his mind. But in the next breath _ in fact in the
course of the next 90 minutes _ he puts forth 10 reasons why he
would make the best Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   After months of protestations that he was focused on winning
re-election in November, Bush came the closest he has come thus far
to making a case for his candidacy for the Republican nomination.
Sitting behind the massive walnut desk in his office in the State
Capitol that was once used by his father the president, Bush
sounded more determined than coy in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed eager to send out the signal that he is no Colin
Powell, making clear that he is more than just dreaming about the
White House. But not wanting to jump too far ahead of himself _ or
of his re-election campaign _ Bush laced his conversation with
disclaimers. But they seemed to have a ritualistic ring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strong hints about a candidacy were particularly striking
because ever since his awkward appearance at a cattle show of
Republican hopefuls in Indianapolis last summer, he has been
careful to stay close to home and not play national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at times sounded as if a bid for the White House were a
foregone conclusion, referring at one point to his fellow
Republicans as ``some of the other candidates.'' At another point,
he said, ``All of us have strengths and all of us have weaknesses.
Republican primary voters are going to have to look at the field
and say, `Who do they want to lead?'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview on Monday, Bush, 51, offered signals of
encouragement for those who want him to run.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had a vision for the nation, that he was a
master of the retail politics that are crucial in early primary
states, that he had learned the rigors (he called it ``the
ugliness'') of national campaigns from his father, that he could
unify Republicans, that he had proven appeal to Democrats, that a
governor would make the best president, that he was ``a hard
charger'' who would not shrink from a barrage of attack
advertisements, and that he had a record running ``the
second-largest state in the union'' that could sell nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush said he was worried about the impact of a
presidential run on his 16-year-old twin daughters, who have
``expressed some concern'' about his possible candidacy, he said
``it has given me some comfort'' that the news media had left
Chelsea Clinton alone. The effect on his daughters, he said, is
``not the overriding issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that his wife, Laura, ``was the last person on board''
when he sought the governorship four years ago but that she felt
differently about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she has seen that she can be a great first lady of
Texas,'' he said, ``I think she now knows she can be a great first
lady of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's deliberations, and unmistakable hints, are no
small matter as the presidential field begins to take shape for
what could be an intensely competitive battle for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a red-hot commodity in Republican politics that
would-be advisers are already practically shuttling here to offer
their services. Some Republicans are conceding him the nomination
and focus on polls that even pollsters acknowledge are wildly
premature but that show Bush edging out Vice President Al Gore for
the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed, I really am,'' Bush said of the polls. ``I'm
honored, of course. But I'm more startled.'' Dismissing those who
argue that his commanding poll numbers may stem from confusion
between Bush and his father, the governor could not resist a jab at
the vice president, saying, ``Either that _ or it's a pretty strong
reflection on Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his father rarely tried to offer advice but was
``living vicariously through all this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite surveys in Texas that show him holding steady at about
70 percent against his Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, Bush
insisted that he was taking his re-election drive seriously. His
advisers said a huge win in such an important state would
underscore his national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times in the interview, Bush's mind sometimes veered far
beyond the borders of this state, which is sweltering under record
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he felt ``the temptations'' of national
office. And he sounded primed for electoral warfare when he
insisted that he would never shrink from the inevitable blitz of
scathing attack commercials from Steve Forbes, who pumped millions
from his fortune into his race in 1996 and plans to run again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to trouble me,'' the governor said. ``It's
not a reason not to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said politicians did not always have the luxury of choosing
their own timetable for seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how life works,'' he said. ``There are windows of
opportunities that come and go. I believe that history has got a
unique way of offering people opportunity, and often times those of
us in the political process really can't affect timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting his upset victory over Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, Bush
said, ``There's a certain amount of gumption that one must have in
order to seize the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   While his father was known as president to struggle with ``the
vision thing,'' Bush said he was sure that he would know how to
lead the nation _ though his concept of a national vision seemed a
bit unformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons to do it are reasons you've heard me talk about
some,'' he said. ``Ushering in the responsibility era. Or the best
education system in the country. And, of course, other national
issues I would be confronted with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a candidate for president should ``have a reason to
run _ a compelling reason _ and to stand in front of America and
say, `If you elect me, here's the vision, here's where I'd like to
lead.''' Asked whether he had that vision, he replied, ``Well,
yeah. I think I've got a pretty clear view of where a better
tomorrow is for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing endorsements from many Democratic officer holders in
Texas and his strong inroads in Hispanic areas that have long been
Democratic strongholds, Bush suggested that his leadership could be
applied on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to unify,'' he said. ``I don't believe you can lead
a divided nation. It's important to nominate someone who can unite
_ and someone who can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans argue that Bush's calls for uniting
conservatives and moderates make him insufficiently conservative to
win the party's nomination. Unlike other prospective candidates,
Bush, who opposes abortion, refused to rule out the possibility
that he would support an abortion rights candidate on a Republican
ticket, saying, ``Those are all questions that have to be answered
given the context of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and others in the party who have recently decried
homosexuality as a sin, Bush sidestepped the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sinners,'' he said. ``I don't believe I should use
my position to make any kind of determination as to who goes to
heaven and who goes to hell.'' Bush said the attacks on
homosexuality could backfire on Republicans. ``If it's a concerted
effort to divide, I think it's going to affect the outcome of
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush did not mention that ``retail politics'' are
important in states with early contests like Iowa and New
Hampshire, where several of his potential rivals have already spent
months hunting for support, he left no doubt that he was capable of
winning over voters one on one.
</P>
<P>
   He made sure to point out his talent for connecting with voters
_ reminding a reporter how he plunged into a crowd of well-wishers
at a recent event in the town of San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw it was not the old rope line,'' he said. ``It was the
ultimate immersion. And I spent a lot of time there. There's still
retail politics in a state like Texas. I like people. I enjoy it.
I'm a hugger and a shaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made the case for the election of a governor as
president. ``Governors make good candidates and good presidents
because they've been chief executive officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not about to invite competition, Bush demurred when asked
which other governor would make a good president. ``Just about any
of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his reasons for a Bush candidacy, the governor
warned that such talk was horribly premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind one way or another whether I will
run for president,'' he said. ``I know that's hard for you to
accept. I hope you do accept it. Because it's the truth.'' &QL;

<P>
   In October, when shares of Ascend Communications had fallen
below $36 from a high of $80.25 just 90 days earlier, the board
quietly gave employees a sizable gift, slashing prices on tens of
millions of stock options they held.
</P>
<P>
   A month later after the stock had fallen below $23, Ascend, a
telecommunications network equipment maker in Alameda, Calif., did
it again, although this may come as news to shareholders. It was
only disclosed six months later, in the 12th footnote to a series
of financial tables the company filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   These maneuvers shifted about $1 billion in equity from
investors to employees, who on average ended up more than $600,000
richer, the Wisconsin Investment Board estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is not alone. This type of tinkering with what was
supposed to be a reward for a job well done is on the rise _ and is
causing growing controversy. Research by academics and compensation
consultants now shows that it is much more common than even the
critics had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly over the last decade, stock options have become an
essential part of a corporate pay package. Now, at a growing number
of companies, particularly in technology, they are moving beyond
the executive suite _ often to everyone down to the janitor.
</P>
<P>
   Giving employees the right to buy their employer's stock for a
set price, no matter how high the stock rises, is supposed to give
workers a powerful incentive to pull together to lift a company's
fortunes _ and thus the return to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   And as the stock market has soared, options have indeed showered
wealth on countless people _ even if their employers' stock has
been propelled as much by Wall Street euphoria as by their own hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   But what of companies that stumble, even in boom times? Say an
employee is given the right to buy a company's stock for $20 a
share _ and counts on a nice windfall from those options as part of
total pay. If the stock slumps to $15, and stays there, the option
is worthless.
</P>
<P>
   One solution that is growing in popularity: simply ``reprice''
the option. If that ``strike price'' drops from $20 to $10, the
employee is suddenly in the money again at $15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Like all options, though, that money dilutes the stake of
outside investors, and the biggest of them _ institutional
investors like pension funds _ are not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, many companies _ especially high-technology
concerns _ say they will lose talented people if they cannot dangle
potentially lucrative options in front of them. ``The only good
argument I have heard for repricing is to address a potential
turnover,'' said Yale Tauber, a compensation expert at William H.
Mercer, pay consultants. ``The currency they deal in, especially in
Silicon Valley, is options.''
</P>
<P>
   If they lose key employees just as they are preparing to bring a
new product or service to market, companies insist, it can spell
ruin for investors, while keeping those people brings the prospect
of more revenues and higher share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, other experts defend stock options as an appropriate
reward for employees who commit their time and careers to a
company, while investors can far more easily move their money
elsewhere if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that higher share prices do not necessarily
follow when the options bar is lowered. ``After option repricings,
share prices move in a random walk,'' said David Yermack, associate
professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   And new data show that once companies reprice options, there is
a good chance they will do it again, becoming serial repricers.
</P>
<P>
   As for large companies, like those making up the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, perhaps one a year reprices executive
options. But at midsize companies, slightly more than 1.2 percent
of options held by executives are repriced each year, Yermack found
in his latest study.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing, he found, is even more common among smaller
companies, with 2 percent of executives' options repriced annually
from 1992 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yermack said that before starting his research, ``I thought that
the rate of repricing was close to zero and a few anecdotal
examples just made for inflammatory news stories. I thought that
because most of my work was with Fortune 500 and S&AMP;P 500 firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But working with data from smaller companies, you find much
higher rates of repricing,'' he said, ``much higher than my
colleagues and I would have expected, especially with the bull
market.''
</P>
<P>
   He also found that when options are repriced, the period to
exercise them is often extended. If, for example, a 10-year option
with three years left to run is both repriced and extended for 10
years, it becomes, in effect, a deeply discounted 17-year option.
</P>
<P>
   Yermack's findings understate the situation because he limited
his research to executives. Companies like Ascend, which repriced
options for everyone except officers named in proxy statements,
were excluded from his study.
</P>
<P>
   SEC rules require detailed disclosure in proxy statements, which
are mailed to all shareholders, when a repricing occurs on options
granted to the chief executive and other named executives.
</P>
<P>
   But if the executives are excluded, these rules do not apply,
even though the cost to outside shareholders may be much greater.
At Ascend, for example, the rank and file combined held eight times
as many options as the combined holdings of Mory Ejabat, the chief
executive, and the other four named executives.
</P>
<P>
   While the five executives did not have their options repriced,
they were granted 712,000 new options, all at prices below the
lowest repriced options for other employees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other research shows that companies like Ascend, which repriced
options twice last year, have a good chance of doing it again.
Mercer found 50 companies that repriced options at least twice in
the last decade. Of these, 16 repriced options three or more times.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay Health Care of Coral Gables, Fla., repriced options five
times from 1991 to 1995, Mercer's research showed, from a peak of
$14.13 to a low of $2.50. The stock now trades at $2.25.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Diaz, a Ramsay spokeswoman, said that the five repricings
were under previous management but that the new management believes
repricing ``can be a tool when trying to correct or bring
fair-market value to pricing'' so options remain an incentive for
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, a noted critic of high pay for executives, said
companies may feel they have no choice but to reprice options when
recruiters tell their most valuable workers, ``Join our company,
and you can have options at street level, not five sub-basements
beneath the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Since companies that reprice are already in trouble, it should
be no surprise that some continue to be in trouble and their stocks
keep sinking, said Donald Chance, a finance professor at Virginia
Tech who has also studied option repricings.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Cypress Semiconductor shares improved after it
repriced options in 1990 and 1992, but in 1996 share prices fell.
Despite two more repricings, they have not recovered. Flagstar, the
restaurant operator controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.,
slid into bankruptcy despite three option repricings between 1992
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of stock prices of high-technology companies can
also lead to manipulation, Chance said. And the result, he added,
``is a lot of money to the executives, but not much to
shareholders, overall.''
</P>
<P>
   No academic research has been published on the impact of
repricing broadly based options, like the Ascend repricing.
Studying such repricings would be difficult because SEC rules do
not require much disclosure, as long as the executives named in
proxy statements are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Ascend repricings were disclosed in May, deep in its annual
10-K filing with the SEC, a dense document that few shareholders or
even professional investment advisers plow through.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote did not give a reason for the repricings, their
costs or any potential benefits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend repeatedly refused to talk about it. ``We regard this as
a private matter,'' said Eric Warren, a spokesman for the company,
whose shares trade on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the footnote is written, it is not even clear
how many Ascend shares were repriced or whether both repricings
affected all employees or whether the separate actions were aimed
at different groups of options holders.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that 35 million options were canceled, but several
executive-compensation experts said they could not calculate
precisely how many were repriced, because of the way the company
presented the data.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the company said the options were repriced
to keep engineers and salespeople from bolting to rivals like Cisco
Systems, 3-Com and Bay Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Other footnotes in its reports suggest how eager Ascend is to
hold onto employees, if only for an extra few weeks. While options
typically vest over a period of years _ 20 percent a year, perhaps,
for five years _ the Ascend options vest over four years, at the
rate of one-forty-eighth a month.
</P>
<P>
   The limited information in the footnote suggests that the
company used the repricing to sweeten its stock-option offerings
even more than just lowering the price would have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Some options were issued at $113.04 each, the footnote states,
well above the $80.25 a share at which Ascend shares peaked a year
ago. This suggests that some options were issued at premium prices,
as much as 41 percent above the top market price.
</P>
<P>
   Most options are priced at the trading price on the day they are
awarded and run for five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes options are priced at a premium to the market so that
share prices must rise before any money can be made on them. A
growing number of big institutional shareholders favor premium
pricing because it ensures that investors make some money before
employees and executives do.

CLINTON PROPOSES LIMITING LIABILITY FOR YEAR 2000 COMPUTER
SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing the potential computer crisis in 2000
for the first time, President Clinton said on Tuesday that he would
propose legislation to limit the liability of companies that share
data about solutions if the information proves faulty.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States would contribute $12 million to a
World Bank program to help developing nations deal with the
potential computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech before the National Academy of Sciences,
warned of ``gaping holes'' in efforts by government and private
industry to prepare their computer systems for the end of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the nation's computers into compliance is one of the
greatest technological challenges in history, the president said.
Failure, he added, will result in ``a series of shutdowns,
inaccurate data, faulty calculations'' that could affect government
functions from the payment of Medicare claims to control of the
nation's air traffic system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was a ``pressing need for action'' at all
levels of government and in the private sector to deal with the
so-called millennium bug, which prevents computers from recognizing
the beginning of a new century. Most older computers are programmed
with two digits for the year in the date field and will not
automatically recognize ``00'' as 2000. They may think it is 1900,
with potentially catastrophic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The current official estimate of the cost of bringing the
federal government's computers into compliance is $6 billion, but
most experts consider that figure far too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems unbelievable, but it's only 535 days from now, at the
stroke of midnight, when we will usher in a new year, a new
century, a new millennium,'' the president said. ``It is fitting,
if more than a little ironic, that this same stroke of midnight
will pose a sharp and signal test of whether we have prepared
ourselves for the challenges of the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Good Samaritan'' legislation Clinton said he would submit
to Congress is intended to deal with the fear of many companies
that they will face expensive lawsuits if they provide information
about their computers' year 2000 compliance that proves wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is still circulating in draft form, would not
relieve companies of liability for failures of hardware or software
intended to address year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is a burgeoning legal specialty of year 2000
liability litigation that is discouraging companies from freely
sharing data, according to Michael Aisenberg, a Washington lawyer
working with the administration on the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of litigation is already putting a chill on
technology initiators, who are worried they'll be sued if their
year 2000 disclosures turn out to be wrong or don't work,''
Aisenberg said. He said that granting liability relief for
well-intentioned data sharing has bipartisan support on Capitol
Hill, but could face stiff opposition from the product liability
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the potential legal costs arising from year 2000
problems range as high as $1 trillion, Aisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other administration officials expressed optimism
that the United States can bring its ``mission critical'' computer
systems into compliance before the ball drops in Times Square next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made it clear to every member of my Cabinet that the
American people have a right to expect uninterrupted service from
government, and I expect them to deliver,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has a markedly more pessimistic view of the federal
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As of last month, only about 40 percent of the 7,336
most-critical government computer systems were prepared for
December 31, 1999, according to the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless progress improves dramatically,'' the agency declared
in a report issued June 10, ``a substantial number of
mission-critical systems will not be year 2000 compliant in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., has studied the problem for the
past several years and gives the federal government a failing grade
for its progress so far.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that he has been pressing Clinton to
personally address the millennium bug as a means of concentrating
the minds of federal bureaucrats. ``I think this is a major step
here,'' Horn said. ``The denial is over. They hadn't done anything
up to now to share with the American people what this problem is
all about. Now they have to keep at it and not assume the nation
heard it because he gave one speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Some federal agencies are better prepared for next year's turn
of the calendar than others, administration and congressional
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those relatively well along in their efforts are the
Social Security Administration, the Veterans' Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But other agencies are ``substantially challenged,'' according
to John Koskinen, the administration's year 2000 czar.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the Departments of Defense, Health and Human
Services, Education, Transportation, Energy, Education and the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said that the United States is further along than 90
percent of nations and that many countries have failed to take even
preliminary steps toward compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great risks internationally,'' he said. If the
Singapore stock exchange fails to open on Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, for
example, the repercussions will be felt throughout the global
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' Koskinen said, ``what the end of next year
will look like.''

   When Charles Lazarus launched Toys ``R'' Us Inc. in 1948, most
toys were sold in mom-and-pop stores crammed with yo-yos and
Lincoln Logs. No one had ever heard of a ``supermarket for toys,''
Lazarus' concept for so-called big-box toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, the Toys ``R'' Us chain, based in Paramus, N.J.,
dominated the toy landscape. It bought toys by the boat load, and
unable to match Toys ``R'' Us on price, many small toy chains and
independently owned stores went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But retail abhors a vacuum, and in the 1990s, giant discounters
and warehouse clubs began expanding their toy departments to fill
the void left by failed mom-and-pops.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a company that had become the country's largest toy
retailer by underselling its smaller competitors, now finds itself
up against some of the largest and shrewdest retailers in the
world, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target, which have been
eating away at the dominant market share Toys ``R'' Us has long
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to get back into Wall Street's good graces, Toys ``R''
Us is now attempting to reinvent itself by branching out beyond Ken
and Barbie dolls.
</P>
<P>
   As it struggles to become more profitable, the company is
seeking to do for baby products what it started out doing for toys.
In a new chain called Babies ``R'' Us, the company is gambling part
of its future on big-box stores that aim to provide one-stop
shopping for parents of infants and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies ``R'' Us is an integral part of our long-term
strategy,'' said Robert C. Nakasone, who recently took over as
chief executive of Toys ``R'' Us Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical Toys ``R'' Us store, the shelves are piled high
with G.I. Joes, Monopoly games, and Sing &AMP; Snore Ernies.
</P>
<P>
   In a Babies ``R'' Us, shoppers find a similar variety of cribs,
high chairs, rocking-chairs, and breast pumps for new mothers. Need
diapers? Or pajamas for a preemie (an infant who weighs less than
six pounds)? Babies ``R'' Us has these items too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 80 kinds of strollers,'' said vice president David
Schoenbeck, who attended last week's opening of a Babies ``R'' Us
in Peabody, Mass., the 100th store in the chain and the second in
Massachusetts. The other store opened last year in Braintree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to buy a gift for a baby shower, this is the place
to go,'' Schoenbeck says.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that there's another baby boom that Toys ``R'' Us is
trying to exploit _ the US birth rate is roughly flat _ it's just
that competition isn't as intense in the baby products category as
it is in the toy business, Wall Street analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   While many retailers sell cribs, strollers, and clothing for
infants, no one seems to offer the breadth of selection that Babies
``R'' Us does in one superstore format, said retail analyst Walter
F. Loeb of Loeb Associates, who added, ``Babies ``R'' Us has a
``niche to themselves for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chain has its roots in an acquisition that Toys ``R'' Us
made last year. After it bought a 77-store operation called Baby
Superstore for $376 million, the chain's name was changed to Babies
``R'' Us. Plans call for the chain to grow by about 20 new stores
annually for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, Toys ``R'' Us used the promise of free
diapers and baby formula to lure customers into its toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Babies ``R'' Us, the company has the opportunity to
hold onto parents as customers from the first trimester of mother's
pregnancy until her youngest child turns 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, parents will buy many of the things they need
for their infants and toddlers at Babies ``R'' Us. When a child
turns three, he or she is a ready-made customer for Kids ``R'' Us,
the company's chain of 218 clothing stores, and Toys ``R'' Us, its
worldwide chain of about 1,100 toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby ``R'' Us is our handshake with the customer, our
springboard to get them into Toys ``R'' Us and Kids ``R'' Us when
their children get older,'' Nakasone said.
</P>
<P>
   Although its balance sheet remains strong _ profits jumped from
$427 million to $490 million for its most recent fiscal year, a
company with just over $11 billion in annual sales could certainly
use a springboard.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the same month that a research firm called the NPD Group
reported that Toys ``R'' Us had lost some of its US toy marketshare
to Wal-Mart and Target, the company said that its first quarter
earnings had fallen 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And since the beginning of the year, Toys ``R'' Us has watched
the price of its stock shares fall from about 30 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday shares were up 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange to
close at 23.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Toys ``R'' Us has taken a number of steps to preserve
its pre-eminence. Since becoming chief executive, Nakasone has
hired several new managers, and Toys ``R'' Us recently launched a
web site to sell toys over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it revamped its inventory practices, a move
that resulted in its placing smaller orders with toy makers such as
Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mattel and Hasbro cited those smaller orders as a reason
for lower-than-expected quarterly earnings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such changes will allow Toys ``R'' Us to compete more
effectively against the likes of Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us remains a formidable competitor _ too formidable
for some. According to the the Federal Trade Commission, Toys ``R''
Us has unfairly pressured toy makers to keep their most popular
toys out of the stores of rival retailers looking to grab a bigger
piece of the toy business.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC won an early round of that legal battle. Toys ``R'' Us,
which denies the FTC's charges, has appealed the decision. A ruling
on the appeal could come any day.
</P>
<P>
   As Toys ``R'' Us looks ahead, it has concluded that its old
formula for success needs to be fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current vision of the company as the `pre-eminent
worldwide retailer of toys and juvenile products' is quite narrow
and no longer consistent with how our business is evolving,''
Nakasone wrote in the company's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone sees Babies ``R'' Us as a part of this evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for the new chain to give an immediate boost to
company earnings, said analyst Sally H. Wallick of Legg Mason Wood
Walker. Because Babies ``R'' Us represent only about 7 percent of
the company's total of nearly 1,500 stores, the company will
continue to depend on toy sales in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, however, Nakasone believes that Babies ``R''
Us will be an important part of a strategy to reposition Toys ``R''
Us Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the worldwide authority on kids, family, and
fun,'' he said.

GM SUES TO HALT UAW STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising the stakes in the bitter six-week strike that has
crippled General Motors production nationwide, the company filed
suit Tuesday against the United Auto Workers union, asking a
federal judge to declare the walkout illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in US District Court in Detroit is a sign that
GM is desperate to end the strike, which has paralyzed 26 of 29
assembly plants and cost millions more than the company had
expected, analysts said. Second-quarter earnings released Tuesday
painted a dark picture for GM, whose profits and cash reserves
plummetted, largely because of losses sustained during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   But determined not to give in to the union, GM is escalating the
fight rather than backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing hard ball. It's bare knuckles now,'' said John
Stamm, a labor relations expert at Babson College. ``What it really
shows is that the company wants this strike to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks an injunction ordering striking autoworkers at
two key parts plants in Flint, Mich., back to work. It also asks
for unspecified punitive damages against the UAW for violating
terms of a 1996 agreement with GM laying out conditions under which
the union could legally declare a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Since Flint workers walked out in early June, citing ``health
and safety'' issues, it has been an open secret that the strike is
really about larger issues, namely GM's drive to cut costs by
speeding up production, slashing jobs and replacing expensive
American plants with cheaper ones in countries like Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike is not about health and safety, it's about where
GM puts its investment,'' Stamm said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to terms of the 1996 agreement, the union is
prohibited from striking over such matters as plant location.
Observers said that workers in Flint walked out under the guise of
health and safety problems, halting supplies to other assembly
plants and bringing GM's North American production to its knees. So
far, GM says it has canceled production on more than 227,000
vehicles and been forced to lay off 161,000 workers. The total cost
to GM now exceeds $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding was evident Tuesday in GM's quarterly earnings
report, which showed second-period profits fell to $433 million, or
59 cents a diluted share. By contrast, earning were $1.58 billion,
or $2.14 a share, for the same period in 1997. &UR;  &LR; Cash reserves fell
to $9.1 billion from $13.6 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While earnings were slightly better than expected, prompting
GM's shares to rise 1 1/2 Tuesday to 70 3/8, analysts said the
strike's effect on GM's cash reserves is higher than anticipated,
possibly prompting the company's decision to file the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're now in a pretty weak cash position,'' said Nicholas,
Lobacarro, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's filing comes after marathon talks over the weekend
failed to produce a resolution, something GM management said it
badly wanted. By Monday, GM vice president Donald Hackworth said
``it is very difficult to see how all this will be brought to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   In a taped message on the status of talks, signs of conciliation
_ such as an earlier vow not cut medical benefits to striking
workers _ had disappeared. ``We will continue to pursue all options
to put an end to this strike and all other potential strikes,''
Hackworth said in the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long-term viability is on the line. ... For that very
reason, we must take a firm stand today.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harder line, however, the lawsuit may not gain much
ground for the company, Babson College's Stamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court is going to kick it right back to them and
say fight it out yourselves,'' he said.

TURMOIL IN ELECTRIC POWER TRADING SHOWS DEREGULATION'S
UNCERTAINTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Ky., Kan., Texas, Ohio)   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Paul McCoy watched a monitor displaying wholesale electricity
prices, he could not believe his eyes. Hour after hour, McCoy, a
senior vice president at Commonwealth Edison Co., the utility that
serves Chicago, saw prices surging to levels never seen before,
peaking at about 100 times normal.
</P>
<P>
   He faced a stark choice: Either black out areas of Chicago to
conserve power during a severe heat wave, just as storms had
knocked out some plants and key transmission lines in the Midwest,
or buy extra power at sky-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   He kept buying, in a single hour on June 25 spending about $4
million for power that would normally cost about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not much of a choice,'' he said in an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented price surge, which lasted two days, made it
clear that the volatile new market ushered in by utility
deregulation could bring some nasty surprises.
</P>
<P>
   For McCoy was far from alone, as many Midwest utilities were
caught in the same squeeze. Still other utilities, though, found
themselves with surplus power and sold it at huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   Enron, the nation's biggest trader of electricity, capitalized
on the shortages by selling large amounts of power to utilities at
high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Capital &AMP; Trade Resources, the trading subsidiary,
reported a doubling of revenue in the second quarter, to $5.86
billion, and an 85 percent rise in income, to $241 million.
</P>
<P>
   Enron president Jeffrey Skilling said the company had strict
credit rules for the companies it trades with. ``We had no
transactions at risk with any of the marketers who have gone broke
or not performed on their contracts,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   This was all a marked contrast with the old days, when utilities
sold power to one another at reasonable prices during emergencies,
and it provides a vivid glimpse of the challenges facing this
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day price run-up also left a legacy of concerns about
the reliability of the wholesale markets. Since the events of last
month, the trading of power on Midwest markets has fallen
considerably, as utilities and others take more care in checking
the reliability and credit of power marketers.
</P>
<P>
   There have even been calls for investigations. And one utility
has called for price caps during emergencies, which existed in the
days of strict regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Some big industrial customers who had their power interrupted
have raised the issue of whether some utilities and marketers held
back power deliberately to make prices soar.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil has also added to the uncertainty of owning utility
stocks. A number of utilities, including First Energy of Akron,
Ohio, and Illinova of Decatur, Ill., said the added costs would
depress their earnings. In most cases, they cannot pass them on to
consumers, as they could under deregulation. Illinova even said
last week that it might have to cut its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make it more risky for investors,'' said Barry
Abramson, a utility analyst for Paine Webber, ``especially for the
utilities that are short on capacity going into seasons of extreme
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Since electricity cannot be stored, peak demand must often be
met by getting surplus power from other regions. And the place
utilities must turn to to get extra power, the wholesale market,
has changed greatly since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which
oversees the industry, ordered utilities to open up their
transmission lines to competitors. Since then, hundreds of
companies that generate no electricity of their own have entered
the fray, and the trading in contracts has grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   During those two days in June, though, two companies did not
deliver the power they had contracted for. This failure, coming at
a critical time, added to the uncertainty and, some experts say,
was one of the main reasons prices surged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities were forced to scramble to cover those contracts,''
said Kenneth Gustafson, a vice president of Bankers Trust Corp. who
advises utilities on risk management and energy markets. ``That was
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry executives and experts stressed, however, that
even though prices surged, in the end the system worked. Enough
power became available on the wholesale market to enable all the
utilities to avoid blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   But they added that because new capacity has not been built to
keep up with demand in areas like the Midwest and the Northeast,
future peaks in demand could strain the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives and analysts described the problems in
June as the growing pains of an industry adjusting to deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Strobel, vice president and general counsel of Unicom
Corp., the holding company for Commonwealth Edison, said the
utility's problems were ``a natural outgrowth of a developing
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to expect that on a rough-and-tumble day like June
25, you're going to have some marketers that will fail,'' she said.
``They were not ready to play in that kind of market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of Las Vegas in this new world,'' she
added. ``When you sit down and make a bet, you don't get to change
your cards. You have to be more careful and sophisticated than
utilities have been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hanson, a manager at Metzler &AMP; Associates, a consulting
firm based in Deerfield, Ill., who has watched how deregulation has
affected utilities, said: ``It was a brotherhood of monopolies;
your neighbor really wasn't a threat to you.''

EFFORT TO REVERSE GAY DISCRIMINATION ORDER PUTS HOUSE REPUBLICANS
IN A QUANDARY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort that put them in an embarrassing
predicament, several House Republicans have been lobbying to
reverse President Clinton's order barring discrimination against
gays in the federal work force.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and three other
Republicans sent a letter to their colleagues before the July 4
recess asking for support to overturn the executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we are moving in this country toward a time when there
will be no need to grant special rights and privileges to any group
over any other,'' the June 24 letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   However, the quandary facing the lawmakers was they had hoped to
attach their amendment to an appropriations bill sponsored by the
only openly gay Republican in Congress, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe is chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee on
Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, which oversees
spending for the enforcement of the anti-discrimination order.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would bar the use of funds to implement or enforce
the order on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The key sponsor of the measure, Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Col., said
that he didn't think about Kolbe's sexual orientation when he
drafted the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think of Kolbe being a gay Republican congressman. I
just think of him being a Republican congressman,'' said Hefley.
``It makes it a little uncomfortable because I would not do
anything to embarrass Kolbe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said he intended to offer the amendment when the
appropriations bill is debated, which could be as soon as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, late Tuesday DeLay's office said GOP leaders had
decided to ask House members to agree to rules of debate that will
not allow the sexual orientation amendment to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   A DeLay aide said the congressman had not intended the amendment
as a slap at Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously nothing personal involved, just differing
philosophies,'' said staffer Tony Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said earlier that it
had not been decided whether to allow the amendment to be
considered. However, the Texas Republican also said he agreed with
its intent.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said that homosexuality is a ``behavior phenomenon as
opposed to religious and ethnic backgrounds'' and therefore should
not be included anti-discrimination order.
</P>
<P>
   If the amendment is considered, Kolbe will oppose it, according
to his chief of staff, Frances McNaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will argue against it and vote against it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Houston chapter of a gay Republican group said
efforts by DeLay and others to make gay discrimination an
election-year issue will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is turning off mainstream Republicans,'' said Dale
Carpenter of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``We do not send
congressmen to Washington to act as religious leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Clinton's executive order comes as conservative
Republicans have escalated their attacks on homosexuals in the
hopes of placating Christian conservatives before the midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has refused
to schedule a vote on James Hormel, Clinton's openly gay nominee to
be ambassador to Luxembourg. Lott also recently called
homosexuality a ``sin'' and likened gays to kleptomaniacs and sex
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Christian conservative groups have stepped up their
lobbying and this week launched a media campaign, taking out ads in
several national newspapers defending Lott and others who have been
criticized for their comments on gays.
</P>
<P>
   One of those ads featured Ann Paulk, a 35-year old former
lesbian who related how she turned straight because of her
Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know people have come out of homosexuality.
The once gay always gay slogan doesn't fit,'' Paulk said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Paulk married six years ago and lives in Colorado Springs.
Colo., where her husband works for Focus on the Family, a
conservative Christian group headed by the Rev. James Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson recently met with DeLay to express concern that the
Congressional Republicans were not pushing the agenda of
conservative Christians who have been one of the most reliable
parts of the GOP base.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time DeLay and others have stepped on their efforts
on a variety of issues, including school prayer and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry declined to cricitize the
anti-gay ads saying, ``those are statements of faith and of strong
belief made by the individuals who signed the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said that administration is more concerned about
``efforts on Capitol Hill to really legislate an acceptance of
intolerance and discrimination against gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the Christian groups, the Human Rights Campaign, a
gay rights group, announced plans to take out a full page ad in USA
Today on Wednesday that features a Republican family from
Minneapolis whose daughter is a lesbian.

 UNDATED: to you.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month demonstrated how much the brotherhood has dissolved.
Some traders said that it appeared that utilities put power up for
sale only when prices peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, however, said the weaknesses of the system will correct
themselves in time and that marketers that cannot deliver will be
forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cracked in a few places,'' Hanson said. ``But the whole
system really did not fail.''
</P>
<P>
   And the price surge, he said, could help stimulate independent
power producers to build new plants. This would help to ease the
supply problems in the Midwest, where demand for electricity has
been robust.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown, director of public relations for the Electric Power
Supply Association, a trade group for independent producers, said
several were actively looking to build plants in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that they were being cautious since the rules
that govern the wholesale market were evolving and there was
concern whether they could get their investment back. A new
gas-fired turbine plant costs about $100 million to build.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities have been reluctant to build new capacity, since many
plan to spin off generating plants to enable them to survive better
when their states open up to full competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some executives are uneasy, for no one is quite sure how
various market forces conspired to make prices surge.
</P>
<P>
   Four utilities _ Cinergy, based in Plainfield, Ind., Dynegy, in
Houston, NP Energy Inc., in Louisville, Ky., and Western Resources,
in Topeka, Kansas _ have filed a petition with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, which oversees the industry, asking that it
hold a hearing on what happened. The Public Utility Commission of
Ohio also plans an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit was filed by FirstEnergy, a utility holding company in
Ohio, against Federal Energy Sales Inc., a power marketer in Rocky
River, Ohio, that failed to deliver the power it had contracted
for. First Energy is claiming $25 million in damages since it was
forced to buy extra power.
</P>
<P>
   A vivid example of the utilities' new world was recalled by
McCoy, who is in charge of transmission and operations at
Commonwealth Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Like most utilities in the Midwest on June 25, he was preparing
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   A heat wave was moving across the region, causing a surge in
demand for electricity. Violent storms had knocked out key
transmission lines and a nuclear plant in Ohio, causing further
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he felt he was well prepared, having contracted for power
months ahead in the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the morning his backup plans began to unravel.
American Electric Power, a subsidiary of AEP Corp., one of the
largest utilities in the Midwest, notified Commonwealth Edison that
it would not deliver 1,300 megawatts it had promised, saying it
needed the capacity on its vast transmission network to cope with a
surge in demand in its own area.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth Edison, along with other utilities, began to cut
back power to some large industrial customers and asked its 3.2
million residential customers to turn off air-conditioners and
other appliances. It also warned that it might even have to black
out some areas for two hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that McCoy turned to the monitor on his desk on the
37th floor of an office tower in the Chicago Loop to see what was
available on the wholesale market, watching prices soar from an
average of $50 a megawatt hour to a peak of about $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not sure what happened that day,'' he said.

WOODS WARMS UP AT BALLYBUNION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Tiger Woods got a taste of Ireland on the
way to the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cowan, his celebrated caddie, had played there following
the Masters with a group of friends and steered his boss in that
direction. Woods played the Old Course at Ballybunion, Waterville,
and the K Club with his neighbor, Masters champion Mark O'Meara,
and Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was in contention at last month's US Open until the
final hole, had a hole-in-one on the third at Ballybunion, and
overall, it was a relaxing interlude before the start of the 127th
British Open tomorrow at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Woods spent a lot of time in O'Meara's company. ``We went
fishing and just had a good time relaxing,'' said Woods Tuesday.
``I found Ballybunion very interesting. It's one of those courses
you have to play enough to know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played well through most of the British Open last year at
Royal Troon, but a quadruple bogey and a couple of triple bogeys
removed him from contention. ``I learned a few things,'' he said.
``I wasn't swinging very well going into the championship and
struggled, hit a lot of bad shots. This year I've changed my
preparation a little bit, worked more on my swing and tried to get
my plane better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think overall, my game is better. I am flighting the ball
better than I was at this time last year. I think overall, the ball
flight has improved and my bad shots aren't that bad. I'm not
hitting it two fairways over and stuff like that. I think overall,
my game is better, and it is really neat to see. Unfortunately, you
don't get the breaks sometimes and win. I've been right there. I've
had a lot of top fives.''

FORMER MEXICAN POLICE CHIEF COOPERATES WITH U.S. DRUG PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After years of blocking U.S. efforts to investigate
corruption in their ranks, Mexican law-enforcement officials have
allowed the jailed former head of their national police to travel
secretly to the United States to testify about drug payoffs at high
levels of the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   In what U.S. officials described as a ground-breaking
collaboration between the two countries, former Police Director
Adrian Carrera Fuentes told a federal grand jury in Houston in June
that he collected nearly $2 million in drug bribes in 1993 and 1994
and turned the money over to a former colleague, Mario Ruiz
Massieu, two officials familiar with the testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators said Carrera's account could be the evidence
they have long sought in what has been a frustrating effort to
prosecute Ruiz Massieu, who was arrested in New Jersey three years
ago, or extradite him to Mexico to face charges there.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials took the case so seriously that they agreed to
let Carrera travel to the United States in the midst of an angry
dispute over the Clinton administration's failure to alert them to
a huge U.S. undercover operation to stop money laundering by
Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are hopeful that the testimony of Carrera and
other new witnesses may eventually prompt Ruiz Massieu to testify
himself about allegations of corruption in the inner circle of
former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The discovery of more
than $130 million that was deposited in Swiss banks by Salinas'
elder brother, Raul, has led to corruption investigations in
Europe, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials said Mexico's decision to allow Carrera to
testify here was probably most important for the precedent it sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely important to the relationship,'' one U.S.
law-enforcement official said. ``When you have as much cross-border
crime as we and Mexico have, the ability to share these witnesses
is a significant breakthrough for our ability to prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ruiz Massieu, Cathy Fleming, said that Carrera's
reported testimony contradicted previous sworn statements he had
given. She said, ``If he tells the truth now, Mario will have no
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The two governments have traded court witnesses and confidential
informants many times before. But Carrera is the first witness to
reach the United States from the upper ranks of the Mexican
government after taking advantage of a new law that has modernized
that country's justice system by allowing prosecutors to protect
cooperative witnesses and plea-bargain with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Carrera, 55, held senior posts in Mexico's prison system and
police force during most of the six years Salinas was president. He
also worked closely with Ruiz Massieu, who served twice as a deputy
attorney general and who, during six months in 1994, supervised
federal police and anti-drug operations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Ruiz Massieu fled Mexico in early 1995 and was arrested at
Newark International Airport, Carrera was charged in Mexico City
with having helped him to cover up the role of Raul Salinas in
ordering a political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities never made a case against Carrera at
that time, he was arrested again in late March during a raid by the
new Organized Crime Unit of the police force he once led.
Confronted with what was by then considerable evidence of his
involvement in drug trafficking and other crimes, he opted to
become the new squad's most important cooperating witness to date.
</P>
<P>
   Carrera is now serving a a four-year prison sentence as part of
his plea bargain. In court proceedings this year in Mexico City, he
has confirmed much of what U.S. officials long suspected about him.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as the warden of the Mexico City prison where he
is now being held, Carrera told a Mexican court, he met several
major drug traffickers as inmates. Shortly after he took over as a
commander in the Federal Judicial Police, one inmate, Amado
Carrillo Fuentes, had been released and summoned him to a safehouse
in a stylish Mexico City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   According to a summary of Carrera's testimony reported in the
Mexico City newspaper Reforma, ``He asked whether he would be given
protection to continue in his drug-trafficking activities. Adrian
Carrera told the trafficker he would dispatch police agents to
guard him and he promised not to persecute him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrera said he met Amado Carrillo again in 1993, and repeated
that he would not to bother him in Mexico City. The trafficker
handed Carrera an attache case containing more than $300,000 in
cash, and, he shouted to one of his lieutenants to buy the police
official a new Cadillac _ ``the most luxurious one there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrera was also quoted as saying he earned a commission of
$1,500 for every kilogram of cocaine he allowed to move freely to
the United States through Mexico. If true, that account would
underscore how payoffs to Mexican officials exploded in the early
1990s after traffickers there began to demand a cut of as much as
half the cocaine they smuggled for Colombian cartels. Until then,
the Colombians had typically paid their Mexican partners between
$1,000 and $2,000 for each kilo transported north; thereafter, the
Mexicans began to earn as much as $10,000 a kilo by selling their
shares of the cocaine directly to U.S. distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Carrera's account appears to conflict with U.S.
intelligence reports compiled even before he took over as head of
the federal police.
</P>
<P>
   According to several officials, one such report quoted an
informant as saying that Carrera had been Amado Carrillo's honored
guest at a ranch south of Mexico City in July 1993. Another report,
a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, states that
Carrera ``allegedly took bribes from the drug cartels to protect
their drug shipments and appoint Mexican Federal Judicial Police
comandantes working for the drug lords.''
</P>
<P>
   At their own initiative, Mexican law-enforcement officials
arranged to bring Carrera to Houston, where he testified June 3 to
a federal grand jury that was just starting to hear new evidence
against Ruiz Massieu compiled largely by investigators from the
U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony had already been scheduled when a diplomatic
uproar broke out over revelations that Customs agents had operated
undercover in Mexico as part of a huge money-laundering sting
called Operation Casablanca. Still, U.S. officials said they were
surprised and relieved when Mexican law enforcement officials
apparently decided it would serve no purpose to postpone or cancel
Carrera's scheduled visit to Houston despite the furor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a civil proceeding last year, the same U.S. attorneys won the
forfeiture of some $8 million that they said was bribe money from
narcotics traffickers that Ruiz Massieu had stashed in Texas banks.
</P>
<P>
   Until now investigators have not been able to make a criminal
case against him in the United States. He has also overcome four
attempts by the Mexican government to win his extradition from New
Jersey, where he was first jailed on Customs charges, then held
under house arrest on immigration charges case and is now awaiting
the outcome of a deportation case against him.
</P>
<P>
   According to two officials familiar with Carrera's secret
testimony in Houston, he told the grand jury that in 1993, Ruiz
Massieu learned that Carrera was growing rich on the traffickers'
bribes and was angry that he was being left out.
</P>
<P>
   That was a problem for Carrera because Ruiz Massieu was his
direct superior at the attorney general's office and because both
Ruiz Massieu and his elder brother, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu,
had helped Carrera win his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrera said his relationship with Ruiz Massieu was
deteriorating because Ruiz Massieu was not getting a piece of the
action,'' said one official, who like others, spoke on the
condition he not be named. ``So he took affirmative steps to
correct that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Between November 1993 and August 1994, Carrera delivered six
cash payments of about $300,000 each to Mario Ruiz Massieu, he was
quoted as having testified. The timing coincides closely with cash
deposits that court records show Ruiz Massieu having made in his
Texas accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it remained somewhat unclear from Carrera's
testimony what if anything Ruiz Massieu might have done in return
for the money. But Carrera said he collected the cash from a couple
of federal police commanders in the provinces who were being paid
directly by the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   According to police intelligence reports from both countries,
one of the two commanders whom Carrera named, David Grajeda Lara,
was the central figure in the diversion of some eight tons of
cocaine that was seized by Mexican highway police officers after it
was flown to the remote airstrip of a mining company near the
northern town of Sombrerete in August 1993. Mexican and U.S.
officials said Grajeda, who later reportedly died of a heart
attack, seized the confiscated cocaine on behalf of the Federal
police and then sold it back to the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu was later in charge of an investigation into the
reported diversion. His inspectors found no evidence of wrongdoing,
but U.S. agents later seized part of the shipment as it came across
the border. Grajeda Lara was promoted to the federal police command
in Monterrey, the most important city in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican officials have hinted that in debriefings with the
Organized Crime Unit, Carrera has provided incriminating
information against not only Ruiz Massieu but also against Raul
Salinas and others close to the former president. Raul Salinas
remains in jail in Mexico on charges of ordering the murder of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and officials in Switzerland said they will
soon confiscate more than $132 million that Salinas deposited in
banks there, asserting that it came from drug traffickers' bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican officials cautioned that although Carrera was
apparently close to Carlos Salinas' private secretary, Justo Ceja _
another secret U.S. intelligence report made available to The New
York Times quotes an informant as saying that they attended the
Super Bowl together in Atlanta in 1994 _ his contacts with the
Salinas family were still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, U.S. investigators did not hide their hope that if Ruiz
Massieu is faced with the prospect of going to jail on money
laundering or drug-conspiracy charges, he might finally agree to
testify about his own knowledge of the former president's closest
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now he has held out pretty well,'' one law-enforcement
official said of Ruiz Massieu. ``We'll see how it goes if he gets
indicted.''

COMMENTARY: JUST SAY $1 BILLION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all the merchandising might of Hollywood couldn't make
America's teen-agers buy ``Godzilla,'' why does anyone think that a
five-year, $1 billion government ad campaign is going to make kids
swear off drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Especially ads like these. No sooner was this new exercise in
bipartisan idiocy announced by Bill Clinton and seconded by Newt
Gingrich last week than the premiere commercial of the campaign hit
the networks. In this elegantly shot display of high-concept
Madison Avenue creativity, a young woman armed with a skillet
angrily smashes an egg and then an entire kitchen to dramatize the
destructiveness of heroin. The ad is an oh-so-hip variation on a
Golden Oldie of Reagan-era anti-drug advertising _ remember that
fried egg once labeled ``your brain on drugs''? _ and it sends
bizarrely mixed messages. The woman looks like Winona Ryder; she's
wearing a tight tank top; there are no visible track marks on her
junkie-thin arms; and the kitchen representing her drug-induced
hell is echt Pottery Barn, if not Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Far from discouraging teen-agers from drug use, our anti-heroin
heroine _ so sexy when she gets mad _ may inspire some of them to
seek out a vixen like her for a date.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed messages hardly end there. Not only will these ads
coexist on TV with those pushing beer and pharmaceutical panaceas
but with a commercial culture that in general subliminally sells
intoxication. ``A lot of advertising equates products with drug
experiences,'' says Thomas Frank, the author of ``The Conquest of
Cool,'' a scintillating history of the modern ad biz. Whether it's
a soft drink like Fruitopia trading on psychedelic packaging or a
stylish new car promising its owner escape and speed or a Nike shoe
bestowing enhanced physical powers, the ubiquitous message of the
advertising medium is Get High.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new anti-drug campaign is the largest government
merchandising effort in history, it's hard to imagine how it will
be heard above the din surrounding it. Even at almost $400 million
a year (half public funds, half pro bono freebies from media
participants), it's still a far smaller campaign than McDonald's
current and as yet inconclusive effort to win back its youthful
defectors. Meanwhile, the industry publication Brandweek has
challenged the methods of academic studies that the Partnership for
a Drug-Free America trots out to defend the efficacy of anti-drug
advertising. It calls the research ``flimsy,'' adding that its
findings ``would hardly justify launching a new stain remover, let
alone a program meant to help keep children sober and alive.''
</P>
<P>
   While partisans on all sides of the drug wars have condemned the
new ad campaign as wasteful, arguing that the money might be spent
better on either more law enforcement or on more after-school
programs and drug treatment, the public has been mum. This only
encourages Washington to think of advertising as the new instant
remedy to fool voters into believing that it is addressing
intractable problems; Speaker Gingrich, proposing a new tobacco
bill to replace John McCain's, has already suggested that
anti-smoking ads be its centerpiece. What's next? An ad campaign to
brainwash Americans into believing that they can trust their HMOs?
It's enough to make you pine for the usual government gimmick of
appointing blue-ribbon commissions to finesse hard policy
questions, whether about AIDS or women in the military or Social
Security. These commissions don't do anything either, but at least
they don't cost us a billion bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Where is all that money going? To advertising agencies and their
media outlets, from newspapers to MTV. Advertising Age reports that
most of the first $90 million installment will go _ where else? _
to Disney. The mouse will throw in some bonus public service
announcements on ABC, a Web site and, who knows, maybe an Epcot
ride simulating the OD experience, in exchange for a $50 million
``multimedia, cross-property package.'' The idea of Disney being on
the government dole is amusing enough, but it may also introduce a
new economic model to the long and tortured history of the drug
war. Where once we had companies that laundered drug money, now we
have corporations synergizing anti-drug money. Should its
``Armageddon'' not cross the line into profit, Disney's share of
this Washington bonanza may be just the fix it needs to help it
feel no pain.

`THE MATCHMAKER': PARODY BECOMES A TRIBUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review) 
(JT) 
 By PETER MARKS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ It is all but impossible nowadays to watch
``The Matchmaker'' and not feel a song coming on. The instant
Cornelius Hackl announces to his young assistant, ``Get into your
Sunday clothes, Barnaby!'' your head fills with images of Gower
Champion's beaming chorus in fancy duds high-stepping its way past
the Yonkers train station and singing, ``Get out your feathers,
your patent leathers, your beads and buckles and bows.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Hello, Dolly!,'' of course, there was the play it was
based on, Thornton Wilder's winsome, all-American farce revolving
around the businesslike romantic schemes of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a
pragmatic yenta with designs on the gruff feed merchant, Horace
Vandergelder. And while the Williamstown Theater Festival tries
hard to cast aside memories of the juggernaut 1964 musical, one
senses in this somewhat enervating revival, directed by Nicholas
Martin and featuring Andrea Martin in the marquee role, the need
for a zesty number or two to perk things up.
</P>
<P>
   The production tries to recapture the dulcet innocence of
Wilder's vision of the 1880s with a new score of incidental, period
music by Mark Bennett, but the earnest effort does not camouflage
the problems the cast has in enlivening the comedy or in achieving
a coherent style of performance. The madcap events in the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant, for instance, are staged with no particular
flair for the coincidence and slapstick of farce; only Ms. Martin's
handling of the ladling of food for Horace (Lewis Stadlen) places
any dexterous physical comedy on display.
</P>
<P>
   Two supporting actors, though, do make beguiling impressions:
Kate Burton as a vivacious and hopeful Irene Molloy, the New York
hat shop owner desperate for security, and the reliably theatrical
Marian Seldes in an agreeably dizzy turn as a confused dowager so
out of it she hums to herself in crowded rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from them, however, most of the cast members appear only
to be in the preliminary stages of figuring out their characters.
As a result, there is a wanness about the production that tends to
render the plot mechanics as even more labored and transparent than
they seem on the page. Wilder himself seems to have had his tongue
firmly in his cheek when he wrote ``The Matchmaker'': ``This play
parodies the stock-company plays that I used to see at Ye Liberty
Theater, Oakland, Calif., when I was a boy,'' he once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The director takes an opposing tack, declaring in the program
notes that his production is intended as ``a tribute to the summer
theaters and music halls of the past.'' But this sepia-toned
approach tends to bathe ``The Matchmaker'' in more nostalgia that
it can currently bear.
</P>
<P>
   As she has demonstrated in shows as diverse as the musical ``My
Favorite Year,'' for which she won a Tony Award, and the New York
Shakespeare Festival's ``Merry Wives of Windsor,'' Ms. Martin can
be a galvanic comic stage presence. Like Martin Short, one of her
former co-stars on SCTV, the brilliant television parody show,
she's at once utterly wacky and totally disciplined: there is the
sense about her of a wild wit tamed through the miracles of
pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy period costumes, including bustles, seem to weigh her
down. Her Dolly is enjoyable but never endearing; she resorts in
desperate moments to familiar bits of shtick, as when she bellows a
reply, Ethel Merman-style. You never really believe that this is a
woman at a crossroads in her life, a woman who comes to an
understanding that she requires more from Horace than his bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   Stadlen delivers a Vandergelder who could be a cousin to his
Senex, the henpecked old goat of ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum.'' He's the curmudgeonly butt of the joke again,
only this time, without the musical breaks in the action to add
some warmth. Yup, what this Horace needs is a song.

TRUANCY RATE CONTINUES TO RISE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than a quarter of Boston Public School students
were absent three weeks or more this past school year, a number
that continues to inch up despite efforts to crack down on the
city's massive truancy problem.
</P>
<P>
   Boston high schoolers already have one of the highest rates of
absenteeism in the country, and statistics provided to the Globe
Tuesday indicate the problem is growing worse: Chronic absenteeism
increased at almost every single high school in the city this year
compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston High School, almost 70 percent of students were absent
more than 14 days this past year; almost 50 percent were absent
more than 27 days.
</P>
<P>
   Students are supposed to fail a marking period if they miss more
than 15 percent of school days, and are supposed to fail for the
school year if they fail a majority of marking periods. Schools
have either three or five marking periods.
</P>
<P>
   But school statistics show students are routinely allowed to
advance to the next grade even when their absenteeism _ from 15
days to 27 days a year, depending on the number of marking periods
_ should block their promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in September, that should change as the city begins an
intensive effort to cut down on truancy, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a strict new promotion policy, students will only be
allowed 3 unexcused absenses a marking period _ or face failure.
The school department has also been meeting with police, state
Department of Youth Services and community officials to enforce the
new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new student promotion policy takes a hard line on student
attendance because it is such a crucial issue,'' said
Superintendent Thomas Payzant. He said the issue of attendance is
of particular priority now as school officials wrap up two years of
putting reform into place in the city's 127 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students need to be in the classroom for these efforts to have
a full impact,'' Payzant said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city officials are looking for ways to increase the
number of attendance officers in the school department, City
Councilor at Large Stephen Murphy said Tuesday. Now are there are
eight attendance officers for the city's 64,000 students. Police
cars will also be dedicated to curb truancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Statewide, a bill is pending in the Senate to give teenagers a
driving license only if their school attendance is satisfactory;
another pending bill will give police officers the right to bring
truants back to school, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Boston high school students miss 28 days of school a
year, four days more than the average of the country's ten largest
cities, according to a report for the Boston schools by Bain &AMP;
Company, a Boston consulting firm. Yet Boston is the country's 22d
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston's new strict attendance policy is enforced, it will be
one of the country's strictest. Chicago, which just instituted a
strict new promotion policy three years ago, allows students to
have 20 unexcused absences a year. School officials there Tuesday
said the policy is strictly enforced, but were unable to provide
numbers of students specifically held back because of unexcused
absences.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's truancy problem has been exacerbated in recent years by
many high schools' policies of locking out tardy students for the
day if they are more than 15 or 20 minutes late, some parents and
students say.
</P>
<P>
   Most high schools have automatic phone machines that call a
student's home letting parents know their child is absent. But many
high schoolers simply take the call while their parents are at
work.

FBI DOUBLES SEARCH TEAM AFTER BOMBING SUSPECT SPOTTED IN N.C.
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted
for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from
the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount
of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the
truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon,
federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric
Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of
35. Bloodhounds also were tracking the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have the resources that we will find him,'' said
Woody Enderson, the FBI agent who directs the multiagency Southeast
Bombing Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The sighting last Thursday was clearly the most encouraging lead
in a frustrating search that has taken investigators across
hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain since Jan. 29, when a bomb
exploded outside the New Woman All Women Health Care Center, in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing killed an off-duty policeman who was working as a
security guard at the clinic and seriously injured a nurse.
Witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the
explosion, and the North Carolina license plate on the man's truck
was traced to Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know
for sure that he's in this area and that we are able to focus in on
a much smaller area than we have before,'' said Enderson.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter with ties to extremist
religious groups, also is wanted for questioning in three bombings
in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997, including the July 27, 1996,
explosion at Centennial Olympic Park. That explosion killed one
woman and injured 111 people. Seven people were injured in a pair
of explosions on Jan. 27, 1997, outside a building housing an
abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburbs, and five were injured in a
Feb. 21, 1997, bombing at a gay nightclub in midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rudolph has only been formally charged in the
Birmingham bombing, forensic evidence suggests that he may have
been responsible for the Atlanta bombings as well, investigators
have said. In early May, the FBI placed Rudolph on its list of the
10 most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for
information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said that the man identified as Rudolph had appeared on
Thursday evening at a residence near Nantahala Lake, not far from
where Rudolph once lived. He said the fugitive took a blue 1977
Nissan pickup truck from the occupant of the residence, whom he did
not identify. He said Rudolph also took a large amount of food from
the resident, possibly enough to sustain him for five or six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the resident provided a description that
enabled them to produce a new sketch of the previously clean-shaven
Rudolph, showing him thinner, bearded and sporting a ponytail. He
was last seen wearing camouflage fatigues, a camouflage jacket and
gloves, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson declined to say specifically whether the resident knew
Rudolph. ``Keep in mind that pretty much in this whole area, people
know each other,'' he said. ``The extent of the association I'm not
going to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that the resident, who was described as the owner
of a health food store, did not report the truck as stolen until
several days later. It was found, broken down and abandoned, at
about noon on Monday at the Bob Allison Campground, a picnic area
in the Nantahala National Forest, the official said. The official
also said that authorities found a note inside the truck explaining
who it belonged to, and they identified the handwriting as
Rudolph's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert
Rudolph,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement official said the truck apparently was not
at the picnic area 18 hours before it was found, meaning that
Rudolph has less than a day's head start on his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said that his troops had been energized by the sighting
of Rudolph. And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph
apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an
avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was
hiding in the familiar woods near his home. ``We've said all along
that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this
area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting
alone,'' Enderson said. ``We still believe that.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ In the National Lampoon film European
Vacation, Chevy Chase leads the Griswalds across the pond in
pursuit of fun, adventure and lots of quality bonding.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toss in the gold medal at the FIBA World Championship of
Basketball, and Rudy Tomjanovich has the same challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich and the U.S. team that will play in the World
Championship of Basketball arrived early today in the south of
France, then took the hourlong bus ride to ritzy Monte Carlo, where
they will spend the next week hoping to grow closer as a cohesive
unit _ a family.
</P>
<P>
   And Tomjanovich believes this team of replacement players for
NBA stars has the sort of personality to become a close-knit group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love the makeup of this team,'' Tomjanovich said.
``We've got guys from all different facets of basketball. We've got
two guys who are in college. We've got two guys who just got out of
college but didn't get drafted. We've got guys who have been in the
NBA. We've got journeymen. We've got guys who have been in the CBA,
and then we've got guys who come from an international situation,
Americans, who have played abroad. We've got old guys. We've got
young guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is a team that, when America sees it, it's going
to know this is an American team. It's a melting pot from all
different levels of basketball. When you think about it, it's a
heck of a story.''
</P>
<P>
   One Tomjanovich hopes will get better as the U.S team led by
players such as Jimmy King, Jason Sasser and David Wood begins
finding out where it stands in the international scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   While in Monte Carlo, the U.S. team will play exhibitions
against France on Saturday and Spain on Sunday. Those will be the
first tests for this learning-on-the-fly U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys that now that you've survived that first cut,
now our focus is that we're going to have to become a real team,''
Tomjanovich said. ``Not an all-star team. Not a group of guys from
a whole bunch of different parts of the country that just go out
and play. We have to become a family and develop a chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already talked about it, having a belief system. We have
to believe in the system we're using. We have to communicate. And
we have to like each other and depend on each other. Trust.
Expecting somebody to back you up. And then have our own
communication and terms on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this team has to do it on guts and heart. It has to be
where we're not playing for the Rockford Whoever-they-ares or the
Houston Rockets. We're playing for the United States. Once you get
that feeling _ and I think we'll have it _ then that gives you an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the country should help in that pursuit. It also
will expedite the process of the U.S. team developing a
personality. Nobody knows who is going to be the top scorers or
rebounders.
</P>
<P>
   But the players know what kind of style they want to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be the butt-kicking, end-to-end,
in-your-face kind of defensive team,'' said Wood, 33, the elder
statesman among the players. ``I've been to Europe, and I just
can't see that not being effective. Going all out for 40 minutes,
that's going to wear some of those other teams down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kick a lot of butt,'' Tomjanovich said when
asked what the strength of his team will be. ``No, I'm just
kidding, but we will have to use team defense and we do have some
guys who won't back down. And we have to make their big bodies move
because I've told our guys to be prepared to be undersized at every
position.''
</P>
<P>
   But height is not always what wins games. Wood said that message
was delivered early and often by Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy has told us that (camaraderie) is everything,'' Wood
said. ``He told us when the Rockets won the championship one of
those years, he felt like he had the seventh- or eighth-most
talented team. But they came together as a group and believed in
what they were doing, and they got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've put the team first, played together and played
hard. And I think that's going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Earl Boykins: ``I think this team has a very good chance
of winning it, but the only way to do it is to come together and
play as a unit. Last year when I played with the USA, we won the
gold medal because we played as a unit. Everybody had one main
goal, and that was to win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Boykins, a 5-5 point guard, was the Most Valuable Player of the
USA World University Games team last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Kruger, coach at the University of Illinois and one of
Tomjanovich's assistants for this U.S. team, is a veteran of
numerous international competitions and believes jelling at the
right time will be important for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now,'' he said as the team arrived overseas.
``We're going to be playing against teams that have been together
for three, five, seven years in some cases. And they play with
great passion. We'll have to have good chemistry and have a real
team feeling, and Rudy, of course, does a great job of promoting
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But few challenges Tomjanovich has faced are as formidable as
this one _ getting this group of NBA-challenged players to be
competitive on a global stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from being the favorite with the NBA players to a
team that's right in the pack,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But we think
we have kids who have a tough mental attitude and believe we're
going to win the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these kids come from backgrounds where they tried the
NBA and didn't make it, then went down to the CBA. Now, all of a
sudden, this is the highest-regarded international tournament in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've told them: This isn't national television; it's
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   What better circumstance to grow up as a family, right? &QL;

AFTER HANDLING MANY CASES, MAN HELD FOR POSING AS LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md.)   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He calls himself Paul C. Kurtz Esq., and those who
know him say that he has done a commendable job of representing
defendants in federal courts in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to how Kurtz has represented himself, that is
a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a still-unraveling case that prosecutors suggest
may be one of the more audacious legal hoaxes of recent years,
Kurtz was arrested in Maryland by the FBI and charged with two
counts of lying to judges about being a lawyer, and investigators
say he may have similarly misrepresented himself to as many as 100
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecutors say Kurtz is not a lawyer. They say he is a
56-year-old con man from Bethesda, Md., who has fooled judges in
courthouses in Manhattan, Brooklyn and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has not said whether it has evidence
that Kurtz has actually tried cases, his role in plea bargains and
sentencing proceedings has led to concern that some of those
convictions and sentences may be in jeopardy in cases where
defendants believed that Kurtz was a genuine lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to get a handle on exactly how extensive
this catastrophe is,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James Benjamin told
U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Stein at a hearing last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was good enough to convince others of his legal
savvy. One lawyer, H. Elliot Wales, said Tuesday by telephone that
Kurtz had performed admirably in presenting a legal brief and
arguments at a sentencing hearing at which they both represented a
defendant, and seemed to be extremely dedicated to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should say, I thought his brief was superb,'' Wales said.
``I thought he made a good oral argument. I thought he was
professional in every way. If all lawyers acted as well and as
competently in proceedings as he did, we would have a great bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz filed that sentencing brief on behalf of one of Wales'
clients, Daniel Spiegelman, who had been convicted of stealing
valuable documents from Columbia University's rare book and
manuscript collection. Investigators say that widely publicized
case was among the scores in which Kurtz may have misrepresented
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investigators executed a search warrant and seized 36
file boxes from Kurtz's home. By the end of last week, they were
still sifting through the contents of the boxes, the investigators
told Stein, and they believe there are 80 to 100 cases ``where
Kurtz has stood up in front of a judge,'' the prosecutor, Benjamin,
said, ``and has blatantly misrepresented who he is and what his
qualifications are.''
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, the revelations about Kurtz are a potential
headache. Benjamin added: ``It is going to have extremely serious
consequences requiring the reopening of what appears to be numerous
settled criminal cases with serious cost to the administration of
justice, prejudice to the government, and to the courts as well.''

DROUGHT COSTS TEXAS FARMERS, RANCHERS $1.5 BILLION, ECONOMISTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In northwest Texas, cotton farmers have written off
most of this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lower Rio Grande Valley, citrus growers are beyond
worrying about their produce. It's whether they'll be able to
salvage their trees that's got them concerned.
</P>
<P>
   And in east Texas, cattle ranchers watch as ponds begin to dry
up, pastureland turns useless and hay prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than three months old, the drought of 1998 has
already cost Texas farmers and ranchers $1.5 billion, according to
economists at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   This is fast approaching the $1.9 billion in damages wreaked by
the drought of 1996, one of the worst natural disasters in the
state's history. That drought lasted about eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drought could easily wind up being worse than 1996 if we
don't get significant rain soon,'' Agricultural Extension Service
economist Roland Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast isn't promising despite the brief downpour that
cooled parts of southeast Texas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weathermen were calling for a slight chance of thunderstorms
across west Texas through Wednesday, with scattered showers in
southeast Texas and more of the same dry skies in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was predicting an end to the drought any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide damage estimates for both corn and grain sorghum
have been increased as the drought intensified, corn to an updated
$225 million and grain sorghum to $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to cotton, the No. 1 row crop in the state, is the same
as it was on June 30, about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest hit area in the state is the South Plains and the
Rolling Plains, where crops of cotton and grain sorghum grown
without irrigation are ``almost a total loss,'' said Travis Miller,
Extension Service agronomist. Even the irrigated fields there will
be affected slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The overall damage estimate has soared since June 30, the last
update, as the result of adding $330 million for hay that won't be
baled and $55 million for fall-planted vegetables in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley that won't be planted because the supply of
irrigation water is running out.
</P>
<P>
   These vegetables range from carrots to onions. The current
estimate is that one-half the Valley's normal acreage of vegetables
will not get planted.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the irrigation districts in the Valley no longer have
water to put into the canals, and others are running low. The
combined water supply in the Falcon and Amistad reservoirs is about
23 percent of their capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus growers are worried about keeping their trees alive and
some have been unable to irrigate for nine weeks, said Gary
McBryde, an official of the Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville Citrus Center in
Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, producers are not just worried about their
yields (of grapefruit and oranges this coming winter), they are
fighting to keep their trees alive,'' said McBryde. Up to half the
irrigation districts in South Texas will shut down in the near
future because of low water supplies in the reservoirs, he
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle business, the largest agricultural revenue-producer
in the state, is just starting to feel the brunt of the drought
with lost revenues of $44 million. This does not include the added
cost of feeding because of drought, which comes to $136 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers have begun to sell lightweight calves and culled cows
because of declining pastures, a process that economist Joe Outlaw
predicts will accelerate sharply during the next six weeks unless
it rains.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, almost 70 percent of the pastures and rangeland in
the state were rated as in either poor or very poor condition. The
price of hay has risen by 15 to 20 percent. Many ponds used for
supplying drinking water have dried up in far west and southwest
Texas, a process that is beginning in east Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact on the state during the next 18 months will
be $4.6 billion, according to the economists. This compares with $5
billion for the 1996 drought.
</P>
<P>
   The drought will ultimately eliminate about 40,000 jobs
statewide, Outlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains optimistic that relatively few farmers will go out
of business because of crop insurance and emergency loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some _ that can't be avoided,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell County, which has its county seat in Sanderson, on
Tuesday became the first county in Texas to receive a drought
disaster declaration from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Also named as contiguous disaster counties were Brewster,
Crockett, Pecos and Val Verde, according to the Texas Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   This means farmers and ranchers in those counties will be
considered for low-interest emergency loans. Currently, 110
counties in the state are at some stage of the disaster declaration
process, said Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry.

   NEW YORK _ The stock market rallied sharply Tuesday as several
companies reported good or better-than-expected earnings for the
second quarter, easing concerns about the drag from Asia's economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The surge was enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average to
a new high, making it the last of the big three indexes to climb
back into record territory.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rally will hold will depend a lot on how the the
rest of the second-quarter earnings season plays out. Only a small
proportion of the 500 companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's index have
reported so far and analysts are still predicting a lackluster
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed Tuesday, Intel Corp. reported that its
second-quarter earnings dropped 29 percent, to 66 cents a diluted
share, 2 cents below recent estimates. In after-hours trading,
Intel's stock dropped to $80.125 a share on the Instinet electronic
trading system after falling $1.6875, to $80.6875, in regular
trading.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared Tuesday that the rush of money into the stock
market from Americans and foreigners is so strong that it may be
enough to overcome less than fabulous earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners are buying U.S. securities aggressively, stock
buybacks are big and mutual-fund flows are strong,'' said Byron
Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``The market is being driven by liquidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wien marveled at the economy's ability to grow without a
resurgence in inflation and the refusal of investors to worry about
how far this market can go. ``It is sort of like having drink after
drink and not getting drunk and waking up the next morning without
a hangover and thinking that you can party all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also buoying investors is the fact that usually _ despite the
Intel disappointment _ there are a lot of positive earnings
surprises during the reporting season because companies work so
hard to manage expectations. Companies jawbone down earnings
forecasts until the beginning of the reporting season, making it
much easier for the actual reports to surpass those already-lowered
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened with the positive earnings reports Tuesday
from Weyerhaeuser, the manufacturer of wood and paper products. The
company announced earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, beating the
recent consensus estimate of analysts tallied by First Call Corp.
of 22 cents a share. But on June 16 the company said that its
earnings would be significantly below the then estimate of 38 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the health-care company, and Norwest and J.P.
Morgan, two major banks, also reported earnings Tuesday at or above
expectations. General Motors reported a sharp strike-induced loss
that was smaller than expected. And Allied Signal, the aerospace
company, reported positive results after the market's close on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow jumped 149.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,245.54,
beating its previous high of 9,211.84 on May 13. The Dow's rally
back to new highs took just under two months, three times as fast
as the return to new highs in February after 1997's August peak and
the sharp one-day decline on Oct. 27 of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which surpassed its April 22 high on July 8,
rose 2.88 points to a record of 1,968.41. The S&AMP;P 500-stock index,
which had surpassed its April 22 high on June 24, climbed 12.39
points, or 1.1 percent, to a record of 1,177.58.
</P>
<P>
   Big Board volume was 700.3 million shares, higher than average.
Advancing issues led decliners by 1,773 to 1,190.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The return to record highs, say some analysts, is not
surprising, because they believe that the underlying fundamentals
of the U.S. economy continue to be positive enough to support the
stock market, even if earnings growth has slowed well below the
double-digit pace that sent stocks higher during the last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   These positive fundamentals were reinforced Tuesday with the
report that the Consumer Price Index for June rose just 0.1
percent, leaving inflation up just 1.4 percent on an annual rate
this year. June retail sales rose 0.1 percent after a revised 1.2
percent gain in May.
</P>
<P>
   While bond prices fell and interest rates rose Tuesday, low
inflation and a slowing in economic growth _ signs of which are
beginning to pop up _ mean that interest rates could remain low,
which also helps the stock market by making equities look more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower interest rates are more important than the difference
between 3 percent and 6 percent earnings growth,'' said Richard
Pucci, the director of research at IBES International, a firm that
follows earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With inflation and long-term interest rates low and economic
activity healthy, I believe that investors are and will remain
unfazed by the slowdown in earnings growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with this positive background there just seems to be an
urgency among investors to get their money into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is so great to get the money in,'' said Marshall
Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Earnings
still count, he argued, but ``current earnings sometimes may not
make as much difference as people speculate that they will get
better in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Also aiding the market Tuesday was the improvement in the
outlook for Russia's economy following an agreement on Monday for
$17 billion in new international support. But the country's
legislature still must approve the domestic economic program that
goes along with the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every problem out there that seems to scare us seems to get
solved,'' Wien said.

CIA, GOING BACK ON PROMISES, SAYS IT WILL NOT RELEASE SECRET
RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking repeated promises it made to the American
public, the CIA said on Tuesday that it will not release secret
records from most of its major Cold War covert operations in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The director of central intelligence, George Tenet, said in a
written statement that the CIA had ``a responsibility to the
American people, and to history, to account for our actions and the
quality of our work.'' But, he said, the agency lacked the money
and the personnel to fulfill its promises anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The agency pledged five years ago to declassify thousands of
files on 11 major paramilitary and political operations launched
under Presidents Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy.
It said then that records on these secret efforts at foiling
Communism and furthering American foreign policy in Europe, Asia,
Africa and the Caribbean would be released as early as 1994. Two
former CIA chiefs, Robert Gates and R. James Woolsey Jr.,
personally promised that the files would be released.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has published some documents from two of those
operations: the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and
the successful 1954 coup against the Guatemalan government. In the
case of Guatemala, the release so far represents less than 2
percent of the available files.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear on Tuesday that the agency never undertook a
serious effort to declassify the remaining nine operations. Tenet
said on Tuesday that he had decided ``to hold the reviews of these
covert actions in abeyance for the time being.'' A historian who
advises the CIA on the declassification program, Page Putnam
Miller, said on Tuesday that ``there are no resources now for this
project.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine operations constitute a secret history of American
power as used against foreign governments by three presidents. They
include efforts to shore up the noncommunist left in France and
Italy in the late 1940s and early 1950s, guerrilla operations in
North and South Korea during the Korean War, efforts ranging from
political propaganda to bombing missions in Indonesia in the 1950s,
paramilitary activities in Laos and Tibet during the first years of
the American involvement in Vietnam, and covert actions that
included assassination plots in the Congo and the Dominican
Republic in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also promised six years ago to release records of its
coup in Iran in 1954. It belatedly confessed last year that it had
destroyed most of those files in the early 1960s. Woolsey called
that destruction, which remained a secret within the agency, even
to him, ``a terrible breach of faith with the American people and
their ability to understand their own history.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency's directorate of operations have
steadfastly opposed releasing Cold War secrets, saying that even
40- and 50-year-old documents can reveal the agency's present-day
sources and methods. A senior intelligence official said that the
directorate accepts declassification in principle but often opposes
disclosures in practice. The tug of war between secrecy and
openness continues unresolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said on Tuesday that declassifying documents is a
painstaking process, requiring the purging of sensitive secrets,
which takes more time, money and people than the agency can commit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the CIA had released 227,000 pages to a government panel
on the assassination of President Kennedy and reams of information
for the State Department's official histories of American foreign
relations in the 1950s and 1960s. These releases, required by law,
took precedence over the voluntary effort to declassify covert
actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A C.I.A. spokeswoman said that about 150 people, most retired
spies, work on declassification. They handle demands from the White
House, Congress and the State Department, as well as public
requests under the Freedom of Information Act. She declined to
reveal how much money was spent, saying the sum is secret.

THE MISTY SCOTTISH ISLE OF SKYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19.)  
 (JT)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every right-thinking visitor to the Isle of Skye must master the
etiquette of the one-track road. The island, a large, many-fingered
blob between the western Highlands and the Outer Hebrides, does
have a basic network of two-lane roads, but the real driving begins
on the narrow trails, often unmarked, that wind from glen to glen,
skirting silvery lochs, crossing desolate moors and sheep pastures,
or running headlong into the forbidding, upthrust mountain chain
known as the Cuillins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a car approaches. Or a fat caravan. Or, for
that special thrill, a tour bus barreling along at high speed.
Custom dictates that the vehicle closest to a passing place, a
bulge in the road indicated by a diamond-shaped sign, should pull
over and wait for the other vehicle to proceed. The driver who
forges ahead, must _ repeat, must _ acknowledge the courtesy with a
wave. If multiple cars are stopped, one wave for the group will not
do. Each waiting car gets its own payoff. It matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a week's stay on Skye, my wife, Nancy, and I
spent a fair amount of time analyzing the sociology of the single
track and criticizing our fellow drivers. We seethed at the louts
who zipped past a convenient passing place, forcing us to halt or
even back up, and then sped by without even a nod. As the sole
driver, I experimented with gradations of thanks, from a minimalist
one-finger wiggle to a Texas-caliber ``howdy'' wave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had lots of practice. Almost any road on Skye qualifies as a
scenic drive, so the temptation is strong to turn off the two-lane
roads and follow the corkscrew single-tracks wherever they may
lead, across squishy moorland covered in purple heather, over
alpine meadows and stretches of grassland that suggest high
chaparral country, along bold headlands thrusting out toward the
sea, past the mesalike formations known as MacLeod's tables, and
the scarred, ragged Red Cuillins and Black Cuillins, geological
lords of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The light on Skye is magic, the weather so unpredictable and
quick to change that listening to the forecast becomes something of
a joke, since everything is possible at any time, or so it seemed
in late August. Bright sunshine and a startlingly pure, pale blue
sky could vanish in an instant, as a flat gray lid of cloud slammed
down and emitted a fine, high-velocity spray of rain. After 10
minutes, a blue streak on the horizon would offer hope, and perhaps
a half hour later, cumulus clouds, soft and puffy enough for
cherubs, would pile up in a Marie Antoinette coiffe. Shafts of
sunlight would send diffused rays over glen and heather, creating
an effect we called ``the hand of God.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunsets provided a full evening's entertainment. Our base of
operations was a whitewashed cottage perched above Glendale, a
scooped-out valley in far northwestern Skye, on the Duirinish
Peninsula, with a view over Loch Pooltiel out to the low, rolling
hills of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides. As evening progressed, a
smear of lemon painted the horizon, setting it off from the
silver-gray surface of the loch, and scattered purplish clouds
floated by, occasionally flaring up with a golden light as they
captured the last rays of the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   The sky eventually settled into bands of blue and bluish-gray.
The coastline softened, and the island appeared to levitate
slightly. As night fell, and sheep bleats were relayed from glen to
glen, Uist floated serenely, a silent dream at the end of the
earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skye does not make enormous demands on the cultural tourist. Its
history is dominated by two clans, the MacDonalds and the MacLeods,
and two events, Bonnie Prince Charlie's secret journey across the
island after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, and the visit of
Samuel Johnson and James Boswell in 1773.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the mighty MacDonalds, who, as hereditary Lords
of the Islands, held sway over Skye, the Outer Hebrides and even
large chunks of the mainland in the 15th century, gets the full
treatment at the Clan Donald Visitor Center, in Armadale, on the
Sound of Sleat at the southern end of Skye. The center, a renovated
stable behind the ruins of Armadale Castle, includes a study center
and museum devoted to the 1,300-year history of the clan, as well
as 40 acres of nature trails and a restored Victorian garden. As
northerners, however, Nancy and I rallied to the cause of the
MacLeods, whose story can be read at Dunvegan Castle, an
uncompromising stone fortress facing Loch Dunvegan that has been
the clan's seat since 1200. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``cause'' is not the right word. The rivalry between
MacDonald and MacLeod, and of both clans with assorted lesser fry,
seems less like ``Braveheart'' than it does a kilted version of the
Hatfields and McCoys. MacLeod smote MacDonald, who smote Mackenzie,
who smote MacTavish, and so on down through the centuries. The
ceaseless struggle for land and power hit a low point one Sunday in
1578 when a marauding band of MacDonalds from Uist landed on
northern Skye, set fire to a church filled with MacLeods and
butchered anyone who escaped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by the lone survivor from the church, an armed party of
MacLeods rushed from Dunvegan Castle and waved the magic Fairy
Flag, left hundreds of years earlier to a clan member by his fairy
lover with the instructions that it be used only in direst
emergency. Nature itself turned against the MacDonalds, who fled to
their boats in panic, only to find that the ebbing tide had left
them high, dry and firmly in the possession of the MacLeods, who
annihilated their enemy. A scrap of the Fairy Flag hangs in
Dunvegan Castle. Its origins are mysterious, but the eastern silk
from which it is made suggests that it may have flown during one of
the Crusades.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The castle had taken on the interior comforts of a fine country
house, and added a landscaped garden, by the time Johnson and
Boswell dropped by for several days of feasting and good
conversation with Lord and Lady MacLeod, who distressed Boswell by
complaining that life was a bit of a bore in Dunvegan Castle.
``Keep to the rock,'' he admonished them. ``It is the very jewel of
the estate. It looks as if it had been let down from heaven by the
four corners, to be the residence of a chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Lady MacLeod would have none of it. ``It is very well for you,''
she said, ``who have a fine place and everything easy, to talk
thus, and think of chaining honest folks to a rock.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nerve center of Skye is Portree, an attractive port and
fishing town with a string of whitewashed hotels, restaurants and
shops lining the harbor. In summer the town teems with visitors,
many of them backpackers on hiking or climbing expeditions. The
tourist office, on Bayfield Lane, near the harbor, is large,
efficient, well stocked with maps, touring guides, hiking
itineraries, histories, Skye-related fiction, and even an
invaluable little treatise on the midge, a tiny, gnatlike
creature. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The midge is a fact of life in the Highlands and Islands. Nancy
and I arrived with fear in our hearts, especially after reading a
newspaper item about a sheep that caused a three-car pile-up after
bolting onto a road to escape a midge attack. Imagination painted
too lurid a picture, however. The breezes blow almost constantly on
Skye, dispersing the midges, which appear from late May to early
September. Sunlight also has a deterrent effect. Midge swarm-athons
tend to occur when the breeze dies down, and light begins to fade.
Know the ways of the midge, counsels the author of ``Midges in
Scotland,'' adjust your schedule, and the problem becomes
manageable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least that was true on Skye's northern peninsulas, where we
concentrated our touristic efforts. On our quiet country lane, amid
the Cheviots and Scottish black-face sheep, we came to look on
Portree and points south with a rustic's disdain. Yes, the south
could boast the charismatic Cuillins, an imposing horseshoe-shaped
chain that, under a threat-ening sky, suggests the stronghold of
the dark powers in ``The Lord of the Rings.'' True, the visitor
must go south to visit the island's lone distillery, Talisker, and
the drive from Carbost to Glenbrittle, skirting the Cuillins, is a
stunner.
</P>
<P>
   But the more thinly populated, wilder north caught our fancy.
Hardly a car was to be seen as we circled the Vaternish Peninsula,
an elevated headland pointing straight across the Minch to Harris.
At Trumpan, a steep coastal road passes the ruins of the church set
afire by the MacDonalds, and the MacLeod graveyard, before
descending to Stein, a tiny village overlooking Loch Bay whose
single street includes the 16th-century Stein Inn and the Loch Bay
Seafood Restaurant, an inviting, beamed room where the chalkboard
specials depend on the day's catch of hake, lemon sole, halibut,
haddock, Dover sole, monkfish, cod or plaice. As an appetizer,
order a pile of squat lobster tails, a local delicacy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greater drama lies just a step eastward, on the Trotternish
Peninsula, a thumblike protrusion whose coastal road offers views
of the Hebrides to the west and the Highlands to the east. Its
weirdly sculptured topography, carved by glaciers from the the
4,000 feet of lava that volcanoes deposited on what was once a
coastal lagoon, includes two of Skye's most famous rock formations,
the Old Man of Storr and the Quiraing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our own peninsula seemed to specialize in unusual museums,
although nothing quite matches the Haggis Museum in Portree, where
a series of dioramas present the natural history of the mythical
beast. Dunvegan itself, little more than a wide spot in the road,
is home to the Giant Angus Mac-Askill Museum, a one-room thatched
cottage devoted to a 19th-century man who, at 7 feet 9 inches and
425 pounds, found a career touring with P.T. Barnum in the United
States. Why the museum stands in Dunvegan is mysterious, since
MacAskill was born in the Western Isles and died in Nova Scotia.
The museum contains nothing that actually belonged to the man. For
a fee of 1 pound _ about $1.70 _ the visitor is treated to the
sight of an enormous coffin, suggestive of MacAskill's size, as
well as a giant chair and a giant bed. A life-size model of the
great man stands in one corner of the cottage, along with a model
of Tom Thumb, a colleague on his tours. It's worth the pound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more serious endeavor is the MacCrimmon Piping Heritage
Center, a small building in Boereraig, on land deeded to the
MacCrimmons, hereditary pipers to the MacLeods. For three
centuries, until the beginning of the 19th century, the MacCrimmons
ran a college of piping that attracted clan pipers from all over
Scotland. Do not enter if you are in an unenthusiastic mood. Geoff
Winter and his wife, Sarah Winter, have a missionary zeal for the
traditional bagpipe music known as piobaireachd (PEA-brokh), and
visitors are regarded as fresh recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The center offers courses of instruction, and at its shop, the
newly converted can buy CD's, tapes or, indeed, a full set of
bagpipes. Winter does not like to let visitors leave before they
have at least tried to get the pipes blowing, and for promising
beginners, he will do the fingering for ``Scotland the Brave.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also cheap at the price of 1 pound is the Colbost Croft Museum,
in Colbost, a traditional stone crofter's cottage with thatched
roof, a dirt floor, some rudimentary sticks of furniture, a few
dishes, and an iron pot suspended over a peat fire in the center of
the main room. The replica of an illegal whisky still sits out
back. That's it. There is no guide and no commentary, but the
cottage speaks eloquently of the harsh conditions endured by the
crofters who scratched out half a living from their tiny plots,
barely managing to put potatoes and herring on the table.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's little ironies, the next-door neighbor
happens to be the Three Chimneys Restaurant, one of Skye's two
culinary temples, the other being the renowned Kinloch Lodge, run
by Lady Macdonald deep in the heart of Clan Donald territory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wretched crofter's cottage is the flip side of the proud
clan histories. In the late 18th century, when farmers from the
north of England learned that Cheviot sheep could survive the
Highland winters, they pushed northward, offering fat rents for
grazing land. In a miserable episode known as the clearances, the
clan chieftains forced their tenants off the land where they had
farmed and grazed sheep and cattle for generations. Thousands
emigrated, many of them to America. Skye became a hotbed of unrest,
and an uprising by crofters in Glendale led to land reforms that
still govern life on the island. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheep play a major role in the tourist experience on Skye. The
fuzzy little darlings like to gather in the middle of the road for
a quick confab, and the background music on the island is the quiet
but unmistakable tearing and crunching sound made by a vast woolly
army, teeth moving triple-time over succulent grass.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter disappointment to both of us that we missed the
sheep dog trials at Talisker, a chance to see ``Babe'' come to
life. But we did get the next-best thing. One fine evening, the
flock next door, a contented band supplemented by a pair of
arrogant roosters, a long-bearded goat, several rabbits and the
world's sweetest-tempered sheep dog, moved to the upper pasture.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic moment. Charlie, the dog, was now called upon
to do his best and round up the flock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Wendy,'' the owner shouted encouragingly. ``Don't forget
Janet, she's lagged behind.'' Charlie circled manically but, alas,
proved to be at best a C-plus sheep dog. Wendy tuned out the
nagging until she was good and ready to move along. Janet, wearing
a bland expression, continued to work on a promising patch of
grass. The flock moved across the road, one sheep short.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, something like a thought entered Janet's dim brain.
Sensing a sudden hush, she looked around, saw no one and emitted a
tentative bleat. There was no response. After puzzling over the
matter for several seconds, she flopped onto her side and fell
asleep. The last rays of light flashed off Loch Pooltiel, three
dark clouds scudded overhead and night fell over Skye. There would
be plenty of grass tomorrow.

TRANSFER OF SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA CRITICIZED

   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans said Tuesday their preliminary
investigation found the Clinton administration ``violated US
policy'' by providing China with sensitive satellite technology
that included military benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in a surprise floor speech,
also said GOP investigators had obtained ``new information''
showing that China tried to influence US elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott didn't provide much detail, he did say the next phase
of the investigation would look at why at least three US satellites
have been launched in China ``with no US monitors present.'' Lott
said the absence of US monitors, which previously has been
reported, is ``directly contrary to previous administration
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry said Lott's announcement
``struck me a little bit like Alice in Wonderland time.'' McCurry
said the Mississippian's floor speech was ``not a serious statement
by a serious person.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as happened last year when Republicans claimed they had
evidence about foreign influence in Democratic campaigns, the GOP
Tuesday declined to make public any back-up evidence to support
both the allegations about satellite technology and foreign
campaign contributions. Republicans said they are partly bound by
security regulations to keep the information secret.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they had not been allowed to contribute to the
interim report and that no actual report was approved or written.
Instead, the report amounted to Lott's release of a seven-page
statment of what he said various Senate committees have learned so
far about the satellite and fund-raising matters.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, said the evidence regarding the satellites was
good enough to ``remove all resistance to naming an independent
counsel to investigate the evidence and the allegations.''
Republicans have previously requested that the attorney general ask
for an independent counsel to examine Democratic campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also blasted the White House for failing to cooperate with
the investigations. Unless cooperation is forthcoming, Lott said,
he will be ``forced to consider other measures,'' including a
freeze on administration nominations and the use of new subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Lott's
action was ``partisanship at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Lott's statement focused on allegations that the Clinton
administration violated US policy by allowing an American company
to transfer satellite technology to China that could be used for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opened his speech by noting that when Vice President Gore
was a senator in 1989, Gore criticized the Bush administration for
allowing three US satellites to be exported to China. ``Allowing
these launches is not in the best interests of our country or of
our relationship with China,'' Gore said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said the Clinton administration has proceeded to do
just what Gore complained about a decade ago, allowing China to
launch satellites provided by Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Loral's chairman, Bernard Schwartz, is one of the biggest donors
to the Democratic Party. Republicans are investigating whether
there is a link between the campaign contributions and Clinton's
issuance of a waiver that allowed China to launch the Loral
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said an unnamed senior official of the Defense Trade and
Security Administration told a congressional committee last month
that the government has failed in its effort to control the
transfer of US technology with military implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formal process ... has failed in its stated mission, to
safeguard the national security of the United States,'' the
official said, according to Lott. However, the testimony was not
released, making it impossible to know the context of the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
international security heard testimony last week that Defense
Department monitors are not required to be present at launches of
US satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said this contradicts administration claims, although Lott
noted there is no statute requiring US monitors to be present.
Furthermore, Lott said China had derived significant benefits from
the launch of US satellites. He noted that China had five launch
failures between 1991 to 1996. But since China benefited from the
knowledge obtained during the launch of US satellites, China has
suffered no launch failures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the assertion that China received a military benefit from
US satellites, the Senate majority leader said, ``We have
established a great number of crossover benefits between a
commercial space launch program and the development of ballistic
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's sweeping charges were reminiscent of the way Senator Fred
Thompson opened his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings
last year by declaring he had proof China sought to influence
Democratic election campaigns. But Thompson failed to publicly
provide such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lott said investigators had obtained information about
the influence of China in US elections that is ``new since Senator
Thompson concluded his review.'' Lott declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said Lott was making misleading
statements about the panel's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that the committee has reached some kind of
conclusion,'' Kerrey said. ``It most assuredly has not.''

 &HT;    Powell tells convention-goers to set examples
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a young military commander, Colin Powell knew he
could face questions of whether his position was the result of
affirmative action. Powell, who later became a general and chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, set out to prove these skeptics wrong
by making sure his was the best unit around.
</P>
<P>
   Those who obtain opportunities through affirmative action need
to do the same, he told participants of the NAACP convention on
Tuesday _ they need to perform at the highest level to prove
affirmative action opponents wrong about the level of competency
among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potential recipients of affirmative action _ high
school students _ know the naysayers are out there.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon session on affirmative action for about 500
members of the youth and college division of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, students worried
about how they would be perceived if they were the beneficiaries of
affirmative action in college admissions, jobs and federal
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Katrice Stinson, a second-year law student at Mercer University,
said affirmative action is owed to blacks and that the students
need not worry about what others think of them, as long as they
perform when given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing preferential about being African-American,''
said Stinson, adding while blacks lag behind whites in standardized
test scores, they do just as well, or better in most cases, once
they are admitted. ``This is something we deserve. If race isn't
used as a factor to help level the playing field, you can't get in.
Then what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who was forceful Tuesday in his support of affirmative
action, said it's important officials at educational institutions
be certain their campuses are diverse. ``This is the only way it
will reflect all of American and not just part of America,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Republican, Powell said his support of affirmative
action came ``not as an academic, but as a soldier who saw it work.
I saw what you could do in the Army when you have affirmative
action.

 &HT;    African-Americans shouldn't let cultural standards shape their
views, panelists say
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The friction slave owners created between black people
of different hues has no place in the African-American community,
young NAACP delegates said Tuesday, and they are determined to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   In a movement that works to advance all black people,
African-Americans must resist media and entertainment images that
supplant cohesiveness, the delegates said. From teen to teen to
teen, they proclaimed the only way to eradicate the centuries-old
problem, is to adopt and adhere to a standard of beauty they define
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There was standing room only during the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People's youth seminar titled ``What Are
You Looking At? Our Image: Lessons, Lies and Liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons started hundreds of years ago during slavery, said
panelist Selena Swan from Vibe magazine, which writes about the
black music industry. But the lies are perpetuated by the media and
entertainment industries in their selection of heroines and
negative portrayals of black people in the news, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some magazines now regularly feature models with prominent
African features, Swan said, but they should not set the tone for
how black people feel about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some change,'' she said. ``My thing is why do we have
to wait for them to think it's popular before we change?''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Richardson, a youth delegate from New York, drew rousing
applause with his assessment of the effect on the black community.
``You have to think about the psychology of what's going on,'' he
said. ``We have our own people bleaching their hair until it falls
out. Respect yourself!''
</P>
<P>
   For some, that call is easier to heed than it is for others,
said Amanda Henley, an 18-year-old delegate from Pennsylvania. ``It
all depends on the confidence your parents instill in you,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Scott, a 27-year-old observer from Charlotte, N.C.,
implored the proud teenagers in the room to take on the
esteem-building role for other youth in their families and
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take leadership for ourselves,'' he said. ``We need
to go back home and plant the seed in younger brothers and sisters
as to what it means to be a beautiful black woman.''

 &HT;    Day 1 of job fair receives praise
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Laurel Green, 22, said she's glad the NAACP's annual
Diversity Job Fair lasts two days. Otherwise, she said she'd never
get through it in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought 30 resumes with me. I have no idea how many I've
handed out today,'' she said on Monday, Day 1 of the job fair. A
recent Shaw University graduate, Green said the fair is much more
diverse than the others she's attended this year. She said she is
looking for a job in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Wakefield, a recruiter from the Georgia-based American
Family Life Assurance Co. of Columbus, said she was impressed with
the candidates she had seen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very pleased,'' Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 companies attended the fair, sponsored by the
NAACP National Labor Department. The fair runs from noon to 6:30
p.m. today in the Georgia World Congress Center. The job fair is
free and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice King fought her own anger
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., addressed her own struggles in an address Monday to the youth
NAACP members.
</P>
<P>
   King said she had become increasingly angry and
``self-destructive'' over the years while trying to deal with the
deaths of her father and other relatives who were close to her. She
said the culmination came when she considered suicide when she
landed in academic trouble after her first year of law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I saw before me was failure. I said, `My God, if I don't
come out of this, then the whole world would know that Dr. King's
daughter is a failure,''' she said. ``God really, literally, came
into my home and told me to put that knife down, because I had a
reason and a purpose for living.''
</P>
<P>
   King encouraged the audience to recognize that they are destined
for greatness as well, and that their family or academic
circumstances do not have to dictate their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, today, is the beginning of your new life regardless of
what happened yesterday,'' she said. ``Stop replaying the tape.
Live in the present.''

 &HT;    Delegates urged to focus energies on what they do best
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's local need and then there's national agenda.
But even when the two are quite different, local NAACP chapters are
finding ways to champion both.
</P>
<P>
   This week, leaders within the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People have encouraged branches to
concentrate on what the country's oldest civil rights organization
does best and share the work of lifting the black community with
other African-American organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, NAACP chairman, emphasized the point Sunday evening
when he told delegates that they need to do old things better,
specifically organization, mobilization, litigation and coalition.
They must remember that the primary mission is fighting white
supremacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, revisited the
issue and warned branches not to stretch themselves thin by trying
to be all things to all people.
</P>
<P>
   He implored them to use the resources of the National Bar
Association, the Urban League and black sororities and fraternities
to help solve social problems plaguing the black community.
</P>
<P>
   For branches in metropolitan areas, those other organizations
are available. But what about rural towns? And what about the
problems that lie outside of the purview of litigation and
mobilization such as teen pregnancy, poor school performance and
drug-use prevention?
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said some branches in rural areas will likely need to be
all things to all people, and they can try to be. However, he said,
the national organization cannot stray from its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Branch leaders say there's room for it all if necessary.
Furthermore, they said, Bond and Mfume's platforms are more
liberating than limiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have clear direction. A few years ago, I can't say the
leadership we had provided that for us,'' said Wes Mooney Jr.,
treasurer of the Waukesha, Wis., NAACP branch. ``But now we know
what we are about. ... Before, we were all going in different
directions and the populace would say, `What do you stand for?' and
`What are you about?' Now we can say we are about A, B and C with
clear-cut goals and objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to abandon social programs just because they
are not NAACP areas of expertise, said Madalynne Brooks of the
Lakeland, Fla., branch which operates a tutoring, teen-pregnancy
prevention and drug-use prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel we should put anything aside because it is
necessary,'' said Brooks, branch membership chairwoman. ``The need
is so great.''
</P>
<P>
   That branch shares its social service work with fraternities and
other civic organizations. And when the branch needs to support the
national protest, political and legal agenda, it enlists the help
of anyone _ even nonmembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go in the highways and hedges and byways to find people,''
said Brooks, 78, who joined the organization 60 years ago. ``When
we are boycotting we go anywhere we can to get people. We'll go
into the juke joint and get people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charles Town, W.V., the local branch takes Bond's advice on
being organizers to continue its social agenda, said branch
president George Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have to be about political action and fighting
racial discrimination,'' said Rutherford, whose town of 35,000 is
10 percent African-American. ``But anything that can help to
improve black people, we should play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, his branch organized a teen youth program that
focuses on education and social and recreational activities. But
once it organized the program, the branch turned it over to the
local Masons to run and kept a supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mesiah, branch president in Buffalo, N.Y., said the local
NAACP volunteers must meet people's basic needs before promoting a
political and judicial agenda. ``It's not going to make sense to
talk to people about voter registration when their stomachs are
empty,'' he said.

 &HT;    Solving the puzzle of cancer's race gap
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Black Americans are more likely than whites to develop
cancer and to die of it. Doctors have known of this troubling
disparity _and have guessed some of the reasons behind it _ for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   What doctors don't have is enough solid information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some biological component to it, as there are
economical, cultural and environmental components. We need a
balanced approach,'' said Lovell Jones, co-chairman of the
Houston-based Intercultural Cancer Center, which addresses cancer
incidence and deaths among minorities. The NAACP, which is among
ICC's member organizations, will address the issue of cancer in the
African-American community at its convention today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't say that it's all poverty and then walk away,
because that gets into blaming the victim,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists haven't ignored the issue, but the puzzle of why
blacks suffer disproportionately from cancer won't be solved by
research alone _ it will take policy and social changes. Research
financing for minority health issues has only in the past few
decades become a health policy priority. And once scientists have
some answers, translating them to effective prevention and
treatment will be another hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 454 blacks out of 100,000 were likely to develop
cancer, compared to 394 whites out of 100,000, according to the
American Cancer Society. In addition, blacks are 30 percent more
likely to die of cancer than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Certain types of cancer are more common among blacks than other
racial or ethnic populations. Blacks have the highest prevalence of
lung cancer, the leading killer among cancers. Black men have much
higher incidence of prostate cancer than white men. Black women
develop breast cancer slightly less often than white women but are
more likely to die of it.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors may play a role.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Americans are more likely than whites, although less
likely than Native Americans or Hispanics, to lack health
insurance. This leads to later diagnoses of medical problems,
reducing chances of successful treatment and survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less early detection, less access to screening,'' said
Dr. Michael Thun, who heads epidemiological research for the cancer
society.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacks also tend to have other risk factors such as obesity,
smoking and poor nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colon cancer is heavily related to diet,'' said Dr. Otis
Brawley, an oncologist at the National Cancer Institute in
Rockville, Md. ``People with high-fat, low-fiber diets are more
likely to get it. There are several different black cultures in the
United States, but the dietary habits are generally those favoring
colon cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Biological differences between blacks and people of other
racial or ethnic backgrounds may also be a factor in cancer
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   Sickle cell anemia often is cited as an example of a genetically
inherited disease that is more common among, although not exclusive
to, blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week that showed that blacks absorb more
nicotine from cigarette smoking than whites or Mexican-Americans is
further evidence that biological differences are medically
significant.
</P>
<P>
   But research must be done to determine whether genetic or
metabolic differences contribute to blacks' high cancer rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why the rate of prostate cancer in
African-American men is more than that of white Americans,'' said
Charles Jackson, the cancer society's director of advocacy for
special populations.
</P>
<P>
   To help answer that question, the cancer society and other
organizations, including the NAACP, have drawn up a plan to reduce
the disproportionate number of prostate cancer cases among black
men, primarily by pushing for more research and education for
doctors and patients. Other programs, such as a nationwide breast
cancer early detection program for uninsured women, are aimed at
high-risk populations with poor access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   The problem can be solved, oncologists say. Jones points to the
now decreasing rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease
among blacks. He attributes this decline to concerted efforts by
scientific organizations as well as individual black doctors. The
same must be done for cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough black cardiologists to have an association of
black cardiologists,'' Jones said. ``But there aren't enough
oncologists to have an association of minority oncologists.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes must come from health care policy, doctors
and minority advocates agree. Health care must become more
flexible, to accommodate the needs of patients. Brawley recalls a
woman with breast cancer whose employer wouldn't let her come in
late a few times a week so she could receive radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a job like that, I'd quit it and go on to another
one,'' Brawley said. ``Whereas she can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to commitment,'' Jones said. ``I've heard a lot
of beautiful statements, and I'm still waiting for the
commitment.''

HERALDING A NEW ERA, BABBITT CHIPS AWAY AT HARMFUL RIVER DAMS

<P>
   RICHVALE, Calif. _ Standing amidst one of the most elaborately
engineered hydraulic systems in the world, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt took a sledge hammer to a dam in California's Central
Valley on Tuesday, heralding the start of what he said would be an
era when many of the nation's 75,000 dams would be judged by
whether they did more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was that those who cheered the dismantling of the
half-century old McPherrin Dam in 100-degree heat included some of
the most battle-scarred veterans of California's waters wars _ the
ranchers, irrigators and urban water managers who have gained the
most from a century of federal dam subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one small blow for salmon,'' said Babbitt, with evident
glee, as he chipped away at the dam on Butte Creek, a major
tributary of the Sacramento River that used to have one of the
biggest salmon runs in the state. ``Dams are not like the pyramids
of Egypt that stand for eternity. They are instruments that should
be judged by the health of the rivers to which they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's words were in stark contrast to the heyday of
dam-building, when Westerners gathered under a hot sun to cheer
politicians breaking ground for big, concrete breaches on the major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could not have happened 10, 20 or 30 years ago,'' said
Timothy Quinn, deputy general manager of the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, which pulls water from every part
of this state to satisfy the greater Los Angeles area. ``The water
wars have given away to something entirely new.''
</P>
<P>
   The dam dismantling was the latest of Babbitt's recharged
environmental initiatives, coming at a time when he is viewed as
treading water in Washington because he is under investigation by
an independent counsel. The prosecutor is examining whether
campaign contributions to the Democratic Party influenced Interior
Department decisions with Indian tribes competing over the awarding
of a casino. Babbitt says he has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Babbitt will chink away at the first dam scheduled
for demolition in order to help endangered species in the Pacific
Northwest, a small dam in Medford, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been courting support from Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., who controls Interior Department spending in the Senate,
to tear down the Elwha Dam outside Olympic National Park in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In the next five years, up to 250 older dams will come up for
licensing renewal. Many of the most environmentally destructive
ones will not be renewed, Babbitt said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, dam removal proposals were considered
radical, with no chance of succeeding. Dams were built and
subsidized by the federal government, regardless of environmental
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the threat that court rulings on behalf of endangered
fish could shut down some dams, many of the beneficiaries of the
water projects have come around to environmental restoration _ as
long they can get their water from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly good for salmon,'' said Laverne McPherrin, the
patriarch of a ranching family that grows rice on 1,700 acres here.
The family, one of several ranching clans that have used most of
the water backed up by the dam, is now getting its water from
another diversion, one that is less lethal to salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a win-win? That depends,'' McPherrin said. ``We'll see
in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   More enthusiastic was Marc Reisner, the author of ``Cadillac
Ranch,'' a seminal book on the environmental cost of Western water
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the good guys now,'' said Reisner, pointing to the
managers of the Los Angeles water district. ``Nobody's ox is
getting gored. Everybody is benefiting.''
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans were guardedly supportive of the
ceremonial demolition Tuesday in the Central Valley, largely
because no major water users were complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tearing down dams should be the rare exception, not the
rule,'' said Rep. Walley Herger, R-Calif., a former rancher who
represents this district north of Sacramento. ``Secretary Babbitt
should make no mistake. The West would never sit idly by while the
extremists of the environmental community try to destroy these
vital structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxed in by Congress on a number of environmental issues,
Babbitt says he has been using the inherent powers of the interior
secretary, and laws passed in the 1970s and '80s but rarely used,
to reorder how much of the natural world in the United States is
governed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he brought wolves back to the Southwest,
announced a series of plans by private landowners to protect
endangered species, and has steered water projects toward
environmental restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the environmental movement in the 20th century
has been fencing off and preserving the back twenty,'' Babbitt
said, in reference to establishment of national parks and
wilderness preserves. ``But the real action now is on landscapes
and watersheds. It is about restoration writ large.''
</P>
<P>
   The political gains of such a strategy were evident two years
ago, he said, when concerns about Republican efforts to roll back
environmental safeguards hurt several incumbent members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen ninety-six was the year we successfully reassembled
the Teddy Roosevelt coalition of hunters, anglers and outdoor
lovers with other conservationists,'' Babbitt said. ``What I've
learned is that you can play defense in the Congress. But the
offensive game, and all the fun, is outside of Congress.'' &QL;

RAMBLES ALONG A REMOTE SHORE

<P>
   VANCOUVER ISLAND, British Columbia _ Crossing Vancouver Island
on the Pacific Rim Highway that traverses it, you see an opening
up, a broadening of the horizon, about halfway across as the
Mackenzie Mountains come into view and signs of civilization
dwindle to nothing. The patchwork shades of green covering the
slopes, as you come closer, turn out to be immense reforestation
projects in various stages of growth. Logging is an important part
of the history of this island, as it is of all of British Columbia,
and some of these giant forests of ancient cedar, Douglas fir and
Sitka spruce were cut in the late 19th century. Other sections
along the highway were logged as recently as the early 1990s. The
new trees, and those from the '40s and '50s that are now imposing
evergreens, are posted with neat company signs giving the
reforestation dates. The waves of green stretch on endlessly,
monotone within their individual sections, broken occasionally by a
section of clear-cutting littered with ghostly silver spurs, stumps
and low bushy growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this quiltlike pattern of intrusion, the landscape is
magnificent. Vista succeeds vista from the high mountain passes,
and the snaking two-lane road twists down to skirt the shallow,
rushing Taylor River and deep lakes. Only when you see the mighty
old-growth forest where it has survived on the west coast (or
earlier near Port Alberni, where there is a small park of old
trees, Cathedral Grove, along the road) do you realize what once
was here, and how puny the replacement forest is in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   After a drive of five to six hours (a lunch stop is the
variable) from Victoria, at the southern tip of the island, the
road descends toward the Pacific, and you can sense the ocean but
can't see it. At the coast, the highway reaches a junction with the
road between the two small towns of Ucluelet and Tofino.
</P>
<P>
   When we made this trip last August, my husband, Michael, and I
had few preconceived notions. I had wanted to visit Vancouver
Island for years, in part because my grandfather and father were
both loggers here decades ago. As a child, my father rode a pony to
school on the island, when it was still mostly wilderness (the road
into Tofino was built in 1956, and paved only in 1972).
</P>
<P>
   Having seen my share of bleak little Western towns, I assumed
Tofino wouldn't be much different. In fact, the small port is
lively and picturesque, on a breezy harbor backed by mountains,
dotted with islands, looking out over Clayoquot Sound and the
Pacific stretching all the way to Japan. (Although when the fog
rolls in off the ocean, as it often does, the views disappear in
moments.) Meares Island, still clothed in its ancient cedars, rises
steeply across Tofino Inlet on one side, with a village of the
Clayoquot people at its base that has been in that spot for
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the town's pleasant cafes and restaurants have decks
or porches where you can sit and look out to sea or watch the
bustle at the pier as an endless succession of small tour boats,
kayaks, Zodiacs and seaplanes set out on whale-watching or other
expeditions. Along with a surprising number of young backpackers
and tourists from Europe, particularly Germans, we saw several
groups of young hippies who looked straight out of the '60s. They
had found, it seems, one of the ``last good places.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the night in a funky small Tofino hotel on a
quiet, lovely ocean cove, we picked up supplies and drove a short
distance toward the cottage we had rented for a week on Frank
Island _ actually no island, but a small point of rocky land
extending into the ocean from Chesterman Beach. The lack of road
access is both its charm and its drawback. We had to haul our stuff
more than a mile down the beach (after parking in the spot
pre-arranged with the cottage's owners), but it was well worth it.
For the one-room-with-views cottage became a base from which to
explore this amazingly beautiful corner of the world, alternating
between somnolence on our small, perfectly sited deck where we
could watch the resident bald eagle wheel in at sunset, and
expeditions ``off island.''
</P>
<P>
   This section of coast is protected as part of the huge Pacific
Rim National Park Reserve, 78 miles long (but not continuous),
which is divided into three units, one of them the famous 45-mile
West Coast Trail. Tofino is just above the northern border of the
Long Beach unit of the park, which includes spectacular wide sandy
beaches and a number of easy walking trails, as well as longer and
tougher hikes. (The third unit is made up of the Broken Islands
Group between Ucluelet and Bamfield in Barkley Sound.) And although
initially we were disappointed to see the paved parking lots at the
head of the trails, with carefully maintained boardwalks rather
than footpaths on some of them, we came to appreciate these
amenities. When you're not watching out for your feet, you can look
up. And your gaze shouldn't be earthbound on the Rain Forest Trail,
where, despite the nearness of the road, you are soon surrounded by
gigantic western red cedars and western hemlocks, some more than
300 feet high, with a dense undergrowth of shrubs, an assortment of
brilliant green ferns ranging from tiny to enormous, and carpets of
lichen and moss. (From our car, we later saw a black bear stuffing
himself with berries near here.)
</P>
<P>
   Another fascinating walk, absolutely flat and quite tame, is the
Shorepine Bog Trail, also a boardwalk, just a half-mile circuit.
But it had a slightly romantic cast from its name in the French
interpretative brochure we picked up at the entrance (no English
versions were left): ``Le sentier de la tourbiere des pins tordus''
_ literally, the path of the bog of twisted pines. Here, in an open
landscape of stunted growth, the bog has created a world of
miniature trees and plants, with hummocks of sphagnum moss in the
boggiest parts rising out of the expanses of sedge like small,
cunning Japanese gardens _ a bit spooky and wonderfully strange. As
at many of the shore-side trails in the reserve, you can leave the
boardwalk and follow a trail to the beach, with the roar of the
surf to guide you.
</P>
<P>
   To see the grandest trees, the 800-year-old cedars with enormous
girths, we went to Meares Island, which is not part of the park, a
short boat ride across Tofino harbor. Down along the docks, local
entrepreneurs buzz back and forth ferrying people to the island in
small outboards, establishing a time to come back and pick them up.
We stayed a few hours, plenty of time to complete the boardwalk
trail; several backpackers were being deposited for a half or full
day to follow the 18-mile footpath, tougher going with twisted
roots and patches of mud along the way, that makes a circuit around
this part of the island.

BLACK DESCENDANT OF CONFEDERATE CAPTAIN CAN'T PRTICIPATE IN
CEREMONY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emerson Emory of Dallas, a black psychiatrist and a
proud descendant of a Civil War veteran, was eager to participate
in this week's dedication ceremonies for a new African American
Civil War Memorial in the nation's capital. There's just one
problem: Emory's ancestor fought for the South.
</P>
<P>
   Emory, who had planned to lay a wreath honoring the Union's
178,000 black soldiers, was dropped from thursday's program at
Arlington National Cemetery because his great-grandfather fought
for the Confederacy in the 13th Texas Cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   A letter revoking Emory's invitation to the event said his
participation on behalf of the Sons of Confederate Veterans would
detract from the memorial's purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The belief and philosophy of this project and foundation
emphasize the struggle for attainment of freedom,'' Walter Hill,
the project's chief historian wrote Emory. ``We view the existence
of the Confederacy as a barrier to this cause and the freedom of
African American slaves and free people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill also told Emory that the memorial's backers do ``not share
and believe in the traditions and symbolism of the Confederate
States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 million memorial will be built with private funding on
federal land in Washington's Shaw neighborhood. The area is named
for Col. Robert Gould Shaw, who led the black Massachusetts
regiment depicted in the movie, ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   The dedication ceremonies start on Wednesday with a symposium on
the role of black Union troops, followed by a tribute on Thursday
at Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial's centerpiece, a
bronze sculpture depicting a soldier leaving his family for war,
will be unveiled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Emory, 73, said the memorial's backers misinterpreted history
and his motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to with me wishing to perpetuate slavery, but
only honoring people who died in battle,'' he said. ``I'm going to
put my wreath down anyway, even if it has to be in the middle of
the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory traces his Civil War ties to Capt. Henry Hancock, a white
slaveowner from Nacogdoches. Hancock died in battle, but not before
fathering a daughter by one his slaves. The daughter was Emory's
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Orlebeke of Dallas, who heads the Sons of Confederate
Veterans, said he asked Emory to represent the 25,000-member
organization at the dedication ceremonies in a symbolic display of
healing. Orlebeke said the South had at least 70,000 black troops,
including many who carried weapons. The Confederate descendants'
organization has about a dozen black members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a bunch of racists,'' Orlebeke said. ``We're trying
to extend the hand of friendship from our black troops to their
black troops, and it was refused.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory, a World War II veteran, said he is proud of his
Confederate ancestor, even if he was on the wrong side of history.
He summarized his view of the war in a poem, ``A Salute To The
Blue, From The Gray,'' that he had hoped to read at the dedication
ceremony:
</P>
<P>
   ``For while gray and blue are colors/
</P>
<P>
   For which men have fought and died./
</P>
<P>
   There was no color to the courage/
</P>
<P>
   That was shown by either side.''

 VANCOUVER ISLAND: the island.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On another day, we drove up Radar Hill, a World War II radar
installation with sweeping views up and down the coast. Although we
didn't take the steep, long hike down to the beach, we did follow
the half-mile Schooner Trail through majestic, mossy forest, down
to Schooner Cove, yet another perfect beach (they're a dime a dozen
around here) with no more than a handful of people on it. Just next
door stretched Long Beach, all 6.8 miles of it, the centerpiece of
the Pacific Rim Park, and its most popular area.
</P>
<P>
   But we hardly needed to seek out beaches, since facing Frank
Island was a fine one. Unlike the majority of the beaches on this
stretch of coast, Chesterman is not part of the park, and is
developed. Although it is lined with private houses and a few
bed-and-breakfasts _ attractive homes, most large and expensive
looking _ they are almost invisible under a heavy fringe of
towering old-growth trees. Quite visible on a rocky point at the
end of the curving beach is the Wickaninnish Inn, a handsome
46-room hotel that opened in August 1996. We drove in to take a
look, and were impressed with the well-designed, three-story cedar
post-and-beam structure, the splendid views and the spacious,
high-ceilinged dining room looking over the water. (Seeing a few of
the luxurious rooms with fireplaces and ocean views, we wished we
could stay on.) The restaurant, the one elegant dining spot in the
area, was fully booked, so we reserved for a few days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, we decided to hike down the beach to dinner,
which was delightful at sunset, and considerably more challenging
on the return, by flashlight, after a bottle of excellent Reserve
'95 Blue Mountain pinot gris, from a British Columbia vineyard. The
sophisticated menu, starring local fish as well as entries from
Hawaii and other seas, was impressive, and the service was
attentive _ all in all, a surprise on these remote shores.
</P>
<P>
   Our most adventurous trip was to Hot Springs Cove, one of the
popular excursions out of Tofino, which takes a good half day (the
sunset version sounded enticing too). We signed on to a comfortable
cabin cruiser for the hour-and-a-half trip up the coast, along with
about 10 other passengers and our First Nations captain (the
Indians in the region are called First Nations people) and his crew
of one. Along the way, we did a little whale-watching, adjusting
the route when the captain heard whales had been spotted in the
vicinity. Because he was generous sharing his radio information, a
couple of Zodiacs crammed with whale-watchers rushed to our
location more than once, but the most any of us saw were several
tantalizing spouts. (Mid-March to early April is the high season
for seeing migrating gray whales in these waters.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we came into a deep cove that felt more like a
fjord, and debarked along with another boatload at the wharf for
the one-mile boardwalk trek through more lovely forest, carrying
our bathing suits and towels. The natural hot springs, long used by
the Indians, are now part of a provincial park. Up above the
shoreline are a cluster of small steaming, rocky pools, with
towering trees as backdrop. (There is a clean bathhouse for
changing, but no facilities.) After soaking in the water _ at the
upper limit of tolerable heat for me _ along with a handful of
other visitors, and edging along from one pool to the other, we
felt too Jell-O-like to clamber down the sharp, slippery rocks to
the water's edge. Some did, and they could actually sit in small
hot puddles trickling down the rocks while gentle cool waves broke
around them.
</P>
<P>
   It's the luck of the draw here whether you encounter just a few
other bathers or find yourself part of a loud and hilarious group _
something about the communal pools and the setting makes people
giggly. Not long after we arrived, a slightly boisterous ``Hi,
Dude'' group left to meet their boat, and the rest of us soaked in
relative serenity, looking out at the Pacific, where whispers of
fog were starting to drift in.
</P>
<P>
   After that day of exertion, we stayed put on our minuscule
island home, doing nothing more exciting than exploring the
colorful tidal pools. Our sole neighbor came bounding over the
rocks at midday, breaking the understood code of solitude to bring
us a wild salmon that he had caught and cleaned a half-hour before.
After grilling it on the barbecue that night, we resolved one
gastronomic issue: the mystique of wild salmon, its quality versus
that of the farm-raised version, is no myth. The dense, delicious
fish tasted unforgettably of the deep Pacific.

BASTILLE DAY: A LITTLE POMP AND A LOT OF SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Basking in the reflected glory of France's World Cup
soccer championship, President Jacques Chirac appealed to his
compatriots Tuesday, Bastille Day, not to lose the upbeat victory
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At heart this victory showed solidarity and cohesion and
showed that France had a soul, or more precisely was trying to find
one,'' he said in a nationally televised conversation with two
journalists at a reception in the vast garden of the presidential
Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities quickly turned into yet another celebration of
the French national soccer team, Chirac's guests of honor, who won
the championship with a 3-0 victory over Brazil on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we keep a good part of this national feeling after
these festivities,'' added Chirac, whose popularity has soared to
the highest level in three years as the national mood has improved,
primed by an upswing in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist prime minister with whom the conservative Chirac
has had to share power since last year, Lionel Jospin, came to the
festivities today with half his government and several thousand
other guests. Most of them were soccer tournament volunteers,
athletes, low-ranking soldiers and sailors, and students Chirac
invited to liven up the party.
</P>
<P>
   Liven it up they did, greeting the soccer team's arrival with an
impromptu version of the national anthem, the ``Marseillaise,''
even before Chirac had finished the interview with the two
television journalists at the other end of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Later both he and Jospin happily submitted to the crush of the
crowd around the players as a recorded chorus of ``We Are the
Champions,'' a 1970s hit by the British rock group Queen, rattled
the palace.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his sometimes uneasy ``cohabitation'' with Jospin,
the president said, ``France should speak with one voice to the
world, and it does.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether he thought the government, which took office
on June 1, 1997, had brought about the economic recovery, Chirac
said, ``The government shares responsibility,'' but added, ``The
growth we see now is due in large part to the efforts of the
previous governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two governments before Jospin's were headed by Chirac's
conservatives, who were defeated last year by a Socialist-led
coalition that promised to make jobs the priority instead of
unpopular deficit-cutting austerity policies that the conservatives
had said were needed to qualify France for a European common
currency.
</P>
<P>
   With the recovery, the Socialists were able to bring the deficit
down to 3.1 percent of France's gross domestic product, and Jospin,
who is more popular than the president now, has said France should
be able to get it down to 2.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Chirac said that, with unemployment still at 11.9 percent
despite the recovery, ``We should remember that growth isn't enough
to reduce long-term unemployment, and that's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He also indirectly criticized Jospin's government for changing
immigration rules this year in response to leftist criticism that
conservative policies were inhumanely strict. ``We should take a
position and then stick to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's new policies, under which illegal immigrants were
invited to register and then half were told they did not qualify
for residence and would have to leave, have also been criticized by
the Socialists' Green and Communist coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the sun shining and a breeze blowing over the
garden, Tuesday was another day for celebrating the symbolism of
France's team, itself evidence of the racial and cultural
integration of many ethnic groups. .
</P>
<P>
   Its key playmaker, Zinedine Zidane, a native of Algeria who grew
up in Marseille, got more cheers in Chirac's own backyard than the
president did.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the tricolor, Chirac noted, was itself
multicolored _ ``a nice image of France,'' he said. ``They showed
an image of a France that wins, and wins together.''

U.N.'S IMPATIENCE GROWS OVER AFGHAN RESTRICTIONS ON AID WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The top U.N. official responsible for
Afghanistan said Tuesday that patience was running out with the
militant Islamic movement that controls most of the country and
that its disruptive stream of edicts has jeopardized all
international aid programs there.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, known as the the Taliban, Tuesday renewed an
ultimatum to all private aid organizations to move collectively
into an abandoned and broken down student hostel outside the Afghan
capital, Kabul, or leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an organization that hands out edicts to us that
prevent us from doing our job,'' said the official, Lakhdar
Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister who is U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Anna's special envoy for Afghanistan. He is in New
York to attend a meeting Tuesday of countries aiding Afghanistan
and one on Friday of U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Taliban, who have sought to gain tighter
control over relief agencies and make their workers abide by its
strict version of Islamic law, issued an edict forcing all foreign
Muslim women working for the United Nations to be accompanied by a
close male relative.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Taliban and the United Nations reached a broad
agreement to cooperate on working conditions in Afghanistan. That
pact was reached after tensions between Taliban representatives and
the United Nations led to a physical assault on one worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of that agreement, things are not what they should be
on the ground in Afghanistan,'' Brahimi said. He said he had told
the Security Council on Tuesday morning that the Taliban ``don't
seem to be taking any decision that is right concerning the work of
the humanitarian community in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are extremely concerned, worried,'' he said. ``We have
already informed the Taliban that this is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Brahimi defended the May agreement with the Taliban, which has
been criticized by some aid organizations and United Nations
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement that we have was indispensable, even if it has
weaknesses,'' he said. ``It was necessary to talk to the Taliban.
It was necessary to see if we can find a basis for us to work in
acceptable conditions. If these conditions are not acceptable my
opinion is that we will have to tell the Taliban: You have signed
an agreement. You will implement it, or let us go and work
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Both donor nations and U.N. agencies as well as private relief
groups have faced calls for a withdrawal of foreign workers and a
curtailment of the aid on which the country depends for emergency
medical and food needs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, the U.N.
coordinator for Afghanistan, said that after the May agreement was
signed, there was ``tremendous enthusiasm'' in some ministries in
Kabul that deal with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Witschi-Cestari, who is based in Pakistan, said that the accord
provided some positive results, especially in rural areas, where
cooperation increased and aid programs began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Taliban hard-liners in the ministry
for the prevention of vice and the promotion of virtue began to
issue contrary orders attacking many development programs,
Witschi-Cestari said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Taliban who know that they have to come to terms
with the international community,'' he said. But how the divisions
and ambiguities in the movement resolve themselves remains to be
seen, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for agencies to pull back are coming at a time when
peace in large areas Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban _
combined with good rain and international aid programs and projects
to remove land mines _ have allowed Afghanistan to produce its
largest harvest since the late 1970s, before the 1979 Soviet
invasion and the years of civil war that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban, which controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan,
recently reopened fighting to take more land from opponents in the
country's north. Tuesday the Security Council called on all sides
to declare a cease-fire and resume talks that broke down May 3.
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential statement, just short of a resolution, the
Council also noted that the Taliban had signed the May agreement
pledging its cooperation with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing the Security Council on Tuesday, Brahimi told
reporters, ``The Taliban must know that not only is there a limit
to what you can stand, but that there are growing pressures on us _
in particular from the donor community _ to say that there's a
limit.''

STARR SEEKS TESTIMONY FROM SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emboldened by a recent court victory, Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr has issued subpoenas for the
testimony of a dozen Secret Service agents for evidence of
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
administration officials and lawyers involved in the inquiry said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas ordered Larry Cockell, the agent in charge of the
presidential detail, along with other agents he supervises who
guard Clinton, to appear before the federal grand jury that is
investigating whether anyone committed obstruction of justice,
perjury or witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Two administration officials said the subpoenas required some of
the agents to appear before the grand jury on Thursday. In
response, the officials said, the administration was preparing to
file a sealed motion for a protective order that would block the
testimony of any agents while the Justice Department pursued a
further appeal of its contention that the agents should not be
compelled to testify. Attorney General Janet Reno filed a brief
Tuesday arguing that the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia should review the issue.
</P>
<P>
   As the legal battle was taking shape, a former Pentagon
colleague of Ms. Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, completed her fifth
appearance before the grand jury. Mrs. Tripp initiated the inquiry
when she called the independent counsel's office last January. She
is expected to return to the grand jury on Thursday, her spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas for the agents were issued following the decision
by a federal appeals panel last week upholding an order for the
testimony of three other Secret Service officials. The three-judge
panel of the court of appeals broadly rejected a claim by the
Treasury Department, which oversees the Secret Service, that agents
should be entitled to invoke a novel kind of privilege to maintain
the confidence of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department invoked the privilege to limit the
testimony of John Kelleher, the chief counsel to the Secret
Service, and two uniformed officers, Gary Byrne and Brian
Henderson. Investigators had sought to question the three men about
conversations they may have had about Ms. Lewinsky, who had worked
in the White House, lawyers involved in the inquiry said.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, Byrne had apparently informed Evelyn
Lieberman, then the deputy chief-of-staff at the White House, that
he had seen Ms. Lewinsky in the West Wing when he did not believe
she was authorized to be there. Ms. Lieberman has said that Ms.
Lewinsky was transferred to the Pentagon and removed from her White
House job because of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge ordered the three Secret Service officials
to testify, the administration unsuccessfully appealed to the
three-judge panel. It gave the Justice Department seven days to
request that the full bench hear any further appeals. Such reviews
are rarely granted, but the move strongly suggests that the
administration will ultimately take the matter to the Supreme
Court, which would not decide whether to hear the case until after
its new term begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   The administration painted a dire picture of the consequences of
last week's decision compelling the testimony of the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case involves a national interest of the first magnitude:
the safety of the president of the United States,'' Ms. Reno
contended in the brief. ``The Secret Service has explained clearly
and unequivocally in uncontroverted declarations that the absence
of a privilege will gravely impair its ability to protect the
president and is likely to result in a national tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the independent counsel's office have
questioned more than 20 agents _ most outside the grand jury _ but
not about Clinton, lawyers involved in the inquiry said. The
questions have focused on the operations of the White House and on
Ms. Lewinsky's visits. Security records indicate that after she was
transferred to the Pentagon, Ms. Lewinsky made 37 visits to the
White House.

 &HT;    Mystery surrounds land deal while Coke stonewallsBy Sallye
Salter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While Coca-Cola Co. stonewalls queries about plans for
its property adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park and whether it
will revive its early 1990s landmark tower proposal, land is
changing hands right in its back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Two land buys _ totaling $2.7 million _ across Simpson Street
from Coca-Cola's parkfront tract were completed over a 24-hour
period two weeks ago just as Coca-Cola was abandoning its plans to
buy and occupy Inforum, a parkside office building.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery buyer in both transactions was Atlantic Financial
Group, an Arlington, Texas-based firm. ``We are working with a
client on that parcel of land and are under a confidentiality
agreement not to discuss it,'' said Stephen Brookshire, a partner
in the firm, which buys properties and leases them to corporations.
He expects his client to disclose plans for the mostly vacant sites
in 30 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Is that client Coca-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in a position to talk about that,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Mark Preisinger. ``We are not in a position to talk about
any acquisition of property in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Coca-Cola say whether a tower _ an on-again and
off-again proposal as high as 48 stories _ is on again in its real
estate planning since its efforts to buy the 710,000 square foot
Inforum collapsed. The company leases about a half million square
feet of office space at two Midtown towers and has several times
considered adding buildings at its North Avenue headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are exploring a number of options,'' Preisinger said,
refusing to confirm or rule out any and stressing that no decision
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Coca-Cola representatives have been
talking to owners of some other properties near its parkfront tract
about buying their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They met with us about a month ago,'' said Jim Hochgertle,
whose wife is among heirs owning property at 235 Simpson St., which
lies between two of the parcels purchased by Atlantic Financial.
The property is currently occupied by Superior Printing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent an offer in the mail two weeks ago, and we've heard
nothing back except a phone call that they received it.'' The
family, which has owned the 19,500-square-foot property since 1962,
is asking $50 a square foot, and Coca-Cola is offering $28,
Hochgertle said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's record of buying properties in the area between the
park and its North Avenue headquarters has been established over
the past decade. On those purchases, Coca-Cola typically strived
for anonymity, buying through affiliates. For its Olympic City
festival area near the park, Coca-Cola spent $8 million buying two
blocks across Baker Street from Centennial Olympic Park. The area
is a key part of the area that has been designated for
redevelopment by the Centennial Olympic Park Authority. The company
leased other properties in that area before the Olympics. Since the
early 1990s, the soft drink giant has made a concerted effort to
beef up land holdings around its North Avenue base.

 MORE QUERIES ON ACCOUNTING DRUB CENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news got worse Tuesday for investors in Cendant Corp.,
the marketing and franchising company whose accounting problems
have devastated its stock price over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Cendant saw the stock price fall 46 percent after
it reported finding ``accounting irregularities'' in the 1997
ledgers of a unit of CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc.
late last year to form Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the stock, still battered, was bruised again as top
Cendant executives warned that the CUC division's questionable
accounting practices were deeper, wider and older than had
originally been reported _ and that less serious but previously
undetected accounting errors had compounded the financial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant shares, which had fallen $3.125 on Monday after news of
the broader problems leaked into the marketplace, closed at
$15.6875 Tuesday, down $3.1875 more in heavy trading. Cendant had
almost touched $42 a share earlier this year, before the accounting
problems arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certainly had a stock meltdown, but we have not had a
company meltdown,'' Henry Silverman, the Cendant chief executive,
said in an interview Tuesday. Silverman was previously chairman of
HFS Inc., whose franchises include Howard Johnson and Ramada Inn
hotels and Avis car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company warned Wall Street on Tuesday that its 1998
income might decline somewhat from current expectations, Silverman
said that profits were still expected to approach $1 billion in
1998 and that cash flow remained very strong.
</P>
<P>
   But that good news was dwarfed by the news that the accounting
irregularities under investigation were not limited to the
shopping-club membership program at CUC, as Cendant originally
reported, but affected ``all the major business units of CUC.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the irregularities were not confined to 1997 financial
statements, as Cendant said in April, but also affected CUC's
financial statements for 1995 and 1996. According to the company,
the irregularities included the improper use of merger reserves to
create ``fictitious revenues'' and the fabrication of accounts
receivable to inflate reported assets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has found a number of serious
accounting errors, which it defines as practices that may not have
been deliberately deceptive but that did not conform to generally
accepted accounting principles. These included the use of
inappropriate depreciation schedules and delays in recognizing the
impact of insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant also disclosed that it had doubled its estimate of the
effect the accounting problems would have on its 1997 profits,
which were originally reported as $900 million, or $1 a share,
before one-time charges that include merger expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Cendant warned that the accounting problems could
reduce its operating profit to somewhere between $783 million and
$801 million, or 87 to 89 cents a share. Now, it expects to report
income of $648 million to $702 million, or between 72 and 78 cents
a share, before the extraordinary expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those extraordinary costs will also be reduced, however, because
current and past merger expenses were found to have been improperly
inflated. As a result, although operating profits will be sharply
lower, Cendant's official net income for 1997, after all
adjustments, should at worst decline by a ``relatively immaterial''
$54 million, or about 6 cents a share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   How could such a broad array of accounting missteps go
undetected for so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the $64 question,'' Silverman said. ``If people want
to deceive you, then they will do so. That is what fraud is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cendant, based in Parsippany, N.J., did not blame anyone on
Tuesday for the disputed accounting policies. Silverman said he
expected the board's audit committee to report on its extensive
investigation by the end of August. The company is also continuing
to provide information about the matter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J.,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Cendant announced that it had dismissed Cosmo
Corigliano, an executive vice president of CUC and its former chief
financial officer. It gave no explanation for Corigliano's
dismissal. Corigliano's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said Tuesday that
his client ``absolutely denies any knowledge of any accounting
irregularities or any other wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Revised financial statements for Cendant are expected by early
August, Silverman said. That will allow the company to move ahead
on its pending acquisition of American Bankers Insurance Group,
subject to regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   According to Silverman, the company had been at work on
Tuesday's report since at least Saturday and the news ``leaked
out'' sometime late Monday morning, contributing to the sharp
decline in Cendant shares that day.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange called the company three times
during the day to press for release of any pertinent news,
Silverman said, and the company promised to make an announcement
before trading resumed Tuesday. The company's lawyers have asked
the SEC to investigate Monday's trading in Cendant shares.
</P>
<P>
   Both Silverman and Walter Forbes, the former CUC chief executive
who is now chairman of Cendant, said they spent more than two hours
Tuesday morning fielding telephone questions from Wall Street
analysts and institutional investors, whose moods ranged from
patience to outrage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most outraged was Timothy Stevenson, a money manager
for the First Capital Group unit of First Union Corp., who said he
sold more than 250,000 Cendant shares Tuesday morning, despite the
day's downdraft. ``It's been one bad story after another,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts were more patient, and a few privately
commended Cendant for the wealth of detail it released Tuesday.

HYDE DEFENDS PROPOSAL STRIPPING DOCTORS OF PRESCRIPTION LICENSES IN
ASSISTED-SUICIDE CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., used an impassioned speech on the sanctity of life Tuesday
to defend his legislative proposal that would require the federal
government to strip doctors of their prescription licenses if they
intentionally help terminally ill patients commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to: `What do you think a human life is
worth?''' said Hyde, who was presiding over a subcommittee hearing
on his proposed Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act. ``Human life, no
matter how wretched, has an intrinsic value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde introduced his legislation last month in response to
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision that the federal Controlled
Substances Act does not prohibit doctors from prescribing lethal
doses of medication to dying patients. In her decision, Reno said
the federal government would not stand in the way of doctors who
help terminally ill patients kill themselves in Oregon, the only
state where physician-assisted suicide is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Reno's decision could turn the ``slippery slope'' of
physician-assisted death, which he said began when the Supreme
Court legalized abortion, into a ``precipitous cliff.'' Oregon's
law permitting doctors to help with suicide could lead to the
untimely deaths of the ``unwanted, the despised, the helpless'' in
society, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Coleman, president of the disability rights group Not Dead
Yet, agreed with Hyde, saying his proposal would ``save the lives
of people with disabilities from a society which too often wishes
that we were dead.'' Coleman, who uses a wheelchair, urged Congress
to ``turn back the steamroller of the euthanasia movement before it
is too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon's Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber defended his state's
unique and controversial law as a legitimate exercise of a state's
right to regulate physicians. He assailed Hyde's proposal as having
a ``chilling effect'' on doctors who treat terminally ill patients
in severe pain. If the bill is enacted, he said, doctors will
``think twice'' before prescribing needed pain medication out of
fear that they will lose their prescription licenses if their
patient dies from the medicine they ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use the artifice of an amendment to the Controlled
Substances Act to establish a precedent-setting intervention by the
federal government into the practice of medicine,'' Kitzhaber told
the Constitution subcommittee. ``Don't intimidate and put at risk
physicians when your true objective is altering the choices
available to terminally ill patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, despite its opposition to
physician-assisted suicide, also came out against Hyde's proposal
as striking fear in doctors who believe they must prescribe strong,
potentially lethal medicine to treat _ not kill _ their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physician-assisted suicide is ethically incompatible with the
physician's role as healer,'' Dr. Thomas Reardon, the association's
president-elect, told the subcommittee. ``However, we fear the
real-world consequences of the bill would be to discourage the kind
of appropriate aggressive palliative care that can dissuade
patients in pain from seeking just such an early death.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's 1994 Death with Dignity Act, both passed and later
upheld by a referendum, permits doctors to prescribe lethal doses
of medicine to patients expected to live only six more months. Two
doctors must share the dire prognosis and agree that the patient is
mentally competent to ask for medical assistance in committing
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, while allowed to prescribe lethal medications, are
prohibited under the law from giving deadly injections. At least
three terminally ill patients in Oregon have committed suicide with
the help of a doctor since the law went into effect Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Reno warned that doctors in states with no
assisted-suicide statute, or even those in Oregon who ignore the
law's safeguards, could face federal penalties. Reno, in refusing
to hinder the Oregon law, rejected the position of Thomas
Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who in
November said physicians prescribing lethal doses would be in
violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and would run
the risk of losing their prescription licenses, which DEA issues.

 &HT;    BellSouth enchanted by Brazil
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLAN TA _ It may not be quite a gold rush down in Latin
America, but for phone companies looking south from Atlanta, there
is glitter aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is seen as a virtual chain of underdeveloped
markets, countries with troubled pasts but great potential, that
are now growing furiously. And for the companies that can service
and exploit that growth, there are fortunes to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Among those anxious to pan for the good stuff are BellSouth and
MCI.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, based in Atlanta and known for its local service to
the nine Southeastern states, has a ``back nine'' strategy in which
it has invested in nine Latin American countries, from Nicaragua to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Most lucrative of all is Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   A country of about 163 million people, Brazil is woefully
underserved when it comes to phones. The nation has about 10 phones
for each 100 inhabitants _ compared with about 65 in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The stunningly long waiting list to get service from Telebras,
the national phone company, led BellSouth into a multibillion
dollar detour. Wireless, the company reasoned, would be a quicker,
easier and ultimately cheaper way to reach millions of potential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, when the Brazilian government sold the rights to
compete against Telebras, which has its own wireless offering,
BellSouth won two bids: one to provide service in Sao Paulo, the
other for the northeast of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   After months of frantic construction and marketing efforts,
service was turned up this spring.
</P>
<P>
   First results were mouth-watering. BellSouth has quickly signed
up about 230,000 customers in Sao Paulo, as well as 16,000 in the
poorer and more sparsely inhabited northeast. Plans are to have
nearly a half-million subscribers in Sao Paulo by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil privatization is barely getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The country is dividing Telebras into three wireline companies,
10 wireless units and one company offering long-distance, including
international. Later this year, Brazil plans to entertain bids for
those companies. BellSouth in the United States has been trying to
put together a package of local, wireless, Internet and
long-distance services _ as well as cable television in some
cities. ``Bundling'' is seen as the key to market dominance, and
the same kind of logic can apply in Latin America. And in fact,
BellSouth has registered for the auctions, although the company has
not decided which bids to make, said John Price, spokesman for
BellSouth International.
</P>
<P>
   But the enticement of privatization in a large and growing
economy has not gone unnoticed. As early as this month, Brazil
could start taking bids for Embratel, the company providing
long-distance and international long-distance in Brazil. Among the
other bidders is MCI, whose business unit is based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, which is planning a merger into WorldCom, has reserved the
right to bid for Embratel, said Manuel Wernicky, spokesman for
MCI's international operations.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has so far come into all bidding with the strategy of
overwhelming the opposition, plunking down bids so high they have
often been double those of the second-place bidder. But MCI _
especially as part of a very aggressive WorldCom _ is no financial
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be a multibillion dollar showdown: The
Brazilian government hopes to raise between $15 billion and $20
billion from the sale of the Telebras companies.

 &HT;    Measuring Net use is big topic at I-World
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Even as the Web matures, with more users logging on
every day, there is still a fundamental questionthat goes
unanswered: Who is out there surfing the Net and how can it be
proved that anyone at all is surfing the Net?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an answer makes advertisers wary. Unlike
television's Nielsen ratings and the magazine industry's Audit
Bureau of Circulation, the Web has no single measurement service
every Web site and advertiser can agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring success is one of the burning questions at Internet
World, the industry's largest and most influential trade show that
opened here Tuesday. Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta-based company,
came to this show hoping it can provide an answer and help create a
standard. It's in the business of measuring the popularity of Web
sites in much the same way Nielsen does for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will never be peace in the measurement business,'' said
Jeff Levy, co-founder of Relevant Knowledge, who came to I-World to
discuss Web measurement, along with competitors Media Metrix and
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Packo, president of Media Metrix, raised the issue of
how measurement companies will adapt once high-speed Internet
access becomes available to a significant number of homes. Most
measurements are currently done with software installed in PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole phenomenon of set-top boxes has the potential to
turn measurement on its head,'' Levy says. He said a company like
his or Media Metrix could install the measuring devices as part of
the Web TV, cable modem or other high-speed broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   ''When that happens, you'll have a set-top box that is capable
of telling you when people turn the volume down and you'll have
that capability in 10 million homes. Broadband is a new world for
TV measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Web measurers can see the future of their industry,
they are still grappling with the present.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now the measurement field is new and young,'' Packo
said. ''It's not a surprise that a lot of people are working on it.
There is room for multiple measures, but eventually one standard
will emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlanta-based Internet companies at the show include
Internet service provider MindSpring and cable company Media One.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO MAINE'S NO. 1 SUMMER FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19.)  
 (JT)  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Maine _ From the front window of a converted Methodist
church here, Penobscot Bay glimmered pale blue in the hazy June
afternoon. A huge roller was smoothing the street's new asphalt,
and down the block a landscaper's backhoes tied up traffic. Inside,
the church's old amber windowpanes lighted the stairwells like a
golden sunrise. Workers hung paintings in its newly finished
galleries. It felt as if the staff was rushing to finish a big
summer house for the family's arrival; in fact, that is what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, the Farnsworth Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine
opened, a place dedicated to the work of the illustrator N.C.
Wyeth, his son Andrew and Andrew's son Jamie. The 130-year-old
church contains the center's galleries; there is also a private
study area, in a separate building, with storage for art and
archives.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since N.C. Wyeth bought a place in Port Clyde, south of
Rockland, in the early 1930s, the family has summered here, and
Andrew Wyeth's painting ``Christina's World'' is, for many people,
synonymous with Maine. The Wyeth center is attached to the
Farnsworth Art Museum, a respected 50-year-old institution that
focuses on artists connected with Maine and that has built one of
the best small, specialized collections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyeth center doubled the size of the Farnsworth and involved
rebuilding whole blocks of downtown Rockland. Designed by
Schwartz/Silver, a Boston firm, it is beautifully scaled and
elegantly complements the existing brick gallery and the
19th-century home of Lucy Farnsworth, the museum's founder.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dissonances. The low wooden shed containing the
study area echoes the long ell of the Farnsworth Mansion, but ends
with a fieldstone carriage house. Why fieldstone, when elsewhere
the architects were careful to use local materials like granite
(once a big industry in coastal Maine) and clapboard? The Wyeths
wanted fieldstone to remind them of their winter home in Chadds
Ford, Pa. And, besides, it's their center; the Farnsworth raised
$11 million in less than two years to build it for them. No other
artists working in Maine could generate this kind of money;
criticism of the Wyeths' work has never affected its great
popularity or high prices.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the Wyeth family enterprise has produced two lavish
catalogs (published by Abrams and Little, Brown) and mounted three
exhibitions. Andrew's landscapes are at the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York; the whole family, including Andrew's
sisters, is represented at the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky.
``Wondrous Strange: The Wyeth Tradition'' inaugurates the Wyeth
center in Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wondrous Strange'' was conceived and hung by Betsy James
Wyeth, Andrew's wife and Jamie's mother. The huge show takes up the
entire museum. It was supposed to fit into the new church
galleries, but Mrs. Wyeth, who, according to the museum's director,
Christopher Crossman, was given free rein, chose so many works that
the Farnsworth's permanent collection was taken down to make room
for it.
</P>
<P>
   That is too bad. Maine's clear light, its bays and islands, its
rocky coast and steep hills have attracted artists for two
centuries, and the Farnsworth has acquired fine works by Fitz Hugh
Lane, Frederick Church, Albert Bierstadt, Winslow Homer, John
Marin, George Bellows, Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent, Milton Avery
and Louise Nevelson, who grew up in Rockland. Alex Katz, Neil
Welliver and Robert Indiana are among the artists now working near
Rockland, and under its curator, Susan Larsen, the Farnsworth is
expanding the scope of its exhibitions and increasing its holdings
of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has collected Wyeths, too, but their context, their
place in the story of Maine art, is something that visitors to the
museum will glimpse in only one gallery this summer, where a show
called ``Bellows and Benson in Maine: The Dream and the Reality''
has been installed. Perhaps it was intentional that you can see
hardly anything but Wyeth this summer. Money buys space. The new
center is devoted exclusively to the Wyeths. So the Farnsworth
Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine will never return the favor
the Farnsworth Art Museum is doing it this summer by clearing out
for ``Wondrous Strange.''
</P>
<P>
   This could become awkward, especially since it is not exactly
clear what the center will have to show. The news release
announcing the center begins: ``With holdings of some 4,500 works
of arts and objects made available by the families of Andrew Wyeth
and Jamie Wyeth, the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland has
established a new Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine.'' When
asked what ``made available'' meant, Crossman said that there was a
nonspecific letter of intent from Andrew and Betsy Wyeth stating
that works of art and archival material relating to Maine would
eventually come to the museum. They have given nothing yet; they
can move things in and out of the center as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wondrous Strange'' is a loan exhibition. Many of the works
have nothing to do with Maine. The show aims to reveal Andrew and
Jamie Wyeth as storytellers in N.C. Wyeth's tradition and
illustrate the influence of N.C.'s teacher, Howard Pyle, on all
three Wyeth generations. Pyle and N.C. Wyeth, masters of
illustration, exemplified the heated-up romanticism of
turn-of-the-century America. While Andrew and Jamie work in cooler
times, there is no question that some of the images in ``Wondrous
Strange'' are really weird. Andrew paints a corpse emerging from a
block of melting ice and severed hands perched on ice floes; Jamie
portrays himself with a pumpkin head and as a clownish scarecrow.
He depicts lighthouses with the same fierce perspective that his
grandfather used for Peg Leg Pete.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to guess the stories behind these images. The
illustrations by N.C. and Pyle are given the titles of the texts
they refer to; the titles of Andrew's and Jamie's paintings are not
always illuminating. Andrew's works, in the merciless way they
render detail, could resonate with John Updike's bleak vision of
America. But Updike's prose sets up a paradox; if he sees godless,
loveless emptiness, his words reach for redemption. And Updike
looks relentlessly. Andrew Wyeth veers off into piety.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``Night Shadow'' shows a sleeping woman, her head
dark, her breasts brightly and explicitly lighted. According to the
catalog, Andrew uses this work ``to memorialize the emotions he
felt upon viewing his father, N.C. Wyeth, in his casket.'' A
painting by Jamie titled ``Bowdoin Sophomore'' presents a boy,
possibly naked, draped in a blanket and holding a starfish.
Another, called ``Orca,'' shows an adolescent with electric hair
wearing a British uniform from the Revolutionary War (a red coat
that belonged to Pyle, according to Crossman). Jamie's casual
presentation of the macabre often reads like Stephen King, but he
is too detached to be scary.
</P>
<P>
   The real story the Wyeths are telling is the story of their own
celebrity. Orca is the name of a Maine island boy who often models
for Jamie Wyeth. The woman in ``Night Shadow'' turns out to be
Helga Testorf, who worked for the Wyeths. Although the artists
might disagree, these paintings could well be about class and
privilege, an enduring subject of art by summer people. Certainly
it informs the paintings in the small exhibition that runs
concurrently with ``Wondrous Strange.'' ``Bellows and Benson in
Maine'' centers on two recent gifts to the Farnsworth from the
bequest of Elizabeth B. Noyce: paintings by George Bellows and
Frank W. Benson, both of whom summered on the coast at the
beginning of this century.

</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 _ It's got all the right stuff for girls: plucky orphan
heroine who defies authority, cute boy, cute dog. Boys may be a
tougher sell, but Pepito does ride a motorcycle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10 AND UP _ Big kids and teen-agers won't want to go unless
they're baby-sitting, but fans of Bemelmans, Ms. McDormand and
Paris will find something to like. And parents will watch with
relief: finally, a ``children's'' movie with nothing objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   THE MASK OF ZORRO &QL; 
Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart
Wilson, Matt Letscher &QL; 
Directed by Martin Campbell &QL; 
PG-13 _ 130 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That Z on the neck of Don Rafael Montero (Wilson) was carved 20
years ago by Zorro, a now aging Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins).
When Zorro first opposed him, Montero was the Spanish governor of
California and brutally oppressed the peasants. Now Montero
enslaves them to mine gold. But behold the Z, slashed again on
walls and flaming on hillsides. Now there's a new Zorro (
Banderas), trained by Don Diego to champion the people and become
the latest movie incarnation of the pulp fiction hero originally
conjured by the police reporter Johnston McCulley. &QL; 
VIOLENCE _ Wordplay and shootings yield heinous injuries, but the
effect is softened by the spirit of dashing adventure. &QL; 
SEX _ None per se, but the Banderas Zorro and the beautiful Elena
(Ms. Zeta-Jones) do some serious smoldering on the dance floor, and
later she loses some articles of clothing to deft flicks of his
blade. &QL; 
PROFANITY _ None. &QL; 
For Which Children?  &QL; 
AGES 3-8 _ ``Children should never have to see the things we do,''
Montero says as he's about to execute three peasants. That is
certainly true of young children. &QL; 
AGES 9-12 _ By this age bracket, however, they are better able to
handle the violence, which is no worse than what they may encounter
in other films and on television, and they will love both Zorros. &QL; 
AGES 13 AND UP _ The more hip among them may turn up their noses,
but most teen-agers should have fun at this movie.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL SOLDIERS &QL; 
Kirsten Dunst, Gregory Smith, Jay Mohr, David Cross, Denis Leary,
Ann Magnuson, Phil Hartman; and the voices of Tommy Lee Jones,
Frank Langella, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Christina Ricci &QL; 
Directed by Joe Dante &QL; 
PG-13 _ 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Fighting, talking soldier action figures, the Commando Elite,
have been programmed to ``show no mercy'' to their sworn enemies,
the Gorgonites, and to believe that the rest of the world are the
toys, not them. But their inventors ( Mohr and Cross) have
installed flawed microchips, which leads to a recall, but not
before the Commandos have hunted down the Gorgonites, added humans
to their list of enemies and waged a full-scale assault on the
neighborhood. &QL; 
VIOLENCE _ Adversaries are mangled and pulverized, the Gorgonite
leader ( Langella) is tortured, creepy Barbie-type dolls swarm over
people like the little dinosaurs from ``The Lost World,'' a boy is
set afire, an action figure's legs are ground up in a garbage
disposer, an action-figure regiment is chopped into mulch by a lawn
mower ... &QL; 
SEX _ None. &QL; 
PROFANITY _ Some rough soldierly talk and some alarmed parental
expletives. &QL; 
For Which Children? &QL; 
AGES 3-8 _ Though the combatants are toys, make no mistake: this is
a war movie and inappropriate for small children. &QL; 
AGES 9-12 _ Probably the best audience: pre-teen-agers will be
amused when they get some of the comic pop references and will be
sophisticated enough to realize that real toys can't do the things
these computer-generated ones can. &QL; 
AGES 13 AND UP _ Fans of special-effects driven shoot-'em-ups may
be attracted to the film, but it's doubtful that many older teens
will be drawn to a story about toy soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   LETHAL WEAPON 4  &QL; 
Directed by Richard Donner &QL; 
Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Chris Rock, Joe Pesci, Jet Li, Rene
Russo &QL; 
R _ 135 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) are back,
promoted to captains of the Los Angeles Police Department in a move
that's supposed to keep them out of trouble and off the streets.
Ha! This time the pair confront Chinese slave labor barons, in
particular the brutal, Rasputin-like Wah Sing Ku (Li). But as tough
as they are, the two old dogs of the 11-year-old action-comedy
franchise can't beat Father Time. ``Getting too old for this,''
grumbles Murtaugh. But a spectacular car chase _ so 80's! _ makes
everyone feel young again, if only for a few minutes. &QL; 
VIOLENCE _ ``Gunfights, explosions, sharks _ the usual,'' Riggs
says. Not to mention strangulation, arson, eye gouging, near-death
by goring and unnecessary dental procedures. &QL; 
SEX _ There's no time for sex. Two women, however, are pregnant and
unmarried. &QL; 
PROFANITY _ Continual. &QL; 
For Which Children?  &QL; 
UNDER AGE 11 _ The movie has its comedic elements, but it's
inappropriate for young children, and unless you'd like to hear the
dialogue and see the karate kicks repeated at home, don't take
them. &QL; 
AGES 11 AND UP _ Don't even try to keep them away. Boys will even
forgive Gibson his skirt in ``Braveheart.''

<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ For more than 25 years, computer scientists
have been working to develop a technology that would put the
processing power of a supercomputer in the hands of average users.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of this technology, known as distributed computing,
is the ability to divide a large set of computer instructions into
multiple small parts, each of which is processed by a different
machine within a network of computers.
</P>
<P>
   But few people have the need or desire to turn their laptop into
a supercomputer. The computer industry is betting that a far more
popular use for distributed computing will be its ability to endow
consumer appliances _ from telephones, televisions and stereos to
kitchen appliances and cars _ with an infusion of borrowed
intelligence by attaching them to a computer network.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sun Microsystems will unveil the first consumer
version of this technology, a product called Jini, which uses Sun's
Java programming language to harness the power of potentially
millions of computers, ranging from giant mainframes to tiny
palm-sized devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have all the ingredients to build a distributed
computing fabric which approaches science fiction,'' said David
Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist who
pioneered distributed computing in 1971. ``You will be able to sit
with your laptop, and it will be able to reach out across the
network. And for the moments you need the power, it will become the
largest supercomputer in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also shift the balance of power in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when worried governments on three continents are
struggling to restrain Microsoft Corp.'s iron grip on computing and
its ambitions on the Internet, distributed computing could level
the playing field by shifting growth in high-tech industries to the
millions of consumer appliances that increasingly contain powerful
embedded processors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft itself is known to be working on a system
similar to Jini, known as Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun, among Microsoft's fiercest competitors, has an early
advantage in this race because of the nature of its Java
programming language, which is designed to move chunks of computer
code from machine to machine.
</P>
<P>
   Jini uses this ability in ways that allow computers and other
devices to cooperate, sometimes by sharing instructions or
information, sometimes by actually dividing a program into parts
and spreading the computation work across several computers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Java has already achieved widespread distribution _
thanks, in part, to Microsoft, which ships it with its Internet
Explorer browser for navigating the World Wide Web and with Windows
98. Although Sun is suing Microsoft for making unauthorized changes
to Java, the Microsoft version of the language will support Jini.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to Sun's plans, over the next 18 months, a
number of companies that make computer hardware and consumer
gadgets will begin incorporating Jini, allowing each of these
devices to talk with each other and to share processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Corp., a disk-drive maker based in Milpitas, Calif.,
intends to commercialize the Jini technology to make drives that
have built-in office network connections. Once these drives are
plugged in, all the computers in a local network will be able to
use them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely going to be a dramatic leap in ease of
use,'' said Paul Borrill, vice president and chief architect at
Quantum.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, advocates of distributed computing
predict, today's desktop computer will evolve from a
self-sufficient machine that must hold all the memory, storage and
processing power it needs for any job into a social machine that
will automatically interact not only with other computers but with
myriad consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of distributed computing has not escaped Microsoft,
which potentially has the most to lose from such a change since it
would make the operating system incidental to the power and control
wielded by a networked computer in a distributed system. For that
reason, Microsoft would hold no obvious advantage over competitors
in marketing a distributed computing technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its competitors and computer scientists, who view
distributed computing as the antithesis of an operating system,
Microsoft prefers to think of it as the operating system of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper on its Millennium product, a Microsoft
research team wrote: ``We argue that advances in hardware and
networking technology enable a new kind of operating system to
support tomorrow's applications. Such an operating system would
raise the level of abstraction for developers and users, so that
individual computers, file systems and networks become unimportant
to most computations in the same way that processor registers, disk
sectors and physical pages are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Processor registers, disk sectors and physical pages are all
elements of hardware that today are controlled by an operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch to all of this: The technology at the heart
of this evolution is the network, and all the assumptions about the
future of distributed computing are based on the belief that
computer networks will be ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   On a large scale, such networks are now being deployed, both by
cellular telephone companies and by computer industry groups
working on new standards for wireless office networks. Once these
networks are available to consumers, beginning later this year, the
stage will be set for a fundamental change in the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   It is the network, which can range in size from a group of
linked household devices to the global Internet, that is the
foundation upon which the new ``meta-computer'' will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The network and distributed computing also represent the
greatest threat to the operating system as it exists today.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, of each generation and iteration of computers _
mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers _ has been built
on a foundation of centralized control wielded by an operating
system, a single, monolithic program that performs the combined
role of a traffic cop, butler and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent proliferation of high-speed and wireless networks
and the melding of computing and telecommunications technologies
driven by the Internet has encouraged developers to proceed on the
assumption that every home, car and other personal environment will
eventually be part of _ and empowered by _ a universal network.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed computing, sometimes known as ``ubiquitous
computing,'' foresees a world in which millions of small programs,
called objects, seamlessly flit back and forth between tens of
thousands of devices that have been enabled to recognize and be
recognized by the network.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a world of cars equipped with distributed
computing devices linked by a wireless network, each car would be
delivering and receiving information from every other car, or to
and from aggregated traffic reports, along the route being driven.
This kind of networking could significantly reduce traffic
congestion by alerting drivers to concerns like accidents,
congestion and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, the traditional operating system, say advocates
of distributed computing, becomes an ungainly encumbrance, sort of
like placing a baton-wielding orchestra conductor at the front of a
jam session of jazz musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in such a distributed world, the boundary lines
between individual computers blur as thousands or even millions of
computers are harnessed to particular tasks as exotic as predicting
the weather or as mundane as controlling the heating and lighting
in a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is very clear,'' said William Joy, a cofounder of
Sun Microsystems and the chief designer of Jini. ``We are moving
toward a world in which it will be possible to move software codes
that act as our personal agents between many different computers in
a global network.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a transformation goes directly to the heart of the central
issue in the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft. The company's executives have argued _ so far
successfully _ that as a result of the company's strategy of
continuously integrating new features into its Windows operating
system, the consumer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, the strategy has led to a vast increase in the memory
requirements in the standard personal computer, from 640 thousand
bytes of main memory in 1988 to 64 million bytes today.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Microsoft's critics charge that in addition to the
monopoly control this strategy has given the company over the
software market, the operating system's growing complexity has made
its programs increasingly prone to error. In recent days Microsoft
has been facing a growing chorus of complaints about bugs in its
new Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of a distributed computing philosophy believe that
with the advent of high speed networking it is now possible to
achieve the value of integration without submitting to the vast
memory requirements or the complexity of the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Modular software design, they assert, makes it possible for each
user to select just the set of applications needed at the current
moment rather than carrying extra baggage.
</P>
<P>
   They envision a computerized world in which human computer users
will be surrounded by a web of hundreds of small computers embedded
in everything from smart cameras to pagers to cell phones, and
handheld computers will exchange messages and data without the
intervention of a centralized master computer. &QL;

BRITISH PANEL DISPUTES RISKS OF IMPLANTS USING SILICONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent group of scientists charged by the British
minister of health with reviewing the safety of silicone breast
implants reported Tuesday that there was no credible evidence that
they caused disease.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, which imposed a moratorium on the sale
of silicone breast implants in 1992, Britain has never removed
implants from the market. But in light of continued concerns raised
by women with implants, the health minister called for this review.
</P>
<P>
   The seven member panel, led by Dr. Roger Sturrock, a
rheumatology professor at the University of Glasgow, heard
testimony from scientists, patient groups and lawyers, examined
published and unpublished scientific papers and read letters from
women with implants as well as articles in the media and posted on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its conclusions were unequivocal: ``Silicone gel breast implants
are not associated with any greater health risk than other surgical
implants.''
</P>
<P>
   The British panel noted that there had been research reports
suggesting links between implants and disease. But it went on,
``The public and the media would not be aware of the lack of
scientific rigor,'' in this research. As a result, the panel said,
members of the public ``could be persuaded and alarmed by results
of what was, in fact, poor science and selective reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology
at Tulane University School of Medicine, who has frequently
testified on behalf of women who believe they have been injured by
the implants, said his studies and those of others clearly showed
that implants leaked and caused toxic immunological reactions.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a presentation to the panel in December, he said, but
``it was clear to me that they had already made their minds up and
they weren't interested in what I had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report Tuesday, the group said there was is no credible
evidence that silicone elicits abnormal immune system reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The group called for more research on the frequency with which
implants rupture and also asked for more data on the incidence of
low-grade infections associated with implants. The panel said such
infections, if they occur, might account for some of the symptoms
reported by women with implants.

DRUG MAKERS TENTATIVELY SETTLE IN PRICE-FIXING SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the United States' bitterest scuffles over fair trade,
four pharmaceutical companies have tentatively agreed to pay $345
million to settle a class-action price-fixing lawsuit brought by
40,000 retail pharmacies, according to lawyers involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Abbott Laboratories, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc., the
Hoechst Marion Roussel unit of Hoechst AG of Germany and
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. appeared Tuesday before U.S. District
Judge Charles Kocoras in Chicago to present the proposed
settlement. Details of the agreement were not fully disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacies had contended in a number of lawsuits that were
filed in 1993, and eventually consolidated into one class-action
case, that large drug makers had conspired to develop a two-tier
pricing system during the early 1990s. The drug makers gave
discounts to managed-care companies and health-maintenance
organizations, the pharmacy owners said, while charging them higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal presented Tuesday, the drug makers agreed to
refrain from a two-tier pricing system, without admitting any
liability, said lawyers involved in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's proposed settlement moved the case one step
closer to completion, it remains far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 11 pharmaceutical makers agreed to pay $351
million to settle the price-fixing contentions, leaving eight
defendants in the case. After four more agreed to the proposed
settlement Tuesday, that left four big pharmaceutical companies _
Novartis, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto and
Forest Laboratories _ to refute the pharmacies' contentions in a
trial before Kocoras, which is set to begin Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged four drug manufacturers are joining others
who have previously agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by
retail community pharmacies over allegations of manufacturer
price-fixing,'' said Ronald L. Ziegler, the chief executive of the
National Association of Chain Drug Stores, an industry group in
Alexandria, Va. ``Hopefully, all manufacturers will practice the
terms of the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott Laboratories and Hoechst Marion Roussel declined to
comment Tuesday. Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn said in a statement that it had
agreed to pay $102.5 million, a bit less than one-third of the
total tentative settlement. As a result, the company said, it must
increase reserves by $61 million and take a $41 million after-tax
charge against earnings in the second quarter, which ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   John Abrams, a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, said Tuesday
that the amount the company had agreed to pay was ``substantially
less'' than Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's share. Rhone-Poulenc agreed to
settle, he said, to avoid the risks and uncertainty of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's proposed settlement would bring the total settlement
amount to about $700 million, which will be held in escrow until
the case is completed. The pharmacy owners must determine how the
money will be divided. Initially, the small pharmacy owners had
wanted an equal split regardless of size, while proprietors of the
larger stores wanted a formula based on per-store drug sales
volume.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawyer involved in the negotiations, the two
groups are considering a plan that provides for a minimum payout
with additional money allotments based on drug sales.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Tuesday's tentative settlement, the drugstore owners
appeared optimistic that they would win the antitrust trial,
sinking their last four opponents. They may have reason to feel
confident, according to one lawyer involved in the agreement.
During the pretrial phase of the case the pharmacies have uncovered
documents that not only appear to confirm their accusations, but
have been aired publicly in court.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, Kocoras quoted from documents that had been
presented in the case and said it was ``unquestionable'' that the
drug companies ``had the opportunity to conspire.'' He said there
was ``evidence of seminars and trade association meetings, which
virtually every defendant attended at one time or another, and a
coordinated exchange of pricing and other competitive information
shared among the manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   But this battle may be to the finish. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for
example, said Tuesday through a spokesman that the company has not
participated in any settlement talks, because it has not conspired
to fix prices and believes the pharmacy owners' lawsuit has no
merit.

 &HT;    DeWine, Hall join call to raise awareness of Sudanese famine
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Ohio lawmakers have joined to bring attention
to the famine killing hundreds in the East African country of
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, and U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine,
R-Ohio, both signed a letter asking their colleagues to pay more
attention to starvation and suffering in the Bahr el Ghazal region
of Sudan. Hall, DeWine and U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., will brief
legislators and their staff on the Sudanese famine Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is starting to step out more on humanitarian issues, and
there aren't many people in Congress showing that kind of
compassion,'' Hall said. ``I really appreciate his partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who visited Sudan in June, has pushed for more
humanitarian aid to ease the famine. He has said he has not seen
such a severe famine since he visited Ethiopia in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A severe drought aggravated a food shortage caused by Sudan's
14-year civil war. The Islamic government stopped humanitarian
relief flights into the area several months ago, pushing about 1
million Sudanese closer to starvation. The flights resumed in June,
but humanitarian workers could not curb the food shortage in time.
</P>
<P>
   The famine struck areas held by the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army, which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Islamic
government. The United Nations, with help from the United States
and other countries, has provided some famine relief, but feeding
centers must turn away all but the most severe cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and DeWine have been working on another front to curb food
shortages in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Both are co-sponsors of the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act, a bill to
provide assistance to African farmers and help promote agricultural
research.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is an original sponsor in the House; DeWine introduced the
bill with U.S. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., in June.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brown Brewer, DeWine's spokeswoman, said the bill followed
DeWine's interest in agriculture development and complemented
another bill to help increase trade to the continent.

   WASHINGTON _ Two Ohio lawmakers have joined to bring attention
to the famine killing hundreds in the East African country of
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, and U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine,
R-Ohio, both signed a letter asking their colleagues to pay more
attention to starvation and suffering in the Bahr el Ghazal region
of Sudan. Hall, DeWine and U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., will brief
legislators and their staff on the Sudanese famine Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is starting to step out more on humanitarian issues, and
there aren't many people in Congress showing that kind of
compassion,'' Hall said. ``I really appreciate his partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who visited Sudan in June, has pushed for more
humanitarian aid to ease the famine. He has said he has not seen
such a severe famine since he visited Ethiopia in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A severe drought aggravated a food shortage caused by Sudan's
14-year civil war. The Islamic government stopped humanitarian
relief flights into the area several months ago, pushing about 1
million Sudanese closer to starvation. The flights resumed in June,
but humanitarian workers could not curb the food shortage in time.
</P>
<P>
   The famine struck areas held by the Sudanese People's Liberation
Army, which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Islamic
government. The United Nations, with help from the United States
and other countries, has provided some famine relief, but feeding
centers must turn away all but the most severe cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and DeWine have been working on another front to curb food
shortages in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Both are co-sponsors of the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act, a bill to
provide assistance to African farmers and help promote agricultural
research.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is an original sponsor in the House; DeWine introduced the
bill with U.S. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., in June.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brown Brewer, DeWine's spokeswoman, said the bill followed
DeWine's interest in agriculture development and complemented
another bill to help increase trade to the continent.

 &HT;    Gingrich's wallet $247,618 lighter
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich spent nearly a
quarter-million dollars in legal fees in the past three months,
according to his latest filing with the Federal Election
Commission. His campaign spokesman said the money was for work
performed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman, Mike Shields, could not say what the $247,618
paid to the Atlanta law firm Arnall, Golden &AMP; Gregory was for.
Gingrich's lawyer, J. Randolph Evans, is a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the bill did not arrive until sometime this spring,
which is why it showed up on Gingrich's report of campaign finances
since April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, Gingrich's longtime friend and political associate, did
not return telephone calls. But Gingrich retained him in late 1996
as the speaker's ethics case neared its dramatic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Evans helped negotiate Gingrich's reprimand by his colleagues
and $300,000 penalty for violating House rules by giving its ethics
committee false and misleading letters about the role the speaker's
onetime political action committee, GOPAC, played in developing his
college course.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics committee has yet to act on another complaint
alleging that Gingrich violated House rules by accepting travel,
fees and other reimbursements from GOPAC and receiving undisclosed
and excessive campaign aid from GOPAC during his closest
re-election campaign in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Van Der Mied, the ethics committee's chief counsel, said he
could not comment on pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is separately investigating
potential violations of tax law from Gingrich's integration of
tax-exempt organizations into his partisan operations and GOPAC's
solicitations of money for a charity that then passed the money
back to GOPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said he did not know if the legal fees covered ethics
matters or the IRS inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has paid lawyers more than $1 million from his
campaign account to defend him against ethics charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's FEC filing, which showed that he has $1 million in
cash on hand for an expected easy re-election campaign this year,
also indicated that the speaker is continuing to dispute $196,000
in fees to Jan Baran, the lawyer Evans replaced and Gingrich blamed
for sending the misleading letters.
</P>
<P>
   Shields had no comment on the money owed Baran.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Georgia Senate race, Democratic candidate
Michael Coles is keeping his campaign afloat with hefty loans from
his personal line of credit at Charter Bank &AMP; Trust in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, founder of the Great American Cookie Co., has loaned or
contributed to his campaign nearly $1.1 million, including $617,000
worth of loans and contributions during the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Coles raised slightly less than $200,000
from individuals and political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell, seeking to fend off a challenge
from Coles, reported raising $837,000 during the past three months
and now has $3.2 million in available cash, compared with $1
million for Coles.

 &HT;    Lott causes stir by airing China trade details
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In taking to the Senate floor on Tuesday to
announce that the Clinton administration's ``wholly inadequate''
export policy had resulted in the transfer of sensitive technology
to China, Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) ignited a tinder
box, with each political party blaming the other for endangering
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's unexpected delivery of the findings of what he termed an
``interim report'' of various Senate investigations, prompted
leading Senate Democrats to assail him for releasing classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is partisanship at its worst,'' said Minority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.). ``I am disappointed by the inaccuracies of the
statements and the recklessness of these statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats noted that Lott unveiled the findings just as
the wide-ranging investigation into campaign fund-raising abuses
appears to be sputtering to an end without any high-ranking White
House officials implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense policy experts expressed concern that an opportunity to
examine whether the nation's security has been placed at risk would
be lost in all the partisan rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those questions is this: Did Loral Space and
Communications and Hughes Electronics help the Chinese figure out
why a satellite launch failed in February 1996 in southern China?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much willingness to accuse the other side of
partisanship; we need to discuss the facts,'' said Henry Sokolski,
the top Pentagon expert monitoring nuclear proliferation during the
Bush administration and who now runs the Nonproliferation Policy
Education Center in Virginia. Comparing the partisan outbreak on
Capitol Hill to two children denying blame over a broken vase,
Sokolski said that both parties seemed to be preoccupied with
blaming the other. ``It's kind of like two kids pointing at each
other saying, `He did it,' when the point is they are standing
there in their bare feet with broken glass everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger in all of this, Sokolski said, is that the focus will
be diverted away from closely examining the export policies of both
the Clinton and Bush administrations. ``It would be a shame if we
get stuck here in partisanship,'' he said. ``We need to address
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his floor statement, Lott said the Senate had
conducted 13 hearings and heard testimony from 32 witnesses in four
Senate committees. From that testimony, he said it was time for
Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sharply criticizing the Clinton White House, Lott
said China's military had benefited from the satellite exports and
that the administration had ``ignored overwhelming information
regarding Chinese proliferation'' and ``embarked on a de facto
policy designed to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from
sanctions under U.S. proliferation law.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of where the Clinton administration has looked the
other way, Lott said testimony before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee earlier this month revealed Defense Department
monitors are not required to be present at satellite launches in
China. ``No one in the U.S. government knows what transpired at
these launches or if U.S. laws and polices on technology transfer
were followed,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's satellite export control system relies on the good
will of the Commerce Department, a department which has repeatedly
demonstrated its willingness to ignore national security concerns
on satellite exports,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   American satellite makers contend transferring the jurisdiction
of approving satellite launches in China from the State Department
to the Commerce Department was crucial to their business.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high for the satellite industry. An analysis by the
Maryland-based Futron Corp. estimates that revenues from the U.S.
commerical satellite market, now valued at $5.7 billion, could be
worth more than six times that amount by 2003.

 &HT;    Braves have decision concerning Wohlers
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Wohlers is expected to be back in an Atlanta
uniform Thursday for the Milwaukee series. What happens after that
not only determines how the club stocks its bullpen for the final
two months, it also could dictate Wohlers' future as a Brave.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was looking forward to getting his closer back,
manager Bobby Cox replied, ``Yeah, if he's ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he's not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to answer that,'' general manager John
Schuerholz said. ``We hope that doesn't happen but if it does,
we'll have to keep working to try to get him through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox has not determined when and how to use him and that decision
is ticklish. Wohlers' inconsistency would rule against pitching him
late in a game, though with Atlanta starters typically working so
long per start, the late innings may be Cox's only choice. And he
must use Wohlers, for leaving him in the bullpen for more than
three days without an outing could set him back further. A primary
reason Wohlers accepted his minor-league assignment was he wasn't
getting any work.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the decision to return to Atlanta is Wohlers', as
dictated by a verbal agreement he made before leaving the team June
19. Though the All-Star break was his original target to return,
Wohlers subsequently agreed to remain with Class AAA Richmond
another week (players with five years experience must approve
optional minor-league assignments), though it cost him some pension
time.
</P>
<P>
   His level of performance has hardly answered any questions _
it's only added more. Wohlers was the losing pitcher in his last
outing, the first game of a doubleheader Monday (one inning, three
hits, two earned runs, two walks, no strikeouts and a home run
allowed). That gave him a 21.60 ERA in seven appearances, with 15
hits, 12 walks, six Ks and six wild pitches in 6 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made some progress, in the opinion of (Richmond
pitching coach) Bill Fischer,'' Schuerholz said, ``proabably not
the amount of progress that either Mark or Bill or any of us would
like to see ultimately. But he has made great strides. And Mark,
according to Bill Fischer, feels very good about what he's done, he
feels very good about the progress he's made, even though the
results statistically may reflect otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of Pride
</P>
<P>
   The club as expected activated outfielder Curtis Pride before
Tuesday's game and returned first baseman Randall Simon to
Richmond. Out since June 28 with a larcerated left index finger,
Pride went 3-for-6 with a pair of walks in a Monday re-hab
appearance in a doubleheader with the Richmond Braves.
</P>
<P>
   His injury occured when Pride took a bat to the cinderblock wall
after a pop-out. Asked if he'd been working on his bat-handling, he
replied, ``Yeah, I've been taking meditation classes.''

NORTH KOREA REFUSES TO ALLOW FULL INSPECTION OF NUCLEAR SITES,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea is refusing to allow international
inspectors full access to its nuclear sites, raising concern that
it will be impossible to determine if North Korea has hidden away
enough plutonium to build nuclear weapons, congressional
investigators said in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
agency of Congress, found that there were significant gaps in the
inspection program imposed on North Korea after it signed a 1994
nuclear freeze agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the report did not directly accuse North Korea of reneging
on the agreement, the authors questioned whether Pyongyang had
placed sharp limits on the outside inspections because they feared
the inspectors would turn up evidence that a nuclear-weapons
program is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans, they said, may be trying to destroy evidence
that showed they had stockpiled a much larger quantity of plutonium
before the 1994 agreement than they have previously acknowledged.
Many arms-control specialists believe that the North Koreans may
have built a bomb from their supplies of plutonium before they
signed the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, which was presented to Congress last
week, North Korea has refused repeated requests for information
about the whereabouts of nuclear components that Pyongyang had
planned to install in two nuclear reactors that were scrapped under
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have also refused to allow the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. agency that conducts the
inspections, to install monitoring devices on tanks used to hold
nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that the North Koreans may have tampered with
the tanks since the 1994 agreement and secretly removed some of the
nuclear waste in an effort to hide evidence of earlier diversions
of plutonium from the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that the North Koreans already have nuclear
weapons on the shelf,'' said David Albright, president of the
Institute for Science and International Security, which studies
nuclear nonproliferation issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when the 1994 agreement was being negotiated, ``not
enough thought was put into verification, and that's why these
kinds of problems have developed. It's well known among those who
follow this issue that the North Koreans have not been cooperating
as much as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 1994 agreement was signed, many arms-control
specialists and diplomats predicted that North Korea's government
would take advantage of loosely worded provisions of the pact to
prevent unfettered inspections of its nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, North Korea has acknowledged that it held a total
of about 90 grams, or 3 ounces, of plutonium, all of it from a
one-time reprocessing of defective fuel rods. But American
intelligence agencies believe the stockpile developed before 1994
is much larger, probably several kilograms _ enough for at least
two bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who requested the report in his
role as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee, said that the new study made clear that the 1994
nuclear-freeze equipment between North Korea and the United States
was ``folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, North Korea pledged to dismantle its
existing nuclear program including two graphite nuclear reactors
under construction, in exchange for the American promise to help
pay for the construction of two light-water nuclear reactors and
the delivery of 500,000 metric tons of oil a year. Light-water
reactors are considered less dangerous because they produce little
weapons-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans also promised to help the Atomic Energy
Commission gather evidence to confirm the size of its plutonium
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said the General Accounting Office report showed that
``we may never know how much bomb-grade plutonium the North Koreans
have diverted to their weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our carrot-and-stick approach is all carrots, no sticks,'' he
said in a statement. ``I am critical of the agreement because we
were too quick to provide North Korea with the goodies before we
knew the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which helped negotiate the 1994 agreement,
said that while it generally supported the conclusions of the
report, the Clinton administration is still hopeful that North
Korea might be prevented from building nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there have been troubles with the inspection program,''
said a department official, speaking on condition that he not be
identified. ``But from our standpoint, what is crucial is that the
North Korean nuclear program is frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the International Atomic Energy Agency said
the agency had no immediate comment since it had not yet seen the
congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   While the nuclear-freeze agreement is considered one of the
Clinton administration's proudest foreign policy accomplishments,
its future has been in doubt because the United States and its
Asian allies have been unable to find the money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The oil deliveries to North Korea, which is plagued by energy
shortages, have fallen behind schedule. Caught in their own
financial crises, Japan and South Korea have resisted pleas to
speed up payment of billions of dollars for the oil and the two
light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
   In May, North Korea threatened to back out of the agreement and
resumed maintenance on one of the five nuclear sites it had shut
down as part of the 1994 agreement. The North Korean Foreign
Ministry said at the time that the country ``should no longer lend
an ear to the empty promises of the United States' side.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report found that ``several
monitoring problems affect IAEA's ability to insure that North
Korea is complying fully with certain aspects of the nuclear
freeze.'' IAEA is the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the North Koreans had placed several
obstacles in the path of the international inspectors, notably by
refusing to allow them to install equipment to monitor the tanks
that hold nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tanks are connected to a complex and inaccessible piping
system that, if operating, would permit the waste to be removed
and/or altered,'' the report said. ``While North Korea maintains
that the system's valves are closed, IAEA is concerned that the
valves' status is not verifiable and that North Korea could be
using these or other valves and pumps to tamper with the tanks'
contents.''

 &HT;    Nelson will ask for sanctions if settlement not reached
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Bill Nelson affirmed Tuesday that he is prepared
to ask for sanctions against Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit
Suisse if the banks do not reach a satisfactory settlement with
Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner, mentioned
the possibility of sanctions to The Palm Beach Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those banks don't treat people correctly, I'm going after
them,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he did not know about accusations that the banks
stole Holocaust victims' assets when he signed off on contracts for
them to provide credit to a state insurance concern.
</P>
<P>
   He was unaware, Nelson said, that a lawsuit against the banks
had been filed four months before he approved the second contract
in 1997. The suit did not exist when the first contract was
approved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have offered $600 million to settle Holocaust claims
but negotiators are asking for $1.5 billion. California has banned
the banks from state business and New York is threatening do so by
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Union Bank of Switzerland became the lead bank or
``syndication agent'' in a consortium of international banks
providing $1.5 billion in credit to Florida's Joint Underwriting
Association, a state-created home insurer of last resort. The
agency can tap the money to pay claims in the event of a hurricane.
Fees to the Swiss banks total an estimated $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he has asked attorneys to explore his legal powers
to ask the JUA to stop doing business with the banks. The current
contract runs through 1999 and Nelson said he would consider
breaking that contract if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Tuesday he did not recall signing any documents
mentioning Swiss banks in 1995, but Union Bank of Switzerland is
mentioned in a one-page document he signed on Sept. 7, 1995
certifying the credit arrangement. J.P. Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
of New York served as managing agent for the banks in both
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Jewish groups favor sanctions. Nelson said he would also
have to consider the financial best interest of the 270,000
homeowners protected by the JUA before making any final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the banks said sanctions would be the wrong move
considering the progress that has been made to rectify a
50-year-old problem.

CITING LOW CHIP PRICES, INTEL EARNS LESS THAN FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. reported a 29 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings Tuesday, a greater-than-expected decline
that the leading maker of computer chips attributed to weakened
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is regarded as a bellwether of the computer
industry, also said that it did not expect to see a significant
improvement in its third-quarter financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported its earnings after the stock market closed, and
its shares fell slightly in after-hours dealing. Investors had
recently pushed Intel and other technology stocks higher on
optimism that the company's results would portend a rebound in
growth.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ending on June 27, Intel earned $1.17 billion,
or 66 cents a fully diluted share, compared with $1.645 billion, or
92 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue totaled $5.93 billion, compared with $5.96 billion in
the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
estimates, had expected Intel to earn 68 cents a share. The
so-called whisper number, offered by analysts to clients orally,
was 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel's earnings fell two cents short of the consensus,
analysts said there were no major surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But in a reflection of the anxiety surrounding Intel's
prospects, its shares declined $1.6875 Tuesday in regular Nasdaq
trading, to $80.6875. In after-hours dealings, once the earnings
figures had been released, the shares eased further to $80.125.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's earnings have suffered in recent quarters from cuts in
the prices of chips to meet new competition and a supply glut of
personal computers in the hands of distributors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said gross profit margins were reduced because of
write-downs of inventory, reflecting weaker selling prices at the
end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that
without these write-downs, Intel would have earned 71 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important,'' he said, ``is that the outlook going
forward continues to be in line with our expectation that the PC
inventory correction is in the process of ending, and Intel will be
one of the big beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that the inventory write-downs reflected some
weakness that should have been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a sigh of relief that things are not falling off
a cliff in the second half,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G.
Cowen Securities Corp. ``But people should remember this company is
a far way from the halcyon days of the early '90s.'' Peck said
Intel is ``not going to show earnings growth in 1998, and '99 may
be tough as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that shipments of microprocessors were down
slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter of 1998, but
that sales of products based on its newer P6 design continued to
grow while Pentium processor-based products declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a difficult environment for the computing industry,
Intel has made significant strides toward increased productivity,
just as we have worked to renew growth,'' Craig R. Barrett, Intel's
president and chief executive, said in a statement. ``We have cut
costs, extended our product line, and are ahead of schedule in
using new manufacturing processes. As a result, we have increased
Intel's competitiveness substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Intel has seldom had to lower prices because
consumers were willing to pay more for its newest,
highest-performance chips. But while a portion of the market will
still pay high prices for the fastest microprocessors, the personal
computer industry's fastest-growing segment has been sub-$1,000
machines.
</P>
<P>
   After letting Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National
Semiconductor Corp. get an early lead in that market, Intel
responded with the low-cost Celeron chip, but that chip had a slow
start. &QL;

 &HT;    Huffy breaks even in earnings
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Huffy Corp. on Tuesday reported break-even
earnings for the second quarter due to a $12.6 million charge
related to the closing of its Celina bike plant.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shut down the world's largest bike plant is
expected to enhance Huffy's bike division long term, but the move
cost the company a 25 percent gain in second-quarter net earnings.
Without the $12.6 million charge, Huffy's earnings would have
increased to $7.8 million, or 63 cents per share, compared with
$6.2 million, or 49 cents per share, during the second quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's second-quarter sales rose 3.4 percent to $220 million
from $213 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Miamisburg-based Huffy shocked its 1,000 hourly workers in
Celina on May 28th when the bike manufacturer said it will close
the plant within a year. The company plans to transfer only a
handful of skilled trade workers from Celina to its bike plant in
Farmington, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy plans to increase bike production at the Farmington plant
and will import more bikes from Asia and Mexico to cover the lost
production in Celina.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the decision to reconfigure the bicycle operation
unfavorably impacted our second-quarter earnings, the elimination
of excess production capacity and reduction of operating expenses
will enhance performance in 1999 and beyond,'' said Don R. Graber,
Huffy's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategies to generate consistent, acceptable levels of
earnings continue to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's bike division has fully recovered from a disastrous 1995
when it lost $10.5 million and was having trouble competing with
cheaper imported bikes from China. Layoffs at its Celina bike plant
are expected to begin in August.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this year, Huffy's net earnings rose
26 percent to $11.6 million, or 93 cents per share, prior to the
$12.6 million charge for closing its bike plant. Sales for the
six-month period increased about 5 percent to $402 million compared
with $385 million during the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy also makes basketball backboards and lawn and garden
tools, and markets inventory and supplier services.

 &HT;    GM takes fight to court in attempt to end strikes
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. sought help in federal court
Tuesday to end a pair of crippling auto strikes that so far have
cost it $1.2 billion, arguing that the monthlong walkouts are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on the same day GM reported that its
second-quarter profits plummeted 81 percent because of the strikes
in Flint, Mich., that have shut down nearly all of the company's
North American production.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, GM asked the court to force the United Auto
Workers into arbitration to decide the legality of the strikes the
automaker considers a breach of its national UAW contract. It also
said it may ask the judge to order the 9,200 striking workers back
to work and award the company unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the arbitration motion was scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   The action was sure to intensify the rift between the two sides
as talks at the two parts plants in Flint dragged on Tuesday with
no signs a settlement. The strikes are into their sixth week and
have idled 175,000 workers nationwide, including nearly 8,000 GM
workers in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   While the Flint talks are at a standstill, negotiators for GM
and the UAW in Dayton aren't doing much better in settling issues
that threaten the future of two local brake factories.
</P>
<P>
   UAW Local 696, which represents 3,400 workers at the brake
plants on Wisconsin Boulevard and Needmore Road, have been at odds
with GM for more than two years. The local talks center on
outsourcing issues, work rules and one company proposal that would
slash 1,800 jobs from the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The International UAW has threatened to call strikes in Dayton
and at a metal-stamping plant in Indianapolis. But GM has asked the
union for assurance that more strikes won't be called once the
Flint walkouts are settled.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GM reported that it earned $389 million, or 52 cents
a diluted share, in the April-June period compared with $2.1
billion, or $2.67 a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue totaled $38.9 billion, down 14 percent from $45.1
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   GM said the Flint strikes reduced after-tax profits by $1.2
billion, or $1.79 a share. The strikes have shuttered 25 assembly
plants and more than 100 parts plants across North America.
Analysts estimate the strikes are costing GM about $80 million a
day in lost production.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter results were in line with analysts'
expectations. The average estimate in a survey of 15 analysts by
First Call Corp. was 53 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our financial performance in the second quarter of
1998 was severely impacted by the UAW strikes against our plants in
Flint, and was certainly not representative of the positive
momentum our financial performance had been building,'' said GM
chairman Jack Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The strike losses don't take into effect any production that may
be recouped after the walkouts are over.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said GM was re-evaluating its spending priorities to
``protect key product programs, such as our new generation of
full-size pickups.''
</P>
<P>
   GM said the strikes had forced it to temporarily suspend its $4
billion stock-repurchase program that began in March. The company
spent $1 billion in the second quarter to repurchase more than 14
million shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes also had a significant effect on GM's cash, which
totaled $9.1 billion at the end of the quarter. That was down from
$13.6 billion on March 31 and $14.9 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker said lower production volume and intense price
competition contributed to the drop in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Delphi Automotive Systems parts unit earned $374 million in
the quarter, down 28 percent from $522 million a year ago. And GM's
international operations earned $181 million, down 53 percent from
$385 million in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GM's earnings a year ago included the effects of less
devastating strikes at two assembly plants. Those strikes reduced
profits by $490 million, or 67 cents a share.

STARR SUBPOENAS HEAD OF CLINTON SECURITY DETAIL TO TESTIFY BEFORE
GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expanding efforts to wrestle evidence from the
Secret Service, independent counsel Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed
the head of President Clinton's security detail to testify before a
federal grand jury investigating an alleged presidential affair and
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Starr to question Special Agent Larry Cockrell, and
possibly other Secret Service agents, came Tuesday as the Justice
Department appealed a court decision compelling Secret Service
employees to appear before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Until Cockrell was summoned, Starr had limited his request for
Secret Service testimony to an agency attorney and two uniformed
officers, none of whom is a member of the president's personal
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cockrell, who often stands at the president's
shoulder and sits across from him in the presidential limousine,
six other Secret Service officers have been subpoenaed to tell what
they saw or heard while protecting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also subpoenaed by Starr were records kept by the Secret Service
that would provide details of Clinton's activities and his
movements at night from 1995 through early 1997, dates that overlap
with the time Monica Lewinsky spent at the White House as an intern
and later on the president's legislative affairs staff. The latter
months include a period when Lewinsky reportedly made three dozen
visits to the White House and was cleared to enter the mansion by
someone in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena for Cockrell demanded him to appear before the
grand jury Thursday. Sources said administration lawyers were
preparing to ask the courts Wednesday for an emergency stay of the
subpoena. Cockrell is scheduled to accompany the president to
Arkansas and Louisiana later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell's subpoena raised the possibility that Starr also would
seek testimony from former heads of Clinton's personal security
detail, including David Carpenter, Lewis Merletti and Brian
Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Merletti, currently the director of the Secret Service, has been
leading the effort to shield agents from having to testify before
Starr's grand jury. The tall, gray-haired Carpenter, who often is
mistaken for Clinton and has served as a decoy for the president,
left the agency to head the State Department's security team and
office of foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in a move that could further delay Starr's
investigation, the Justice Department asked all 11 members of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review
decisions by a federal judge and three-judge appeals panel saying
that Secret Service agents must cooperate with the grand jury
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is being used by Starr to investigate whether
Clinton or his associates illegally tried to cover up alleged
sexual encounters between the president and Lewinsky and with White
House aide Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-page motion, the Justice Department contends that the
three-judge panel erred when it ``substituted its judgment'' for
the opinions of experienced Secret Service agents who assert that
compelling them to testify would endanger a president's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury Department that is
represented in the appeal by Justice Department lawyers, has argued
that forcing agents to testify would jeopardize a president's trust
in his protectors' ability to keep confidential what they see and
hear. As a result, the agency asserts, a president would distance
himself from his security detail and increase the risk of
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that the difference of even a few
feet between a president and his protective detail could mean the
difference between life or death,'' Merletti said in a recent court
filing.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson and the three
appeals court judges declined to recognize a so-called ``protective
privilege'' to shield Secret Service agents from having to testify,
some Justice Department officials privately expressed doubts about
the agency's chance of winning before the full appeals court or,
eventually, the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, the federal court of appeals for D.C. has
handled more than 700 cases, and only two were heard by the full
court. Neither of those saw a reversal of a 3-0 decision as was
rendered in the Secret Service privilege case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the U.S. District Courthouse, Linda Tripp, whose
taped conversations with Lewinsky triggered the investigation of
possible perjury and obstruction of justice, appeared before the
grand jury for a fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tapes reportedly include claims by Lewinsky that
contradict denials made under oath by her and Clinton that they
engaged in sex. The tapes also reportedly include claims by
Lewinsky that Clinton and close friend Vernon Jordan urged her to
lie about her relationship with the president. Clinton and Jordan
deny urging anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the tapes, according to accounts of those who have heard
portions of the secretly recorded telephone conversations, Lewinsky
discusses ways for Tripp to alter her recollection of a November
1993 encounter between Clinton and Willey outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has testified under oath that during that meeting Clinton
kissed and fondled her against her will. Clinton acknowledged
meeting privately with Willey but denied any inappropriate
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's suggestions to Tripp reportedly were made after she
learned that she might be questioned under oath by attorneys for
Paula Jones, who at the time was suing Clinton for sexual
harassment over an incident when he was governor of Arkansas.
Jones' lawsuit has been dismissed by a federal judge in Little
Rock, Ark.

LOTT REKINDLES CHINA MISSILE CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on
Tuesday that Senate investigators had concluded that China improved
its military missile program when it received sensitive American
space technology after the Clinton administration loosened export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing floor speech, Lott also said ``new information''
had surfaced on China's effort to influence the 1996 American
elections. But he said he could not discuss the disclosures because
they were classified.
</P>
<P>
   ``National security concerns are regularly downplayed and even
ignored,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments mark the first attempt by a congressional leader to
characterize the disparate findings of 10 House and Senate
committees on the far-reaching inquiry into whether China illegally
obtained American technology that helped Beijing's ballistic
missile program. Lott's speech was an apparent attempt to create a
sense of momentum and focus that the overall investigation has been
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats immediately accused Lott of jumping to false
conclusions and politicizing the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statement by the majority leader endangers national
security,'' said Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, the ranking Democrat on
the Intelligence Committee, ``because it threatens our committee's
capacity to produce a bipartisan set of recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senators have expressed frustration that the
inquiries of four Senate committees, which have held 13 hearings
since May, have gained little traction.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last Thursday of several Republican senators who
advise Lott on China, several urged him to tie together the most
important findings, and go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to bring the interim conclusions to the Senate
floor,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other Republicans said the administration was
stonewalling their requests for documents, an accusation that
Kerrey and White House officials denied.
</P>
<P>
   In his floor speech, Lott dropped no bombshells and offered no
new evidence to support his assertions. Instead, he restated some
of the principal accusations made in the Senate hearings to date
and called them ``five major interim judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Lott said the administration's controls over the export
of American satellites for launching on Chinese rockets was
``wholly inadequate.'' He cited the testimony of the General
Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, that the shifting
of licensing authority over commercial satellites to the Commerce
Department from the State Department in 1996 loosened restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also noted that the Justice Department is investigating two
instances where sensitive technology may have been improperly
diverted to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   One case involves information Loral Space &AMP; Communications and
Hughes Electronics shared with Chinese engineers after a failed
launching of a Loral satellite in February 1996. The second
instance involves information Hughes shared with Chinese officials
after the failed launching of a Hughes satellite in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Commerce Department official acknowledged last week
that the department had erred by failing to refer the Hughes damage
report to the State Department for review before the company gave
the results to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said that China's military benefited from the
information shared by Loral and Hughes. That was the conclusion of
three federal agencies that reviewed the information the companies
gave to Chinese rocket scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on how much satellite exports enhance
China's ballistic missile programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the administration had ignored intelligence findings
that China shipped M-11 missiles to Pakistan in 1992, and refused
to impose strict sanctions on China that would also hurt American
satellite makers. Administration officials have said the evidence
was not solid enough.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lott said new information has emerged about China's
effort to influence the 1996 elections. Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., who heads the Intelligence Committee, said the same thing
after a closed meeting last week with FBI Director Louis Freeh.
Neither senator gave any details. But Lott renewed his call Tuesday
for an independent counsel to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the head of the Pentagon agency responsible for
safeguarding American technology exports, is scheduled to testify
before the Intelligence Committee. And the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee this week invited C. Michael Armstrong and
Michael Smith, the former and current chief executives of Hughes,
to testify at a hearing this month. Senators said they are willing
to subpoena the executives if they do not testify voluntarily.

 (ATTN: Alaska)  (Also moved in ``t'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost a decade after Alaska lost its nonstop passenger service
to Japan, Northwest Airlines is currently making weekly nonstop
flights between Anchorage and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska proposed $1 million in
incentives to any airline that provided direct service to Tokyo.
However, Northwest does not qualify for the incentive because it
plans to suspend service Sept. 24, at least until next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But its 15 summer round-trip flights are expected to bring in
more than 4,200 Japanese business and leisure travelers, and
Knowles said the flights would add more than $12 million to the
Alaskan economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to 1989, most international traffic stopped here to
refuel,'' said Morton Plumb, Jr., director of Anchorage
International Airport. But Anchorage was no longer needed after the
fall of communism opened the shorter polar routes to international
air traffic, and more fuel-efficient jet planes made refueling
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   While Anchorage does a big business in cargo flights, ranking
12th in the United States, its international traffic dwindled to
396,000 passengers in 1994, the fewest number in years, from 1.5
million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   This year, including the expected 4,200 Northwest passengers and
those who connect from Hawaii and cities in the continental United
States, the foreign passenger tally in Anchorage will rise to about
720,000, Plumb said, while domestic passengers will total 4.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, annual gross sales at Anchorage's duty-free shops
have struggled back to about $16 million, double the amount of four
years ago but still only a fraction of the $118 million in gross
sales in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the drop in revenue is the result of the big
drop in international passengers. But Plumb observed that many of
the current Chinese and South Korean visitors spend less freely
than the Japanese passengers of a decade ago, and today's Japanese
visitors themselves spend less freely, no doubt because of their
nation's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Cruises
</P>
<P>
   The jointly owned Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity
Cruises have announced millennium plans for their 17 ships. Royal
Caribbean's Legend of the Seas, for example, will be among the
first and last cruise ships to celebrate the first day, by
positioning itself west of the international date line on Dec. 31,
1999, and east of the dateline on Jan. 1, 2000. Its Vision of the
Seas will be the first to enter the Panama Canal from the Caribbean
in 2000, followed by Celebrity's Zenith.
</P>
<P>
   A Gift in Time
</P>
<P>
   By commissioning a line of gifts from some of Japan's leading
artists and craftsmen, the Park Hyatt Tokyo Hotel has made it easy
for its guests in that present-giving country to pick up a little
something for customers, business associates, family or friends _
remembrances ranging from paper coasters with artistic designs to

<P>
   Almost a decade after Alaska lost its nonstop passenger service
to Japan, Northwest Airlines is currently making weekly nonstop
flights between Anchorage and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska proposed $1 million in
incentives to any airline that provided direct service to Tokyo.
However, Northwest does not qualify for the incentive because it
plans to suspend service Sept. 24, at least until next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But its 15 summer round-trip flights are expected to bring in
more than 4,200 Japanese business and leisure travelers, and
Knowles said the flights would add more than $12 million to the
Alaskan economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to 1989, most international traffic stopped here to
refuel,'' said Morton Plumb, Jr., director of Anchorage
International Airport. But Anchorage was no longer needed after the
fall of communism opened the shorter polar routes to international
air traffic, and more fuel-efficient jet planes made refueling
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   While Anchorage does a big business in cargo flights, ranking
12th in the United States, its international traffic dwindled to
396,000 passengers in 1994, the fewest number in years, from 1.5
million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   This year, including the expected 4,200 Northwest passengers and
those who connect from Hawaii and cities in the continental United
States, the foreign passenger tally in Anchorage will rise to about
720,000, Plumb said, while domestic passengers will total 4.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, annual gross sales at Anchorage's duty-free shops
have struggled back to about $16 million, double the amount of four
years ago but still only a fraction of the $118 million in gross
sales in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the drop in revenue is the result of the big
drop in international passengers. But Plumb observed that many of
the current Chinese and South Korean visitors spend less freely
than the Japanese passengers of a decade ago, and today's Japanese
visitors themselves spend less freely, no doubt because of their
nation's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Cruises
</P>
<P>
   The jointly owned Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity
Cruises have announced millennium plans for their 17 ships. Royal
Caribbean's Legend of the Seas, for example, will be among the
first and last cruise ships to celebrate the first day, by
positioning itself west of the international date line on Dec. 31,
1999, and east of the dateline on Jan. 1, 2000. Its Vision of the
Seas will be the first to enter the Panama Canal from the Caribbean
in 2000, followed by Celebrity's Zenith.
</P>
<P>
   A Gift in Time
</P>
<P>
   By commissioning a line of gifts from some of Japan's leading
artists and craftsmen, the Park Hyatt Tokyo Hotel has made it easy
for its guests in that present-giving country to pick up a little
something for customers, business associates, family or friends _
remembrances ranging from paper coasters with artistic designs to
tea sets and sake bottles.
</P>
<P>
   These items, most of which are hand crafted, can be ordered from
hotel rooms and are wrapped by the hotel staff in traditional
Japanese paper and cord.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Investigators bear down on N.C. area where Rudolph may be hiding
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ The discovery of a pickup truck believed stolen
by Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has led federal
investigators to double their force here and hint that they could
be close to finding the fugitive who was last reported seen Jan.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that
the man who reported his truck stolen knew Rudolph and had seen him
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear to investigators was why the man waited at
least two days to report the pickup stolen, giving Rudolph time to
escape with another six months' worth of food, which he also
allegedly stole from the man.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said that does not mean that the man,
identified as George Nordmann, an elderly health food store
proprietor, was trying to help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph. ``What would
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force
investigating the Birmingham bombing and three Atlanta bombings,
``This is a witness of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann's 1977 blue Nissan pickup truck was recovered Monday
shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested
area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C. Investigators said Nordmann
told them the pickup truck was stolen from him Thursday, along with
a large amount of food.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were
found on the pickup. ``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we
may,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators indicated that they believe they are closer to
Rudolph than they have been since he was named in February as a
suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that
killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously
injured a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson declared, ``We
are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they may have missed Rudolph, a
31-year-old carpenter and experienced outdoorsman, by just hours
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF official said a federal agent had passed through the
area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found Monday and that
the truck was not there. ``It was not in the location where it was
found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million
reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said Rudolph, who moved as a teenager with his mother
and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is
believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard
and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has
reenergized the manhunt for Rudolph, who was last reported seen at
a video store in Murphy on Jan. 30. A few days later, a pickup
truck registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the
day of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near
Murphy. Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of
the forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters
here in Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup
truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at
1-888-ATF- BOMB. There's a million dollar reward for information
leading to Rudolph's capture.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudoloph
was alive and hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
They also believed he was acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that,'' Enderson said. ``The search has been
intensified significantly.'' The number of agents in western North
Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had
about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared
into the woods. ``He had stolen another six months worth, or at
least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are
approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was first approached as if it might be
boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County , N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain
near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks
that reach 4500 to 5000 feet into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foilage is so thick you can't see....you can't find
anything,'' Thompson said. ``I said all along he was here and he'll
be here until he's caught.''

FIRM BUYS NEW CHUNK OF 20TH CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- American International Group Inc., which rode in
like a white knight to save 20th Century Industries after the
Northridge quake, is poised to take a controlling stake in the auto
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City-based insurance and financial services firm
said late Tuesday it has purchased enough shares of 20th Century's
common stock to give it ownership of 15.4 percent of the
outstanding common shares.
</P>
<P>
   And if it converts the preferred stock and exercises the
warrants it acquired as part of its bailout deal with 20th Century,
it could own more than 50 percent of 20th Century's outstanding
common stock -- and a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   An AIG spokesman could not say how many additional shares AIG
bought most recently, when they were purchased or at what price.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 25 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, however,
the company said it owned about 3.21 million shares of 20th
Century's common stock. Conversion of the preferred stock and
exercise of the warrants at that time would have given AIG about
39.1 million, or 44.6 percent, of 20th Century's common stock.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 51.7 million common shares outstanding, said Rick
Hill, vice president of corporate relations for 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had not seen the latest filings, but Tuesday's
announcement indicates that AIG is following through on its
intention revealed in April to own more than half of 20th Century's
voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think (AIG) is going to want 100 percent of
it,'' Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities Ltd. in
Westport, Conn., told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   AIG first invested in 20th Century in 1994 after nearly
two-thirds of 20th Century's capital was wiped out by claims
stemming from the Northridge earthquake. Part of AIG's bailout
included a provision allowing it to later buy as many shares of
20th Century as it wanted, preventing 20th Century officers from
enacting bylaws that most companies could use to stop an unwanted
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of 20th Century closed Tuesday at 27.9375, down 0.0625

PACKAGING WAGNER IN FLESH AND FLASH FOR FUN AND PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19.)  
 (JT)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jet-black man, facing front and nearly naked but for a spiked
leather G-string with matching spiked sunglasses, and holding a
dead white swan; a trio of skinny, scantily clad, bewigged and
beribboned drag queens who could be drum majorettes in a Gay Day
parade; a naked obese woman sitting on a floor and cuddling a tiny
dog between her fleshy arm and humongous bosom, with heart-shaped
trinkets masking her face and nipples. Are we leafing through some
gay and lesbian soft-porn magazine? No, these are the covers of
three new RCA Victor recordings of orchestral excerpts and
arrangements from Wagner operas, performed by the Netherlands Radio
Philharmonic under the direction of the distinguished Dutch
conductor Edo de Waart.
</P>
<P>
   Slick, sensationalized cover art has often played a part in the
selling of classical recordings. But even David Kuehn, the vice
president for marketing and for artists and repertory at the New
York office of BMG Classics, which manufactures RCA recordings,
admits that the new Wagner covers are over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no middle of the road about them,'' Kuehn said
recently. ``Even within our own ranks, when we first presented the
covers and the marketing plans, it was pretty evenly divided
between fans and detractors. Some thought it was exactly what we
needed, but the core of the classical people thought it was really
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, certain stores are nervous as well. At the Tower
Records store near Lincoln Center in Manhattan, the new CD's have
not been given prominent display; they are in a bin labeled
``Wagner: with tasteful covers.'' The facetious tone of the
description is clearly intentional, and the hint of a disclaimer is
understandable. Whether you find these designs arousing and
imaginative or just plain grotesque, tasteful they are not.
</P>
<P>
   But taste, Kuehn suggests, is in the eye of the beholder. Or
perhaps in the hand of the beholder, for getting a CD into a
consumer's hands is the first step in selling it. ``I have
purchased recordings of music I did not know, based on intriguing
or provocative cover art,'' Kuehn said. And he disputes the idea
that classical-music consumers are immune to marketing techniques;
it's just that the marketing has to be creative and appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, in terms of eye-catching contemporary cover designs,
the classical record business has a lot of catching up to do. In
the heyday of long-playing records, during the 1950s and '60s,
cover designs were more often inept than tasteless. London Records
was famous for its maladroit covers of complete opera recordings
with great artists like Joan Sutherland and Renata Tebaldi. Ms.
Tebaldi's classic 1958 recording of ``Madama Butterfly'' featured a
photo of the diva costumed as Cio-Cio-San but looking like some
frump on her way to a Halloween party. Then there was the boringly
austere approach, typified by Westminster Records: against darkish
single-color backdrops the pertinent information was printed in
gold or silver italicized lettering.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Angel Records (now EMI Classics), knowing
that it had a glamorous star in Maria Callas, designed her covers
accordingly. Callas' 1964 recording of ``Carmen'' was first issued
in a deluxe blood-red, velvet-textured box with a picture of the
diva looking menacingly seductive, captioned, unabashedly, ``Callas
 &UR; is &LR;  Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were all those adulatory Angel and Deutsche Grammophon
recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan, with cover photos of
the silver-haired maestro in a leather coat standing next to his
white sports car or gazing regally at snowy vistas in the Austrian
Alps. Then came the teen-meat-in-jeans campaign for the winsome
violinist Joshua Bell, when he made his first recordings for London
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, BMG has been particularly bold _ some might say
crass _ in creating marketing concepts that executives deem
titillating. This is the company that produced ``Out Classics,'' a
collection of music by gay (or supposedly gay) composers, culled
from the BMG catalog. On the cover was a photograph showing the
upper body of a seemingly naked, impossibly hunky young man with an
intense, distracted look on his Byronic face.
</P>
<P>
   Does this kind of cover art sell records? And how do such
far-out design concepts relate to the music being marketed?
</P>
<P>
   De Waart offers performances of suites from several operas _
``orchestral summaries,'' they are called here _ arranged by Henk
de Vlieger, a Dutch composer. The disks are titled `` `Der Ring,'
an Orchestral Adventure,'' `` `Parsifal,' an Orchestral Quest'' and
`` `Tristan und Isolde,' an Orchestral Passion.'' Longer orchestral
passages, like the Prelude to ``Tristan,'' are performed intact
along with other excerpts in which de Vlieger has assigned the
vocal lines to instruments. The recordings were made between 1992
and 1995, so BMG has had plenty of time to decide how to market
them.
</P>
<P>
   De Vlieger's work is professional, and de Waart's performances,
though nothing special, are spacious and clear-headed. Yet de
Waart's magisterial approach to Wagner makes matters all the more
curious: What possessed BMG to produce such grotesquely silly cover
designs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, our company headquarters is in New York, but these disks
were produced locally in Holland,'' Kuehn said. ``We have not given
local territories enough opportunities to create their own
projects. So when these recordings came up, it was decided to find
a Dutch designer, someone with the same hip cachet of, say, Bruce
Weber in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer is an outfit called Edzeetera, but the crucial
aspect is the work of Erwin Olaf, a 38-year-old photographer who
first earned attention with his photos documenting the Dutch
homosexual-rights movement. A successful early exhibition in
Amsterdam, ``Among Men/Among Women,'' led Olaf to work with various
European homosexual magazines. He is considered a sort of Dutch
Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designs are obviously homoerotic,'' Kuehn said. But are
they?
</P>
<P>
   The muscular black man on the ``Parsifal'' disk could be some
Mad Max version of the opera's questing knight, holding over his
shoulder the limp swan he has just shot with his bow and arrow. The
three prancing drag-queens on the ``Ring'' album are clearly meant
to be the Rhinemaidens. And the obese woman on the ``Tristan''
recording (overweight naked women are a recurring theme in Olaf's
work) is certainly intended as a satirical depiction of an enormous
Wagnerian singer, complete with diva trappings, including her tiny
pooch. The heart that covers her face is no doubt metaphoric.
(Isolde blinded by love, get it?)
</P>
<P>
   The records are being heavily pitched to the gay male market.
BMG has been running frequent ads in The Advocate, the national
homosexual magazine, with sales copy as excessive as the cover
designs: ``No other composer is as sensual, dramatic, or intense as
Wagner ... For the first time a three-CD series that encompasses
the most enticing melodies of this composer's magical operas.''
</P>
<P>
   The covers seem more campy than magical. But what does a music
critic know about marketing design? The records have been selling
briskly, Kuehn says, especially in major urban markets, a fact that
at the very least should help combat the dismaying stereotype that
gay men have good taste. In Holland, the disks are available in a
boxed set with a booklet containing all 12 of Olaf's photographic
conceptions of various characters from the Wagner operas.

NEW TRANSLATIONS OF BIBLE CAN'T BE WORD FOR WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Translation is not replacing one English word with one Havasupai
word. In Havasupai, the structure of the sentence builds to the
point. English clauses may be difficult to convey.
</P>
<P>
   In the New International Version of the Bible, 1 Corinthians
1:18 reads: ``For the message of the cross is foolishness to those
who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Havasupai is roughly translated word for word, the same
verse reads ``Cross, Christ has died, people that God does not
know, when they hear it, it isn't worth anything, but people that
are saved, God they know, they God see great works his.''
</P>
<P>
   Some similes in Scripture are changed to reflect life in Supai,
such as the phrase from James 1:6: ``He who doubts is like a wave
of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In Supai, the blue-green water flows in the same direction,
tumbling down the breathtaking falls. The erratic Canyon winds made
a better example.
</P>
<P>
   Other images aren't so easily conveyed the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In Luke 5, Jesus recruits his disciples, saying he will make
them fishers of men. The first translation came across as, ``A lot
of fish were on the shore and now a lot of people will come and
help pick the fish up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Havasupai text was revised again, and the new translation
was understood as, ``Your work has been getting fish, but from now
on you will get people to believe my word.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHVALE, Calif. _ Standing amidst one of the most elaborately
engineered hydraulic systems in the world, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt took a sledge hammer to a dam in California's Central
Valley on Tuesday, heralding the start of what he said would be an
era when many of the nation's 75,000 dams would be judged by
whether they did more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was that those who cheered the dismantling of the
half-century old McPherrin Dam in 100-degree heat included some of
the most battle-scarred veterans of California's waters wars _ the
ranchers, irrigators and urban water managers who have gained the
most from a century of federal dam subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one small blow for salmon,'' said Babbitt, with evident
glee, as he chipped away at the dam on Butte Creek, a major
tributary of the Sacramento River that used to have one of the
biggest salmon runs in the state. ``Dams are not like the pyramids
of Egypt that stand for eternity. They are instruments that should
be judged by the health of the rivers to which they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's words were in stark contrast to the heyday of
dam-building, when Westerners gathered under a hot sun to cheer
politicians breaking ground for big, concrete breaches on the major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could not have happened 10, 20 or 30 years ago,'' said
Timothy Quinn, deputy general manager of the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, which pulls water from every part
of this state to satisfy the greater Los Angeles area. ``The water
wars have given away to something entirely new.''
</P>
<P>
   The dam dismantling was the latest of Babbitt's recharged
environmental initiatives, coming at a time when he is viewed as
treading water in Washington because he is under investigation by
an independent counsel. The prosecutor is examining whether
campaign contributions to the Democratic Party influenced Interior
Department decisions with Indian tribes competing over the awarding
of a casino. Babbitt says he has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Babbitt will chink away at the first dam scheduled
for demolition in order to help endangered species in the Pacific
Northwest, a small dam in Medford, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been courting support from Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., who controls Interior Department spending in the Senate,
to tear down the Elwha Dam outside Olympic National Park in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In the next five years, up to 250 older dams will come up for
licensing renewal. Many of the most environmentally destructive
ones will not be renewed, Babbitt said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, dam removal proposals were considered
radical, with no chance of succeeding. Dams were built and
subsidized by the federal government, regardless of environmental
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the threat that court rulings on behalf of endangered
fish could shut down some dams, many of the beneficiaries of the
water projects have come around to environmental restoration _ as
long they can get their water from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly good for salmon,'' said Laverne McPherrin, the
patriarch of a ranching family that grows rice on 1,700 acres here.
The family, one of several ranching clans that have used most of
the water backed up by the dam, is now getting its water from
another diversion, one that is less lethal to salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a win-win? That depends,'' McPherrin said. ``We'll see
in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   More enthusiastic was Marc Reisner, the author of ``Cadillac
Desert,'' a seminal book on the environmental cost of Western water
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the good guys now,'' said Reisner, pointing to the
managers of the Los Angeles water district. ``Nobody's ox is
getting gored. Everybody is benefiting.''
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans were guardedly supportive of the
ceremonial demolition Tuesday in the Central Valley, largely
because no major water users were complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tearing down dams should be the rare exception, not the
rule,'' said Rep. Walley Herger, R-Calif., a former rancher who
represents this district north of Sacramento. ``Secretary Babbitt
should make no mistake. The West would never sit idly by while the
extremists of the environmental community try to destroy these
vital structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxed in by Congress on a number of environmental issues,
Babbitt says he has been using the inherent powers of the interior
secretary, and laws passed in the 1970s and '80s but rarely used,
to reorder how much of the natural world in the United States is
governed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he brought wolves back to the Southwest,
announced a series of plans by private landowners to protect
endangered species, and has steered water projects toward
environmental restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the environmental movement in the 20th century
has been fencing off and preserving the back twenty,'' Babbitt
said, in reference to establishment of national parks and
wilderness preserves. ``But the real action now is on landscapes
and watersheds. It is about restoration writ large.''
</P>
<P>
   The political gains of such a strategy were evident two years
ago, he said, when concerns about Republican efforts to roll back
environmental safeguards hurt several incumbent members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen ninety-six was the year we successfully reassembled
the Teddy Roosevelt coalition of hunters, anglers and outdoor
lovers with other conservationists,'' Babbitt said. ``What I've
learned is that you can play defense in the Congress. But the
offensive game, and all the fun, is outside of Congress.'' &QL;

HOLY PROJECT IN GRAND CANYON: COUPLE WORK ON HAVASUPAI BIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUPAI, Ariz. _ Scott and Lynanne Palmer brought their love for
God and master's degrees in linguistics to this dusty village in
the Grand Canyon's depths two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, surrounded by the high red rock walls, they painstakingly
continue the work of their hearts: translating the Bible into
Havasupai.
</P>
<P>
   They have lived with views of vivid blue sky by day and
brilliant stars by night, a short hike from the spectacular
blue-green Havasu Falls. They have raised two daughters in a home
smaller than a double garage, with few modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   They have earned trust and friendship and learned the Havasupai
language, carefully guarded by a tribe that does not want its words
scattered outside the Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   And with the help of a few tribal members, they have drafted
about 6,500 Bible verses _ most of the New Testament and 17
chapters of Genesis _ into Havasupai, a language so different from
English that each verse is translated meaning-to-meaning, rather
than word for word.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of the millennium will creep by before the Havasupai
New Testament and Genesis are finished, likely in 2002,
representing 24 years and more than a million dollars invested.
</P>
<P>
   All for a tribe with 670 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everyone who has grown up here, Havasupai is their
language,'' said Lynanne Palmer, a Wycliffe Bible Translator along
with Scott. ``That's the language that is closest to your heart,
and everybody deserves the chance to hear God's word in their own
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, we don't know how much this
translation will be used. The church has always been in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Wycliffe Bible Translators sends missionaries around the world
to translate the Bible into obscure languages, based on the
conviction that Scripture is understood best in a person's native
tongue. The translators do not proselytize or build churches.
</P>
<P>
   Each country's languages are cataloged and its people surveyed
for interest in a New Testament project. That done, the Palmers
went to Supai to find Christians interested in a translation and to
get permission from the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ida Iditicava was one of the first to help. Long before she met
the Palmers, she had heard the Navajos had the New Testament in
their own language. She believed in Jesus and thought maybe her
people should have a New Testament in their language, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it in English, I kind of understand it,'' she
said. ``When I read it in my language, then I know it. It will be
good.'' &QL; 
__ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1976, when the Palmers married on their way to
becoming translators with Wycliffe. She planned to work with a
tribe in northern Quebec, following a call to missions she felt as
a fourth-grader in social studies class in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to work on a project in Brazil, where his family
had lived when he was a boy. His father had worked on a ranch and
with a church mission there.
</P>
<P>
   Both projects fell through, and they weren't sure where in the
world they would be assigned, although they knew they would be
together. They finished their master's degrees, waited and prayed.
In the end, they went to the bottom of the Grand Canyon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 1{ years learning the language before starting the
actual translation. The work is painfully slow, even with native
speakers' help. Each verse is translated into Havasupai. The verses
are typed into the computer; and the revisions, double checks and
triple checks begin.
</P>
<P>
   Havasupai speakers read the verses for comprehension. The
passages are translated back to English as another check for
understanding. The final step is a theological consultant who reads
that English translation for biblical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bemus Uquallah became a staff member on the project and
now does the first draft translation. As a native speaker, he
completes the first rough draft more quickly than the Palmers, even
after their 20 years' experience with the language. Still, a day's
work may yield only 12 verses. &QL; 
Projects take years &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A typical translation project takes 15 to 30 years. The Palmers
optimistically figured their project would take five. They both
were working, and they had help from native speakers. The Havasupai
language was written. They had computers. A church had been in the
community for as long as most could remember.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the project, they experienced what Scott calls
the death of their vision, and they became even more focused on
God's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it to ask `What does God want?' and to hang in
there, and it's worth it to leave to God how it fits in with
everything else,'' Scott said. ``Sometimes we see it and we're very
happy about that and sometimes we don't see it. But what's
important is not seeing or seeing. What's important is what God
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   So they stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's flood left a foot of water in their house and a
broken air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Their water heater is a large pot on the stove, and their
bathroom is an outhouse down the path. Their refrigerator is
smaller than those in college dorms. Ice and meat are a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have television, so they spend the evenings after the
supper dishes are washed visiting with neighbors and reading aloud.
They lead less modern lives than some of their neighbors who have
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughters, 16-year-old Elena and 10-year-old Sarah, think
their lives are terrific, except for the packing and traveling back
and forth between their Canyon home and their home in Cottonwood,
where some of the translation work has been done. &QL; 
Hike out of Canyon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Palmers have lost track of how many times
they've been on the 8-mile trail in and out of the Canyon. A
helicopter taxis residents in and out of the village for $25 one
way, a little pricey for the family of four except in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Even while pregnant, Lynanne hiked. When she was too
uncomfortable to walk up and down the steep trail, Scott led her on
horseback, and their Supai friends made jokes about Mary and
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   He carried their daughters for the next four years of their
lives, in a backpack carrier they rigged long before the baby
backpacks were marketed. Today, he carries a laptop computer _ only
4 pounds, he says with glee, and probably their most modern
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   For most translation projects, work is done in and out of the
village, because the chores of life can be time-consuming, said
Dick Mueller, associate director of the North American translation
work.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmers also spend time out of the Canyon, traveling in
their aged motorhome to talk to churches that financially support
the project.
</P>
<P>
   In the Grand Canyon's only church, more tourists than tribal
members attend most Sunday mornings. Scott often plays the keyboard
and Elena plays the flute to accompany the congregation, which
meets in a converted Quonset hut. &QL; 
New understanding &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Palmers' efforts have not caused a mass conversion to
Christianity in the village. But Uquallah, an elder in the church,
believes the translation is the only way his tribe will understand
that Jesus is not a White man's God.
</P>
<P>
   ``When different people come in to test the translation work, I
always hear something like, `Oh, is that what it says? I didn't
really understand that,' '' he said. ``I know that it's going to be
a big help to my people. The word of God, that's a powerful thing,
and they should be able to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another project volunteer didn't quite understand the gospel
until she heard it in Havasupai, Lynanne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day, she prayed to trust Christ, and I got to be there
and listen,'' said Lynanne, who still meets with the woman.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palmers hike out of the Canyon for the last time, they
will take a copy of the Havasupai Bible only if the tribe gives
them one. They will not be credited as the translators, and years
from now, no one may even remember their names.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott has this picture in his head of heaven, an image from
a favorite verse in Revelation: ``There before me was a great
multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people
and language, standing before the throne . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those people, he says, will speak Havasupai. &QL;

NEW TRANSLATIONS OF BIBLE CAN'T BE WORD FOR WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Translation is not replacing one English word with one Havasupai
word. In Havasupai, the structure of the sentence builds to the
point. English clauses may be difficult to convey.
</P>
<P>
   In the New International Version of the Bible, 1 Corinthians
1:18 reads: ``For the message of the cross is foolishness to those
who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Havasupai is roughly translated word for word, the same
verse reads ``Cross, Christ has died, people that God does not
know, when they hear it, it isn't worth anything, but people that
are saved, God they know, they God see great works his.''
</P>
<P>
   Some similes in Scripture are changed to reflect life in Supai,
such as the phrase from James 1:6: ``He who doubts is like a wave
of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In Supai, the blue-green water flows in the same direction,
tumbling down the breathtaking falls. The erratic Canyon winds made
a better example.
</P>
<P>
   Other images aren't so easily conveyed the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In Luke 5, Jesus recruits his disciples, saying he will make
them fishers of men. The first translation came across as, ``A lot
of fish were on the shore and now a lot of people will come and
help pick the fish up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Havasupai text was revised again, and the new translation
was understood as, ``Your work has been getting fish, but from now
on you will get people to believe my word.'' &QL;

U.S. PRESSES ALLIES TO REIN IN PROPOSED WAR CRIMES COURT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The United States has been putting pressure on some of
its closest European allies to limit the scope of a future
permanent international war crimes court.
</P>
<P>
   Talking points said to have been prepared for Defense Secretary
William Cohen, for example, suggested that if Germany succeeded in
lobbying for ``universal jurisdiction'' for the court, the United
States might retaliate by removing its overseas troops, including
those in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Few Europeans took the threat seriously, believing that
Washington would not abandon its NATO commitments to protest the
formation of the international criminal court. And Germany was
dropping its support for the proposal anyway after being persuaded
by other European countries that it had too little support to end
up in the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But the talking points underscore how fiercely Washington
opposes the kind of court desired by some of its closest allies.
The United States is leading the opposition to the proposal for a
powerful court, with the support of France and some developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon denied on Tuesday that Cohen had threatened to
withdraw troops from Europe. But the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth
Bacon, said Cohen had argued publicly and privately against
sweeping powers for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also said Cohen had never seen ``those talking points.''
Pentagon officials said they did not know where the document had
originated and did not believe that it had come from their
department.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations from more than 160 countries have been negotiating
the terms of a treaty at a U.N. conference in Rome. As the deadline
for a compromise looms this Friday, some of the most crucial and
contentious issues covering the court's power and jurisdiction have
yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the talking points spread through the conference
rooms on Tuesday, it created a stir at a gathering already marked
by tension and deep divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is one of more than 50 countries that have wanted a
powerful court that could prosecute individuals in any country, for
crimes ranging from genocide to crimes against humanity and war
crimes, whether or not their country signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States worries that its troops could someday be
hauled before foreign judges on politically motivated charges, and
has been lobbying relentlessly to limit the court's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the universal jurisdiction proposal be adopted by the
Rome Conference, we would have to consider the implications for our
overseas presence, including our commitment of forces to Europe''
was how the American talking points prepared for conversations with
German defense officials expressed the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
   The talking points, which were dated last Thursday, were
private, but a copy was made available to The New York Times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Scheffer, who leads the U.S. delegation, made the American
position clear last week, when he told the conference that the
United States would countenance a permanent war crimes tribunal
only if its automatic jurisdiction was limited to genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer insisted that the United States would not allow the
court automatic jurisdiction crimes against humanity or war crimes.
To investigate those charges, the United States asserted, the court
would need the consent of accused country. Nations that have not
signed the treaty would have to agree before the court could act.
</P>
<P>
   Even on genocide charges, Washington says the court would have
jurisdiction only over countries that are party to the treaty. As
the talking points put it, the prospect of the new court
``pretending to have jurisdiction over our personnel, even though
we are not a party, is completely unacceptable to the United States
under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer declined to comment on the talking points, but a
spokesman for the American delegation said: ``We view these private
discussions as both a normal and essential part of our
negotiations. We enjoy close working relationships with our allies,
part of which includes speaking frankly on issues of importance.''
</P>
<P>
   The talking points angered many delegates who were upset by what
they viewed as American intransigence. Human rights groups, which
have been lobbying for the court to have the broadest possible
jurisdiction, were dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is what the United States is capable of doing in
order to get its way,'' said Jelena Pejic, head of the delegation
from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. ``If they can use
these kinds of bullying tactics on an ally like Germany, you can
imagine what they are doing to smaller countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The American hard line reflects Pentagon concerns, and also
strong opposition in the Senate, which must approve any treaty
signed in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the
Foreign Relations Committee, has warned that any treaty creating an
international court that could sit in judgment of American citizens
would be ``dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would be willing to sign a treaty,
but only if it was tightly tailored to protect American soldiers
from any risk of prosecution. Human rights groups and many
delegations argue that in seeking to protect its own citizens, the
United States would be giving people like President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq and the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot immunity from
prosecution.

CLINTON THREATENS VETO AGAINST SPENDING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday issued his strongest
veto threat yet against a spending bill for the next fiscal year,
but a powerful House committee did nothing to try to reshape the
bill to meet his demands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lawmakers from both parties tacked on a series of
amendments concerning smoking, women's health care and the
impotency drug Viagra. Then the Appropriations Committee approved
the bill, which would drastically scale back the president's
initiatives on education and cut aid for home-heating fuel and
summer jobs for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which would provide $81.9 billion for labor, health
and education programs, is perceived by all sides as one of the
most contentious of the 13 spending bills that Congress must pass
to keep the federal government running in the next fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in Congress has defied the president's
wishes most directly in this bill. And the president said on
Tuesday that he ``would have no choice but to veto it'' in its
current form.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bill ``denies essential educational
opportunities to young people across the country and important
training and job opportunities for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's actions allow both the Republicans and the
administration to stake out their positions _ the Republicans for
budget discipline, the president for education _ before more
intense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans in both houses have already said the cuts
are too drastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation will always be fluid until it lands on the
president's desk,'' Representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana,
the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, conceded on Tuesday
after the bill passed in a 32-to-23 vote along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained about the cuts at the four-hour meeting of
the Appropriations Committee. But they spent most of the time
discussing amendments that were unrelated to those cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Fla., proposed a new label on
cigarette packs warning that smoking kills black people at a higher
rate than it kills others. It passed by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., proposed a measure to allow women in
health maintenance organizations to designate their obstetricians
and gynecologists as their primary care doctors. It passed 29 to
25.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the highest ranking Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee, proposed a measure to prevent federal
money from being used to reimburse states whose Medicaid programs
pay for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Obey, citing estimates that his measure would save the federal
government $100 million a year, proposed using that savings to
treat children who are at risk for violent behavior. It passed by
voice vote.

CHRISTIAN RIGHT LAUNCHES AD ATTACK ON HOMOSEXUALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of influential Christian groups has
launched a national ad campaign attacking homosexuality, igniting a
firestorm of protest Tuesday as the religious right gears up for
the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader from
Mississippi who recently likened gays and lesbians to alcoholics
and kleptomaniacs, the $200,000 ad blitz characterizes homosexuals
as sinners in need of Christian healing.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial campaign, widely seen as an effort by the
Christian right to provide indirect support for congressional
candidates who promote the movement's agenda, sparked outrage among
gay rights leaders and produced the unintended consequence of
exposing a major rift in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP candidates facing tough elections in key races tried
to distance themselves from the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really wrong for both the Republican Party and the
country,'' said Peter G. Torkildsen, a Massachusetts Republican
trying to regain the seat he narrowly lost in 1996 to
Representative John F. Tierney, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that it serves any useful purpose at all,''
Torkildsen said. ``It incites fear in people, and it is not the
traditional Republican role for the government to intervene in
people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign is funded largely by the Christian Coalition,
whose chairman, Pat Robertson, sought the GOP nomination for
president in 1988, and the Family Research Council, whose leader,
Gary Bauer, is considered a prospective Republican contender for
the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In full-page ads this week in the New York Times, the Washington
Post and USA Today, the coalition promotes the highly disputed
theory that people become homosexuals by choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is not a sex issue, it's a heart issue,'' one ad
stated. ``There are problems for homosexuals even condoms can't
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, which advocates gay and lesbian rights, said numerous
medical and mental health groups have agreed in recent decades that
homosexuality is not a product of personal choice. Birch asserted
the ads were part of an effort by the Christian groups to promote
their agenda in association with GOP congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recently met with Lott and other key Republicans in
the House and Senate to push for the religious right's priorities,
as did James Dobson, who heads the Family Research Council's parent
group, Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're seeing some of the fruits of that alliance,'' Birch
said. ``They are using these very manipulative ads to throw red
meat to the firebrand, extreme-right, grass-roots wing of the
Republican Party. It's nothing more than a crass political move in
an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch said the Human Rights Campaign was buying a full-page ad
in today's editions of USA Today to counter the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Owens, a Christian Coalition spokesman, denied the ad
campaign was aimed at providing support for Lott and other
congressional leaders who have stepped up their criticism of
homosexuality since Robertson and Dobson visited Capitol Hill
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This message is not emanating from the GOP,'' Owens said.
``It's a non-partisan message based on the mainstream concern about
the decline of morality in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said the advertising campaign would continue, although he
declined to provide details. He asserted the impetus for the
campaign was to defeat the push for broader homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subject most Americans, including us, would rather
not have to address, but since it is being advanced by the gay
lobby, somebody needs to respond and provide some leadership,''
Owens said. ``The pro-family movement is doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Washington Post, the ad displayed a photograph of a
large group of people who claim they no longer are homosexuals
because of ``God's healing love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing for the truth that homosexuals can change,''
the ad stated. The ad thanks Lott and former Green Bay Packers star
Reggie White, among others, ``for having the courage to speak the
truth about sexual sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is one
of two openly gay members of Congress, challenged the assertion
that individuals choose their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anybody who told me they decided to be
homosexual or heterosexual,'' he said. ``Virtually every gay man or
women I know was terribly upset when they first figured it out. The
notion that people voluntarily choose this is just nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said studies have shown that people who believe
individuals choose their sexual orientation are more likely to
discriminate against homosexuals. He asserted the ads were aimed at
building opposition to antidiscrimination initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homophobia is losing the cultural war,'' Frank said, ``so they
are doing this to try to pump up their side in the political
arena.''

TALLAS TO FILE FOR ARBITRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the deadline for salary arbitration arrives at
midnight, expect Robbie Tallas to be among those filing. The
25-year-old Bruins goalie hopes to avoid a hearing and would like
to negotiate a contract rather than have it decided before an
arbiter, but he feels the best course of action is to file.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said the Bruins are offering him only a 10 percent raise
to $440,000 _ equal to the qualifying offer they were required to
make in order to retain his rights _ and are offering just a
two-way deal. Tallas would like a one-way contract, meaning he'd
make the same money if he played in Boston or Providence. The
Bruins want him to agree to a $110,000 salary if he plays in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, of all the Bruins' restricted free agents, Tallas
was presumed to be the easiest to sign. It's widely believed that
defenseman Kyle McLaren and center Jason Allison will be the
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can settle it beforehand,'' said Tallas. ``I'd
like to not have to deal with it. But I'm the longest (tenured)
goalie here. I'm coming up on my fifth year and I think it's time
to reward me a little bit. I think Byron (Dafoe) and I have a great
relationship. I really love it here and I want to stay. This is my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said the issue isn't money as much as the one-way
contract. He believes he's proven his worth to the club. He also
figures it's likely that if the Bruins had lost Jim Carey to
expansion or opted to buy him out of the last two years of his
contract, they'd be more willing to give Tallas a bigger raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed at Boston's response to what I feel is a
very reasonable request by Robbie,'' said Tallas's representative,
Jay Fee, referring to his client's desire for a one-way deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas and Fee point to a couple of other backup netminders as
comparable players when assessing their demands. One is Steve
Shields, who was the backup to Dominik Hasek in Buffalo before
being dealt to San Jose. Shields just signed a deal that will pay
him $600,000 this season and $700,000 in 1999-2000. Shields
finished the year with a 3-6-4 record and 2.83 goals-against
average in 785 minutes. Tallas was 6-3-3 with a 1.83 GAA in 788
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The other comparison is with St. Louis's Jamie McLennan, who
signed a deal for $625,000 and $650,000 with the Blues after
playing more than twice as many minutes _ 1,658 _ as Tallas and
finishing with a 16-8-2 record and 2.17 GAA.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Tallas feels the Bruins aren't willing to talk
about upgrading their offer. He's hoping that filing for
arbitration will open the lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``(President-general manager) Harry Sinden said some nice things
about me during the season,'' said Tallas. ``I thank him for that.
I know this organization has been around for a long time. The
process (of arbitration) does scare me a little bit, but hopefully,
it won't go to that. I said when I got here that I wanted to be
part of this organization for a long time. I still do. Whatever
happens, I'll come to training camp and be as focused as I always
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said the Bruins aren't
sure Tallas is worthy of a one-way deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd he play, 14 games last year? I don't know if that
warrants the right to have a one-way contract,'' said O'Connell.
``If it were 50-60 games, maybe. Sometimes we don't like to hear
what they say. Sometimes they don't like to hear what we say. It's
a part of the business that's difficult. We made our offer. I told
(Fee) our position. We really like Robbie Tallas. But we're going
to have Dafoe, John Grahame, Jim Carey, and Tallas in camp. Who are
the two who are going to be left standing? Last year would you have
been able to say that it would've been Dafoe and Tallas?''
</P>
<P>
   Four other Bruins have the option of filing _ Ted Donato, Steve
Heinze, Dmitri Khristich, and Tim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to see Donato opt not to file. Sources say he
is more concerned about his role on the club if he stays and where
he might end up if he goes. A pending arbitration case might throw
a monkey wrench into an already delicate situation.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich seems a slam dunk to file and appears to have the best
case. O'Connell said he hasn't seen any numbers from Taylor. As for
Heinze, O'Connell thinks that situation could come down to more
than money for the forward, who made $650,000 last season and has
scored 43 goals in 91 games over the last two seasons, during which
he missed 73 gamnes with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it will come down to is, are we paying what he thinks is
fair? Does he want to stay here? Is money a huge issue or the most
important issue?'' said O'Connell. ``Stephen grew up here. He lives
here and I think he loves it here. If he's looking for that big
contract, that big score ... To pay the big money, it wouldn't be
fair to everyone else.''

CHRISTIAN RIGHT LAUNCHES AD ATTACK ON HOMOSEXUALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of influential Christian groups has
launched a national ad campaign attacking homosexuality, igniting a
firestorm of protest Tuesday as the religious right gears up for
the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader from
Mississippi who recently likened gays and lesbians to alcoholics
and kleptomaniacs, the $200,000 ad blitz characterizes homosexuals
as sinners in need of Christian healing.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial campaign, widely seen as an effort by the
Christian right to provide indirect support for congressional

WITH DEFAMATION DECIDED, BRAWLEY CASE MOVES TO QUESTION OF
DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-BRAWLEY-REACT) 
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ A day after they were held liable for
defamation in the Tawana Brawley case, the Rev. Al Sharpton and two
other men began battling Tuesday to persuade the jury to award only
minimal damages, clearly hoping to claim a symbolic victory despite
Monday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides in the long-running case, the struggle over the
damages phase of the trial has at least as much symbolic
significance as practical importance, since all three defendants
say they have limited means.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most forceful defense arguments Tuesday, Michael
Hardy, Sharpton's lawyer, suggested to the jurors that their
decision might have been based on their dislike of Sharpton and
pleaded with them to put aside ``personal feelings as to Reverend
Sharpton'' when setting damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's risky tactic of suggesting bias against his client
within the jury focused attention on just how much importance both
sides attach to the question of damages.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones has sought $395 million, an amount that he could say
confirmed the dimensions of the wrong that was committed when
Sharpton and the other two Brawley advisers, Alton Maddox and C.
Vernon Mason, said a decade ago that Pagones had raped and
kidnapped Miss Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could award anything from the full amount Pagones
requested to a nominal amount to zero, a sum that could give the
advisers the ability to assert that their defamations amounted to
harmless rhetoric in the pursuit of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, began the new phase of the
trial Tuesday morning with a terse opening statement urging the
jurors to assess the full compensatory and punitive damages ``to
punish the defendants and also to discourage others from similar
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements, the defendants took various tacks
to reach the same destination: Each made a case for the jury to
award minimal or no damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said that some people see Sharpton as a ``caricature'' who
is loud and has political views with which they disagree. He urged
the jurors not to allow what he called such illicit feelings to
influence a decision on damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead with you to make your decision based on the law and
the evidence, not on personal feelings as to Reverend Sharpton,''
Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's lawyer, Stephen Jackson, suggested to the jurors that an
award of minimal damages could begin to repair the wounds caused by
the case. ``There is an opportunity here to stop the bleeding,'' he
said. ``It's time for healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who has argued the case on his own behalf, urged the
jurors not to be swayed by emotion. He asserted that Pagones had
suffered no financial losses and that any symptoms of anxiety
Pagones associated with the case had appeared before the advisers
had mentioned his name publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Among Pagones' friends and acquaintances, Maddox said, the fact
that the advisers had named Pagones as a participant in an assault
had not injured his reputation. And he said it would be a
miscarriage of justice ``to punish three men who have clearly given
their lives and their careers to help people who could not help
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who spoke first Tuesday, simply told the jurors in a
three-minute statement that Pagones had endured mental stress and
physical suffering as a result of false charges by the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Implying that the case for extensive damages was obvious,
Stanton then entered Pagones' medical records into evidence,
reminded the jury that Pagones had testified for 25 days and rested
the plaintiff's case. The defense is to begin presentation of its
evidence on the damages issue on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hardy appeared the most shaken Tuesday as he addressed the
jurors after they found on Monday that Sharpton had slandered
Pagones seven times, while they found Mason liable for only one
defamatory statement and Maddox liable for only two statements.
Hardy said he had tried to understand what he considered
inconsistent decisions and had wondered whether attitudes about
Sharpton, rather than the evidence in the case, were behind the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope there's not an illicit motive behind that,'' Hardy
said as he stood before the jury box. Such things as the
unpopularity of political views ``or even dislikes, if you will, of
Reverend Sharpton'' should not play a part in any decision, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the six jurors had signed the verdict sheet on
Monday. Because Pagones' case is civil, only five votes were
required on any count. But Hardy suggested Tuesday that
inconsistent findings with respect to the advisers showed some
division on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   If there were deep tensions among the group, they were not
obvious Tuesday. In the courtroom for the brief proceedings, the
jurors appeared calm after the evident exhaustion of their four-day
deliberation. Although the jurors were sequestered over the
weekend, Judge S. Barrett Hickman had permitted them to return to
their homes on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the case said Tuesday that the juror who refused
to sign the verdict sheet is a black woman, one of two black
jurors. The other four jurors are white. It was unclear why the
juror had refused to sign the sheet or whether racial issues played
any part her decision. Just before they delivered their decision on
Monday, a white female juror told the judge that the panel was
divided 3-3 on some counts, which suggested that any division would
not have been along racial lines alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are no longer sequestered, the jurors are not
permitted to speak publicly until they have completed the damages
phase of the case. Lawyers said Tuesday that it was not clear how
long the damages phase would take.

CAMBODIA JOURNAL: WHEN HE WRITES A SONG, PEOPLE BETTER LISTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Pity the pagoda boy, barefoot and hungry,
living on handouts from the monks. But now the pagoda boy is grown
up and important and he sits in a big chair.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in Cambodia knows the song about the temple student
who rose to power and respect. And everybody knows its author _ one
of the country's most prolific songwriters (with a little help from
his aides) _ Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   He is powerful and respected, but still modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sing and I can't play an instrument,'' said Hun Sen,
the modestly titled second prime minister, who seized full power in
a coup a year ago. ``But I can write. So whatever people want to do
with my songs, let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is his aide, Hun Heng, a former singer, who gets that task.
``He likes to write at night and sometimes he stays up all night
writing,'' Hun Heng said in an interview, referring to his boss.
``Then he submits his material to me like a draft. I put it into
the way we do it so the singer can sing the song.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an intense creative process, Hun Sen said. Sometimes the
songwriting urge strikes him on an airplane or a helicopter, and he
scribbles on scraps of paper as he goes about his government work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I compose with tears in my eyes,'' he
said, ``especially when I write about a wife separated from her
husband, or about the pagoda boy or about the virtues of my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   So the strongman has a soft side? Hun Sen bristled at the
question. ``I am not a strongman,'' he declared. ``Other people
call me a strongman. And it is wrong to call me a monster. I am
only a strongman to destroy real monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen heeds the advice that is often given by elementary
writing teachers. ``I only write about what I know,'' he said. He
was indeed one of the poor Cambodian children who got their
education at a pagoda _ brought to the temple by his father, a poor
farmer. And he does now sit in a big chair.
</P>
<P>
   There are love songs in Hun Sen's oeuvre (``The Dark-Skinned
Woman of Krang Yoev'') and many songs that extol the virtues of
rural life. There are songs dedicated to the Hun Sen Development
Centers he has opened around the country, like the one titled, ``In
the Shade of the Palm Trees of Krang Yoev Development Center.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even a song promoting the virtues of peace and human
rights: ``Bravo for the day of culture and peace!'' it goes.
``Respect human rights, respect the value of the other and of
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the songwriter nor his aide (who are not related) writes
the music. Instead, Hun Heng puts his master's words to popular
melodies, which are then recorded onto cassettes and played every
evening on government-controlled radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody buys these songs because we hear them on the radio all
the time,'' a Cambodian journalist said. ``Nearly all the FM
stations belong to Hun Sen's party.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of cassette tapes of Hun Sen's songs at
the Russian Market in downtown Phnom Penh the other day, though it
was not clear from talking with the saleswomen whether that was a
sign of their popularity or of the lack of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the songs, that's why we have them for sale,'' said
one vendor, Sok Huong. She said Hun Sen's songs focus on ordinary
people, in contrast with those of Cambodia's leading statesman,
King Norodom Sihanouk, who not only writes songs but is also famous
for making amateur movies with a romantic treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phnom Penh Is the Capital of Cambodia,'' said a customer,
naming one of the King's best-known songs, and began to sing. The
singing customer knew names but not lyrics of Hun Sen's songs.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no Hun Sen cassettes at a neighboring shop.
``Nobody wants them,'' said the proprietor, You Sokhun Thy. ``We
displayed one once but we took it down when the cover started to
turn yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanted or not, the songs keep coming _ as many as 100 since Hun
Sen began his compositions a decade ago. On a recent campaign swing
to a village called Rolang Ken, he pulled out a much-folded page of
government stationery and read a verse, scribbled in red ink, that
he had composed for the local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh! Rolang Ken, I miss you so much,'' he read. ``I remember
the time of the floods. The farmers were crying over their lost
harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hun Heng, the musical aide, said the songs sometimes have a
subtle political subtext. One of these is ``The Road Crossing the
Field.'' It is an olive branch to his political foes, disguised as
a sad love song, or perhaps as a song about rural development, Hun
Heng said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart aches because I miss you so,'' the song goes. ``I see
you bathing but you turn your back on me. It shocked me, darling,
when you told me you loved me no more. But even so, I still care
enough about you to build a road for you.''

GM SAYS STRIKES LED TO EARNINGS DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn., Okla.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ General Motors Corp. announced Tuesday that its
profits plunged 81 percent in the second quarter, mainly because of
strikes here. The automaker also filed a lawsuit demanding that the
United Auto Workers union allow immediate arbitration of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent retaliation, the UAW on Tuesday night scheduled a
strike vote this Sunday at GM's giant Saturn factory in Spring
Hill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   GM made official its previous estimate that strikes at two parts
factories here had cost it $1.18 billion in lost after-tax profits
during the second quarter. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial
officer, said that while the automaker hoped to recoup some of that
loss through extra production later this year, the actual amount
that could be recovered would depend on how long the labor dispute
lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the strike is over soon, we can make up a lot of that, but
the longer the strike goes on, the harder it is to make it up,''
Losh said in a telephone interview. GM executives are hoping that
customers will wait for its dealerships to be restocked with
popular models after production resumes, instead of shopping at
rival automakers' dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   GM reported that it earned $389 million in the second quarter,
or 52 cents a diluted share, down from $2.10 billion, or $2.67 a
share, in the period a year earlier. The earnings were a penny
short of Wall Street analysts' forecast of 53 cents, according to
First Call Corp., a Boston company that tracks earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   GM's sales fell 15.8 percent, to $33.46 billion from $39.74
billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM's cash reserves dropped to $9.1 billion, from $13.6 billion
at the end of the first quarter, a slightly smaller decline than
Wall Street analysts had anticipated given the labor dispute. Losh
said that GM had made a $1.2 billion pension contribution during
the quarter, had repurchased $1 billion worth of stock and had paid
$2.2 billion in bills from suppliers of parts that mostly have not
yet been assembled into cars.
</P>
<P>
   GM has suspended its stock repurchases and does not need to make
another contribution to its pension plans soon, while the bills
from suppliers have mostly been paid, so the rate of decline in
GM's cash reserves should slow, Losh said. In addition to its cash
reserves, GM has $4 billion recently deposited in trust funds that
can be used to pay employee health costs during the strike if
necessary, Losh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong cash position and we have a strong balance
sheet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM stock rose 75 cents Tuesday, to $69.625. Jack
Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said GM's solid bank
account could allow it to withstand a fairly long strike, although
at the risk of market-share losses.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to put more pressure on the UAW to compromise, GM sued
the union Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   GM contended in its lawsuit that the strikes at two parts
factories here represented an illegal strike over GM's factory
investment decisions. GM's national agreement with the UAW, which
runs through September 1999, only allows strikes over three types
of local grievances: health and safety issues, subcontracting to
outside suppliers and production issues such as the speeding up of
assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   GM said in its complaint that the UAW had filed dozens of local
grievances only after GM notified the union on Feb. 6 of plans to
postpone some investments in a factory here that stamps auto-body
parts from sheets of steel. The number of pending production
grievances soared to 188 from six, the number of subcontracting
grievances doubled to four, and 54 health and safety grievances
were filed when previously there were none, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   GM asked the court to compel the union to participate in
expedited arbitration, and a hearing was scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon. Thomas Gottschalk, GM's general counsel, said that UAW
officials had refused to schedule a meeting with the arbitrator,
Thomas Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The GM lawsuit also asked the court for an injunction ordering
an end to the strike and for cash damages, but Gottschalk said that
expedited arbitration was the company's priority.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
at a news conference that the strikes were legal and that the UAW's
national agreement with GM has a provision barring lawsuits. The
UAW is willing to engage in arbitration but has concluded that
expedited arbitration is not in the interest of its members, he
said. GM is losing $75 million a day because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Of GM's 29 North American assembly plants, the Saturn factory is
one of only three still running. Even if a strike is approved,
workers would not be able to walk out without the national union
leadership's permission.
</P>
<P>
   GM's earnings in the second quarter of last year were also hurt
by strikes, as walkouts at a pickup-truck assembly plant in
Pontiac, Mich., and a midsized car-assembly plant in Oklahoma City
reduced the company's earnings then by $490 million.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the strikes this year and last year, and excluding a
partial spinoff of Hughes Electronics Corp. and various special
items, GM's earnings in the second quarter of this year totaled
$1.6 billion, or $2.40 a share, down from $2.1 billion, or $2.82 a
share, a year earlier, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings dropped after adjustments mainly because GM is
introducing new models, Losh said.

 &HT;    Youth workshop: Students want to protect affirmative action
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ LaRoddric Theodule assumed he was a sure bet to study
architecture at the University of California Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A native of nearby San Jose, he had a 3.4 grade point average,
made a 1250 on the SAT, starred on the track team and worked 40
hours a week at an architectural firm. But because of California's
recently passed anti-affirmative action legislation, Proposition
209, Theodule was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I know about affirmative action? I've done more living it
than studying it,'' said the 18-year-old, who will attend
historically black Florida A&AMP;M University. ``I was more than
qualified to go to Berkeley. The year before, a large number of
blacks were admitted with equal or lower standards than I had.''
Proposition 209 was a 1996 ballot initiative that prohibited most
racial and gender preferences in public education and other
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Theodule's story struck a chord among the 500 or so young people
gathered Tuesday afternoon for the NAACP's youth and college
division's workshop on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   While the theme of the workshop, ``A Handout or Handup,'' was
only mentioned in passing, the tone was quickly set that
affirmative action had to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Erayne Gee, a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, noted
the impact when affirmative action is not present. Gee said only
about 1,000 of the 50,000 students at the University of Texas at
Austin are black. In Texas, the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled that using race as a criterion for college admission was
illegal and that the need for college diversity is not a sufficient
reason for race-based admissions. The court decision ``not only
affected admissions, but our support services as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrice Stinson, who read the students a chilling e-mail she
received after her first semester at Mercer University School of
Law that denounced affirmative action and predicted that the whole
country would soon follow Texas and California's lead, said
students should use the convention as a springboard to learn as
much about affirmative action and its effects as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know how to talk about it, how to discuss it and
what language we are going to allow others to use when talking
about us,'' said Stinson, who is entering her second year at
Mercer. ``Know what it is and how to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Hutchinson, 19, who wants black organizations to work
with other minority groups to form a stronger collective body to
fight the backlash against affirmative action, fears that black
college and high school students still don't see the significance
of affirmative action, which was described by some as the ``civil
rights of our era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to know that this will affect their futures,'' said
Hutchinson, a sophomore at the University of Oregon. ``Maybe not
now or in the next couple of years, but students need to start
thinking about this now before it is too late.''

VISITING SOUTH AFRICA, RUBIN SIDES WITH THE FREE-MARKETERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Stepping into a sharp South African
debate without acknowledging it, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin repeatedly endorsed South African economic policies Tuesday
even as these policies faced attack by the government's closest
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who is on a five-nation Africa trip, said in Soweto that
the country's economic policies were ``strong and stable'' and that
the government's controversial Growth, Employment and
Redistribution Policy ``sets forth a medium-term plan to keep them
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides South Africa, Rubin is visiting the Ivory Coast,
Namibia, Mozambique and Kenya to encourage policies that Washington
and international lending agencies endorse: austere budgets, open
markets, vigorous business competition and the sale of state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   He also called here for expanding loans to small businesses,
more education for the poor and greater flexibility from labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   He deflected questions about the value of the South African
currency, the rand, which has fallen sharply, other than to repeat
that good economic and fiscal policies made for resilient
currencies. The rand rose 2.6 percent Tuesday to a rate of 5.985 to
the dollar. But it remains 19 percent below its value at the end of
1997, when it took 4.86 rand to buy a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rubin did not mention the political criticism faced by
the ruling African National Congress, he made it clear that the
United States supported the government's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   In an evening session with reporters, Rubin said he had ``no
ulterior motive'' in praising these policies and was not conveying
an American position on next year's South African national
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC's two closest political allies, the South African
Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, an
umbrella organization of mostly black labor unions, strongly oppose
government economic policies, which favor cutting public payrolls,
keeping government debt low, accepting high interest rates to
control inflation and selling the airlines, railroads, ports, phone
and electric utilities, diamond mines and dozens of other companies
owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The government's opponents also oppose its request for ``labor
flexibility,'' considered a euphemism for union agreement to end
wildcat strikes and accept changes such as around-the-clock mining
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies represent a sharp reversal for the ANC _ which,
until it came to power in 1994, took a socialist approach that
favored nationalization of the gold mines and full employment
through state projects.
</P>
<P>
   The unions and the Communists, who hold many seats in Parliament
in return for years of loyal support of the ANC, have criticized
these current policies because the economy grew less than 2 percent
last year, with a net loss by some estimates of 130,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, President Nelson Mandela and his heir apparent,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, warned the unions and the Communists
that these policies would be ANC positions for the 1999 election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Rubin pressed here for stimulating the economy through
``micro-enterprise lending'' _ loans of as little as $50 given to
the poor to start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To push the point, he visited a Soweto day care center run by
Francina Mbense, who has stocked it with books, toys and furniture
bought with a 15,000 rand loan _ about $2,500 _ which she received
under a program financed by the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Although she pays 23.25 percent interest, Mrs. Mbense said she
was grateful because South African banks would not make loans of
less than 50,000 rand and Soweto loan sharks charged as much as 50
percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   At an hourlong discussion afterward with South African bankers
and small-business executives, Rubin heard bankers explain why they
did not make loans in impoverished areas. The cost of administering
the loans was too great, they said; they cannot offer the business
advice small borrowers need, and they are criticized when they
build cut-rate branch offices because they build fancy ones in
white suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin suggested that they look at American business models such
as pooling their money to be lent, and he noted that American
bankers had been pushed through legislation into making small loans
to customers in rundown areas. &QL;

AT LEAST 2 DIE IN TENNESSEE FLOODS CAUSED BY RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Nine inches of rain in four hours caused Shoal
Creek to pour out over its banks late Monday night, flooding
Lawrence County and killing at least two people.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were missing Tuesday, and at least 30 were treated
at hospitals for minor injuries. Bridges, cars and houses were
washed away in and around Lawrenceburg, the county seat, about 70
miles south of Nashville near the Alabama border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water came up extremely fast, within minutes, and it is
not common in that area, so there was not much warning,'' said
Randy Harris of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrenceburg's 10,500 residents were without drinking water
Tuesday because water and sewage treatment plants were disabled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Yurgel of the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency
said the two flood victims were W.O. Watters, 74, and Martha
Maddox, 60. Watters' body was found Tuesday in his truck under a
bridge over U.S. 64. Ms. Maddox's car was also washed off U.S. 64
west of town. Yurgel said her body was recovered on Shoal Creek
about 100 yards from the entrance to David Crockett State Park.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people were forced to evacuate late Monday, but the
creek quickly receded Tuesday and residents returned to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews continued searching for dead or injured Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a flash flood watch would remain in effect at
least until Wednesday morning for Lawrence and surrounding
counties. &QL;

UTILITY DEREGULATION REPEAL VOTE CLEARS LEGAL HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A repeal of Massachusetts' new electric deregulation
law is one major step closer to appearing on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court has tossed out a legal challenge to
signatures that had been collected to launch the November ballot
question.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday clears all but one final hurdle for getting
the ballot question before voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-paragraph decision, the court upheld an April decision
by the state Ballot Law Commission, which gave the green light to
the repeal question after reviewing the signatures in a petition
drive required for a referendum question.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether there were sufficient signatures collected
from Barnstable and Berkshire counties.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the trade group for
large businesses including Boston Edison and other utilities, had
challenged the validity of the signatures.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 66,000 signatures were collected.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, repeal advocates were celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory,'' said John T. O'Connor, chairman of
the Campaign for Fair Electric Rates, the group that is leading the
repeal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the electric light companies will respect the
voters' wishes as well as the Massachusetts Supreme Court's
reaffirmation to allow a vote for lower electric rates and cleaner
air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's a loss and we knew a signature challenge is
difficult, but we'll move forward,'' said Robert R. Ruddock, AIM's
general counsel and executive vice president of energy and
environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AIM's remaining legal challenge is whether the proposed
ballot question is constitutional. The state's deregulation statute
includes a provision for state-run renewable energy programs that
would be funded by money collected in ratepayers' monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
   Those funds _ a small percentage of the total electric bill _
are considered ``appropriations'' and under the Massachusetts
Constitution cannot be put before the voters in a ballot question,
AIM contends.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is still pending in the SJC, said Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who is also running for Congress in the 8th
Congressional District, calls AIM's last challenge ``legal
harassment,'' adding it is a desperate measure to deny his group's
right to put the repeal before the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The state's utilities _ through AIM _ are expected to spend
millions of dollars to fight the repeal. AIM has retained a Los
Angeles firm that specializes in defeating voter referendums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never outspend them, so we must build a coalition of
small business and consumer groups to work with us,'' said
O'Connor.

CORPORATIONS STILL GIVE, BUT ALSO GET  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While corporations continue to lend major support to
colleges and universities, their giving is rarely so purely
philanthropic as in the past, the leading organization of education
fund-raisers was told at its annual meeting over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than simply hand over a check and say goodbye, today's
corporate sponsors want to see their money used in ways in line
with their business objectives,'' said Suzanne Cornforth of
Paschall &AMP; Associates, public relations consultants in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cornforth, who spoke in Chicago on Sunday at the annual
gathering of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education,
an organization of academic fund-raisers, alumni association
administrators and others, said corporate giving to all
beneficiaries leaped to $4.25 billion in 1994 from $850 million in
1985. But increasingly, she said, strings are attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young generation of corporate sponsors,'' Ms.
Cornforth said, ``and they have discovered the advantages of
building long-term relationships with educational institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those long-term relationships _ or ``partnerships,'' as they are
known _ manifest themselves in a variety of ways. A corporation may
donate a laboratory and then train students and faculty in the use
of its own technological equipment, a step virtually sure to have
long-term sales benefits. Or companies may use scholarships and
grants to focus research in ways useful chiefly to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may award fellowships to promising graduate students, or
endow faculty chairs or deanships that carry the corporate name:
when Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chief economic adviser to
President Clinton, was chosen two months ago to head the Haas
School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, the
title she assumed was BankAmerica Dean, following a $2-million
BankAmerica donation to the business school.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate consulting fees to faculty are another common
partnership feature, and critics worry that big businesses can
threaten academic independence and steer the human and physical
resources of a university in directions beneficial mainly to
themselves. Even a believer in corporate partnerships, Manny
Cunard, executive director of the National Association of College
Auxiliary Services, acknowledges, ``When you have colleges taking
money from corporations, there's always the potential risk that the
colleges will become obligated to a particular company.''
</P>
<P>
   Partnerships are a relatively recent trend that experts trace to
1992, when the Pepsi-Cola Co. and the Pennsylvania State University
system struck a deal in which Pepsi agreed to pay the system about
$14 million over 10 years for exclusive rights to sell its products
on 21 university campuses. Today nearly 100 institutions have
similar deals, according to a survey by Lee White, a Denver
investment banker who specializes in higher education finance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corporate heavyweights that have entered or are
exploring partnerships are Fujitsu Ltd., GTE Services, Nike Inc.,
Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., the Rite Aid Corp., the Sun Co., Pfizer Inc.,
Merck &AMP; Co., the Pepsi-Cola Co. and the Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, California State University at Fresno announced that
Pepsi-Cola and Save Mart Supermarkets had jointly offered to
contribute $40 million over 20 years or so toward the $105 million
needed to build a multipurpose campus event center. If the trustees
approve, the new building will be named the Save Mart Center, and
the food chain will be granted the exclusive right to serve as the
off-campus ticket outlet for all Fresno State events. As for
Pepsi-Cola, a unit of Pepsico Inc., it would be given the exclusive
right to sell nonalcoholic beverages and certain snack foods on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Still other corporate sponsors provide scholarships and support
academic work increasingly tied to their research and development
needs. This spring the trustees of the University of Connecticut
approved a deal in which Pfizer will build a $19-million research
laboratory on the university's campus in Storrs. The university
will occupy 20 percent of the space, and Pfizer 80 percent.
Officials said they expected that the venture would help Pfizer
develop animal vaccines and enhance the university's ability to
attract highly qualified faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pfizer is not alone among pharmaceutical companies in
reaching out to colleges and universities. Last year, for example,
Merck announced an agreement under which it will pay the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology $15 million over five years
to collaborate in the development of innovative technology. Merck
will be given patents and licensing rights to developments
resulting from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not all such arrangements work out smoothly. One of them, which
only recently collapsed after months of negotiation, concerned a
partnership called the California Educational Technology
Initiative, in which two or more companies, including Fujitsu and
GTE Services, were to build a $300 million high-technology network
linking the 23 campuses in the California State University system.
In exchange, the corporations were to have the use of the linkage
to market their products to university students, faculty and
alumni.
</P>
<P>
   While critics voice concerns about corporate influence and its
potential to threaten academic independence, corporations and
university development officers defend their ties, arguing that
universities have become more sophisticated in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``A generation ago, some people thought it was unseemly for
universities to go out and ask people to give money,'' said Charles
Agnew, vice chancellor for development at the Penn State system of
higher education. ``Now it's routine. And some of those we
routinely ask _ sometimes in exchange for a franchise _ are
corporations.''

NEW TEAM TAKING SHAPE AT SUNBEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DANA CANEDY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month after Sunbeam Corp. dismissed Al Dunlap as chairman and
chief executive and replaced him with another turnaround expert,
the new chief has appointed his own team to run the troubled
appliance maker, according to an internal memorandum to employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, distributed Tuesday, Jerry Levin, the new chief
executive, announced a management team that replaces crucial
appointees of Dunlap with executives who helped turn around Coleman
Co., the outdoor equipment manufacturer that Sunbeam acquired in
March. Levin had been chief executive of Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Griffith has resigned as president of the household products
group, and Levin will take on his duties until a replacement is
found, the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shapiro, a former vice president and general counsel at
Coleman, will become executive vice president and chief
administrative officer at Sunbeam, stepping into a post Dunlap had
been looking to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team brings together a few key Sunbeam veterans and
recent recruits with a number of proven executives, many of whom I
have previously worked with at Coleman,'' Levin said in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Other important executive changes include the appointment of
Bobby Jenkins as executive vice president and chief financial
officer, a position he once held at Coleman. He replaces Russell
Kersh, who was Dunlap's most trusted lieutenant and who was
dismissed within days of the former chairman's ouster last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, while it is a new team, it's already a really
cohesive team,'' an executive close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also sought to reassure employees about Sunbeam's
future, saying that the new management was committed to helping the
maker of Sunbeam and Oster brand blenders and electric blankets
return to profitability. The memo also told employees that Sunbeam
had reached agreements with its bankers to give management time to
address the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sunbeam declined to comment on the memo. &QL;

MORE ENGLISH INSTRUCTION SOUGHT FOR BILINGUAL PUPILS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With new graduation standards requiring all high
school students to pass a rigorous English examination, state
education officials are now proposing longer, more intensive
English classes for students with limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, released on Tuesday by the state's education
commissioner, Richard Mills, would require those students, from
kindergarten through high school, to spend two or three of their
eight school periods in English. Currently, the 225,000 students in
the state with limited English skills are required to spend only
one 35-minute period a day learning the language. Many spend the
rest of their school day in classes taught in their native
language.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which requires the approval of the seven-man state
Board of Regents, is intended to address two problems: helping
bilingual students meet the higher graduation standards and
improving the way bilingual education is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want youngsters who don't yet speak English to speak
English,'' Mills said on Tuesday in an interview. ``I want them to
pass the exams. I want them to have every opportunity that every
other child has.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual programs are one of the most contentious matters of
educational policy, and they have come under renewed focus in
recent months because of California's overwhelming public vote to
end such classes and immerse students in a year of intensive
English.
</P>
<P>
   But where critics of California's bilingual programs cited study
after study attacking bilingual education as trapping students in a
language nether world where they master neither English nor their
other subjects, Mills, in his proposal, cited evidence showing how
students' mastery of their native language actually helps them
learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mills' proposal, students would have to take additional
hours of English, so they could be integrated into mainstream
English classes within three years. In New York City, home to a
majority of the state's students with limited English, that does
not always happen: Currently, a third of the city's bilingual
students, particularly older ones, take longer than three years.
Students with limited English also take longer to graduate than
their peers, and a greater share of them drop out of high school.
The Education Department did not estimate how much the proposal
might cost or how many extra teachers would need to be hired.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual education advocates Tuesday expressed cautious support
for the proposal, saying that they applauded the goal of teaching
English more thoroughly but worried that students would get short
shrift in other academic subjects.

LOS ANGELES TIMES HAS NATIONAL PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times plans to introduce a national edition
later this year or early in 1999, according to top newsroom
executives.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the four-section paper has a main section of
national, international and regional news, with other sections
devoted to business, sports and features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a couple of `let's see how this works'
steps,'' said Michael Parks, the editor of The Los Angeles Times,
which is a unit of Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   The edition's East Coast circulation will be concentrated in
Washington and New York, while its West Coast circulation will aim
at San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper currently prints an edition that has circulation
of more than 3,500 copies in Washington and the East Coast, but
that paper is an abbreviated 12-page edition.
</P>
<P>
   James Helin, the president of the California edition who is the
executive in charge of the project, said that he envisioned an
eventual press run ``in the mid-five-figure'' range.
</P>
<P>
   The weekday circulation of The Los Angeles Times is slightly
less than 1.1 million; Sunday circulation is 1,362,000. &QL;

THE BEASTIE BOYS: KEEN-EARED SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 19.) 
(th) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a term in hip-hop, flavor. It is a good thing. Rappers
want to have flavor: panache, style, something extra that enables
them to stand out from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In their 17 years together, however, the Beastie Boys have
developed something much better than flavor: taste. This is not a
hip-hop term. It is the key to survival in the mercurial world of
pop.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians like David Bowie, Peter Gabriel and David Byrne have
good taste; as most of their colleagues have fossilized, it has
enabled them to remain relevant, even after their hit-making days
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys are listeners as much as they are musicians, so
any music they make is going to be interesting. This has enabled
them to survive commercially while every rap act from their era has
fallen by the wayside (with the exception of L.L. Cool J, whose
grip on the mainstream has become tenuous as his taste has devolved
into mimicry).
</P>
<P>
   That is, if one could still consider the Beastie Boys rap,
because they've blown what little currency they did have in the
hip-hop world by following their broader instincts instead of the
orthodoxy of the rap mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The band's previous two albums were a collection of hard-core
punk songs and an album of lighter instrumental music; its new
record jams 22 tracks with eight singers into 68 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the output of a group that sets out to make the
perfect pop record like ``Pet Sounds,'' ``Sgt. Pepper'' or even
``It Takes a Nation of Millions'' (the rap classic by Public
Enemy). This is the work of a band that aims to show how much it
can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Nasty'' jumps from rap to easy listening to Latin to
noise to soul to opera to rock without pausing for breath. As the
band boasts in ``Intergalactic,'' ``I'm so versatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys are emblematic of a new breed of artists who
have emerged over the past decade, the collector-musicians. Where
postmodern musicians slap different styles together noncommittally,
as if they were all equivalent colors in the sonic palette,
collector-musicians weld different sounds together with commitment
and bias.
</P>
<P>
   Their songs are more tributes than statements. For example, the
eccentric dub-reggae pioneer Lee ``Scratch'' Perry appears on
``Hello Nasty,'' not to make the album better, more commercial or
more musical, but simply because the band likes him and wants to
collect his voice like an audio autograph. It's not that
collector-musicians (they also include Beck, the Dust Brothers,
Stereolab and Cornelius) are fans more than artists. It's that
being a fan is part of their art.
</P>
<P>
   From their first full hip-hop album, ``Licensed to Ill'' in
1986, the Beastie Boys set themselves up as observers and emulators
of rap culture, privileged white boys looking in from the outside,
as they did as teen-agers in the years leading up to the record,
running around Manhattan clubs where punk, new wave and rap were
mingling.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Beastie Boys have transformed themselves from a
band to an enterprise. Like Gabriel's Real World label or Byrne's
Luaka Bop, the Beastie Boys developed Grand Royal, a record label
and a magazine (plus a clothing company called X-Large) predicated
on the notion that the Beastie Boys have good taste, that they know
what is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Another key to their survival is their ability to spot talented
musicians and use them on their albums, whether it's the Dust
Brothers' producing ``Paul's Boutique'' nine years ago or the
contributions from the turntablist Mixmaster Mike and the
keyboardist Money Mark on ``Hello Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   As music buffs, the Beastie Boys are also able to listen to
current rap and rock and siphon off the elements that make them
interesting, as evident in the snatches of violin and sped-up
female voices on the new album, both tricks borrowed from the
Wu-Tang producer known as RZA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Nasty'' sounds like a night with disk jockey who has a
short attention span: samples of everything from Stravinsky to Tito
Puente to earlier Beasties albums abound. Hip-hop beats are mixed
into Latin music. Songs skid to a halt as the sound of a needle
scratching across a record interrupts. And all kinds of turntable
tricks _ sirens, horns, electronic gurgles and sound effects _ are
mixed on top of the busy songs, as the band raps lines like,
``Remote control, change the station.''
</P>
<P>
   On the album, some of the stations are playing seething,
energetic music, and some are playing directionless throwaways. It
is the curse of the collector-musician: knowing too much and
wanting to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   The most often cited dilemma for the Beastie Boys is that their
most popular music has been their goofiest _ tongue-in-cheek frat
anthems like ``Fight for Your Right (to Party!)'' and ``Girls.''
They may be too smart to fail these days, but they are also too
smart to be a phenomenon again.
</P>
<P>
   Though some place the Beastie Boys in the genre of alternative
rock, they behave more like a classic-rock band, especially since
the personalities of the three members have been diverging.
</P>
<P>
   Though they tend to rap in unison, it's easy to pick out the
three intertwined aesthetics at work. Lines like ``Share your love
with a friend'' come from the member who has discovered
spirituality, the aspiring Tibetan Buddhist Adam Yauch.
</P>
<P>
   Phrases like ``money makin''' come from the member making the
shift into the executive world, Mike Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   And the phrase ``Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable''
probably come from the band's secret weapon, the clown and
collector Adam Horovitz. Silly-smart lines like the Run-D.M.C.
parody ``I'm the king of Boggle, there is none higher/I get 11
points off the word quagmire,'' best fuse all their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hello Nasty,'' there is probably something for everyone,
but there is probably no one whom everything is for. Popular music
is moving past the time when combining two genres is going to
create something new. It is more the exposition of a distinct
personal taste that is going to result in a new sound.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, something unusual is less likely to arise from a
combination of hip-hop and Celtic music (that's flavor) then it is
from someone mixing the sound of the Wu-Tang Clan and the
Chieftains, along with a few other favorites from a treasured
record collection, like, say, Celia Cruz, Willie Nelson and a
cocktail-music compilation on Rhino records (this is taste).
</P>
<P>
   Flavor fades, but taste is a lifetime trait. And ``Hello Nasty''
is a testament to good taste, even if it at times it does lack
flavor. &QL;

ADVERTISING: BURNETT ACQUISITION BRINGS THAT T-WORD CACHET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass., Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another ambitious effort to improve its
competitive position on Madison Avenue, Leo Burnett Co. said
Tuesday that it would join rival agencies in the rapidly growing
field of business-to-business technology marketing by acquiring TFA
Communications LLC, a leading shop in that realm.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal between the two privately held
companies, both based in Chicago, were not disclosed. The agreement
calls for TFA to become a separate business unit of Burnett under
the name TFA/Leo Burnett Technology _ giving Burnett, which has
long been perceived as a stodgy, traditional agency, the cachet of
the T-word amid a frenzy for anything redolent of bits and bytes.
</P>
<P>
   TFA had billings last year of $68 million, which ranked it fifth
on a list of agencies in its category compiled by the trade
publication Marketing Computers. Billings are estimated to reach
$88 million this year and $123 million in 1999. TFA competes
against agencies like Anderson &AMP; Lembke, part of Interpublic Group
of Cos., and CKS Partners, a unit of CKS Group.
</P>
<P>
   TFA has more than 30 high-technology clients, including Avid
Technology, Motorola, News Edge, Open Market, Pervasive Software
and _ because no such list is complete without a company starting
with an ``X'' or a ``Z'' _ Zygo. By comparison, Burnett has only
one high-technology client, Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was negotiated in a quick six weeks, is the most
recent in a burst of acquisitions by Burnett, which once prided
itself on expanding its service offerings slowly and through
internal growth.
</P>
<P>
   But that approach was jettisoned last year after Burnett, the
world's 13th-largest agency company, with billings of $6 billion,
became bedeviled by lost accounts, turmoil in the executive suite
and a palpable belief that it was lagging behind its big rivals in
revamping to reflect the industry's radical transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a vision for what we are trying to do,'' said Linda
Wolf, group president of the Leo Burnett North America unit, who
came to New York to discuss the deal with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to diversify, to get into high-growth areas such as
technology,'' she added, ``but we don't want to make acquisitions
only for their earnings stream. We want to make them because
they're right, for the clients and for the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aggressive expansion efforts by Burnett include Internet
marketing, with a majority stake in an agency named Giant Step;
health care advertising, with a minority stake in Williams-Labadie
Advertising; urban marketing, with the formation of a shop called
Vigilante, and the acquisition of a 49 percent interest in Bartle
Bogle Hegarty, one of the world's hottest creative agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Leo Burnett U.S.A. has been decentralized into seven
business units, and the Burnett media-services operations have been
spun off into a division named Starcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought in a million years I'd be sitting here'' being
``acquired by Burnett,'' said Sean Bisceglia, chief executive at
TFA, who joined Ms. Wolf for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglia, 32, opened TFA in 1991 after working for agencies
like Grey Advertising and what is now Lois/U.S.A. TFA began, he
said, ``with a $7,000 loan from my father, three employees and two
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year and a half, we decided to focus on technology,'' he
added, ``because of studies by Gartner Group and others saying this
would be an exploding area.'' Bisceglia becomes chief executive at
TFA/Leo Burnett Technology and an executive vice president at
Burnett U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   TFA/Leo Burnett Technology will continue specializing in
advertising, direct marketing, public relations and Internet
marketing for business-to-business clients rather than consumers.
But the deal will help the agency respond to important changes
among such marketers, many of which are refocusing their efforts to
reach consumers too, running commercials during the Super Bowl in
addition to peddling their wares at computer conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of technology companies are very product- and
engineering-centric,'' Bisceglia said, ``but as competition
increases, the need to become more sophisticated, to brand, gets
very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   So as the needs of clients evolve, the affiliation with Burnett
will give the 83 employees of TFA/Leo Burnett Technology the
ability to tap the consumer expertise of an agency that handles
accounts for the likes of Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, Philip Morris and
Procter &AMP; Gamble. It also offers access to Burnett's media and
research services as well as its international offices.
</P>
<P>
   All that could also help TFA/Leo Burnett Technology land clients
in the areas of what Bisceglia described as ``consumer technology,
retail technology _ the Compaqs and the Dells.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked if Burnett's problems had made him leery of talking with
Ms. Wolf and other top Burnett executives about a deal, Bisceglia
replied: ``Burnett's not going anywhere. Burnett is not
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he added: ``We had many frank conversations in which I
asked, `Do you understand what you're getting, because we're a
little bit different?' But Burnett embraced our entrepreneurial
spirit, what we're all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglia contrasted that with the attitudes of managers of two
publicly traded agency companies in Chicago and New York _ which he
declined to identify _ who he said were also interested in TFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``With them, it was a trophy issue,'' he said. ``They wanted
some earnings to get their stocks up a point or two because they'd
just got 200,000 shares.''
</P>
<P>
   The TFA employees in Chicago will move into the Burnett
headquarters office. As TFA's other offices, in Boston and Dallas,
are renamed, they will give Burnett its first representation in
those cities. TFA/Leo Burnett Technology also plans to open an
office in San Francisco, another new town for Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   A public relations agency in which TFA has a minority interest,
Corporate Technology Communications in Chicago, becomes
minority-owned by Burnett; Paul Rand continues as its president and
chief executive.

COMMENTARY: SUMMER OF DISCONTENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The summer of '98 will be remembered for several
things. Demi and Bruce splitting. Tina and Harvey merging. Camilla
and William colliding.
</P>
<P>
   But most strikingly, this will be remembered as the summer the
news media decided to forget about news and focus on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The guild is in the midst of a weird collective meltdown.
Journalists have always been self-regarding. But now we're
positively solipsistic, with no time or interest in covering
anything outside our own travails.
</P>
<P>
   Content ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   We are obsessed with our mistakes. Our top editors' comings and
goings. Our piques. Our fantasies. Our desires. Our
disappointments. Our severance packages. Our synergy. Our e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The journalistic club, once self-protective, has turned as
savage as ``Lord of the Flies.'' Nothing is private anymore. Bitter
feuds and emotional rants are flying through cyberspace and landing
on newsprint.
</P>
<P>
   Fired journalists seem as preoccupied with their Legacies as
Bill Clinton. First James Fallows gave his self-exculpatory
Farewell Address. Then April Oliver mounted an aggressive defense
of her role reporting the CNN nerve gas fiasco, long after she
should have disappeared in a cloud of shame gas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lull in Monica scoops has descended because the
journalistic sleuths who dug up the sex scandal have been so busy
debunking Steven Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Where reporters once pored over declassified documents, this
week they are poring over the e-mail sent out by Michael Kinsley,
the editor of Slate, telling colleagues and friends and the rest of
the galaxy about his ill-fated encounter with Si Newhouse. Newhouse
offered Kinsley the job as editor of The New Yorker on Sunday, then
snatched it back a few hours later and gave it to David Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with the rumble between the president and the prosecutor,
journalists became mesmerized with the rumble between the eccentric
billionaire and the cyberspace editor.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., Kinsley sent out
a message to his staffers at Slate, elaborating on his low opinion
of Newhouse's manners: ``I feel I had a narrow escape from finding
myself working for a jerk (something that is, of course, impossible
at Microsoft).''
</P>
<P>
   Slate itself served as an echo chamber, with the married writers
Timothy Noah and Marjorie Williams trading notes on the
Newhouse-Kinsley imbroglio in online pillow talk, in a feature
called ``The Breakfast Table.'' Enhancing the hall-of-mirrors
effect, Noah is a Fallows acolyte who went through his own
publisher-editor donnybrook at U.S. News &AMP; World Report. Ms.
Williams works for Vanity Fair, another Conde Nast publication
owned by Newhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Else Matters Except The New Yorker,'' Noah entitled
one of his entries. Ms. Williams observes that the ascension of
Remnick is even Topic A at her Washington mothers' group.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists weren't deconstructing Kinsley's e-mails, they
were e-mailing each other Nina Burleigh's e-mail. In a message to
her former colleagues and in a piece in The New York Observer to be
published Wednesday, Ms. Burleigh, the former Time White House
reporter who offered some erotic meanderings about President
Clinton in Mirabella, defends herself zestfully.
</P>
<P>
   In her Observer piece, she recounts the moment when she gave
Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post a provocative quote about how
she would be willing to perform a certain kind of sex on President
Clinton in gratitude for his defense of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized Howard's visceral response to my words by his
sudden intake of breath and the spurt of pounding fingers on
keyboard,'' she writes. ``I'd never been on that side of a good
quote before. It was better than sex!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burleigh opines: ``In the event that we ever get a female
President, Pete Hamill or Norman Mailer would never be so savaged
and maligned and ridiculed for writing about the woman's charms.''
In a rousing call to other female scribes who had reacted in horror
to her embarrassing true confessions, she says, in her e-mail,
``Wake up oh my sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh my sisters, oh my brothers. Get a life.

HIGH-END HOUSES JOIN IN REBOUND OF MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Crickets chirp along rustic Topeka Drive, hidden
among the luxury homes and manicured lawns that gave rise to the
area's nickname: Millionaires Row.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, it would have taken six months or longer for
these south-of-the-Boulevard homes to sell; the high-end market was
as soft as a flower bed. But recently, several homes in the
neighborhood above Ventura Boulevard have sold quickly, including
one in one day.
</P>
<P>
   It is under these circumstances that Harry and Elaine
Castellucci decided to put their 4,000-square-foot house on the
market for $895,000. Once the children left home, the empty-nesters
played with the idea of moving out. But it had to be the right time
and for the right price. The house holds many memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't such a great opportunity to sell, we wouldn't
leave,'' said Elaine Castellucci. ``It's very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   All across L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the tables are turning
for home buyers and home sellers. Once a buyer's market, the
housing rebound is tipping the scale toward sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the optimum time for sellers to put their homes on the
market,'' said Pat Zicarelli, president of Style Realty Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And while that's been the case for entry-level homes for at
least a few months, what makes this summer different than the
spring is the increased activity -- and prices -- in the high-end
market.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 98 Valley-area homes sold for $500,000 or higher, 44
percent higher than a year ago, according to the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   But high-price homes aren't the only news in this summer's hot
market. More homes are selling at or close to the asking price with
the average price reduction on a sale at 5.8 percent for June, the
trade group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers have to realize that prices are going up,'' said Bud
Margolin of Fred Sands Northridge. ``The sooner they make an offer,
the better off they will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Margolin added, that doesn't mean sellers can price their
homes at 1989 levels. While market prices have risen 10 percent
from the low, they're still 25 percent below the levels of the late
'80s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't shake Michael Shaman's optimism. He is selling
his Van Nuys house for $206,000. The house with three bedrooms, one
and three-quarter bath, and a spa has gotten interest from a dozen
people after an open house Sunday. The home has been listed for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't sell it today, maybe I'll raise the price,'' he
joked, adding confidently, ``We'll sell it. ... I feel the market
has come up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Zicarelli's clients, a home seller in Santa Monica, also
raised the asking price after hearing about the market upturn --
from $750,000 to $895,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Castelluccis, selling their home of the last 15 years is
more than a financial decision. After all, they've made many
additions to the four-bedroom, five-bath house to make it cozy: a
fireplace, a jacuzzi and a lagoon pool with mini-waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Family mementos are scattered throughout the slanted ceiling
rooms with hardwood floors, giving the house a comfortable feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking to sell quickly,'' said Harry Castellucci,
looking around his home. ``We like it here.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once a merchant, now semiretired, Joey Coleman has
worked or lived around Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, for 35 years,
a witness to what has changed and what has not. So as he spent
Tuesday sitting with friends along Fulton Street, Coleman tried to
explain a frustration felt and endured more often than seen.
</P>
<P>
   No, Coleman said, he wasn't surprised that a jury in Dutchess
County _ a predominantly white jury, he pointed out _ had found the
Rev. Al Sharpton and two others liable for defamation in the
10-year-old case of Tawana Brawley. He expected little else from a
white jury, regardless of the particulars of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that people have begun to expect,'' said
Coleman, 53, who is black. ``They always expect the negative.''
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is Sharpton and Miss Brawley, it is almost a
reflex to return to Bedford-Stuyvesant to measure opinion like
ingredients in a recipe: How much anger, frustration or bitterness
remains? Ten years ago, Bedford-Stuyvesant, then Sharpton's
political base, became the center of protest after Miss Brawley,
then 15, accused a group of white men, including Steven Pagones, of
raping her.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a day after the defamation ruling against Sharpton and
two others in a civil lawsuit brought by Pagones, there were no
protests or marches in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The only fury along
commercial Fulton Street was the amplified voice of a preacher
leading a sparsely attended tent revival.
</P>
<P>
   But if time has doused the sense of rage, random interviews with
more than 20 black residents underscored the lingering sense of
alienation and frustration unleashed by the Brawley case. Ten years
later, there is not the same palpable anger, but neither is there
any sense of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has just been so much injustice done that sometimes
blacks may overplay things,'' said Coleman. ``It's hard for a black
man now to believe all of a sudden that everything is on the
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Bedford-Stuyvesant, the defamation ruling was the talk of
many radio programs tailored to black audiences. Speaking on
WLIB-AM, Sharpton called the decision ``inconsistent and
political'' and warned that it would ``have a chilling effect on
activism and advocacy around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's host, Minister Conrad Muhammed, said, ``In our
community, it's shoot, lock you up, ask questions later.''
</P>
<P>
   The tortured storyline of the Brawley case is now familiar to
most New Yorkers: the sharp accusations against Pagones by Sharpton
and Miss Brawley's other advisers; the subsequent grand jury report
that exonerated Pagones and concluded that Miss Brawley had
fabricated her story; and, most recently, Monday's ruling against
Sharpton and the two other advisers, C. Vernon Mason and Alton
Maddox. The jury began hearing testimony in the damages phase of
the trial Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Bethany Baptist Church on Marcus Garvey Boulevard
that Miss Brawley's mother spent more than a month in
``sanctuary,'' avoiding arrest for refusing to testify before a
special grand jury investigating the case 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a few blocks away at the McCafe restaurant on
MacDonough Street, the Rev. F.D. Waddell predicted that the
decision _ and the news media attention from the trial _ would only
help Sharpton by providing him with more exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will enhance his political situation,'' Waddell said.
``What he does, and what I like about him, is he doesn't allow
something to be swept under the rug or forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the restaurant, Clara Walker, said she had known
Sharpton since he was a teen-ager. ``He tried to help but he might
have jumped the gun without getting all the facts. I know he
wouldn't put something together just to have something going. He
wouldn't do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grand jury report, Miss Walker, 63, like many other
black residents, said she believed ``something happened'' to Miss
Brawley, even if Pagones was not involved. ``Someone knows
something,'' she said. ``Something did happen to that child.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Joyce Turner, co-owner of Cross Boro Realty
on Fulton Street, said she had early doubts about Miss Brawley's
story but that she believed nonetheless that Sharpton had acted in
good faith. What she would like to see, she said, is some healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who you are,'' she said of Pagones, ``I don't want
the wrong person to be accused of something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than a few people criticized the news media as a biased
messenger in telling the Brawley story. Speaking on the radio
program, ``The Global Black Experience,'' Maddox accused the news
media of conspiring with the judicial system to win a decision
against the advisers. ``If this case was properly reported,'' he
said, ``everyone in this state would be in an uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside her Albany Avenue apartment, Pamela Carter, 38,
agreed. ``I don't even care what happened,'' she said. ``The media
lies to us. They don't tell the real story. Sharpton, he's a black
man, he's for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sharpton did not enjoy universal support. ``Justice was
served yesterday,'' said a 47-year-old woman who asked not to be
identified as she carried groceries along Marcus Garvey Boulevard.
``And I hate to say it, but Al Sharpton can't tell me nothing. He
tried to raise a stink with it. Whenever something happens in the
black neighborhoods, here he comes. But to me, it's because he just
wants to be on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A 36-year-old woman who identified herself only as Renee
dismissed Miss Brawley's story. ``I believe she missed her curfew
and was scared her mother was going to tear her up and she
concocted that story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Eberhart, 63, sat on a chair outside his apartment on
Albany Avenue, listening to the shouts from the nearby revival. ``I
think Sharpton should have checked before he went into it and
accused the man,'' Eberhart said. ``I'm not saying he's not right,
but I think he should have checked. Anything you hear out of
somebody's mouth doesn't have to be true.''

 Net Heavies Tell FTC How To Slam Spam   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A coalition of Internet heavyweights, led by America Online and
AT&AMP;T, has submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commission urging
a major crackdown on unsolicited junk e-mail, or ``spam.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ad-Hoc Working Group on Unsolicited Commercial Email, which
was formed at the request of the FTC a year ago to come up ways to
put a lid on spam, is proposing that federal and state regulators
be given the authority to prosecute spammers who ``forge'' e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial e-mailers sometimes ``forge'' their return addresses
_ making it look as if the message came from AOL or other popular
online services _ to trick consumers into opening their mail. Many
of these messages promote get-rich-quick schemes, pyramid
operations and sex sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that different from old-fashioned junk mail that looks
like it's from the government or might contain a check. But unlike
junk mail sent through the post office, e-mail spammers can send
out millions of pieces at virtually no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This form of elusive behavior is costing everyone _ the
system, individual consumers _ a great deal of money and frustrates
consumers' ability to limit messages they don't want,'' said
Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel of the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington, D.C., and principal writer of the 32-page
report.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant use of forged addresses and e-mail containing
fraudulent material prompted the FTC to request a report from
industry leaders last summer. The ad hoc group of 40 companies and
organizations also includes IBM, Microsoft, MCI, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Our core concern is with e-mail that has deceptive
content,'' FTC attorney John Rothchild said. ``Anything that allows
companies to steal money from unsuspecting consumers through scams
_ whether by direct mail or e-mail _ is a major concern to us.
There are a large number of old-fashioned pyramid schemes online
that are camouflaged as business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothchild said the five-person FTC is studying the report and
will comment soon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving states the ability to prosecute spammers,
the report recommends that Internet service providers make
widespread use of filtering software to weed out junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures could significantly reduce the volume of spam
on the Internet,'' said Richard Buchband, general counsel of Juno
Online Services LP, a provider of free e-mail. ``Until now, the
most effective way to stop spammers was by suing them.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Juno, which boasts 5.4 million users, has sued
eight junk mailers since 1997 to bar them from hawking
get-rich-quick schemes on its e-mail service or from forging Juno
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Juno, AOL and others have successfully sued spammers
off their sites, the strategy is costly and doesn't shield
consumers from the scores of online mass marketers who aren't taken
to court, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 billion pieces of junk e-mail a year are
clogging up Internet pathways and individuals' e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting outcry among consumers has prompted several pieces
of anti-spamming legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Netizens Protection Act, sponsored by Representative
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., would amend the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991, which bans unsolicited junk faxes, to also
regulate junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate unanimously passed a provision of the
Consumer Antislamming Act, co-authored by Senator Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., that would fine junk e-mailers up to $15,000 if
they mask their identities with forged addresses. The bill
prohibits the unauthorized switching of telephone service providers
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc group's report encourages Internet service providers
and Net surfers to employ a combination of litigation and software
filters for ``temporary relief from (junk) e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But it admits that isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Despite some service providers' best efforts to litigate
(spam) off the Internet, some senders are quick to target other
service providers when faced with a judgment forbidding them from
targeting a specific provider,'' the report stated.

WHO WILL LEAD JAPAN? KINGMAKERS WILL DECIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As Japan chooses a new prime minister, the procedure
somewhat resembles a traditional village market in which hawkers
bargain over their wares, in this case their favorite candidates to
run the world's second largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a marketplace is open and anyone can see what is
going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party has announced that on July 21 it
will select its new president _ who will then become prime minister
_ so the party's factions are bustling about with secret meetings
and tense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so far, none of the contenders have actually announced their
interest in the prime minister's job, because it is considered poor
manners for a political aspirant to step forward on his own; the
better-bred pretend to be pushed.
</P>
<P>
   The key figures in choosing the country's next leader are the
elders of the party factions, which, to make things murkier, were
officially abandoned a few years ago and technically no longer
exist. These kingmakers, like former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, rarely say
much in public but command great influence in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an underground process of sounding people out and
building a consensus,'' explained Keizo Takemi, a Liberal Democrat
member of Parliament. ``It's not clear-cut decision-making, but
it's very effective for the Japanese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the shadowy nature of the selection process creates a
quandary for the Liberal Democrats. Party officials like Takemi
believe that the behind-the-scenes activity is necessary, but they
also worry that it may anger voters _ and voter anger is on
people's minds these days, since it is the reason why the prime
minister's job is available.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to resign Monday
after voters gave the party a drubbing in parliamentary elections.
The main complaints of the voters were economic mismanagement and
the kind of old-style politicking that the party now plans to
employ to pick Hashimoto's replacement. But party members worry
that the appearance of conflict could lead to more problems than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we try to make it more open, that will bring about
confusion in the markets,'' Takemi said. ``To avoid bringing about
serious confusion in the currency markets, which could bring about
confusion in all the Asian markets, we must be very careful to
avoid conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The new party leader will be chosen by the Liberal Democratic
members of Parliament, but the key maneuverings are not by
individuals but by the factions _ or ``former factions'' as they
are sometimes called. All but about 26 of the 366 Liberal Democrats
in Parliament belong to one of the five factions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the faction members normally vote as a block, that gives
enormous power to the faction leaders. Takeshita is the godfather
of the largest faction, with 91 members, Nakasone heads another
with 61 members, and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reigns
over another with 82 members.
</P>
<P>
   These behind-the-scenes leaders are often called Japan's shadow
shoguns, and they wield incomparably more power over the country
than former presidents do in the United States. But politicians,
scholars and political journalists also say that the importance of
the factions and faction leaders is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to this idea of them as shadow shoguns,''
said an aide to one of the former prime ministers. ``But it is true
that they have long experience in Parliament _ up to 50 years _ and
that that gives them considerable influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also some effect from Confucianism and its respect for
seniority,'' the aide said. ``But it's changing. They have much
less authority than they did 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason why the faction leaders seem to have lost influence
is that public funds are now given to parties as a whole. The
result is that the coffers of each faction are far less important
in winning influence.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita is perhaps the most influential of the ``shadow
shoguns,'' constantly holding meetings in his home to help
formulate national policy, but even he is more of a back-stage
manipulator and sage than a secret dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Takeshita doesn't have to exert his influence so much,'' said
Yoshibumi Wakamiya, the political editor of the Asahi Shimbun,
Japan's most respected newspaper. ``But his experience and
political expertise are highly rated, and so he is often consulted
by politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The factions are not based on ideology or policy, and a
politician joins one or the other simply because even now they are
mechanisms to allocate Cabinet posts and other prizes, as well as
some campaign funds. Likewise, the party elders traditionally
negotiated not so much policy as political issues, like who would
get which Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the elders have played some role in formulating a
response to the economic crisis. Takeshita helped draw up a
stimulus package earlier this year, and Miyazawa has been deeply
involved throughout the crisis in mapping out economic policies,
for he is a respected expert on Japan's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidate to become prime minister is Keizo Obuchi,
the foreign minister and the head of the biggest faction, which is
named after him but is informally controlled by Takeshita. But the
leaders no longer have iron control over their factions, and one
indication of that is the emergence of a fellow member of the
Obuchi faction, Seiroku Kajiyama, as one of Obuchi's leading
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this may be the weakness of Kajiyama's candidacy,
for members of the Obuchi faction seem more inclined to support
Obuchi than to back Kajiyama.
</P>
<P>
   While the party leaders have the greatest influence and seem
inclined to pick someone like Obuchi, this prospect is making some
junior members of Parliament very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that when general elections are called some time in
the next couple of years, Obuchi _ generally regarded as about as
uncharismatic as a politician can be _ would make a feeble
campaigner with short coattails, jeopardizing their own political
futures.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some younger members would like a more fiery
leader and better campaigner to be prime minister. The one
mentioned most often is Junichiro Koizumi, a dynamic politician.
</P>
<P>
   A poll for Asahi Shimbun suggested that among the public, the
favored choice among the leading Liberal Democratic candidates
would be Kajiyama, followed by Koizumi. But the party elders are
the ones who count, and they seem inclined toward Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamics of the political parties favor Obuchi, but
everybody thinks that he's not fit to manage a crisis like the one
we have now,'' said Wakamiya, the political editor. ``So it goes
around and around, but in the end it may stop at Obuchi.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wakamiya said that while experts are unimpressed by
Obuchi's intellect and leadership, they do give him credit for his
ability to listen and work with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi knows his limits and he listens to others,'' he said.
``He could turn out to be a very good prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a good deal of carping among Japanese and foreign
commentators that all the leading candidates to be the next prime
minister seem dull and tired and unimaginative. But some also say
that the factional system and the emphasis on consensus tends to
elevate precisely that kind of politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blame them for being dull,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, a
political science professor at Tokyo University. ``That's how
they've been chosen as high-ranking politicians. If you want
politicians at the highest level, then you've got to change the
structure.'' &QL;

 More Mega-Mergers Ahead for Morgan Stanley Tech Expert   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Dealmaker Frank Quattrone may grab most of the ink, but Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter's Chuck Cory has honchoed some of the year's
biggest technology buyouts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quattrone, of course, is the investment banker credited with
building Morgan Stanley's tech practice in the Silicon Valley
earlier this decade before job- &QL; 
hopping to Deutche Bank Securities. He hung his money clip there
two years before bolting yet again to Credit Suisse First Boston a
couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cory, meantime, has toiled at Morgan Stanley for 17 years, the
first 15 of which he spent in New York. But two years ago, he was
dispatched to Menlo Park to fill the void left by Quattrone.
</P>
<P>
   Cory, 43, was no stranger to technology and telecom, having
represented AT&AMP;T in as many as 15 deals since the mid-80s. And as
Morgan Stanley's managing director of mergers and acquisitions for
technology worldwide, Cory is a rare breed: a Morgan Stanley banker
who runs an entire practice from outside Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-80s, I, like most investment bankers, was a
generalist,'' he says. Heading up a specialty ``just wasn't done
then.''
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, and Morgan Stanley has changed with them
by requiring its bankers to specialize by industry, Cory says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment banking used to be about just being a deal
jockey,'' he notes. But not anymore. When it comes to advising
large corporations on acquisition decisions, ``you better be a
savvy industry observer who can provide intelligent advice,'' Cory
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's top chief executives must be listening.
Already this year, Cory has been the lead adviser on three
blockbuster technology deals totaling nearly $30 billion. He
represented Houston-based Compaq in its $9.6 billion buyout of
Digital Equipment, Santa Clara's Bay Networks in its $9.1 billion
merger with Northern Telecom and Ciena in its $7.1 billion merger
with Tellabs.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, while IPO underwriting keeps investment banks in
clover, M&AMP;A is where the action is. Eight of the 10 largest
transactions of all-time have been announced during the past three
months, according to Mergerstat, a deal tracking service in Los
Angeles. In fact, some 3,890 U.S. deals have been announced already
this year totaling more than $772 billion, which is more than
double the $285.1 billion in deals during the first half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In what is amounting to the biggest consolidation of industry
since the turn of the century, ``more dominoes are certain to
fall,'' Cory says.
</P>
<P>
   And you can bet Cory and Morgan Stanley will be there to grab
their share.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   It's earnings season, and chief financial officers from Bangor,
Maine, to Burlingame are creatively putting their best spin on
their companies' latest financial results. But when unhappy news is
released, not everyone is granted the privilege of being spun.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case in San Francisco on Monday morning when the
Chronicle's semiconductor reporter, Dan Fost, wasn't allowed to
attend a special briefing held by Applied Materials for fund
analysts and managers at the posh Sheraton Plaza hotel.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Applied Materials warned Wall Street that it would
not meet analysts' consensus projections.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, shareholders wanted to hear a detailed explanation as
to why. So not to keep fund managers and analysts in the dark, the
Santa Clara semiconductor-equipment company arranged the briefing
to coincide with Semicon West, a semiconductor trade show being
held at the Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   With the preannouncement of a bad quarter and uncertainty
surrounding Japan's election (Applied does a lot of business in
Asia), rumors of layoffs were flying, Fost says.
</P>
<P>
   But once the reporter arrived at the registration table for the
briefing, he was told that he couldn't partake because it was ``for
analysts only.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials tried to make up for the inequity by holding a
separate news conference for reporters later in the day, and Fost
was given a 10-minute interview with chief executive Jim Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the institutional crowd was treated to three
hours of pointed explanation while the press and the public were
regaled with a few minutes of sound bites.

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE DELAYED AND DERAILED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is going to report to the Senate
Judiciary Committee today, but nothing she says is likely to change
one big fact or clear up one lasting mystery. The fact is that even
with the Independent Counsel Act, if an attorney general is
determined to protect a sitting president from investigation there
is little that Congress or federal law enforcement agencies can do.
The mystery is why any attorney general would want his or her chief
legacy to be the preservation of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson said that was how history is likely to regard
the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry if it stays on
its current track. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs
Committee, Thompson was not able to prove Chinese government
meddling in the 1996 election, but the information remains as
disturbing as it was back when the FBI first warned members of
Congress about the alleged Chinese plan. Johnny Chung, the accused
bagman who had such good entree to the Oval Office, may have been
the connection between the Chinese military and Democratic
fund-raisers, but Justice Department spin is that we may never
know.
</P>
<P>
   Such possibilities make most prosecutors curious. They make the
nation's top prosecutor militantly lethargic. Janet Reno has
rejected the obviously correct advice of Louis Freeh, the FBI
director, that she appoint an independent counsel, since her boss,
the president, was at the center of the most reckless fund-raising
effort since Watergate. The fact that even her tightly controlled
inquiry has already produced the indictment of 11 Democratic
figures argues for appointment of an independent prosecutor willing
to follow the trail into a White House where, according to a recent
indictment, a wealthy Asian businessman like Dhanin Chearvanont was
able to discuss economic issues with President Clinton and Don
Fowler, then the Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lashing her department to produce the truth, Reno has
steadily reinforced its balkiest instincts. For months in 1996, the
inquiry languished under inexperienced leadership. Charles Labella,
who arrived in October 1997 to fix things, is about to decamp to
California, abandoning his unfinished duty to David Vicinanzo, a
deputy U.S. attorney from New Hampshire. Maybe Ms. Reno learned
something during all those years she lived by the sea in Miami. If
you want to prevent a ship from reaching its destination, just keep
changing the navigators.
</P>
<P>
   We are pleased that Freeh has delayed a transfer for James
Desarno, the senior FBI investigator on the case. Freeh continues
to tell members of Congress that he thinks an independent counsel
is necessary. We would like to see him make more forceful and
persistent public statements. The worst that could happen would be
that Reno or the president would fire him. In this administration,
it would be refreshing to see someone dismissed for zealous
curiosity about how Clinton raised the money that got him
re-elected.

 132 Follow Quattrone To Credit Suisse   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
After raiding the top three investment bankers from Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell's Technology Group two weeks ago, Credit Suisse First
Boston hired another 132 employees from its competitor yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mass defection represents about 95 percent of the employees
at DMG's tech group, a Menlo Park-based subsidiary of Germany's
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The raid _ perhaps the biggest ever by a Wall Street firm _
included 75 investment bankers, more than 20 analysts and support
staff.
</P>
<P>
   They followed Frank Quattrone, who on July 1 announced that he
was quitting as DMG's managing director to head investment banking
and equity research for CSFB's technology clients around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined at the time by George Boutros, managing director
for mergers and acquisitions, and Bill Brady, managing director for
corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, the trio jumped from Morgan Stanley with
nearly 20 of their colleagues to create a technology investment
``dream team'' for DMG.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Quattrone had vehemently denied rumors that he was
about to leave DMG. ``I would have preferred not making this
move,'' he said yesterday. ``If Deutsche Bank's strategy didn't
change so dramatically in North America, we wouldn't have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing substantial loan losses in Asia as well as some other
problems, the giant German bank announced plans to restructure in
January. DMG's management staff was shuffled and then reshuffled.
Commitments to add research and sales force were withdrawn,
according to Quattrone.
</P>
<P>
   The company retrenched and shifted its focus back to Europe,
``making it increasingly difficult conducting business as usual,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers and prospective clients, especially those planning
initial public offerings, questioned whether Quattrone and crew
would stay put and whether they would continue to provide analyst
coverage and make markets in their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, when Quattrone received the first inquiry from
CSFB, he says he didn't return the call. But by May, he began
talking to Charles Ward, managing director and global head of
corporate and investment banking at CSFB. Discussions became
serious in June. Quattrone and his two lieutenants jumped ship two
weeks ago. And on Monday, CSFB reached what the two sides are only
describing as an ``amicable'' agreement.
</P>
<P>
   No financial terms were discussed. Quattrone would say only that
the pay packages for himself and his colleagues ``had to be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, DMG's high-tech practice generated about $120 million
on $200 million revenues, and profits reportedly were split about
evenly between the key producers and the company.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone has denied rumors that he alone made $7 million to $10
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like DMG, CSFB explored building its own technology investment
banking practice before opting to buy one. ``We concluded it would
take a very long time and the way to build critical mass would be
to hire a lot of people quickly,'' said CSFB's Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banking unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse is a
world power in several areas. In the first half of this year, it
ranked No. 3 in global mergers and acquisitions, with 123 deals
worth $249 billion. It represented AT&AMP;T in its merger with
Tele-Communications Inc., and Chrysler in the merger with
Daimler-Benz. In the past six months, it also ranked No. 5
worldwide in equity underwriting, managing 48 deals worth $11.8
billion. But in technology, it is a weakling, with just 17
investment bankers and 13 analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Those employees will report to Quattrone. The CSFB tech group
will be headquartered in Palo Alto, with about 90 employees. Other
offices will be in San Francisco, Boston, New York, London and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some directors of competing firms suggested yesterday that
Quattrone has lost credibility after repeatedly pledging his
devotion to DMG.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1996, he left Morgan Stanley under the veneer of
building a world-class technology investment banking practice,''
said one. ``Doing it a second time, the veneer becomes thinner and
it looks like the motivation is personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some DMG investment banking clients _ including
Amazon.com, Atmel and PeopleSoft _ recently have taken deals to
Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, others remain loyal to Quattrone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience has only been positive,'' said Peter Morris, a
partner with the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates,
whose client Carrier Access is about to launch a public offering
with the help of Quattrone. ``We are staying with them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day before the mass exodus from DMG, Deutsche
Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer was quoted in the Financial Times as
saying that his firm is determined to expand investment banking in
the United States through acquisition or joint venture. But several
competitors are unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that they've lost their flagship franchise and are
pulling the tent down in the United States,'' said the managing
director of one company. He feels that CSFB poses a much graver
competitive threat than DMG ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have major-league distribution capability,'' he
said. ``They've got everything else, and now they have a new
industry group _ technology.''

 Egghead Cracks the Net   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Six months after scrapping its money-losing chain of stores,
Egghead.com Inc. could be the first big retailer to successfully
transform itself into a pure Internet company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its three Web sites comprise an online superstore with more than
40,000 computer products. The flagship site,  &LR; www.egghead.com &LR; ,
sells new hardware and software, while  &LR; www.surplusdirect.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.surplusauction.com &LR;  offer older versions of products, along
with refurbished and surplus goods.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, sensing that Egghead could become a major shopping
presence on the Net, have driven the company's stock up from $8.44
at the start of July to $26.13 on Monday. The shares gave back some
yesterday, closing down $2.72 to $23.41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's finally setting in that Egghead is no longer the
chain of 170 little strip mall stores, and that they have a very
strong brand name that's recognized by anyone who's used a computer
over the past 10 years,'' said Paul Taylor, an analyst for Arcadia
Investment Corp. in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Egghead doesn't expect to return to profitability in the near
future, but it hopes that by slashing operating costs and focusing
on the Internet, it has set the stage for a rebound. The company
had an operating loss of $7.2 million in its fourth quarter that
ended in March _ its 11th loss in the past 12 quarters. However,
online sales _ the key to future success _ hit $30.5 million during
the quarter, exceeding forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Growth appears to be especially strong for
 &LR; www.surplusauction.com &UR; ,  &LR; a site that lets consumers bid online
for computer hardware and software. Egghead said that in the first
quarter that ended in June, revenues from the auction site nearly
doubled from the fourth quarter, reaching $13.7 million. (The
company will report first-quarter results on July 28.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; After what Egghead has endured during the past several years,
any positive news is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1984 as Egghead Software, it was the most prominent
chain selling computer software for a decade. At its zenith, it
boasted 250 stores and a thriving catalog business.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, however, computer superstores such as CompUSA were
starting to eat into Egghead's business. By the summer of 1996, the
company was on the rocks, buckling under the same pressures that
were afflicting other software chains such as Software Etc. and
Babbages, which also were finding it nearly impossible to turn a
profit with small stores based in shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the Egghead turned to its chairman, George Orban,
an early investor in the company who had also helped start several
other retail ventures, including Ross Stores, the chain of discount
clothing outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Orban became chief executive of Egghead in January of 1997,
replacing Terence Strom. Orban's first order of business was to
close about 80 stores (out of a total at that time of 160), and
concentrate on markets where he thought the company could compete.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Orban suggested that Egghead turn its
attention to the Internet. The company redesigned its Web site for
online shopping, and in August it acquired Surplus Direct, which
operated  &LR; www.surplusdirect.com &LR;  and the then-new
 &LR; www.surplusauction.com,  &LR; in a $31.5 million stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, Orban was confident Egghead could make
it exclusively on its growing Internet business. Last January 28,
the company said it would close its remaining 80 stores, lay off 80
percent of its 1,000 employees, take a $42 million restructuring
charge and change its name to Egghead.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point you could have made the case that Egghead would
not have long to live,'' conceded company spokesman John Hough.
</P>
<P>
   What brought Egghead back, said Orban, was its strong brand
name, a solid core of management, and the fact that it had more
than $60 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have capital and intelligent people there are a
lot of things you can do even in as difficult a situation as
Egghead found itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orban, 52, doesn't really see much difference between selling
out of a store or off the Web. ``I've often said this is no more a
technology business than a chain store is,'' he said. ``This is a
business of retailing in which you need to use technology to make
it successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to seen whether Orban's vision will translate into a
long-term rebound. The few analysts who follow the company are
taking a wait-and-see approach about the recent rise in its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going crazy on all the Internet stocks, and this is
one that has just now been discovered,'' said Casey Stern of Starr
Securities in New York. ``What concerns me about these stocks is
that when they go up this quickly, if there's a hiccup they're
going to come down just as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Egghead grow itself into an Internet shopping franchise? ``I
can't say at this point,'' Stern said. ``But I certainly like what
Egghead has done. It looks like they're on their way.''

of the South African currency, the rand, which has been falling
sharply.

AS OTHER STATES CUT DEBT, NEW YORK BORROWS MORE AND MORE

 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There is an audacity to the way New York state
borrows money that can make even critics sound almost admiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it really is amazing,'' said Robert Kurtter, senior
vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. ``No
one else is even close.''
</P>
<P>
   While many states are taking advantage of the economic boom to
control or reduce their public debts, New York state is vigorously
bucking the trend, engaging in a borrowing spree that easily gives
it the largest debt of any state.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Mario Cuomo began his last term, on Jan. 1, 1991, New
York owed $20 billion in outstanding bonds that were being repaid
with state taxes. When Gov. George Pataki took office four years
later, the debt was $27 billion. Now it is almost $35 billion, and
the administration projects that it will reach $41 billion in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   California, with a population 75 percent larger than New York's,
is a distant second, with $21 billion in tax-supported debt.
</P>
<P>
   New York's public authorities, agencies like the Thruway
Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which are
controlled by the governor, owed $60 billion at the start of 1991
and $71 billion when Pataki took office; they owe $85 billion
today. That figure, too, is expected to keep rising fast. Some of
that debt is supported by state taxes, but most of it is repaid
through the authorities' own revenues, like tolls and subway fares.
</P>
<P>
   This voracious borrowing has come even as the state has racked
up record surpluses in the last two years, and it has helped make
possible what Pataki, a Republican, holds up as his signal
achievement: cutting taxes deeply, even as state spending has
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Going billions of dollars deeper into debt has allowed the state
to expand its capital building programs, despite tax cuts, by
pushing the costs as much as 30 years into the future and leaving a
future generation of lawmakers to deal with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they cut taxes, they had to either borrow a lot more
money, or let the capital program go to pieces,'' said Frank Mauro,
executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group financed
primarily by foundations and labor unions that studies state
finances.
</P>
<P>
   People who watch the state's finances from outside the Capitol,
including some who rate the state's bonds, warn of a debt crisis in
the making, one that in the next recession _ or even in a Wall
Street downturn _ could force severe program cuts and layoffs, or
increases in the taxes and fees that are used to pay off bonds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state's debt has grown as the nation's economy has been
humming along _ though somewhat less tunefully in New York _ and
generating healthy tax revenues. Most states have used this period
to get their fiscal houses in order and their debts under control.
Louisiana, until recently the only state with a worse credit rating
than New York's (they are now tied for worst), has cut its debt in
half in five years.
</P>
<P>
   New York began the last recession as the biggest debtor state.
When some states borrowed to make ends meet during that downturn,
New York borrowed more. When sour times turned sweet, New York kept
borrowing and continues to borrow far more money, year in and year
out, than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by Moody's shows that New York state's
tax-supported debt is the fourth highest, per capita, of any state,
and fifth highest when measured against the income of state
residents.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, under Gov. Christie Whitman, has also bucked the
national trend, going much deeper into debt despite good times.
Before Whitman took office, New Jersey had a below-average debt
burden, but it has jumped to seventh worst in the Moody's rankings,
though still significantly less than New York's.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, long one of the most heavily indebted states, has
marginally increased its borrowing under Gov. John G. Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Pataki, who is running for re-election this year,
acknowledges that the state owes too much, and he has proposed some
modest steps to deal with the problem. But it is a measure of how
deeply ingrained borrowing is in the state's political culture that
while many other states have held debt steady or reduced it, the
governor's budget director, Robert King, boasts of having slowed
the rate at which New York's debt grows.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor and his aides have said the primary
blame for the growing debt lies with the Legislature, particularly
the Democrats who control the Assembly. Democratic Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver has repeatedly advocated more borrowing, despite the
state's huge cash surpluses of $2.1 billion this year and $1.4
billion last year. The administration also points to the burden of
keeping up the state's expansive infrastructure of roads, bridges,
colleges and mass transit, arguing that they were ill maintained in
Cuomo's last years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to tell you that the problem does not need to be
addressed,'' King, the budget director, said in an interview. ``We
are committed, the governor and the Budget Division, to trying to
reduce the size of the state debt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the growing debt has tarnished, somewhat, the governor's
carefully built and jealously guarded image as a fiscal
conservative, one that is central not just to his current campaign,
but to his potential aspirations for national office in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's record on debt is irresponsible, because New
York was already so deeply in debt when he took office,'' said Tom
Carroll, president of Change-NY, a group of fiscal conservatives
that has generally lauded Pataki's record. ``This is the one fiscal
problem he has made worse, rather than better. And it's
particularly inexcusable to keep borrowing more when the state is
running such big surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats complain that while Pataki derided Cuomo as a
tax-and-spend Democrat, the governor has turned out to be a
borrow-and-spend Republican. New York City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, has tried to
campaign to Pataki's right on fiscal matters, making himself out to
be the true conservative, and reminding audiences of his role in
creating New York City budgets that are, by most experts'
judgments, more sound than the state's.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts say the problem has actually worsened under
Pataki, because the state borrows for more of its capital needs
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Cuomo's 12 years in office, the state paid well over
half of its capital budget with cash on hand, borrowing the rest.
In some years, the ``pay-as-you-go'' portion was over 70 percent,
and even in Cuomo's last two years in office, when the state's
economy was still stagnant, it was 51 percent and then 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki, it has fallen below 30 percent, despite the
state's record surpluses, and the administration's long-range plan
calls for it to drop to 10 percent soon.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``With these huge surpluses, we've not only blown a spectacular
opportunity to increase pay-as-you-go, cap borrowing and even pay
off some of the old debts, we've actually done the opposite, and
made it a lot worse,'' said Andrew Rein, senior researcher with the
Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the New
York city and state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Most states spend less than 4 cents of every general fund dollar
repaying bonds. At the start of 1991, New York spent less than 6
cents. When Pataki took office in 1995, it spent 8 cents. This
fiscal year, it will spend $3.5 billion paying off loans, or 9{
cents of every dollar in the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is projected to keep rising fast, not only because
the state plans to keep borrowing, but because lawmakers have
approved a host of tax cuts that have not yet taken effect, and
that will cut into the available money in the general fund. The
increase is all the more striking because interest rates have been
very low in recent years, allowing the Pataki administration to
save money by refinancing bonds at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   King, the budget director, spoke of the administration's
frustration at not being able to take more steps to control
borrowing. ``Patterns of behavior take a while to change,'' he
said. ``We're changing them as aggressively as our friends upstairs
will let us,'' he added, referring to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki, the state has not engaged in some of the most
derided practices of the Cuomo years, like selling, in essence, the
Attica prison to itself to generate cash, or borrowing to meet
routine operating needs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pataki proposed early repayment of the $200 million
in Attica bonds, but the Legislature refused. This year, he
proposed paying cash for $425 million in already approved projects,
like a sports complex in Brooklyn and improvements to the Buffalo
Bills' stadium, rather than borrowing the money, but the
Legislature said no. He proposed the creation of a debt-reduction
fund that would use up to $800 million in surplus funds this year
to pay off debts; the Legislature created the fund, but would only
put $50 million in it.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, the governor, under some criticism for proposing
an 8 percent increase in state spending, vetoed more than $800
million in borrowing approved by the Legislature, saying the
projects were unnecessary, or could be paid for with cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   All of this lets Pataki claim, with some justification, that his
is the voice of restraint in Albany. But restraint is a relative
term.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pataki who this year started a six-year, $3-billion
borrowing campaign for improvements at State and City University
campuses. He agreed to the $425 million in borrowing for sports and
other facilities in last year's budget. He championed the $1.75
billion environmental bond act approved by voters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, under Pataki's direction, the Long Island Power
Authority is issuing $7 billion in bonds, the largest state or
local bond issue in U.S. history, to buy the assets of the Long
Island Lighting Company. The MTA, which the governor controls, is
selling $3.5 billion in fare-backed bonds over three years, largely
because Pataki ended the state's practice of helping pay for new
trains and buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debt in New York is viewed as a free good,'' said Kurtter, of
Moody's. ``It's not viewed as a scarce resource. The concern is
first and foremost creating additional resources to afford current
spending, and deferring any costs that can be deferred as far as
possible into the future.''

 &HT;     ASPIRE TO PERSPIRE? I DON'T THINK SO 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am old enough to remember when ladies didn't sweat. They may
have perspired, they may even have glowed. But they didn't sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are no more ladies, and women are sweating all over
the place. Yes, we've earned the right to sweat. It's one of the
less-acknowledged triumphs of the feminist movement. For some of us
who came of age pre-Title Nine, this new sweat equity takes some
getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   I am trying to learn to love it. To love my own sweat, that is.
Do I have to learn how to love everybody else's too? That would be
asking a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Before we go on, perhaps I should pause to say that if this
subject offends you, please move to the next column which, whatever
it's about, won't be about sweat. Don't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the hottest evenings in recent memory, a friend and I
were talking in my kitchen, which, like the rest of the house, is
cleverly designed to be drafty in winter and airless in summer. I
was attempting to cook dinner, I suppose you might even say
``slaving over a hot stove'' (I certainly would), and complaining
that I hate sweat, that it was driving me crazy, that I'd taken two
showers that day and was working up to a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to accept your sweat,'' Chris said. ``Don't
fight it. Give in to it. Relax. Learn to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   I know sweat is healthy, that you're supposed to break a sweat
when you exercise, that if you don't sweat you'll boil over and
die. So sweat is swell. But do I have to love it?
</P>
<P>
   Chris grew up in Florida. Chris is male. Both these facts have
formed his view of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Men love to sweat. Ask any man. ``I love to sweat!'' he'll say.
It's one of those guy things.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's a girl thing, too. Women love to sweat. Because
it's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taxed our muscles, and ended up very sweaty. Which is why
we loved it,'' say the editors of Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness
magazine, reviewing a 30-minute workout in the summer number.
</P>
<P>
   And because sweating is so healthy, it's fashionable. Which is
great, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division between fashion and fitness is officially blurred
into oblivion,'' the July issue of Vogue declares in a sportswear
layout featuring athletic-looking young models, some of them
actually sweating, unless they've been sprayed with Evian, a
possibility; it is Vogue after all.
</P>
<P>
   A workout-induced sweat is what a tan used to be: a status
symbol. Once, not so long ago, a tan was a mark of the leisured
class, of the sort of people who could afford to summer and winter
at resorts and watering places. Workers were pale. Now workers are
pale and sweaty. Because work is the new status symbol. So is
working out. And getting a tan is unthinkable. It can kill you.
Worse, it can age you before your time.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat, on the other hand, is good for you, assuming you
re-hydrate yourself by drinking gallons of bottled water and
electrolyte-replacing fluids specifically designed for those who
sweat. Sweat sells. It sells makeup. Waterproof mascara to help you
avoid the dread ``racoon-eyes'' look. Tinted moisturizers instead
of foundation, which tends to run when it meets sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat sells clothing. ``Your skin sweats, gets clammy, dries up
and dies,'' reads an ad for a new line of Nike training wear
described as, ``a highly-evolved way to facilitate the evaporation
of sweat by hauling it away from the skin.'' This ad features a
photograph of track star Marion Jones, caught in the middle of a
long-jump, her amazing form aglow. Sweat looks great, on her. But
on me? I don't think so.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SOUTHPORT, England _ The gloomy, cold weather settled around the
historic links of Royal Birkdale Golf Club on Tuesday much like the
bitter chill that has seeped into the heart of Ian Baker-Finch.
</P>
<P>
   This is not how Baker-Finch remembered it, with the rain and
gusting winds. But then nothing is like Baker-Finch remembers
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sunny, warm Sunday when Baker-Finch won here seven
years ago. Not just won, conquered. He shot 64, 66 for the final
two rounds, didn't miss a fairway or a green over the last 18 holes
and took his place among golf's elite as the British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the end of his golf career.
</P>
<P>
   What would follow was the most horrific slump in golf history.
As Baker-Finch desperately fought to live up to his new status and
new title, the golf game that had gotten him there drifted away.
The perfect drives down the fairway became snap-hooks; the
taken-for-granted confidence turned into blinding fear.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, the essence of Baker-Finch the golfer was gone. In the
past three years, Baker-Finch has made just one cut worldwide and
is 0-for-32 in PGA Tour events. His total income on the golf course
for that span is less than the average teen-ager makes working for
minimum wage in a fast-food joint.
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch has been through more than 30 specialists _ coaches,
gurus, trainers, psychologists, hypnotists and well-meaning
advice-givers. He has taken his swing apart, piece by piece; spent
hours in front of a mirror trying to get back to basics; and
devoted thousands of hours to grueling practice sessions on the
driving range, always searching, always hoping.
</P>
<P>
   The result is always the same. No matter how good the swing
feels, no matter how much the mind is in sync, no matter how the
body feels, once Baker-Finch steps to the first tee in a
professional event, there's just nothing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all been down to a lack of confidence,'' Baker-Finch
said. ``When you are young, you can pull up trees, move mountains,
rule the world. You haven't stumbled or suffered a fall. Then,
something happens and you start to realize that, yes, you are
fallible. And from that point on, it depends on how you handle
things. I just became drained of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing all my golf at the highest level and could only
stand by and watch as a new breed of young lions came through and
played better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if he had just stood by and watched, things might have
evened themselves out. But that wasn't Baker-Finch's way. So he
continued to grind, continued to pound away, beating his club
against the wall that was threatening to smother him.
</P>
<P>
   But it just got worse, and smack in the center of the spotlight
at that.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 British Open at St. Andrews, Baker-Finch, as a past
Open champion, was paired with Arnold Palmer, who was playing in
his last Open Championship. The crowds gathered around the first
tee were enormous. It should have been a simple task to land a tee
shot on what is possibly one of the widest fairways in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Baker-Finch snap-hooked his drive so far, it cleared
two fairways and went out of bounds on No. 18, more than 170 yards
left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 at Royal Lytham, Baker-Finch started with a 78 and
finished with an 84, coming in last. And then came the worst blow.
Baker-Finch had such high hopes coming into the 1997 British Open
at Royal Troon. He had played in a pro-am the week before and
carded a solid 67. But by the time he stepped to the first tee
Thursday, the demons were back in full force.
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch double-bogeyed the second, sixth and eighth holes;
made bogey on the first three holes on the back side; doubled the
13th with a hooked drive; tripled the 16th by driving out of
bounds; and then doubled the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was absolutely the worst feeling I've ever known,''
Baker-Finch said, ``walking up the 18th at the British Open about
to shoot 92.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until months later that Baker-Finch described in an
article for Sports Illustrated how he and his wife, Jennie, walked
into the champions' locker room following the round, curled up on
the floor together in a fetal position and sobbed. Then after 45
minutes of misery, Baker-Finch pulled himself together and went to
the media center to answer every last painful question from
reporters. That evening, he packed his bags and left, withdrawing
from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Baker-Finch has taken a retirement of sorts from
golf. He continues to practice and play with his friends, maybe a
club event here or there, but nothing in any official competitive
capacity. And surprisingly, his game has been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so relaxed, I am playing really well,'' Baker-Finch said.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, he has come full circle. Back to the place where
it all started and then ended. But this year, Baker-Finch arrived
at Royal Birkdale without his clubs. He is working this week as a
color commentator for ESPN and ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am qualified to play at Birkdale by virtue of being a
previous winner of the Open,'' Baker-Finch said. ``But I decided
some time ago to give it a miss this year. I am covering the
tournament for ABC. I can offer them a good insight into what is
going on, and what might be going through a player's mind, or how a
tournament is unfolding in terms of who might win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Finch returned to Royal Birkdale last month for the first
time since his victory, doing work for Japanese television. The
Birkdale staff had rigged loudspeakers at No. 18, and when
Baker-Finch walked up the 18th fairway, they played the tape of the
cheers and yells that accompanied his walk up that last fairway in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Baker-Finch said. ``The staff had all
gathered at the windows of the clubhouse, and they were all
applauding. It was a marvelous moment, one I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the one seven years ago, when Baker-Finch was hugging
his wife in the bright sunshine on the 18th green at Royal Birkdale
and kissing the coveted Claret Jug. In his heart, he believes one
day that he and the sunshine will return to the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 37,'' Baker-Finch said. ``I'll be back.''

NEW YORK TIMES WEB SITE ENDS FEE FOR FOREIGN USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to expand the popularity of its World Wide Web site
outside the United States, The New York Times said Tuesday that it
had eliminated the fee for access from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation in January 1996, the site, www.nytimes.com,
has been offered free in the United States and has attracted more
than 4 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had, however, charged foreign subscribers $35 a month.
Fewer than 10,000 users outside the United States have elected to
pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic
Media Co., said the decision to end the fee resulted from
``understanding the pricing dynamics on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an audience outside the United States that wanted
the product badly, but it was not large enough to create an
advertising marketplace we considered scalable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said they expected that increased
advertising revenue from abroad should make up the revenue lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, The Times will do much better driving
the advertising than they ever will on the subscription side,''
said Lauren Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is effective immediately. Foreign users will be
charged the same fees as domestic ones for access to the crossword
puzzle and retrieval of past articles from the archives. They range
from $2.50 an article to $9.95 for five articles a month.

WITH DEFAMATION DECIDED, BRAWLEY CASE MOVES TO QUESTION OF
DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 5th graf to ADD first reference for Pagones.) 
(With NY-BRAWLEY-REACT) 
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ A day after they were held liable for
defamation in the Tawana Brawley case, the Rev. Al Sharpton and two
other men began battling Tuesday to persuade the jury to award only
minimal damages, clearly hoping to claim a symbolic victory despite
Monday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides in the long-running case, the struggle over the
damages phase of the trial has at least as much symbolic
significance as practical importance, since all three defendants
say they have limited means.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most forceful defense arguments Tuesday, Michael
Hardy, Sharpton's lawyer, suggested to the jurors that their
decision might have been based on their dislike of Sharpton and
pleaded with them to put aside ``personal feelings as to Reverend
Sharpton'' when setting damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's risky tactic of suggesting bias against his client
within the jury focused attention on just how much importance both
sides attach to the question of damages.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pagones, the former prosecutor who sued the three
advisers, has sought $395 million, an amount that he could say
confirmed the dimensions of the wrong that was committed when
Sharpton and the other two Brawley advisers, Alton Maddox and C.
Vernon Mason, said a decade ago that Pagones had raped and
kidnapped Miss Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could award anything from the full amount Pagones
requested to a nominal amount to zero, a sum that could give the
advisers the ability to assert that their defamations amounted to
harmless rhetoric in the pursuit of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, began the new phase of the
trial Tuesday morning with a terse opening statement urging the
jurors to assess the full compensatory and punitive damages ``to
punish the defendants and also to discourage others from similar
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements, the defendants took various tacks
to reach the same destination: Each made a case for the jury to
award minimal or no damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said that some people see Sharpton as a ``caricature'' who
is loud and has political views with which they disagree. He urged
the jurors not to allow what he called such illicit feelings to
influence a decision on damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead with you to make your decision based on the law and
the evidence, not on personal feelings as to Reverend Sharpton,''
Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's lawyer, Stephen Jackson, suggested to the jurors that an
award of minimal damages could begin to repair the wounds caused by
the case. ``There is an opportunity here to stop the bleeding,'' he
said. ``It's time for healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who has argued the case on his own behalf, urged the
jurors not to be swayed by emotion. He asserted that Pagones had
suffered no financial losses and that any symptoms of anxiety
Pagones associated with the case had appeared before the advisers
had mentioned his name publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Among Pagones' friends and acquaintances, Maddox said, the fact
that the advisers had named Pagones as a participant in an assault
had not injured his reputation. And he said it would be a
miscarriage of justice ``to punish three men who have clearly given
their lives and their careers to help people who could not help
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who spoke first Tuesday, simply told the jurors in a
three-minute statement that Pagones had endured mental stress and
physical suffering as a result of false charges by the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Implying that the case for extensive damages was obvious,
Stanton then entered Pagones' medical records into evidence,
reminded the jury that Pagones had testified for 25 days and rested
the plaintiff's case. The defense is to begin presentation of its
evidence on the damages issue on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hardy appeared the most shaken Tuesday as he addressed the
jurors after they found on Monday that Sharpton had slandered
Pagones seven times, while they found Mason liable for only one
defamatory statement and Maddox liable for only two statements.
Hardy said he had tried to understand what he considered
inconsistent decisions and had wondered whether attitudes about
Sharpton, rather than the evidence in the case, were behind the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope there's not an illicit motive behind that,'' Hardy
said as he stood before the jury box. Such things as the
unpopularity of political views ``or even dislikes, if you will, of
Reverend Sharpton'' should not play a part in any decision, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the six jurors had signed the verdict sheet on
Monday. Because Pagones' case is civil, only five votes were
required on any count. But Hardy suggested Tuesday that
inconsistent findings with respect to the advisers showed some
division on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   If there were deep tensions among the group, they were not
obvious Tuesday. In the courtroom for the brief proceedings, the
jurors appeared calm after the evident exhaustion of their four-day
deliberation. Although the jurors were sequestered over the
weekend, Judge S. Barrett Hickman had permitted them to return to
their homes on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the case said Tuesday that the juror who refused
to sign the verdict sheet is a black woman, one of two black
jurors. The other four jurors are white. It was unclear why the
juror had refused to sign the sheet or whether racial issues played
any part her decision. Just before they delivered their decision on
Monday, a white female juror told the judge that the panel was
divided 3-3 on some counts, which suggested that any division would
not have been along racial lines alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are no longer sequestered, the jurors are not
permitted to speak publicly until they have completed the damages
phase of the case. Lawyers said Tuesday that it was not clear how
long the damages phase would take.

REPORT SAYS BOEING'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE READY IN
TIME  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The national missile defense system, for which The
Boeing Co. recently won an initial $1.6 billion contract to develop
and manage, faces significant risks and technical challenges and is
unlikely to be ready in time to protect the country from attack by
2003 as planned, the General Accounting Office said in a
just-released report.
</P>
<P>
   The findings likely will provide more ammunition to the
project's critics in Congress, who have belittled it as the ``son
of Star Wars,'' the much-maligned 15-year-old proposal by former
President Ronald Reagan for a space-based missile-defense shield
against attack by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars was considered technically and financially
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The system under development by Boeing is less ambitious and is
designed to protect the United States from an attack by a rogue
nation, or an accidental missile launch by Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat from New Mexico and a program
critic, called the report ``disturbing.'' He said it's still not
clear, despite much research, that the system will even work.
</P>
<P>
   For Boeing, it's a $5 billion question. That's what it would be
worth to the Seattle-based aerospace giant if the administration
decides in 2000 to build the system and extend Boeing's contract to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing must first demonstrate by 2000 that even a
rudimentary missile shield will work and can be deployed by 2003 in
either Grand Forks, N.D., or in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The project has the strong support of many congressional
Republicans, who would like to see such a system deployed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Even meeting the current deployment schedule is doubtful,
according to the General Accounting Office, the independent
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accomplishing all the required contracting, development,
integration and testing planned before the initial decision point
in fiscal year 2000 is, and will continue to be, high risk,'' said
the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any decision in fiscal year 2000 to deploy an NMD (national
missile defense) system by 2003 would involve high technical risk
because the associated compressed schedule will permit only limited
testing of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO prepared a less detailed report on the project last
December. The latest report was requested by Democrats on the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon on June 30 awarded the initial development contract
to Boeing, which beat out United Missile Defense Co., a joint
venture among Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and TRW. The team from
United Missile Defense was considered the front runner because it
had more experience than Boeing in missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion contract was the largest yet awarded for a
national missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   The initial development phase of the project is being run by
Boeing's Space Systems Division in Downey, Calif., and will involve
about 250 workers in the region. Half those workers will be new
hires, Boeing has said.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with reporters when Boeing was
selected, John Peller, Boeing's vice president overseeing the
project, said the company would be able to overcome the
technological difficulties. He said much has been learned during
the years of research that the Pentagon had conducted at a cost of
about $50 billion on previous efforts to build a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident that the technology is in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said Tuesday that Peller has seen the GAO
report but has not yet had time to read it and could not comment on
its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Boeing's risk is significant because the
program's schedule only permits limited flight testing before 2000,
when the Defense Department will decide whether to deploy the
system in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of flight testing is limited compared to other
programs,'' the GAO report warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, in a letter attached to the GAO report,
said it agreed with the risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department concurs that the National Missile Defense (NMD)
program faces significant challenges because of high schedule and
technical risks. The report is generally accurate ....''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year a panel appointed by the Pentagon, headed by
Gen. Larry Welch, a former Air Force chief of staff, warned against
``a rush to failure'' because of the project's ambitious schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had requested $2 billion for fiscal
years 1996 to 1998, but Congress more than doubled the amount to
$4.6 billion for increased testing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the missile system is much smaller than the Star
Wars shield envisioned by Reagan in the 1980s, the technical
challenges are still daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must develop space and ground-based radar to provide
early warning of attacking missiles, a ground-based radar system to
identify and track the missiles, and an anti-missile interceptor to
hit and destroy the incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report did note that since its last look at the project
in December 1997, some technical progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors successfully tracked and obtained data needed to
identify simulated targets and decoys, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   More flight tests have been added, the report said, but they may
not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   If a decision is made in 2000 to deploy the system by 2003,
three flight tests would be conducted in fiscal year 2000, and four
a year in fiscal years 2001 through 2003. But the GAO quoted
Boeing's program manager as saying even the expanded flight test
program is ``anemic.''

REP. HAYWORTH'S LETTER ASSAILS CLINTON, INFURIATES DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Rep. J.D. Hayworth, who had been trying to soften his
caustic style, has enraged Democrats with a fund-raising letter
calling Clinton an ``unprincipled, philandering president.''
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1 appeal for money, the Arizona Republican also said
that Clinton has presided over ``the most corrupt administration in
U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   And it warned that Hayworth's Democratic opponent, Steve Owens,
is being bankrolled by ``trial lawyers, radical homosexual rights
groups, environmental extremists . . . along with almost every
other left-wing wacko group you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-page letter has embittered Democrats who are still
smarting over Indiana Republican Dan Burton's reference to Clinton
as a ``scum bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of bitter partisanship and meanspirited name-calling
is shocking, even coming from Hayworth,'' Mark Fleisher, head of
the state Democratic Party, said Tuesday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayworth's chief of staff, Joe Eule, said Fleisher ``takes
hypocrisy to new heights'' by accusing the congressman of
name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a June 29 Democratic Party news release saying
Hayworth had been named the ``dumbest member of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The release relied on a July ``Washingtonian'' magazine survey
of 1,200 Capitol Hill staffers that rated Hayworth No. 1 in the
``No Rocket Scientist'' category among House members.
</P>
<P>
   Owens also has been less than flattering to Hayworth in his
fund-raising appeals.
</P>
<P>
   One Owens letter branded Hayworth a ``partisan yes man'' for
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and another said the congressman is
``beholden to the liquor lobby that opposes tougher drunk driving
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take issue with the idea that this is any more vitriolic
than any other fund-raising letter,'' Eule said of Hayworth's
missive. ``It's no more vitriolic than the ones our opponent sends
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth's fund-raising appeal is designed to fire up
conservative voters in his sprawling 6th Congressional District,
but a copy was inadvertently mailed to a Democrat who turned the
letter over to state party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized upon it as a sign that Hayworth was reverting
to the cutting style that gained him so much publicity during his
first term in Congress. After narrowly escaping defeat in 1996,
Hayworth had taken a much lower profile while gaining more
prominence in Congress with a seat on the prestigious House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretended to be a kinder, gentler J.D., but it doesn't
seem to be that way after this letter,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Hayworth also calls California Democrat Rep. Henry
Waxman, head of the House committee that has been investigating
Democratic fund-raising, an ``oleaginous left-winger.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman press aide Phil Schiliro said Hayworth's letter
symbolizes ``what people find so repugnant about politics today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about ideas or who's better, it's about trading
insults,'' he said. ``It's just unfortunate that's what his
politics has sunk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth is facing a sharp challenge from Owens, a former
Democratic Party chairman and an old friend of Vice President Al
Gore. Owens came within a whisker of defeating the former TV
sportscaster in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth's letter suggests that Clinton's fate could be decided
in part by the the outcome of his own re-election because Democrats
have made him a top target in their effort to regain control of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to survive, they must beat me,'' Hayworth's letter
states. He also suggests that Clinton likely would be impeached by
a re-elected GOP Congress: ``Make no mistake,'' he wrote ``the
Clinton gang will approach this election as if their very survival
is at stake. They should. It is.'' &QL;

TENTATIVE TOBACCO DEAL NETS TEXAS COUNTIES $2.2 BILLION, LAWYERS
SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and JOE STINEBAKER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The tobacco industry would pay $2.2 billion to
Texas' 254 counties for health care costs associated with smoking
under a tentative agreement reached Tuesday between negotiators for
the counties and state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to the counties would be on top of the $15.3
billion settlement the state already has won from the tobacco
industry, said lawyers for Harris and Dallas counties.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Attorney Mike Fleming said that of the counties'
total settlement, about 20 percent would go to Harris County and
the Harris County Hospital District.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the negotiations said that would amount to
$440 million out of a total $2.2 billion settlement for all the
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million
people and is the largest county in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Richard Mithoff, who negotiated for Harris County
and the hospital district, said he believes with ``99 percent
certainty'' that the deal will hold together and be approved by
U.S. District Judge David Folsom in Texarkana next week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's settlement occurred after two days of closed-door
sessions in Folsom's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a substantial accomplishment, and it would be a
tremendous benefit to everyone in Texas,'' Mithoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ries, a lawyer representing Dallas County, described the
deal as an ``agreement in principle, with some fine points to be
determined.'' Ries said lawyers representing the counties in the
negotiations will advise their governing boards to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County Commissioners Court is expected to meet in
special session early next week to hear the details, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mt. Pleasant, called the agreement
``a good solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo,
originally had wanted to pay the counties just $400 million out of
the original settlement the state won earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But then, led by Harris County, the state's counties threatened
to sue the tobacco industry separately to recover unreimbursed
health care costs related to tobacco use. That threat raised the
possibility that Texas would not be able to bring its settlement
with the tobacco industry to final closure.
</P>
<P>
   Mithoff and Ries said the counties' money would come from
additional state claims against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The state's original settlement with the industry provided that
Texas can match any better deals that other states get. Minnesota
won a better deal than Texas, triggering the enhanced payments
clause.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached Tuesday, the state would keep its
original settlement, while the counties would receive the
additional payments, Mithoff and Ries said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales is in New York working out the
details of the additional settlement with the tobacco industry,
said spokesman Ron Dusek.
</P>
<P>
   Sources who asked not to be quoted said the tobacco industry had
not wanted to make an additional payment in the Texas tobacco case
until it was sure the counties would not file a separate lawsuit
against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The county settlement apparently clears the way to finalizing
another sticking point in the state's settlement _ an agreement on
how private attorneys' fees in the case will be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and seven legislators had taken action to
halt Morales' agreement that private lawyers who handled the
state's case would receive $2.3 billion in contingency fees from
the tobacco industry. Bush and the lawmakers argued the payment to
the lawyers was too high and that ultimately, the state could be
liable for part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Under a tentative deal with Morales, Bush and the legislators
agreed to allow the lawyers' fee issue to be separated from the
rest of the lawsuit so that the state's settlement with the tobacco
industry could be finalized. But Morales on Monday refused to go
along with that until the counties made their settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McKetta, the lawyer representing the legislators, said his
clients were ``disappointed'' that Morales refused to sever the
lawyers' fee issue until the rest of the lawsuit was settled. Dusek
said Morales did not want to conclude the lawsuit in a
``piecemeal'' fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Bush and Morales calls for the lawyers who
represented the state to go into arbitration to set a fair payment.
If the lawyers believe the amount awarded by the arbitrator too
small, they can return to court to seek a higher amount. Bush and
the legislators would then be free to oppose the increased
payments.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the fight over the lawyers' fees, Morales filed
a motion asking Judge Folsom to assess $25 million in sanctions
against Bush and the seven legislators for holding up the final
lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, one of those legislators, said the deal with the
counties requires Morales to drop the sanctions motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No dropping of that sanctions motion, no deal with the
counties,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said he and Junell only negotiated with the counties on
what the total amount of their settlement would be. He said it is
up to the counties to decide how the money will be divided.
</P>
<P>
   For negotiating the settlement for Harris County, Mithoff's
contract calls for him to be paid approximately $25 million. But
Fleming said Mithoff and the county will work out an agreement
under which Mithoff would receive substantially less than that
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee has never been an issue to Mr. Mithoff,'' Fleming
said. ``And we'll work out something reasonable with Commissioners
Court.''

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He calls himself Paul C. Kurtz Esq., and those who
know him say that he has done a commendable job of representing
defendants in federal courts in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to how Kurtz has represented himself, that is
a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a still-unraveling case that prosecutors suggest
may be one of the more audacious legal hoaxes of recent years,
Kurtz was arrested in Maryland by the FBI and charged with two
counts of lying to judges about being a lawyer, and investigators
say he may have similarly misrepresented himself to as many as 100
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecutors say Kurtz is not a lawyer. They say he is a
56-year-old con man from Bethesda, Md., who has fooled judges in
courthouses in Manhattan, Brooklyn and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has not said whether it has evidence
that Kurtz has actually tried cases, his role in plea bargains and
sentencing proceedings has led to concern that some of those
convictions and sentences may be in jeopardy in cases where
defendants believed that Kurtz was a genuine lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to get a handle on exactly how extensive
this catastrophe is,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James Benjamin told
U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Stein at a hearing on July 8 in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was good enough to convince others of his legal
savvy. One lawyer, H. Elliot Wales, said Tuesday by telephone that
Kurtz had performed admirably in presenting a legal brief and
arguments at a sentencing hearing at which they both represented a
defendant, and seemed to be extremely dedicated to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should say, I thought his brief was superb,'' Wales said.
``I thought he made a good oral argument. I thought he was
professional in every way. If all lawyers acted as well and as
competently in proceedings as he did, we would have a great bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz filed that sentencing brief in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan sitrict on behalf of one of Wales' clients, Daniel
Spiegelman, who had been convicted of stealing valuable documents
from Columbia University's rare book and manuscript collection.
Investigators say that widely publicized case was among the scores
in which Kurtz may have misrepresented himself.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investigators executed a search warrant and seized 36
file boxes from Kurtz's home in Bethesda. By the end of last week,
they were still sifting through the contents of the boxes, the
investigators told Stein, and they believe there are 80 to 100
cases ``where Kurtz has stood up in front of a judge,'' the
prosecutor, Benjamin, said, ``and has blatantly misrepresented who
he is and what his qualifications are.''
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors, the revelations about Kurtz are a potential
headache. Benjamin added: ``It is going to have extremely serious
consequences requiring the reopening of what appears to be numerous
settled criminal cases with serious cost to the administration of
justice, prejudice to the government, and to the courts as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey C. Hazard, professor of legal ethics at the University
of Pennsylvania School of Law, said that the real cost in such
cases is borne by the defendant. ``He's entitled to a lawyer,''
Hazard said. ``He didn't have a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz is being held with a bond of $200,000 in Maryland pending
further proceedings, and could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
The government is seeking to have him transferred to Manhattan to
face the charges.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Brian Shaughnessy, would not comment on the case
except to say that Kurtz is an expert in the complex rules that
govern federal sentencing and was often consulted by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was highly knowledgeable in those areas,'' Shaughnessy
said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say they were first tipped off to questions about
Kurtz's background on July 2 from a source they will not identify.
They conducted a computerized nationwide check and found no record
that Kurtz was licensed to practice law anywhere in the United
States, Agent Jeffrey Drubner wrote in the federal complaint filed
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found that Kurtz had a record of convictions
dating back to the early 1970s in Virginia, Pennsylvania and
Washington for crimes including passing bad checks, larceny, bank
fraud and theft, Drubner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be learned Tuesday whether Kurtz had attended some
law school or where he might have picked up his legal knowledge.
His business card, which is included in court records, describes
him as ``attorney at law'' at the ``National Correctional
Counseling Center'' in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   In March, while Kurtz was representing a defendant who was
pleading guilty to money laundering in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, Kurtz was asked by Judge Leonard Sand about his
affiliation. Sand said that he was not familiar with the National
Correctional Counseling Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an adjunct part of my practice, Your Honor,'' Kurtz
replied, according to the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz told the judge that the primary focus of his practice ``is
to deal with sentencing matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sand, addressing the defendant, Tohmes Peter, asked, ``Are you
satisfied with the representation you have received from your
attorney?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Peter responded.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Kurtz lied again, prosecutors said, when he wrote
to another judge who was assigned to handle Peter's sentencing.
Kurtz asked Judge Kevin Duffy for a postponement of the hearing,
explaining, ``I have recently lost my elderly mother and, as a
result of attending to personal family business, have fallen behind
in attending to client affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday it was revealed in court that Kurtz's
87-year-old mother is alive and lives in Silver Spring, Md. Kurtz's
lawyer, Shaughnessy, agreed with that assertion, the transcript
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is alive,'' Shaughnessy conceded. ``It is a fact.''

RED BADGRO, 95, FOOTBALL HALL OF FAMER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK LITSKY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris (Red) Badgro, whom legendary running back Red Grange
called ``one of best half-dozen ends I ever saw,'' died July 13 at
a hospital in Kent, Wash., outside Seattle. He was 95 and the
oldest living member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He had been hospitalized briefly after a fall in Kent, where he
had spent his retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1930 through 1934, Badgro played offensive and defensive
end for the New York Giants. He was a big-play receiver who made
the National Football League's All-Pro teams in 1930, 1931, 1933
and 1934. Steve Owen, his Giants coach, said, ``He could block,
tackle and catch passes equally well, and he could do each with the
best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Badgro went to the University of Southern California on a
basketball scholarship and won four letters each in football,
basketball and baseball. A football teammate was the fullback
Marion (Duke) Morrison, later known as John Wayne. During their
college years, they worked occasionally as movie extras, but as
Badgro's niece, Dorothy Westland, of Palm Desert, Calif., said,
``Uncle Badge chose football and John chose movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, Badgro began his pro football career with Grange and
the upstart New York Yankees. When the team collapsed the next
year, Badgro turned to baseball and played the outfield in 1928 for
the Tulsa minor league team and in 1929 and 1930 for the St. Louis
Browns. He batted .239 in 89 games for the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1930, when the Browns demoted him to Houston of the
Texas League, he was recruited by Owen to play pro football for
$150 a game, the going rate, and his baseball career ended. NFL
teams were limited to 20 players then so, at 6 feet and 190 pounds,
Badgro played end on both offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he left the Giants to coach and play for the new
Syracuse team in the American Football League. The team disbanded
after two games, and in 1936 he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers of the
NFL for his final season as a player.
</P>
<P>
   His most memorable moment came on the last play of the NFL's
1933 championship game between the Giants and the Bears in Chicago.
He caught a pass and raced for the goal line, with only Grange, a
shrewd defensive player in the day of two-way players, between him
and the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Burnett, a Giants running back, chased Badgro, ready for a
lateral pass if necessary, but Grange tackled Badgro high in a bear
hug to prevent a lateral. With the ball wedged between them, they
went down, and the Bears won, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grange's arms were around the ball,'' Badgro recalled four
years ago, ``and I couldn't get rid of it. If I get by him, we win
the game. I wish I had the ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Badgro and each teammate received a loser's share of
$142.22.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the last time the Giants played in Seattle, Badgro
watched the game as a guest of Wellington Mara, the team's
president and coowner. When Badgro played for the Giants, Mara was
a teen-age helper to his father, Tim, who owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Badgro was a rugged, fierce competitor,'' Wellington Mara
said, ``and a 190-pound defensive end was pretty big in those days.
He was a very mild-mannered guy, but murder on the field. He was a
clean player. You had to be because there were only three or four
officials and the other guy could get back at you without the
officials catching on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, players had to supply their own shoes, just as
in baseball then. He didn't have money to buy extra football shoes,
so he worked out in baseball spikes. Everyone gave him a lot of
room so he wouldn't step on their toes. When we had a scrimmage, he
had to change his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Hiram Badgro was born Dec. 1, 1902, in Orillia, Wash. His
niece said he enjoyed playing football as a youngster, but added,
``He said that when he graduated from high school, there weren't
enough boys big enough to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After his playing career, Badgro was an assistant coach at
Columbia and the University of Washington, but he declined to
become a head coach because he feared he could no longer be close
to the players.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 63 years, Dorothea, died in 1993. They had no
children. He is survived by his niece and her three sons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, at age 78, Badgro became the oldest inductee into the
Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought much about it,'' he said of his election.
``All I knew is that a lot of players were in it who hadn't been
All-Pro four times like I had. Being elected is the greatest thrill
of my life.''

JURY PICKED IN CADET CAPITAL MURDER TRIAL, TESTIMONY TO BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Whittled down from an initial pool of 181
Comal County residents, a dozen jurors were selected Tuesday in
former Air Force Academy Cadet David Graham's highly publicized
capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of seven men and five women cleared the way for
opening arguments to begin Wednesday morning. District Judge Don
Leonard allotted 20 minutes for prosecutors and defense attorneys
to make their opening remarks. After that, prosecutors were to
begin presenting witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish said he expects to take
at least one week to build his case against Graham, who is accused
of killing Adrianne Jones, 16, of Mansfield, Texas, in December
1995. He would not disclose who his first witnesses will be.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 20, faces life in prison if convicted of capital murder.
His former fiance, Diane Zamora, was convicted of capital murder in
February and is serving a life sentence at a women's prison in
Gatesville. Prosecutors say the pair plotted Jones' death after
Graham said he had a relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors hearing Graham's case include a race-horse trainer, an
industrial psychology consultant, a civilian Air Force aviation
mechanic and a pool hall operator. The jury also includes two
Hispanics and the only African-American in the initial pool.
</P>
<P>
   Some on the panel initially said they were biased against Graham
based on extensive publicity about the case, but all agreed that
they would be impartial jurors. One juror said judging someone is
against her religious beliefs but later agreed that she could
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Lead defense attorney Dan Cogdell spent most of Tuesday's court
session questioning the pool. The Houston lawyer stressed that
prosecutors are required by law to prove that Graham is guilty of
Jones' slaying and that the defense team is not required to prove
that Graham is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell also suggested reasons why a ``hypothetical'' defendant
might make a written confession that was not true. ``What if they
loved another person very much and agreed to take responsibility
with them?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The understanding of laws regarding written confessions and
reasons people make them will be a key part of the defense because
Graham submitted a hand-written statement detailing Jones' slaying,
Cogdell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that the statement is going to be an issue in
this case. ... It's a critical inquiry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the questioning, Cogdell asked the potential
jurors whether any of them thought that Graham is innocent based on
his portrayal in the news media and the Zamora's trial in February.
No hands raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a bigger burden than I ought to have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he is ``elated'' with the jury panel. ``I wanted
smart, free-thinking jurors and I think I got them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, the lead prosecutor, declined to comment about the
jury. He questioned the prospective jury pool Monday, at one point
asking for assurances from the panel that they would not let their
first impressions of a defendant influence their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Cogdell asked Graham to stand up and walk into the
center of the jury pool. As the 6-foot, 2-inch former cadet turned
to face all the panelists, Cogdell asked if anything about Graham's
appearance made them believe that Graham might be guilty. No hands
were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good-looking kid, and I wanted the jury to see that his
looks are inconsistent with that of a killer,'' Cogdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's trial was moved to New Braunfels out of concern that
extensive publicity about Zamora's trial would hamper jury
selection in Tarrant County, where the slaying occurred.
</P>
<P>
   According to police records and Zamora's trial testimony, Zamora
and Graham carried out a plan to kill Jones after Graham claimed he
had sex with her. Jones was found beaten and shot to death along a
rural southwest Grand Prairie road. The case went unsolved for nine
months until Zamora confided to her roommates at the Naval Academy
about her role in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he plans to call Zamora to testify in order to show
inconsistencies between a written statement she made to police and
her testimony during her trial.

CONGRESS EXEMPTS WHEAT SALES FROM PAKISTAN SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress gave final approval Tuesday to a measure
that allows Northwest farmers to sell wheat to Pakistan, removing a
major obstacle for an industry reeling from the effects of the
Asian financial crisis and overabundant harvests worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said President Clinton would sign into law the
measure, which exempts wheat sales from sanctions imposed on
Pakistan for its testing of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was crucial because Pakistan Wednesday plans to buy
about $35 million of wheat. Northwest growers now are free to bid
against farmers from Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory sanctions Clinton imposed against India and
Pakistan after they tested nuclear weapons in May prohibited the
United States from issuing credit guarantees, which Pakistan needs
to borrow money from private banks to buy U.S. wheat. The measure
approved by the House and Senate Tuesday exempts those credits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was not controversial _ the final version passed
both houses on a voice vote when few members were present _ but it
was only the announcement of the impending purchase by Pakistan
that finally propelled Congress to action.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest lawmakers, who have been trying to get the sanctions
lifted since the day they were imposed, were jubilant. Pakistan,
which prefers the white wheat grown in the Northwest to the red
wheat grown in other parts of the United States, bought more than a
third of Washington state's wheat crop last year at a price of more
than $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for eastern Washington,'' said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat is now Washington state's second most valuable export,
after Boeing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critically important that we not cut off people who will
buy our product,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., whose
district includes the southeastern Washington region where the
wheat industry is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt personally delivered the bill to the White House for
Clinton to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly stated his willingness to change the
sanctions law to exempt agricultural export credits.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``does not believe food should be used as a weapon
in the imposition of sanctions,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat farmers, who by some estimates are facing the lowest price
for their crop in 70 years, are relieved to have access to the
Pakistani market. Some wheat industry officials hope that a
Northwest sale to Pakistan will help raise prices on the overall
wheat market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful news,'' said Thomas Mick, chief executive
officer of the Washington Wheat Commission. ``This is something we
really need at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   During about 30 minutes of debate on the House floor Tuesday, no
one spoke against the bill. But the plight of the wheat farmers has
fueled anti-sanctions sentiment in Congress, and some members
suggested that many more sanctions should be lifted to help other
industries sell products abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation does not go far enough,'' said Rep. Calvin
Dooley, D-Calif. ``Why does it not make sense for us to limit
sanctions on any other product? It is in the interest of U.S.
workers to eliminate sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking drew concern from some, including House
International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that we can help our farmers ... but we are
approving U.S. loans, funded by taxpayer dollars, to replace the
money the Pakistanis could have used to take care of their own
needs, and instead they used that money to develop nuclear
weapons,'' he said. ``There is definitely a role for unilateral and
multilateral sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill should not be construed as a lessening of our
commitment to nonproliferation,'' he said. ``To the contrary, by
crafting a more focused sanctions policy, it helps secure the
domestic base for continuing sanctions.''

TEXAS GOVERNOR SOUNDING MORE LIKE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas whether he is
running for president and he insists that, really and truly, he has
not made up his mind. But in the next breath _ in fact in the
course of the next 90 minutes _ he puts forth 10 reasons why he
would make the best Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   After months of protestations that he was focused on winning
re-election in November, Bush came the closest he has come thus far
to making a case for his candidacy for the Republican nomination.
Sitting behind the massive walnut desk in his office in the State
Capitol that was once used by his father the president, Bush
sounded more determined than coy in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed eager to send out the signal that he is no Colin
Powell, making clear that he is more than just dreaming about the
White House. But not wanting to jump too far ahead of himself _ or
of his re-election campaign _ Bush laced his conversation with
disclaimers. But they seemed to have a ritualistic ring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strong hints about a candidacy were particularly striking
because ever since his awkward appearance at a cattle show of
Republican hopefuls in Indianapolis last summer, he has been
careful to stay close to home and not play national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at times sounded as if a bid for the White House were a
foregone conclusion, referring at one point to his fellow
Republicans as ``some of the other candidates.'' At another point,
he said, ``All of us have strengths and all of us have weaknesses.
Republican primary voters are going to have to look at the field
and say, `Who do they want to lead?'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the interview on Monday, Bush, 51, offered signals of
encouragement for those who want him to run.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had a vision for the nation, that he was a
master of the retail politics that are crucial in early primary
states, that he had learned the rigors (he called it ``the
ugliness'') of national campaigns from his father, that he could
unify Republicans, that he had proven appeal to Democrats, that a
governor would make the best president, that he was ``a hard
charger'' who would not shrink from a barrage of attack
advertisements, and that he had a record running ``the
second-largest state in the union'' that could sell nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush said he was worried about the impact of a
presidential run on his 16-year-old twin daughters, who have
``expressed some concern'' about his possible candidacy, he said
``it has given me some comfort'' that the news media had left
Chelsea Clinton alone. The effect on his daughters, he said, is
``not the overriding issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that his wife, Laura, ``was the last person on board''
when he sought the governorship four years ago but that she felt
differently about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that she has seen that she can be a great first lady of
Texas,'' he said, ``I think she now knows she can be a great first
lady of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's deliberations, and unmistakable hints, are no
small matter as the presidential field begins to take shape for
what could be an intensely competitive battle for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a red-hot commodity in Republican politics that
would-be advisers are already practically shuttling here to offer
their services. Some Republicans are conceding him the nomination
and focus on polls that even pollsters acknowledge are wildly
premature but that show Bush edging out Vice President Al Gore for
the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed, I really am,'' Bush said of the polls. ``I'm
honored, of course. But I'm more startled.'' Dismissing those who
argue that his commanding poll numbers may stem from confusion
between Bush and his father, the governor could not resist a jab at
the vice president, saying, ``Either that _ or it's a pretty strong
reflection on Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his father rarely tried to offer advice but was
``living vicariously through all this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite surveys in Texas that show him holding steady at about
70 percent against his Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, Bush
insisted that he was taking his re-election drive seriously. His
advisers said a huge win in such an important state would
underscore his national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times in the interview, Bush's mind sometimes veered far
beyond the borders of this state, which is sweltering under record
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he felt ``the temptations'' of national
office. And he sounded primed for electoral warfare when he
insisted that he would never shrink from the inevitable blitz of
scathing attack commercials from Steve Forbes, who pumped millions
from his fortune into his race in 1996 and plans to run again in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to trouble me,'' the governor said. ``It's
not a reason not to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said politicians did not always have the luxury of choosing
their own timetable for seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how life works,'' he said. ``There are windows of
opportunities that come and go. I believe that history has got a
unique way of offering people opportunity, and often times those of
us in the political process really can't affect timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting his upset victory over Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, Bush
said, ``There's a certain amount of gumption that one must have in
order to seize the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   While his father was known as president to struggle with ``the
vision thing,'' Bush said he was sure that he would know how to
lead the nation _ though his concept of a national vision seemed a
bit unformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons to do it are reasons you've heard me talk about
some,'' he said. ``Ushering in the responsibility era. Or the best
education system in the country. And, of course, other national
issues I would be confronted with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a candidate for president should ``have a reason to
run _ a compelling reason _ and to stand in front of America and
say, `If you elect me, here's the vision, here's where I'd like to
lead.''' Asked whether he had that vision, he replied, ``Well,
yeah. I think I've got a pretty clear view of where a better
tomorrow is for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing endorsements from many Democratic officer holders in
Texas and his strong inroads in Hispanic areas that have long been
Democratic strongholds, Bush suggested that his leadership could be
applied on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to unify,'' he said. ``I don't believe you can lead
a divided nation. It's important to nominate someone who can unite
_ and someone who can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans argue that Bush's calls for uniting
conservatives and moderates make him insufficiently conservative to
win the party's nomination. Unlike other prospective candidates,
Bush, who opposes abortion, refused to rule out the possibility
that he would support an abortion rights candidate on a Republican
ticket, saying, ``Those are all questions that have to be answered
given the context of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and others in the party who have recently decried
homosexuality as a sin, Bush sidestepped the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sinners,'' he said. ``I don't believe I should use
my position to make any kind of determination as to who goes to
heaven and who goes to hell.'' Bush said the attacks on
homosexuality could backfire on Republicans. ``If it's a concerted
effort to divide, I think it's going to affect the outcome of
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush did not mention that ``retail politics'' are
important in states with early contests like Iowa and New
Hampshire, where several of his potential rivals have already spent
months hunting for support, he left no doubt that he was capable of
winning over voters one on one.
</P>
<P>
   He made sure to point out his talent for connecting with voters
_ reminding a reporter how he plunged into a crowd of well-wishers
at a recent event in the town of San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw it was not the old rope line,'' he said. ``It was the
ultimate immersion. And I spent a lot of time there. There's still
retail politics in a state like Texas. I like people. I enjoy it.
I'm a hugger and a shaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made the case for the election of a governor as
president. ``Governors make good candidates and good presidents
because they've been chief executive officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not about to invite competition, Bush demurred when asked
which other governor would make a good president. ``Just about any
of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his reasons for a Bush candidacy, the governor
warned that such talk was horribly premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind one way or another whether I will
run for president,'' he said. ``I know that's hard for you to
accept. I hope you do accept it. Because it's the truth.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite age restrictions on the women's tour and the need for a
power game on the men's tour, tennis prodigies continue to spring
up like mushrooms, many of them traveling to the United States with
eager parents who still believe that the sport can deliver their
children to the pot of gold at the end of a global rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Like divas sharing the same stage, two of these players
brandished their racquets and pounded away last spring on adjacent
practice courts at the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton,
Fla., without ever acknowledging the other's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They plowed through intense practices like workhorses in
blinders: 15-year-old Yelena Bovina, working out with a coach and a
male sparring partner under the watchful eye of her mother,
Marguerite, and 11-year-old Maria Sharipova, whose effervescent and
opinionated father, Uri, has received strict orders to stay mum
while his daughter learns her trade.
</P>
<P>
   All that was at stake, according to both young emigrants, was a
happy future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come to Bollettieri's: back home I played
on a piece of street, but here you've got good coaching, good
weather, good everything,'' said the freckle-faced Bovina, a
6-foot-2-inch power hitter who likens her style to Monica Seles and
Venus Williams, and who won her professional debut recently in a
satellite event in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina once took 90-minute subway rides to practice in Moscow
but now lives in a brand-new apartment a stone's throw from the
Bollettieri complex. ``You have everything here. When I saw this
place, I wanted to stay,'' said Bovina, who arrived with a single
suitcase, intending only to play the Eddie Herr junior event in
December. She never went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one way for my daughter to become the best, to
realize all of her potential,'' added Marguerite Bovina, who left
her husband and another daughter behind in Moscow to chaperon
Yelena's quest.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina and Sharipova are two of the latest influx of Russian
prodigies plucked up by talent scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Each is poised for a direct launch into professionalism, a place
where, in Sharipova's carefully enunciated vision, she said: ``If
you're good enough, you're going to make a lot of money. I won't
make a million dollars by staying back in Russia and being the No.
1 junior in the world. Because I came here to Florida, I gave
myself the ability to make it in the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharipova signed with the International Management Group when
she was 9 and already commands a ballerina's poise. She said she
planned to use her tennis earnings to ``buy a house in the
mountains and help all my grandparents, because life is hard for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bovina, who was discovered in Moscow three years ago by scouts
for IMG, which owns the Bollettieri complex in Bradenton, got to
the pro circuit sooner than Sharipova. ``In Russia I was always the
best for my age; now I get to prove I can be the best in the
world,'' said Bovina, who insists she has selected her own destiny
and expresses gratitude to her parents for helping her pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   Bovina first gripped a racquet at 4 in Morocco, where her father
had a stint with the consulate; back in Moscow, she played and won
her first tournament at 8. She and her family were hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sneaker companies are in a retrenchment mode and the
popularity meter does not shine as brightly on tennis as it once
did, business is booming at the tennis academies that dot south
Florida. While the mission of the camps is to turn out graduates
with college scholarships, what makes them famous is the superstars
they spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bovina and Sharipova, nearly everybody is in a hurry _ with
a clear conscience. All the parents say they have nothing but the
maximization of the child's talent in mind, an assertion echoed by
the academies, with a caveat: ``The role of the parent in a
player's career is huge, and there's often a fine line between
coach and parent, but we're getting better at dealing with it,''
said Ted Meekma, the head of I.M.G.'s academies division. ``We're
trying to educate them that the best role of the parent is usually
just that, to be a parent, not the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ross of Advantage International, who represents Australia's
17-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, said: ``As managers, it's our job to
exploit and extract the very best opportunities for our clients,
but for the players themselves, and their families, it can't be all
about the money. At least, it shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, parents like Hewitt's, who waited for a nod from John
Newcombe and Tony Roche, the sages of Australian tennis, before
letting their son turn professional at 16, appear more restrained
than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the carrot and the stick, and it's created a
monster,'' said Mike DePalmer Sr., a former coach at the University
of Tennessee and a longtime associate of Nick Bollettieri, the
mentor who developed Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Anna
Kournikova. ``The downside to the equation is the pressures on some
kids; the upside is that kids who graduated from this place
received $2.2 million in college scholarships last year alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But those were ``normal'' teen-agers with no chance of making a
splash in the pros. The prodigies, according to IMG's Gavin Forbes,
are not normal. ``They're like your little Mozarts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents set by 17-year-old Martina Hingis' No. 1 ranking
and megamillions, 16-year-old Anna Kournikova's multimillion-dollar
clothing contracts even before she has won a tournament and the
dual celebrity of the teen-aged Williams sisters despite bypassing
the traditional junior development route have had a galvanizing
impact. If you're extraordinary, you're marketable. Now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Bovina already has a Nike contract and a clear-cut goal. ``I
want to be No. 1,'' she said in succinct English as her mother
beamed. ``Then I want to buy a house and 10 horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollettieri's blueprint for Bovina includes a slew of $10,000
Challenger events and a summer of World Team Tennis. ``She's got a
lot working for her if she can come through on the playing end:
she's tall, blonde, pretty, friendly, a natural for television,''
he said. ``But I don't know what will happen if we don't have quick
results. I need two more years, but I'm not sure they think that
way. I think she overworks, but when we talk about cutting back her
court time, the mother, who happens to be a lovely person, starts
to cry. So there's pressure coming from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of teen professionals is more common, but not
limited to the women's side: Belgium's 17-year-old Xavier Malisse
and Australia's Hewitt made their mark on the men's circuit in a
matter of weeks. Malisse came within 2 points of upsetting a fellow
high school dropout, top-ranked Pete Sampras, last February in his
professional debut in Philadelphia, and Hewitt made history at 16
by defeating Agassi en route to his first career title at Auckland,
New Zealand, in January. Now the 17-year-old generating the most
fuss, along with a feeding frenzy of agents eager to represent him,
is southern California's Taylor Dent, the son of Phil Dent, a
former Australian touring pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early for a guy these days,'' said Jose Lambert, who
coaches Malisse at Bollettieri's, ``and I would never tell a
17-year-old boy he better be ready to hang with the consummate
pros. But Xavier's got the God-gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got me a winner and a character,'' Bollettieri said
proudly about Malisse. ``He's a magician, moves like lightning, and
oh boy, the mark he can make if he stays halfway sane when the
money starts rolling in. He's my breakthrough player for late
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Maria Sharipova Bollettieri's player for 2002,
barring a revision of a rule that keeps her off the women's pro
tour until she's 15. ``I keep telling the dad, what's the rush,
we've got an age rule here,'' Bollettieri said. ``The girl knows
how to win, and all the fundamentals are there, but I can't send
her out when she's 13, even if she's ready. And I can't switch her
to a lefty just because he says it's in the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Uri Sharipova, who worked the mines in Siberia to pay for
his daughter's passage to the United States four years ago, a
passage that separated Maria from her mother in Sochi for two
years, remains impatiently optimistic. As he observed from
courtside during one of Maria's morning practice sessions at the
Bollettieri academy: ``This place is Mecca for the dreams, isn't
it? So maybe the rule will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Macci, whose academy is based in Fort Lauderdale, says the
new tennis parents are well-informed, hypercritical and demanding.
``With the parents,'' he said, ``no matter what you do, it's never
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Macci estimates the total yearly costs of top-caliber full-time
private training can hit $100,000. No wonder the parents, whether
they are paying now or paying back later (an arrangement Macci
often employs), can get overwrought about their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bollettieri and Macci sent home an 8-year-old candidate
from England. Though Macci now coaches 13-year-old Todd Reid, the
Australian prodigy who arrived at Bollettieri's last fall with his
own agent and sponsorship portfolio, he admits that ``they put the
cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can know how a 13-year-old boy will turn out,'' Macci
said. ``I even had some parents bring in a 5-year-old for me to
look at, and what I said was, `This is insane.'''
</P>
<P>
   But signing 11-year-old girls like Katia Afinogenov, a Russian
prospect whose mother was a world-class runner at 800 meters and
whose brother has been drafted by the National Hockey League's
Buffalo Sabres, to a 10-year contract is, according to Macci, a
sane maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer Capriati was 10 when she came here, and Venus and
Serena Williams were 10 and 11,'' Macci said. ``When you know
you've got a can't-miss on your hands, especially with the girls,
this is when to get serious.''

<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ A day after Orangemen in their
bowler hats staged their jaunty annual parades throughout Northern
Ireland, a procession with an anguished pace followed three small
coffins up a hillside road Tuesday to a country churchyard here.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the white coffins, with polished brass nameplates on top,
were the bodies of Richard Quinn, 11, and his brothers Mark, 10,
and Jason, 9. They were burned to death in their beds in the early
hours of Sunday morning by a firebomb thrown in the ground-floor
window of their two-story row house in nearby Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few Catholics in a predominantly Protestant housing
project, the boys were the latest victims of this province's
sectarian violence, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,200
people. Two men have been arrested, and one of them is suspected of
links to a fringe Protestant paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news of the deaths of these three boys has touched the
hearts of people across the continents,'' the Rev. Peter Forde told
the mourners, who thronged every aisle and standing area of the
Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick. A loudspeaker brought the
Requiem Mass to people outside who could not fit in. The church,
itself a target of arsonists in past years, has stained-glass rose
windows that are fortified with metal grills.
</P>
<P>
   The sorrowful silence was broken only by sobs from friends and
family members who stared at the boys' coffins in pain and
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn, 29, the boys' mother, sat expressionless in the
first pew, comforted by her remaining son, Lee, 12. He survived
because he was staying that night at the house of his grandmother,
Irene Quinn, in Rasharkin.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were carried into the nave as the steeple bell
tolled dirgeful single notes. People throughout the church pressed
handkerchiefs to their faces, and children clutched their parents.
The coffin bearers, teen-agers and young men, shook with grief, and
substitutes rushed to shoulder their burden.
</P>
<P>
   The most distraught of them, a man with tattoos and facial
jewelry named John Dillon, 28, who lives in England, is the father
of at least one of the boys, all of whom had taken their mother's
name. He was left to mourn alone, at times taking up the front line
of pallbearers and tearfully caressing the coffins. References to
remembrances for special prayers during the services avoided
mentioning the name of any father, talking instead of ``Chrissie,
Lee and the extended family.''
</P>
<P>
   The scripture readings spoke of resurrection. An achingly sweet
poem composed by two teen-agers from the housing project where the
dead boys lived asked: ``Why would someone do this? is the question
on our lips. Who would have so much evil at their fingertips?''
</P>
<P>
   Forde invited Presbyterian and Methodist ministers to help him
lead the service. ``One could even say that we are all united by
this horrible event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Patrick Walsh, of the diocese of Down and Connor, said he
had spent the past week visiting parishes ``where people have been
living under a constant cloud of fear, anxiety and tension _ so
many intimidated, so many homes attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to disputes over Protestant marches, disputes
that have provoked arson attacks on Catholic churches and homes,
and letters with bullets and threatening notes sent to Catholics
living in Protestant areas. The mob violence culminated in the
killings of the boys on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airwaves, the printed page, have been saturated with
noises _ strident, harsh, discordant noises _ carrying words of
hatred, of incitement or recrimination, words not found in the
vocabulary of Christianity,'' Walsh said. Leaving no doubt that he
saw linkage between defiant protests and violent acts, he said,
``The weapons of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of
murderous destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the Protestant Orange Order and government
security forces at Drumcree, outside Portadown, is in its 10th day.
The number of protesters and rioters has been greatly reduced, but
the Orange leaders say they are determined to carry on despite
calls from Protestant clerics and politicians to withdraw out of
respect for the boys.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At issue is the right of the Portadown Orange Lodge members to
return from Drumcree parish to their downtown headquarters along a
road that goes through a neighborhood of Catholic housing projects.
The government's Parades Commission ordered them to return by
another route but they refused. The Orangemen have been camped at
the site since July 5, when they encountered the barricades and
troops placed in their way.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night the Rev. Ian Paisley, hard-line leader of the
Protestant cause, turned aside suggestions from Ronnie Flanagan,
commissioner of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, from David Trimble,
the new first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and from
others that the protest contributed to mob violence that had ended
in the killing of the Quinn boys.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at Drumcree lighted by bonfires, Paisley urged the
demonstrators to maintain their stand and said politicians seeking
an end to the protest were ``dancing on these young fellows'
graves.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Irish Republican Army had committed ``much
worse crimes'' against Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Orange Order's own religious leaders stepped up the
pressure on the protesters to end their standoff at Drumcree, which
has been a flash point of violence for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Backing the calls to leave the scene, the clerics said, ``We
place on record our utter revulsion at the murder of the three
little boys in Ballymoney and extend our sincere sympathy to the
parents and to all the bereaved family.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, from the Representative Group of Orange Order
Chaplains, continued: ``We also express to the Roman Catholic
community in Northern Ireland our deep sorrow that so many of them
have been intimidated out of their homes and that several of their
churches have been burned. Our bitter shame at all this, allegedly
carried out in the name of Protestantism, is not in any way
lessened by the fact that many of our own people are the victims of
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's service at the Church of Our Lady ended with a moving
antiphon. From the altar Forde said, ``Now in peace let us take our
little boys to their final rest in Rasharkin,'' and as the coffins
filed back down the center aisle, a soprano in the choir loft sang,
``Suffer Little Children to Come Unto Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were lifted into a single hearse and taken seven
miles to a street corner 100 yards down the hill from the cemetery,
and the pallbearers took up their doleful duty for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   With a final prayer, the white coffins were lowered into a
single large fresh grave, and hundreds of bouquets were placed on
top. Three floral tributes spelled out the boys' nicknames, Tavish,
Marky and Ace.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Miss Quinn had asked that the boys be buried
here so that she would never have to return to Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Carnany Estate, where the Quinns lived in
Ballymoney, Samuel Montgomery, 8, pedaled his bicycle up to a
visitor at the soot-blackened facade of the grey stucco home where
the boys died. They had been his friends, he said, and the bike
still leaning against the fence belonged to ``the wee one.''
</P>
<P>
   He peered through the boarded-up window and asked if they were
still inside. Told no, he paused. Then he brightened. ``They're
going to heaven today, right?''

AMERICA WEST AIRLINE FINED $2.5 MILLION FOR VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ohio, Nev.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday
evening it was fining America West at least $2.5 million, and
possibly $5 million, for violations of maintenance and operations
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which the airline has agreed to pay, would be the
largest ever paid by an air carrier, eclipsing the $2 million the
agency fined Delta Air Lines in November 1992. In 1986, the agency
said it was fining Eastern Air Lines $9.5 million, but only $1
million was collected.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday evening, the company said it had reached
an agreement with the FAA ``to move forward in a spirit of
partnership, to avoid the cost of protracted litigation and focus
resources on improving operations and customer service.'' It did
not admit to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West Airlines has one of the top safety records in the
industry,'' said president and chief executive Richard Goodmanson
in the statement. ``We take our responsibility to the flying public
and the FAA very seriously and we are pleased by the FAA's
willingness to work with the company. The safety of our passengers
was never affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Stuckey, the acting deputy director of flight standards
for the FAA, said the Phoenix-based airline had permitted 41,000
flights of its Airbus A-320 wide-body jets without performing
periodic inspections for cracks of the fuselage skin around the
cargo and crew doors.
</P>
<P>
   It also flew Boeing 737s and 757s without proper installation of
webbing meant to prevent cargo from shifting in flight, the FAA
said. At another airline, Fineair, a cargo jet crashed on take-off
in Miami last year because of shifting cargo.
</P>
<P>
   America West was also faulted for flying a Boeing 757 that had
problems with its elevator system, which controls the plane's
attitude, nose up or nose down. It either flew with an elevator
unit that was inoperable or the device that monitors that function
was inoperable, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the fines, the FAA deemed the airline safe to fly
now. ``All the operational and airworthiness items have been
corrected,'' said Stuckey, in a telephone conference call Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stuckey said that the airline would pay $2.5 million now. The
other $2.5 million is due in 12 months, unless the airline complies
with an agreement to improve its operations. The agreement calls
for teams that include agency personnel to broadly review the
airline's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that it had been inspecting the doors on its
Airbuses visually, but the airline did not follow the
manufacturer's recommendation in 1994 to switch to monitoring the
doors by using instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that Airbus had later changed its
recommendation to postpone instrument inspections ``until 16,000
takeoffs and landings, a milestone that none of America West's
Airbus aircraft have reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuckey of the FAA said the airline's inattention to those
inspections was ``inadvertent, they missed it, and wasn't included
in their program until we found it in December.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline also failed to supervise contractors performing
maintenance on the planes, the agency said. Airlines are
responsible for work done by sub-contractors, and the agency has
been concentrating on this area since the crash two years ago of a
Valujet DC-9 near Miami, which occurred in part because of
contractor errors.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA began bringing charges against America West last
December and some violations were as recent as May, Stuckey said.
The airline and the agency began negotiations in Phoenix on Monday,
he said, and finished today.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which says it is the ninth-largest passenger
carrier in the nation, reported strong first quarter earnings of
$25.1 million, up from $14 million in the first quarter of 1998.
Its revenue for the last 12 months was about $1.9 billion, with
earnings of $86 million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America West, with headquarters in Phoenix, also has hubs in Las
Vegas, Nev., and Columbus, Ohio. The airline has 11,000 employees
and 101 planes. With mostly short-haul routes, it flies nearly 600
flights a day, to 91 cities in this country and seven in Mexico and
Canada.

FANS TO BE SITTING PRETTY AT ROSE BOWL

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They remodeled his scoreboard and they built
his new video board. Now, Granddaddy has a new face.
</P>
<P>
   Individual, flip-up seats have replaced bleachers from goal line
to goal line at the 75-year-old Rose Bowl, the latest phase of the
venerable stadium's $22.5 million renovation. The end zones remain
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long project _ scheduled for completion before UCLA's
home opener on Sept. 12 _ has reduced capacity from 100,089 to
approximately 93,500 and forced the Bruins to revamp their seating
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great old stadium, but it's never been very
comfortable,'' Pacific-10 Conference assistant commissioner Jim
Muldoon said.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation project began in 1993, when the Rose Bowl
Operating Committee formed a wish list of 33 changes to carry the
stadium into the next millennium. A video board, advertising
panels, seats, dressing rooms and remodeled scoreboard topped the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping the changes would attract a Super Bowl and perhaps an NFL
team, the Pasadena City Council approved the remodeling and issued
a municipal bond. The seating phase alone cost $6 million,
according to Rose Bowl general manager Dave Jacobs. Several rows
for handicapped seating have also been added.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for reduced capacity, tickets to the Jan. 1 Rose
Bowl game have increased to $110 from $75. But the greatest impact
is on UCLA's 30,000 season-ticket holders, who this week will
receive a letter detailing the process and explaining why their
seats have been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people have been moved up or down two, three or
four rows,'' associate athletic director Rick Purdy said. ``We
thought two things were important: to move people up or down
instead of left or right, and also to move everyone. We thought it
was more fair to move everyone a little than move some people
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA initially notified season-ticket holders in February. But
when the new seats arrived this spring, they were too small. A new,
wider batch was ordered, further reducing capacity and forcing UCLA
to revise its seating plan a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy is bracing for complaints once tickets are mailed next
month _ ``I'm sure it'll be frustrating for some people'' _ but he
hopes the arm rests, improved back support, expanded leg room and
flip-up bottoms make the changes worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best news for everybody (is the flip-up bottoms),'' he
said. ``Now you don't have to go through contortions to let
somebody by.''
</P>
<P>
   With the City Council's blessing, the Rose Bowl Operating
Committee sent photos and information packets to the NFL office and
team owners. Although the Super Bowl is booked through 2003 _
Miami, Atlanta, Tampa, San Diego/New Orleans, and San Francisco are
the upcoming hosts _ the changes match league preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we like stadiums with seats as opposed to
bleachers. That's more attractive,'' said Greg Aiello, NFL vice
president for public relations. ``Traditionally, we like to play
Super Bowls in league cities, but that's not etched in concrete. We
won't rule it out, but there isn't a Super Bowl available for a few
years down the road. Hopefully, by then there will be an NFL team
in L.A.''

<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ For more than 25 years, computer scientists
have been working to develop a technology known as distributed
computing that would put the processing power of a supercomputer in
the hands of average users.
</P>
<P>
   For scientists and others who need enormous computing power,
distributed computing holds out the promise of increasing the power
of a standard laptop exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   But for the average consumer, it will eventually produce smart
gadgets such as cars that avoid traffic jams and phones that know
not just the telephone number of every listed person in the United
States but their addresses, ZIP codes and the names of their family
members.
</P>
<P>
   In short, distributed computing promises to endow consumer
appliances _ from telephones, televisions and stereos to kitchen
appliances and cars _ with an infusion of borrowed intelligence by
connecting them, with or without wires, to a computer network.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sun Microsystems will unveil the first consumer
version of this technology, a product called Jini, which uses Sun's
Java programming language to harness the power of potentially
millions of computers, ranging from giant mainframes to tiny
palm-sized devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have all the ingredients to build a distributed
computing fabric which approaches science fiction,'' said David
Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist who
pioneered distributed computing in 1971. ``You will be able to sit
with your laptop, and it will be able to reach out across the
network. And for the moments you need the power, it will become the
largest supercomputer in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also shift the balance of power in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when worried governments on three continents are
struggling to restrain Microsoft Corp.'s iron grip on computing and
its ambitions on the Internet, distributed computing could level
the playing field by shifting growth in high-technology industries
to the millions of consumer appliances that increasingly contain
powerful embedded processors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft itself is known to be working on a system
similar to Jini, known as Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun, among Microsoft's fiercest competitors, has an early
advantage in this race because of the nature of its Java
programming language, which is designed to move chunks of computer
code from machine to machine. Jini uses this ability in ways that
allow computers and other devices to cooperate, sometimes by
sharing instructions or information, sometimes by actually dividing
a program into parts and spreading the computation work across
several computers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Java has already achieved widespread distribution _
thanks, in part, to Microsoft, which ships it with its Internet
Explorer browser for navigating the World Wide Web and with Windows
98. Although Sun is suing Microsoft for making unauthorized changes
to Java, the Microsoft version of the language will support Jini.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to Sun's plans, over the next 18 months, a
number of companies that make computer hardware and consumer
gadgets will begin incorporating Jini, allowing each of these
devices to talk with each other and to share processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first of these will be Quantum Corp., a disk-drive
maker based in Milpitas, Calif., that intends to commercialize the
Jini technology to make drives that have built-in office network
connections. Today, such connections are controlled by the
operating system and are difficult to configure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely going to be a dramatic leap in ease of
use,'' said Paul Borrill, vice president and chief architect at
Quantum.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, advocates of distributed computing
predict, today's desktop computer will evolve from a
self-sufficient machine that must hold all the memory, storage and
processing power it needs for any job into a social machine that
will automatically interact not only with other computers but also
with myriad consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, potentially, has the most to lose from such a change
since it would make the operating system incidental to the power
and control wielded by a networked computer in a distributed
system. For that reason, Microsoft would hold no obvious advantage
over competitors in marketing a distributed computing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its competitors and computer scientists, who view
distributed computing as the antithesis of an operating system,
Microsoft prefers to think of it as the operating system of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper on its Millennium product, a Microsoft
research team wrote: ``We argue that advances in hardware and
networking technology enable a new kind of operating system to
support tomorrow's applications. Such an operating system would
raise the level of abstraction for developers and users, so that
individual computers, file systems and networks become unimportant
to most computations in the same way that processor registers, disk
sectors, and physical pages are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Processor registers, disk sectors and physical pages are all
elements of hardware that today are controlled by an operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch to all of this: The technology at the heart
of this evolution is the network, and all the assumptions about the
future of distributed computing are based on the belief that
computer networks will be ubiquitous _ and, in most cases,
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   On a large scale, such networks are now being deployed by
cellular telephone companies and by computer industry groups
working on new standards for wireless office networks. Once these
technologies are available to consumers, beginning later this year,
the stage will be set for a fundamental change in personal
computing.
</P>
<P>
   It is the network, which can range in size from a group of
linked household devices to the global Internet, that is the
foundation upon which the new distributed computing will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of distributed computing is the ability to divide a
large set of computer instructions into multiple small parts, each
of which is processed by a different machine within a network of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, each generation of computers _ mainframes,
minicomputers and personal computers _ has been built on a
foundation of centralized control wielded by an operating system, a
single, monolithic program that performs the combined role of a
traffic cop, butler and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent proliferation of high-speed and wireless networks
and the melding of computing and telecommunications technologies
driven by the Internet has encouraged developers to proceed on the
assumption that every home, car and other personal environment will
eventually be part of _ and empowered by _ a universal network. For
that reason, it is sometimes known as ``ubiquitous computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed computing foresees a world in which millions of
small programs, called objects, seamlessly flit back and forth
between tens of thousands of devices that have been enabled to
recognize and be recognized by the network.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a world of cars equipped with distributed
computing devices linked by a wireless network, each car would be
delivering and receiving information from every other car, or to
and from aggregated traffic reports, along the route being driven.
This kind of networking could significantly reduce traffic
congestion by alerting drivers to accidents, congestion and weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, the traditional operating system, say advocates
of distributed computing, becomes an ungainly encumbrance, akin to
asking a baton-wielding maestro to conduct a jam session of jazz
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in such a distributed world, the boundary lines
between individual computers blur as thousands or even millions of
computers are harnessed to particular tasks as exotic as predicting
the weather or as mundane as controlling the heating and lighting
in a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is very clear,'' said William Joy, a co-founder of
Sun Microsystems and the chief designer of Jini. ``We are moving
toward a world in which it will be possible to move software codes
that act as our personal agents between many different computers in
a global network.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of distributed computing envision a computerized world
in which each person will be surrounded by a web of hundreds of
small computers embedded in everything from smart cameras, to
pagers, to cell phones and hand-held computers that will exchange
messages and data without the intervention of a centralized
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Jini is scheduled to be publicly described for the first
time on Wednesday on Sun's Web site. It will be marketed in
September under the name Java Tone, an analogy to the ubiquitous
nature of the telephone dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Sun says it is now working with more than 30 companies, ranging
from Federal Express Corp. to the giant software maker Computer
Associates, to develop Java Tone products.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Joy, who co-founded Sun after dropping out
of graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, has
holed up in a small laboratory in the mountains of Colorado where
he has been attempting to reinvent modern computing by exploiting
the concepts of distributed computing.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Joy's small group of researchers decided to put
into effect the ideas of David Gelernter, a computer scientist and
author from Yale University who invented a computing language
called Linda that was intended to enable the writing of programs
that could utilize the power of many computers simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Gelernter's original vision was a vast distributed computer to
simulate much of the surrounding social and physical world. He
called his vision ``Mirror Worlds'' and described it in a 1992 book
by that name (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``The guts of an operating system have always been an ensemble
of small programs, but that aspect has always been suppressed in
favor of the monolithic desktop,'' Gelernter said. ``Sun is
breaking the news to the user that an ensemble is a simple and
natural and straightforward computing model.'' &QL;

<P>
   In a sudden turn of events Tuesday night, Mike Richter, the
unrestricted free-agent goaltender, reached agreement with the
Rangers on a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the team for whom he has played the last nine
seasons, Richter got a new contract from the Rangers after it
seemed that the team might sign Curtis Joseph, another prominent
free-agent goalie who had played for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's deal will average between $5.4 million and $5.5
million per season. It is considerably more than the $3.9 million
the goalie made last season. &QL;

POLICE TRY TO LINK MISSING WOMAN TO SUSPECTS' CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still no closer to finding Irene Silverman, the
wealthy widow who vanished under suspicious circumstances 10 days
ago, city detectives Tuesday focused on clues that might place her
in the car of the two suspects in her disappearance, examining
minute samples of hair and saliva recovered from the back seat to
determine whether they match hers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman, 82, vanished on July 5, and detectives have been
investigating a former tenant, Kenneth Kimes, 23, and his mother,
Sante Kimes, 63, who rented a $6,000-a-month suite in her East 65th
Street town house. The Kimeses were arrested the same day on an
unrelated charge of passing a bad check in Utah in April, and were
carrying Mrs. Silverman's passport and other identification when
federal agents took them into custody, authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives are also reviewing eight microcassette tapes of
telephone conversations made by the Kimeses at Mrs. Silverman's
home earlier this month, said an investigator who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. In one of the conversations, a woman
claiming to be the manager of a Las Vegas casino told Mrs.
Silverman that she had won a free vacation. The caller, who
investigators believe was Mrs. Kimes, then tried unsuccessfully to
get Mrs. Silverman to give out her Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were found in the back seat of the Kimeses' car, along
with a 9-millimeter automatic pistol, 10 wigs, business documents
and a box of ammunition for a .22-caliber pistol. Detectives said
the Kimeses had apparently emptied their trunk sometime before they
were captured, moving even the spare tire and jack into the back
seat with the duffel bag and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a search warrant prepared by the Manhattan district
attorney's office, investigators seized physical evidence from the
Kimeses' car, including blood from a small stain on the seat belt,
hair found inside a large black duffel bag and a pillow with a
saliva stain.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodstain is of no value as evidence against the Kimeses,
said a second detective who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
because a test by the Medical Examiner's office determined that the
blood came from a man. Another spot of blood found outside Mrs.
Silverman's home is also being tested, but investigators said it
may be too small and tainted by exposure to the elements to yield
any conclusive results.
</P>
<P>
   But police last week removed a hairbrush and a toothbrush from
Mrs. Silverman's home and are waiting for results from the crime
lab to learn whether hair and saliva from her home matched the
evidence taken from the Kimeses' car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have a body yet, but if there is evidence to put
Mrs. Silverman in that car, at least we have a starting point to a
criminal case,'' said the first investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Las Vegas, California, and the Bahamas also want to
question the Kimeses about questionable business deals, the murder
of their former business partner in Los Angeles, and the
disappearance of an auditor examining their bank accounts in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police say the Kimeses are suspects in the murder of
the businessman, David Kazdin. Los Angeles detectives returned to
California on Monday with palm prints from both suspects and are
awaiting results of tests to determine whether they match a partial
print found on the garbage bin where Kazdin's body was discovered
March 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, who are being held on Rikers Island, have refused
to be interviewed by police, but their lawyers deny that the
Kimeses were involved in Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, and on
Monday suggested that members of her housekeeping staff might have
harmed her because of her abrasive manner.
</P>
<P>
   A former employee of the Kimeses who later became an FBI
informer told detectives that Mrs. Kimes asked him to fly to New
York because she wanted him to manage a new mansion she had
obtained from an unnamed former ballerina, the first investigator
said. Mrs. Silverman once danced with the corps de ballet at Radio
City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police also recovered two medical syringes and a vial of a
sedative from the back seat. Investigators said it was unlikely
that they were used recently because the syringes were still in
their sealed wrappers and the medicine was so old that it contained
mold and had probably lost its potency.

COURT ACTION MOVES NYC SEX ZONING LAW CLOSER TO IMPLEMENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's sex shops and their customers have lost
yet another round in their court fight to block tough zoning laws
intended to restrict the adult-entertainment industry, and their
legal remedies have essentially been reduced to one: an appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes right in getting the Supreme Court to look
at the case, then the city won't be able to enforce the law at
least until next year,'' said Beth Haroules, a lawyer for the New
York Civil Liberties Union. ``It's also possible that it's the end
of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Their plight elicited little sympathy from City Hall. When city
officials learned Tuesday that a federal appeals court had decided
to end its involvement in the case, they immediately began dusting
off their plans to begin enforcing the new laws, as early as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready,'' said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the recent decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals provided only punctuation to a previous ruling by the
court. Last month a three-judge panel for the court upheld the
zoning law, which would ban strip clubs and X-rated book and video
shops from operating within 500 feet of residential areas, schools,
day care centers, houses of worship or one another. It also
declined to examine the free speech implications of the law, saying
that New York's highest court had already done so.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the owners and customers of the sex shops quickly
asked for a special hearing before the full court, even though such
requests are rarely granted. Last Thursday, the court denied the
request filed on behalf of customers by the New York Civil
Liberties Union. Then on Monday, the court denied a similar plea
from the sex shop's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haroules said that the federal appeals court's decision was
disheartening, yet also expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already looked at the zoning ordinance a couple of
times,'' she said. ``So it's not unexpected. But it is another
procedural step that has to be taken before you can go to the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the ruling allowed Giuliani to continue his public
count of judges _ now up to 23 _ who have upheld the city's right
to enforce the zoning laws. He added that city inspectors ``are
ready to begin enforcement on this important `quality of life'
initiative as soon as the last legal impediments are removed from
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent budget fight that has occupied city government,
the court ruling also provided a rare moment in which the City
Council and the mayor's office find themselves in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is a great boost for the neighborhoods throughout
our city that have suffered from the harmful proliferation of adult
entertainment uses,'' said Councilman Walter McCaffrey, a Democrat
from Queens who played an early role in drafting legislation that
targeted sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the industry said they had not abandoned hope
that the Supreme Court would recognize the city's zoning law as
overly aggressive and an infringement on the rights of those who
prefer to have X-rated stores in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107 adult-entertainment
businesses, did not respond to several messages left at his office
Tuesday. But those close to the case say that Fahringer may ask the
Court of Appeals to continue preventing the city from enforcing the
law while he pursues an appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawyers for the sex-shop industry may also ask Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice responsible for the New
York region, for a similar stay as part of their appeal to the
country's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would affect 146 of the city's 164
adult-entertainment businesses. City officials say that they hope
rigorous enforcement will persuade most owners to go out of
business. But some business owners vow to adapt: one strip club
owner has said his dancers will wear bikinis, while an adult-video
store owner has begun to diversify his stock with old comedies and
children's movies. &QL;

UA DROPS BROOM BECAUSE OF GRADES

<P>
   PHOENIX - Dion Broom's basketball scholarship at Arizona will
not be renewed for 1998-99 by Coach Lute Olson, leaving the former
Mesa Westwood High star in limbo for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Broom, a power forward, lost his scholarship because he did not
meet team academic requirements, a UA spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Olson could not be reached for comment. Broom hung up the
telephone when contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olson already has begun stocking up for 1999. On
Tuesday, UA received an oral commitment from point guard Jason
Gardner, one of the most sought-after high school players in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (5 feet 11, 170 pounds), who will be a senior at
Indianapolis North Central High School, was a teammate of UA
freshman Michael Wright on the USA's gold-medal winner in the
Junior World Championships last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I decided it would be best to commit now so I
can concentrate on school and basketball,'' Gardner said. ``I just
did not want to be bothered by all the recruiting stuff over the
next couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's basketball instincts and the manner in which he runs a
team have been compared with former UA All-America point guard Mike
Bibby, who led the Wildcats to their first NCAA title as a freshman
and was the second player chosen in last month's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be in the same sentence with Mike Bibby,''
Gardner said. ``It will be a challenge to uphold the level of
excellence he established at UA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner likely will succeed Jason Terry as the Wildcats point
guard in 1999-2000. Terry will be a senior this season. There are
no other true point guards currently in the program. Oral
commitments are non-binding. High school seniors may sign binding
letters of intent from Nov. 11-17.
</P>
<P>
   The Broom decision helps UA clear up a scholarship logjam
created by the signing of six freshman recruits and the transfer of
7-foot-1 Loren Woods of Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   To get down to the NCAA limit of 13 scholarships, UA also did
not renew the scholarship of guard Josh Pastner, a former walk-on
who has served as the Wildcats' unofficial shooting coach the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Pastner agreed last year to give up his scholarship if Olson
needed it. He is scheduled to graduate in December and will have to
pay tuition only for one semester.
</P>
<P>
   Pastner is expected to remain on the team. He is listed on the
UA preseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   Broom's future is less certain. His name is not on the roster.
He has not been dismissed from the university, and he is eligible
to remain in classes at UA if he pays his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Broom would have to sit out a year if he transfers to another
NCAA four-year institution. He would be eligible to play this year
at a junior college.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a series of fateful twists the past two
years for Broom.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the state's bright prospects during his junior
year at Westwood. Then, one week after signing his letter of intent
to UA in November 1996, the 6-foot-8, 265-pound Broom suffered a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The remainder of
his senior season was lost.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled to catch up in the classroom after undergoing
surgery and finished his high school career with a 2.44 grade-point
average _ just missing the 2.5 he needed to qualify for freshman
athletic eligibility at UA.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Broom attended Chandler-Gilbert Community College last
fall, where he earned the necessary grades and made a qualifying
score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to become eligible at UA for
the second semester.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to the Tucson campus in December, but Olson was
not satisfied with Broom's overall conditioning nor the
rehabilitation on Broom's repaired knee. He practiced with the
Wildcats but did not appear in games. &QL;

FUSION-RESEARCH EFFORT DRAWS FIRE

 (ATTN: Md., Calif., N.J.)  (lb)

<P>
   A multibillion-dollar federal effort to create tiny blasts of
pure fusion energy like that of a hydrogen bomb violates the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and shows that the United States is
pursuing a double standard on the control of nuclear weapons, a new
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published by an American scientific group, is the
first to make that specific accusation but echoes growing criticism
that the United States is heading down a dangerous nuclear road.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, critics say, is at risk of becoming a nuclear
hypocrite, talking eloquently of disarmament and the virtues of a
comprehensive ban on nuclear testing while quietly investing
billions of dollars in advanced technology that can perfect new
kinds of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is by the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research, of Takoma Park, Md., a respected scientific group founded
in 1987 that has won praise from private experts for its critiques
of the federal nuclear establishment. Its analyses have prevailed
in lawsuits against the Energy Department, mostly involving
contaminated nuclear-weapons plants, and led to out-of-court
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In its new, 92-page report, to be issued Wednesday, the group
warns that fusion research like that now under way by the
government could be used to develop a new generation of hydrogen
bombs and that it is thus illegal under the test ban. Some 150
countries, including the United States, are signers of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which runs the research program, strongly
denies the institute's accusation. The department said Tuesday that
its fusion research would produce no new weapons and instead was
meant to help keep the nation's existing nuclear stockpile in good
working order, as well as to help harness nuclear fusion for
peaceful energy production.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ray Kidder, a former nuclear-bomb designer at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, who reviewed the institute's report
for technical accuracy, praised the group's work as rigorous and
thorough, and said the issue of a possible treaty violation was
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This question needs to be taken seriously and discussed in an
open forum, and some decisions made about it,'' Kidder said in an
interview Tuesday. He added that he and two colleagues had prepared
a proposal for limiting pure-fusion research and that the proposal
would appear in a coming issue of Physics Today, a professional
journal.
</P>
<P>
   One of his colleagues, Dr. Frank von Hipple, is a former adviser
to the Clinton White House who now works at Princeton University.
He has warned that pure-fusion research could result in devices
``compact enough to be used as weapons,'' a prospect taken
increasingly seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Bethe, a Nobel laureate who was a main architect of the
first atomic bomb, a half-century ago, wrote President Clinton last
year to warn of the dangers of ``pure-fusion weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute's criticism focuses on a sprawling federal program
that, in all, involves a dozen or so new major scientific projects
at the nation's weapons laboratories and will cost roughly $4.5
billion a year for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible aim of that program is to shift national efforts
away from developing nuclear arms and toward maintaining stockpiles
in good condition, using computer simulations and a battery of
other advanced techniques to ensure the arsenal's potency.
</P>
<P>
   But the institute says in its report that the fusion-research
aspects of the colossal effort are so ambitious that they violate
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, long a holy grail of arms
controllers. The Clinton administration promoted the treaty and
signed it in 1996. Its aim is to end all nuclear blasts as a way to
stop nuclear innovation, which customarily must be tested
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the institute criticizes a huge laser complex now
under construction in Livermore, Calif., known as the National
Ignition Facility. The $2.2 billion complex, about the size of the
Rose Bowl, is to be completed in 2002, the world's first machine to
generate tiny thermonuclear explosions, igniting hydrogen without
the usual atomic match.
</P>
<P>
   The laser would fire a titanic bolt of energy onto a tiny pellet
of hydrogen fuel, heating it to a higher temperature than the
surface of the sun and causing hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium
in a burst of pure fusion energy. Weapons scientists have also been
pursuing a number of smaller projects that strive to miniaturize
the machinery needed for such feats.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons scientists and the Energy Department are lobbying to
continue such work, saying it is permitted under the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But critics fear that proposed ignition systems are getting
quite small, raising the prospect of pure-hydrogen bombs that could
be easily transported to distant targets.
</P>
<P>
   Arms controllers worry that the fuel for hydrogen fusion is
relatively easy to obtain and that a pure-hydrogen bomb, if
perfected, could in theory be cheap to build. The main fuel for
nuclear fusion is deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that is
ubiquitous in sea water. By contrast, atomic bombs are fueled by
uranium and plutonium, which are scarce and costly to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the fusion work's legality arise because the
test-ban treaty bars ``any nuclear weapon test explosion or any
other nuclear explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the treaty, the nation's nuclear-weapons laboratories
and allies in Washington argue that the comprehensive test ban has
a loophole that allows pure-fusion research, including explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the institute, in its report, strongly disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no technical basis on which laboratory thermonuclear
explosions can be excluded from this ban,'' the report says, adding
that work to achieve that goal is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors are Arjun Makhijani and Hisham Zerriffi,
both physicists. Makhijani, the institute's president, holds a
Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is similar to the one before the hydrogen bomb,''
he said in an interview. ``Once pure-fusion weapons are
demonstrated, they will be very difficult to stop. So the time to
act is now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robin Staffin, who oversees fusion-energy research for the
Energy Department, dismissed such worries, saying international
opinion and prior arms-control agreements held that fusion
experiments were not ``nuclear explosions'' as defined by the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Staffin further disparaged the idea that any sort of pure-fusion
research could ever turn dangerous. ``All these methods strike out
on the criteria of being useful as a weapon,'' he said. ``We have
no fusion-weapon program.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to faulting the U.S. work, the institute's report
criticizes a large effort under way in France known as the Laser
Megajoule project, which also seeks to ignite fusion with powerful
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's report calls for a halt to the big French and
U.S. laser efforts, and for bans on certain types of smaller
research.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls on the next international test-ban conference to
consider formally and specifically outlawing such work. That
meeting may occur as soon as next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States adheres to its present path, Makhijani
said, it will only further alienate the developing world, which has
sometimes criticized the U.S. program of fusion research as
provocative and resents Washington's insistence that there be no
further members of the nuclear club. In May, India and Pakistan
stunned the world by conducting a series of underground nuclear
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason we're in this very messy situation in South
Asia is the double standard by which nuclear powers can go on
possessing nuclear weapons indefinitely but deny them to other
parties,'' Makhijani said. ``This technology provides one more
illustration of that double standard.''

POLICE UNION AGREES TO DROP 48-HOUR RULE ON INFRACTIONS BY
OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The union that represents police sergeants in New
York City reached a tentative agreement with the Giuliani
administration Tuesday on a contract that eliminates the right of
police officers to wait two full business days before having to
answer questions about possible misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeants Benevolent Association president Joe Toal said the
union's board voted Tuesday to send the contract to its delegates,
who in turn will decide whether to send it to the 4,500 members for
ratification. ``We're going to recommend that the contract be
ratified by our membership,'' Toal said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope to eliminate what is known as the 48-hour
rule in subsequent contracts with other police unions, including
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents the bulk
of the 40,000-member force.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has said that the rule, which has been a
part of police contracts since 1971, hampers its ability to
investigate infractions that would not be the subject of criminal
investigations, which could range from procedural errors to
brutality. And critics outside the department have said that the
rule contributes to a perception that police officers accused of
crimes are treated differently than civilians, largely because of
the clout their powerful police unions wield.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rule is rarely relevant in cases where police
officers face both criminal proceedings, which can result in jail
terms, and departmental proceedings, which can result in
suspensions or dismissals. In such cases, prosecutors usually ask
departmental investigators to delay questioning officers in order
to avoid compromising their testimony in a possible criminal trial,
and officers retain the same right as civilians not to incriminate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Reppetto, the president of the Citizens Crime
Commission of New York City, a private watchdog group and a member
of the Mayor's Task Force on Police-Community Relations, which has
voted to abolish the rule, said it was important to eliminate the
rule because it gives an impression that ``somehow police officers
can have more rights than anyone else in a criminal
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said
Tuesday night, ``The mayor has long held the belief that the rule
should not be in existence.'' The Police Department said it would
not comment on the rule or the tentative accord until the sergeants
had voted on the contract.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The PBA has staunchly resisted the city's efforts to eliminate
the rule. Tuesday, PBA spokesman Joe Mancini reiterated his union's
opposition. ``Eliminating the 48-hour rule would just be denying
cops who are the subject of internal investigations _ for violating
things in the patrol guide, for instance _ of their rights,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergeants Benevolent Association did not let the rule go
willingly. When the city announced six or seven months ago that it
did not consider the rule a mandatory subject for collective
bargaining, and thus was not going to negotiate on it, the
association filed an complaint with the city's Board of Collective
Bargaining, said James Hanley, the commissioner of the city's
Office of Labor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Toal said the association had argued that the rule should be a
subject for negotiation because it had been in its contracts for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 30, the board sided with the city, saying the rule
concerned a disciplinary issue and thus was not a mandatory subject
of negotiation. The ruling also covers the Lieutenants Benevolent
Association, which is now negotiating a contract with the city.
Hanley said the collective bargaining board is also considering
whether the rule should be considered a mandatory subject in
current negotiations with the detectives' and captains' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said he believed that the board would act similarly when
the patrolmen's contract expires in the year 2000. ``The PBA will
continue to enjoy this provision in their contracts,'' Hanley said,
``but when the contract expires, I'm sure we'll be focusing on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mancini predicted that the board's decision involving the
sergeants' and lieutenants' contracts would be challenged in court,
rendering it moot by the time his members negotiate their next
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But Toal said he did not think the sergeants' union would mount
a legal challenge to the board's decision. ``There's no place to
challenge it,'' he said. ``Take something like that to court and
you're never successful.''

LEIBERMAN-CLINE HAPPY ON THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was just for one season, and a short one at that.
More of a fling than a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings can hardly be the same as those sure to come should
Kevin Johnson show up post-lockout at America West Arena in, say, a
Lakers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something poignant about the return of Nancy
Lieberman-Cline to the court where her Hall of Fame playing career
ended 10{ months ago _ with one minute and no points in a 59-41
WNBA semifinal playoff loss to the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew for sure that was the end for the oldest player in
the first-year league, but reality eventually bites everyone. She
would not have returned to the Mercury as a 40-year-old player,
Cheryl Miller said. But Lieberman-Cline clung to the playing dream
right up to her decision in January to become coach-general manager
of the expansion Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miller, the Mercury coach-GM and fellow Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Famer, Lieberman-Cline is happy on the sideline,
which is where she'll be tonight at 7 for the rematch against the
Mercury. The teams played in Detroit a week ago, with Phoenix
winning on a buzzer beater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how I'd feel until I got out there, but I don't
miss playing,'' said Lieberman-Cline, whose job includes
front-office business duties that the Mercury delegates to its vice
president/operations Seth Sulka. ``I had to do one thing well and
use 100 percent of my time and energy to build this organization.
It's an awesome task.''
</P>
<P>
   One that, judging by the standings, she is doing well. At the
halfway point of the season, the Shock is just one game out of the
fourth and final playoff berth and 4{ games ahead of its expansion
counterpart Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit rebounds better than any team in the league and uses the
boards to trigger the kind of running game Lieberman-Cline
cherished as a player. The kind she thought she could still play
last season had she been given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obviously a little disappointed with how Cheryl dealt
with me as an athlete and a person,'' said Lieberman-Cline, who
averaged 11.2 minutes in 25 regular-season games. ``It surprised
me, her lack of sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the lines of communication would have been better.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller essentially had no choice but to select Lieberman-Cline
with the next-to-last pick of the elite draft in February 1997. The
other candidate was plodding 6-foot-8 center Haixia Zheng, who
would have had no chance in the Mercury's transition offense.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between what Lieberman-Cline thought she could
contribute and Miller's opinion grew with the achiness in the
backup's right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there as a player,'' said Miller, forced into early
retirement in 1987 because of bad knees. ``What you're physically
able to do is always invariably different than what your mind says
you can do. If you can accept that and can accept the role, it
makes things easier. But that's a hard place to get to in a short
amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said dealing with Lieberman-Cline became a distraction:
``It was hard on Nancy, it was hard on the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline insists she tried not to let her frustration
become a team cancer. ``There is no tougher role than being on the
bench,'' she said. ``It requires a multitude of personalities. If I
wasn't going to play more minutes, my job was to make Michele
Timms, Bridget Pettis and Umeki Webb better (in practice).''
</P>
<P>
   There was at least one shining moment. In her first game back
after spending three on the injured list, she helped rescue the
team from a tailspin that threatened the playoff berth. Her five
spectacular minutes in relief of a struggling Timms turned a
stretch game against Cleveland. ``Nancy was all-world,'' Timms
said. ``We owe her a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to June 17, 1998, and the hauntingly familiar
comments by this season's oldest player in the WNBA: ``I feel I can
help this team if I get the opportunity. I have a lot of pride as a
player. I can play any position in the game, and that includes the
bench. If they want me to play the bench, that's a position, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Woodard, an eventual Hall of Famer who turns 39 on Aug.
12, was speaking to the ``Detroit News'' about her lack of
early-season playing time with the Shock, which started 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline, who selected Woodard from Cleveland in the
expansion draft, sees appreciable differences between her
relationship with Woodard and hers with Miller. Or maybe it's just
being on the other side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have honor and respect for her contribution to the game,''
said Lieberman-Cline. ``When you honor and trust and respect
someone, you can deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline said she was brutally honest with Woodard, who
started all but one game for the Rockers in 1997. To survive
training camp, Woodard had to improve on a laundry list of items,
the new coach said. And if she did, would being last on an 11-woman
roster prove acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her the worst possible scenario, hoping she would make
it better,'' Lieberman-Cline said. ``She said, `Tell me what I need
to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard then did what was asked well enough to be promoted to
starting small forward four games ago. ``I'm so proud of her
because she's handled it the right way,'' Lieberman-Cline said.
``Last year gave me a better understanding. If I hadn't had that,
who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline became a great player and competent broadcaster
by learning from others and knows enough to do the same as a rookie
coach. ``If I have all the answers, we're in trouble,'' she said,
laughing about a critical moment at New York nine days ago. ``I had
never diagrammed a last-second play in the huddle. Ever. Not even
on an Etch-a-Sketch.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to help from a veteran staff that includes her first
pro coach, Greg Williams, and former NBA assistant Sonny Allen,
Lieberman-Cline took a Coaching 101 crash course from her 1976
Olympic coach, Billie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 hours over three days, Moore answered all the questions
that Lieberman-Cline could muster. ``I told her, `Treat me like a
moron and tell me what you know about the game.' Afterwards I said,
`Billie, why didn't you teach me this when you were a coach?' I
thought I knew so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline knows for certain what she wants to accomplish
tonight, beyond beating the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to say thanks to a city that quickly embraced her and
made the last of her more than 20 years as a player meaningful
beyond its historical intersection with the renewal of U.S. pro
women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come out there and I want to wave to our fans and I
want to shake the hand of the Colangelos,'' she said. ``It's a very
special place for me.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oscar Mendez would sit on his porch and admire the
small cropdusters. They flew low to the ground fumigating the rice
fields near his home in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day that will be me flying,'' he would say, pointing at
the small planes. He was only six years old.
</P>
<P>
   Friends laughed. But two years later, Oscar took his first plane
ride, to the United States. And today, at 19, Mendez has graduated
from Aviation High School and is working at Kennedy International
Airport as an aviation mechanic for Tower Air.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez's easy move from school to a job just days after
graduation last month is a prime model of one of the nation's most
unusual school-to-work programs. While many schools are forging
stronger links with businesses, Aviation is still the nation's only
high school whose students service commercial aircraft, educators
say.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Tower Air and Aviation High have worked
together. About 40 seniors are interns there during a fifth year at
the high school, spending 20 hours a week at Kennedy instead of in
shop classes. Tower Air has hired all its student interns after
graduation either full time or part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a unique school,'' said Jim Peters, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration's eastern region. ``It has been
doing it for the longest time and has been among the most
successful programs in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest the thought of teen-age interns fixing planes generate fear
of flying, the airline and the high school both point out that
trainees start work with baby steps. They observe for the first
five weeks, then they perform more elementary tasks like changing
light bulbs in the cabin, fixing seats or lubricating the flap
controls on the wings. Eventually, students are allowed to replace
faulty circuit breakers and remove and replace aircraft engines,
under the supervision of an experienced mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe a 19-year-old is working with Tower,''
said Mendez, who plans to continue working next fall when he enters
the College of Aeronautics, in East Elmhurst, Queens. ``It's kind
of crazy. Here we are fixing airplanes that actually fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviation High School opened in 1925 as the Central Building
Trades School, a vocational training program, with three
instructors teaching woodworking, plumbing and electrical
installation. In 1936, the school took aviation technology as its
focus and 21 years later, it moved to Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of shop classes, including hydraulics, welding
and sheet metal, students qualify for an FAA exam that licenses
them to work on either an aircraft frame or engine maintenance.
Students like Mendez, who stay a fifth year, can obtain a second
license from the agency and qualify for an internship with Tower
Air _ and usually, a job offer. Tower gets the chance to evaluate
potential workers while the school's students get the chance to
work on real aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the equipment, but it is not the same thing,'' said an
assistant principal, Mario Cotumaccio. ``We don't have a 747 in our
back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotumaccio started the program because Aviation graduates faced
a familiar teen-age Catch-22: they had trouble finding their first
jobs because they lacked airline experience, which they could not
get until they had a job. Tower Air, a low-cost airline based in
New York, decided to give the internship a try. Tower Air chairman
and chief executive Morris Nachtomi said the company has been
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Before the internship program, training programs were confined
to the small hangar behind the school, which holds about 16
aircraft, 4 from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The school now faces a series of new academic hurdles as the
state tightens its academic requirements. All public school
students _ including those at vocational schools _ are being
required to take regents exams, which test a student's preparation
for college work. It comes during a national effort to raise
standards for vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a need for well-rounded education,'' said John
Decaire, president of the National Center for Manufacturing
Sciences, a consortium of industrial companies based in Ann Arbor,
Mich. ``Companies don't operate sort of autonomously anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Aviation graduates stay in aircraft maintenance,
about 77 percent go on to college. Yvonne Franco plans to go to
Jacksonville University in Florida after she completes her fifth
year in June of 1999, paying for school by working in aviation
maintenance. ``It is a backbone for me,'' Yvonne said. ``I know it
assures my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Marleny Franco, said, ``When the children come out
of there, they come out with a career in their hands so that they
don't have to go fry potatoes at McDonald's.''

COWBOYS' CONSTANT: CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys trek into a city portrayed as
a sleepy outpost today bearing the black-hat reputation of their
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But when practices begin tomorrow, citizens of Wichita Falls
will wake up to a team that bears few resemblances _ on and off the
field _ to the one of dopin', gun-totin' and dorm-trashin' repute
that won six NFC East and three Super Bowl titles since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Camp Change.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest stars, like quarterback Troy Aikman, running
back Emmitt Smith, receiver Michael Irvin and cornerback Deion
Sanders remain, the prevailing theme for the Cowboys as training
camp opens at Midwestern State University is change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of this franchise is about change,'' Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said. ``But we have undergone more change this year
than any year since I've been here. Change is good. I believe it
can be positive and make for more excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Cowboys' shift of their training camp from
the enticements of Austin to laid-back Wichita Falls, the Cowboys'
off-season was highlighted by major alterations in image, personnel
and offensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There were no controversial off-field incidents. Team gatherings
for Bible study, rather than at strip bars, garnered headlines in
national publications. The team hired a new coach, Chan Gailey, and
signed former Pro Bowl running back Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   A new offense that includes the shotgun formation has been
installed. And several longtime and popular veterans like Herschel
Walker, Bill Bates and Tony Tolbert aren't on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said the training-camp move
was inevitable because the team had outgrown its location at St.
Edward's University in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that most of the organizational moves with
players and coaches were born out of the frustration from a 6-10
1997 season, when the Cowboys missed the playoffs for the first
time since 1990 and ended the season on a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Other lowlights from last season include:
</P>
<P>
   Futility inside the opponent's 20-yard line by an offense that
scored only 19 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A once-dominant offensive line allowing 39 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Cowboys defender recording more than six sacks, the
fewest by a team leader since Bob Lilly led the 1963 Cowboys with
five.
</P>
<P>
   A defense that had only seven interceptions, the fewest this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   A defense that allowed 1,994 yards rushing, the most since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones said the players have taken to the changes because
they were frustrated at the dismal ending of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change will be positive,'' he said. ``I don't factor the
training camp move into it. But as far as Chan is concerned, him
coming in will be fresh for everybody. It's a wakeup call that
there needed to be change. No matter who was here, there needed to
be change for us to get back where we were over the past few years.
Change is tough, but it definitely can be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Change in the 1998 Cowboys will also feature six new offensive
and defensive starters. Free safety Brock Marion was lost to free
agency. Tackle Mark Tuinei, wide receiver Anthony Miller and
defensive end Tolbert were released. David LaFleur replaces Eric
Bjornson at tight end. And defensive end Shante Carver was not
re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, the former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator,
rejects any comparisons to his predecessor, Barry Switzer, or talk
of what went wrong last season. However, his presence and his
get-tough style represents much of the concrete change that Jerry
Jones was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't compare last year's team,'' Gailey said. ``I'm trying
to do what we think is right for this team, this year. I would hope
that everything we do is toward getting this team back to the NFL's
elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Several position battles will be Gailey's focal point over the
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Stoutmire and George Teague are battling to fill Marion's
free safety spot. Macey Brooks, Ernie Mills, Jimmy Oliver and
Stepfret Williams will battle Billy Davis for the second receiver
position.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Fred Strickland's starting job is up for
grabs, with the team giving strongside linebacker Randall Godfrey a
shot in the middle. That means that veteran linebacker Broderick
Thomas and rookie Darren Hambrick have a chance to win Godfrey's
spot on the strong side.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are also looking for a kick returner to replace
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones acknowledges that the modifications in the Cowboys
from last season have resulted in more questions about the team
going into 1998 than in recent years. And, while he understands
that line of thinking, because ``we are not as talented as we used
to be,'' Jones said his goals going into training camp are no
different than they have been the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not viewed as the most talented team in football
anymore,'' Jones said. ``And rightly so; we have a lot of
questions. But we have questions with talent, which gives us a good
shot of going \Rto the Super Bowl\S if we can get those questions
answered. It would be fun to go to the Super Bowl without everybody
expecting you to go. That will be fun to watch.''

HEALTHY KNEE GIVES HOPE TO RATTLERS DEFEN SIVE BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Muhammad Oliver doesn't claim to be a basketball
player. Never has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played organized ball before,'' he said. ``I just love
to jump and dunk. Don't ask me to dribble and shoot from outside.
Just feed me alley-oops.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the day he dunked a basketball, however, that he knew he
was ready to return to professional football, something that seemed
far-fetched two years ago after undergoing reconstructive surgery
on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back on the court, dunking the ball any way I want, doing
the things I did before at the same level,'' said Oliver, a former
North High star.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent two weeks ago, in his first game with the
Rattlers. First he came up to stuff the run from his defensive back
position, then, a play later, he intercepted a pass and returned it
for a touchdown in Arizona's most lopsided win of the season, 69-27
over the Grand Rapids Rampage.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oliver's first pro football game since 1996, when he tore
up his knee in a scrimmage with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   He said doctors cleared him to return to play in '97, but he
didn't trust his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I use to judge my progress is everyday activities, like
playing basketball,'' he said. ``I wasn't able to dunk a basketball
that well, so I knew I wasn't at 100 percent. I talked to my wife
and I decided to sit out the entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Oliver, 29, who graduated from North in '87, is making a
push to get back on an NFL field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being advised by his agent to avoid playing Arena
football, Oliver figured this was the ultimate place, where he has
to make quick cuts and stops on the 50-yard field, to test his
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers had approached Oliver before, only to get ``no''
for an answer. But after watching a couple of games and enjoying
what he saw, Oliver approached the Rattlers about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent really doesn't belive it's a steppingstone back to
the NFL and there is a risk factor, but I need to know where I
stand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, 5-foot-11, 185 pounds, has been working in a finance
business and shooting commercials in Phoenix. He got tired of
waiting for an NFL team to call. With the Rattlers, at least, he
can stay home, play before friends and family and hope to catch the
attention of some neighbors _ the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream, in all honesty,'' he says, ``is to play for the
Cardinals. I see a need for a corner like myself to play for them.
They've got Anaeas (Williams). I could add depth at that other
corner position. I would love to play for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With defensive specialist Cedric Walker gone for the season
after reconstructive knee surgery, the Rattlers are happy to help
him pursue his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought him in as a two-way player when Randy (Gatewood)
got hurt,'' Coach Danny White said. ``It appears now he has much
more impact as a defensive specialist. He's a good enough athlete
to play receiver also. ''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver still toys with the idea of returning to track and field,
where he once was a top decathlete.
</P>
<P>
   He says he plans to resume training next year for the decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not I compete at the world-class level, I'm not
pushing for that,'' he said. ``It's something else I miss doing. I
enjoy the training and stuff. I know that's weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (2000) Olympics still crosses my mind. It's a goal to
compete there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver qualified for the 1996 Olympic Trials but was unable to
perform because of his knee, which has been scoped twice since the
days he was teaming with Phillippi Sparks in the secondary for a
national championship team at Glendale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   From Glendale, he continued his college career at Oregon, then
spent parts of four seasons in the NFL with the Denver Broncos,
Miami Dolphins and Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   He coached track at North High last spring while rehabilitating
his knee. His inspiration, he says, comes from his golf partner,
NFL defensive back Anthony Parker, a former Tempe McClintock and
Arizona State star.
</P>
<P>
   Parker made it big in the NFL only after recovering from
reconstructive knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seeing him achieve things is motivation itself,'' Oliver
said. ``I know what he's gone through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident I can achieve that level. I pray I will.''

2 COYOTES TURN TO ARBITRATOR  
 CANUCKS SIGN BARON TO 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes forwards Dallas Drake and Bob Corkum, two of
eight unsigned restricted Group II free agents on the team, will
file for arbitration today in an effort to bolster their salaries
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Murray Baron, meanwhile, agreed to a three-year
contract Tuesday as an unrestricted free agent with the Vancouver
Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, but Baron, who spent the
past 1{ seasons in Phoenix, is believed to have signed a deal worth
more than $2 million a year, including a signing bonus of at least
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith tendered qualifying offers
for the minimum 10-percent increase to both Drake and Corkum, but
neither player is prepared to accept his one-year offer for
$650,000 and $550,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, a physical right wing who plays predominately on the
team's top two lines, is seeking a two-year deal worth about $1.3
million per year. Corkum, the team's third-line center, best
faceoff man and a top penalty killer, wants at least $1 million for
one season.
</P>
<P>
   By going to arbitration, which most players and teams usually
hope to avoid, Drake and Corkum can present their case for higher
salaries, the Coyotes can argue it, and an independent judge will
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the verdict, it also guarantees that both players
will be back in Phoenix uniforms for the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitration hearings begin Aug. 1 and can last through Aug. 15.
Eligible players must file no later than today.
</P>
<P>
   Teams can continue negotiating through the arbitration process,
and in most cases, deals are usually struck before the arbitrator
makes a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that likely will happen with Drake, 29, and Corkum,
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to try and get a deal done, yes,'' Smith said
Tuesday from San Diego, where he is vacationing with his family.
``A lot of times, these deals get done that way. A lot of times,
they get done at the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake notified the league and Smith on Monday of his plans to
file for arbitration, according to his agent, Tom Laidlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll continue to talk and, hopefully, get something
resolved,'' Laidlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, meanwhile, is scheduled to become an unrestricted free
agent after next season and will settle for a one-year deal,
although he'd prefer a multiyear pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along I like it in Phoenix, and if they're
willing to give me a long-term deal to buy me out of the free
agency I get next year, I'd be more than happy to do that,'' Corkum
said Tuesday from his home near Boston. ``But I don't know if they
have the budget in place to give me the three- or four-year deal I
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly their choice, so most definitely, I'm
prepared to go to arbitration. I think (Smith) pretty much expected
this is what would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbitration hearings, by nature, can become bitter and extremely
personal. Nevertheless, Corkum said he's ready to enter the fray if
that's what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business, and I wouldn't take anything personal,'' he
said. ``But I'm worth more than the $500,000 I was playing for for
the last two years. I'm not looking to break the bank. I just want
what's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Keith Carney, acquired last season from Chicago in
the Chad Kilger trade, is also eligible for arbitration. Neither he
nor his agent, Brian Lawton, could be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other restricted free agents who remain unsigned but have been
tendered qualifying offers by the Coyotes, include forwards Shane
Doan and Louie DeBrusk, defensemen Deron Quint and Sean Gagnon, and
goalie Scott Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Baron, the Canucks signed him in part to replace
free-agent defenseman Jyrki Lumme, who agreed to a five-year, $17
million deal with the Coyotes on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good fit for Murray,'' said Baron's agent, Steve
Mountain, who also represents Corkum. ``(Vancouver Coach Mike)
Keenan will give him plenty of ice time, at least 20 to 22 minutes
a night, and that's what Murray needs.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bare majority of the House on Tuesday night
narrowly fended off another effort to amend a bipartisan
campaign-finance bill, keeping the measure intact through another
night of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The 219-201 vote to defeat an amendment by Rep. John Doolittle,
R-Calif., granted a slim victory to the bipartisan coalition
arrayed behind the bill. But the vote was far closer than those on
previous amendments, suggesting that groups like the National Right
to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition could be making
headway in their efforts to defeat the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-finance measure, sponsored by Reps. Chris Shays,
R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., would effectively ban the
large unregulated contributions to political parties that were at
the heart of the 1996 campaign-finance abuses. The legislation
would also curb independent advertising by interest groups just
before a general or primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has been fiercely opposed by the Republican
leadership, whose party traditionally holds a fund-raising
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tuesday night's debate focused on the restrictions on
independent advertising in the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle and his supporters said his amendment would ensure
that voter guides put out by groups like the Christian Coalition
and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
would not be jeopardized by ambiguities in the wording of the
campaign-finance bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Meehan argued that their bill would protect voter
guides and that the amendment would undercut the restrictions they
were seeking to impose on commercials run by independent groups,
which have proliferated in recent campaigns.

RIPKEN'S STATS OFF, BUT THE STREAK GOES ON
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The All-Star break was a bleak time for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the highest payroll in baseball was 261/2 games
out of first place. There were rumors and stories of dissension in
the clubhouse and in the front office, and owner Peter Angelos was
said to be ready to start trading potential free agents, including
Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   But most notable, from a historical perspective, the debate was
raging once again: Should All-Star third baseman Cal Ripken, having
a substandard offensive season, take a day off and end his
magnificent streak of consecutive games played?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seemed to have an opinion, especially in the news
media. Some were calling it the most selfless streak in history.
Others called it the most selfish. However, the two whose opinions
matter most continue to defend the streak, and Ripken is in the
Orioles' lineup indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Cal has on any given day is good enough for me,''
Orioles manager Ray Miller told Baltimore reporters before the
break. ``I have a tough enough time getting guys to play two weeks
in a row, let alone every game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that if Ripken asked for a day off, he
would get one. But he has no intention of doing so, and the streak
will reach 2,572 games when the Orioles play the Rangers tonight at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep perspective and the simple approach,'' Ripken
said at the All-Star Game. ``I'm considered the everyday third
baseman for the Orioles, and my job is to come out and help us win.
If the manager is making his lineup, thinking I can be one of those
guys that can help us win, I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's mediocre offensive numbers invite debate.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting .257 with seven home runs and 37 runs batted in.
His .371 slugging percentage on the day the American League
All-Stars were announced was lowest on the team, lower than even
defensive-minded shortstop Omar Vizquel. The Orioles' .359 slugging
percentage from their third basemen, usually considered a power
position, is third-lowest in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if your performance is down, I'd rather have people
talk about your performance, rather than the streak,'' Ripken said.
``Taking a day off is not going to help your performance. Actually
working hard and correcting your hitting will correct your
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major-league player is prone to slumps. But when Ripken
goes through them, there is an immediate tendency to blame the
streak.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in 1990, when Ripken's batting average dropped to
a career-low .250 with 21 home runs, 78 runs and 84 RBI, relatively
low numbers for him. The streak was blamed, but Ripken responded
the next year by hitting .323 with 34 home runs and 114 RBI, good
enough to be named the AL Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   However, he isn't getting younger. Ripken will be 38 next month,
an age when many players contemplate retirement, being a designated
hitter or a platoon situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak itself can be analyzed, dissected, opinions can be
formed in all different directions,'' Ripken said. ``But I don't
worry about that kind of stuff. I worry about the thing that
matters most, my approach to the game. It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   He has staunch defenders, including Rangers first baseman Will
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who say he needs to take a day off don't realize
how hard it is to go out there and play every day,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Florida manager Jim Leyland: ``Cal Ripken is a great player
and still a very productive player. If Cal Ripken is healthy, he's
like any other great player _ you want him in the lineup. I'll
never believe that Cal Ripken is hurting his team by playing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Twins' Paul Molitor had to go on the disabled list for
the 14th time in his career after getting hit in the ribs by a
pitch, he wondered aloud why such things don't happen to Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, he'd probably be playing tomorrow,'' Molitor said.
``He'd probably hit left-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans seemed to weigh in with an opinion at the All-Star
break. A sellout crowd at Coors Field gave Ripken a standing
ovation in pregame introductions equal to that given Mark McGwire
and Rockies hometown favorite Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the streak ends, it will take care of itself,'' Ripken
said. ``The situation will present itself, which will make sense,
and it will happen. I can't tell you how it would happen, but it's
not going to go on forever.''

   NEW YORK _ A day after he was acquitted of accepting illegal
payoffs, Assemblyman Dov Hikind said he would not run for the
congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Charles Schumer, saying it
was too late to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little late to pursue that goal,'' Hikind said. ``We're
looking at several other things, but not in 1998. But it will be
for a major position.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind said that he would not yet endorse any of the Democratic
candidates for the congressional seat in Brooklyn; Schumer is
running for the Democratic Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind said he might run for re-election to the state Assembly,
and that he had already received 5,000 signatures to put him on the
ballot.

COMMENTARY: HARD TIMES FOR ART IN REALM OF THE COIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martin Russell took over a tiny Times Square movie
house last year, spending 18 months and $100,000 to convert it into
a performance space for poets, actors and musicians. Since he
didn't learn carpentry or painting when he studied at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art, he improvised his way through fixing up
raw space with sweat equity.
</P>
<P>
   As unfamiliar as Russell was with those skills, the space itself
was no stranger to sweaty rawness. He took over a theater with a
black-walled basement dungeon and another room lined with cramped
booths that were once used for anonymous sex. Until 1995, it was
the New King Cinema, a gay X-rated theater that city officials
closed after investigators found that it was the setting for risky
and unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Combining artistic vision and let's-put-on-a-show impulsiveness,
Russell and his wife, Jill, struggled to give the decrepit theater
a second act. They turned it into the Eden Arcade and plan to offer
a nonstop cultural smorgasbord. Above the theater's entrance on
West 44th Street, they wryly wrote, ``Important Intangible Cultural
Property.'' Now it could become the ultimate in intangible:
defunct.
</P>
<P>
   The cost and time needed for renovations exceeded the Russells'
expectations. Unable to open the theater, they are still waiting
for various licenses and certificates that would allow them to
serve food and liquor to generate income. They are behind on their
rent and worry that they will be cast from their private paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware we're asking for an extraordinary privilege to be in
New York, in Times Square, at the turn of the century,'' said
Russell, who is British. ``To have a showcase where people can say
what they want. To have movies, music and poetry. That's Eden,
ain't it? We're really within touching distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russells' kooky gutsiness has been tested in the
now-sanitized Times Square, where they have lived since the 1970s.
They came from Europe, where they had studied theater, intent on
performing. Russell grew dismayed when people said he needed a
nonprofit group to gain legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you don't understand,'' Russell said he told them. ``Art.
`No,' they told me, `you don't understand. If you want
respectability, you have to become producers in spite of
yourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   They did, migrating from space to space until they found a good
one on West 43rd Street. By early 1996, they were set to sign a
10-year lease when the neighborhood started buzzing with the
arrival of Disney and its big plans for the seedy strip. The
landlord wanted more money. With no luck and no home, they
discovered that even storefronts in the Hell's Kitchen section were
going for ridiculous rents in anticipation of a golden age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became victims of this upscale thing,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like canaries in the English mines. They brought them
down to see if they would live. They now send in the artists, and
when the neighborhood goes up, they throw us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, he and his wife came across the closed X-rated theater
and struck a deal with the landlord, who they said was eager to
return it to legitimate use. But it took a lot more than the three
months they had planned on to strip the chairs and floors of
accumulated years of Lord knows what. They also found themselves
having to spend time and money fixing walls and exits to meet
building and fire codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid I used to see all these guys working in the theater
and ask, `How did they get so cynical?''' Russell said. ``The
theater is such a joy. A bouquet. The hardest thing is trying to
remain sane in the middle of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have worked out a payment schedule to catch up on
the back rent, the Russells continue to look for angels in the
neighborhood. They have sent out about 1,300 ``begging letters,''
as Russell calls his fund-raising pitch packages, which boast not
only of his performance plans but also of his training programs for
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Sex sold; that's what he learned when someone told him that the
old theater raked in $7,000 in cash each day. Now he has to worry
about selling people on the arts as an alternative to the
mass-market stuff that dominates the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kid, 10 years ago on the way to school in the Village, she
saw these hookers standing on the street in bathing suits and high
heels, waiting for the guys driving in from Jersey,'' he said.
``She looked at me and said, `There's nobody looking for YOU at
8:30 in the morning with a 20 spot.' You'd think that music, drama
and poetry would sell. That's the rich bouquet you want in life.''

EDITORIAL: UNDERMINING AN INTERNATIONAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to understand why Washington is sabotaging the
creation of a permanent international criminal court that would
serve American interests. The White House should welcome a court
now being negotiated by international delegates in Rome that could
punish and deter international criminals such as Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, afraid that American peacekeepers abroad will be
subject to politically motivated prosecutions, is behind the
American opposition. But the court will have ample safeguards to
prevent frivolous cases. If the judges at the existing
international tribunals for Bosnia and Rwanda are an indication,
the court's justices will be sober. They will have to approve
investigations and indictments. A country's own courts would take
precedence over the international court, which would cover only the
most serious international crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is asking that no prosecution take place without the
consent of the accused's government. This proposal, a retreat from
current international law, is supported by many of the rogue states
Washington abhors and is opposed by most democracies. It is easy to
see why _ imagine Yugoslavia having to agree before Slobodan
Milosevic could be tried. The idea undermines the whole reason for
the court, which is to have international law trump the impunity
international thugs win by force.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to believe the court would help protect
rather than threaten the safety of American peacekeepers abroad. In
Bosnia, for example, no American soldier has been killed in combat
in part because the most violent men are not in political power but
in hiding, after their indictments by the Bosnia tribunal. If
Washington remains opposed, other nations should proceed with the
design and establishment of a serious court. The Administration,
for its part, should not compound its isolation by destroying world
efforts to make this 50-year dream a reality. &QL;

EDITORIAL: BOBWHITES IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2000, man and nature permitting, flora and fauna
that have not been seen in these parts for years will be thriving
in New York City's parks _ screech owls and lunar moths in
Manhattan, bobwhite quail in the Bronx, water shrews in Queens,
butterfly weed in Brooklyn, tree frogs in Staten Island. These
species are part of Parks Commissioner Henry Stern's experiment to
enhance the biodiversity and the educational value of the urban
landscape. Whether it works or not, his plan is powerful evidence
of how far New York City's parks have come. Not so long ago the
parks were dumping grounds for abandoned cars. Today they are
healthy enough to allow their supervisors to think more
ambitiously.
</P>
<P>
   Re-introducing species is a complex business. For one thing, the
species must fit logically into a food chain capable of sustaining
it. Screech owls, for example, need small rodents to survive.
Central Park has mice galore. Wanderlust is an obvious danger,
especially in birds, but park officials say that neither screech
owls nor bobwhites are migratory. Finally, park officials must make
their own adjustments. The lunar moth builds its cocoons in messy
piles of leaves underneath trees. The maintenance staff must
therefore resist the impulse to keep the premises manicured.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shot in the dark'' is the way one wildlife biologist
describes Stern's vision. But what is there to lose? Besides, the
species themselves might welcome a change of venue. The bobwhite
quail, for example, is under siege in its native habitat, partly
because the hedgerows where quails congregate are being mowed down
as farms consolidate. The Bronx's Pelham Bay Park might provide
just the cover they need.

 &HT;    Toys to T-shirts, Christian market is big business
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Hey, everybody, what time is it?
</P>
<P>
   It's Jesus time.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the answer from the owner of a Christian-message
watch company and the rest of the 1,552 exhibitors in six acres of
convention space here.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Convention Center is jammed with more than 13,000
members of the Christian Booksellers Association who are meeting
here through Thursday. Publishers and wholesalers are hawking wares
from books to birdhouses, and store owners are looking for products
in a retail industry that is generating more than $2 billion a year
in sales. The booksellers association's goal is to double that
figure by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will _ evangelism or a cash cow _ today's
Christian marketplace is becoming a sophisticated industry that
employs secular marketing techniques and business savvy. Strong
economic times coupled with more demand has created higher profit
margins, with some products selling for almost three times
wholesale cost.
</P>
<P>
   You can ``Soar with Jesus'' on a toy airplane or keep your
breath fresh with Testamints. You can host a party with Jesus
napkins, plates and cups or send your kids to school with Nativity
erasers in their God First backpack.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to work with your Virtues brand commuter coffee mug
that proclaims ``Integrity, The just man walketh in his integrity''
from Proverbs and dash into the office with a leather briefcase
embroidered with a Latin cross. Later, you can put on your Jesus
socks, T-shirt and shorts, slip into your tennis shoes that
announce you are a ``Jesus Freak'' on a plate attached by the
shoestrings and take a jog. If that's not your sport, try a
skateboard with an inspirational message, or a round of golf with
golfballs inscribed with ``Jesus. The new hole-in-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a little blue? J-Mar Associates in Waco has the cure for
what ails you: pill containers that instruct the patient to ``Take
as needed for spiritual renewal.'' Inside, the container has 50
tear-off Bible verses. They are a big hit with hospital chaplains,
said Bob Gager, J-Mar's operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things just fly out of our place,'' he added. The
company sells more than 25,000 pill containers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Never be late for an important appointment with a Citizen watch
offered by Harry Ko of Garden Grove, Calif. Among the more than 300
watches bearing Christian messages, face designs include ``Pray
Hard,'' ``His Pain Your Gain'' and ``Jesus is Watching Every Second
of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The watches, which retail for $39.95, come with a lifetime
guarantee, Ko said. ``I hate to see them throw in it in the trash
with the message on it,'' he explained. ``I'd rather they send it
in and I fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a caveat: No guarantee on salvation, Ko said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolates, gravy dishes, pens, pencils, videos, games, clothes
_ you name it and wholesalers have God, Jesus and the Scriptures on
it.
</P>
<P>
   From junk to big business
</P>
<P>
   The industry has come a long way from three years ago when it
was awash in cheap, tacky gift items, such as Jesus toenail
clippers. ``We were here one year, and they had Bible toilet
paper,'' recalls Vernon Wilson, a custom-jewelry maker.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders call it holy hardware and Jesus junk. The Rev. Franklin
Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham, calls it garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of trash that comes out in the name of
Jesus Christ,'' he said Monday. ``There's big money, big
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Anderson, president of the Colorado-based booksellers
organization, said retail sales, which are showing a 13 percent
gain in 1998 over the same period last year, are about reaching
more people for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales is merely the measurement by which we can gauge
increased outreach, increased impact in the lives of people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christian manufacturers are quickly responding to secular
trends, producing alternative merchandise, including a burgeoning
music industry, to counter what many see as commercial enterprises
designed to neutralize God or demean Christian values in society.
</P>
<P>
   Besides answering secular trends, the Christian market has
started its own.
</P>
<P>
   Market sets trends
</P>
<P>
   Products bearing the W.W.J.D. (What Would Jesus Do) motto, for
example, are spreading faster than a Texas wildfire. The movement
began by targeting adolescents. They used W.W.J.D. to guide them
through the tough decisions teens face during puberty. Now, these
products' popularity is exploding among adults, with goods ranging
from bracelets to ties.
</P>
<P>
   The newest initiative launched by the booksellers association at
the convention is a ``Think Kids First'' campaign that has brought
together 23 children's-product suppliers to encourage Christian
bookstores to devote more space to children's materials. If the
campaign is successful, it could eventually lead to a new breed of
stores dealing exclusively in children's merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, according to Anderson, is to have such a good,
high-profile selection of quality children's products that parents
and kids will think of shopping at Kids First stores before other
toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Britt Beemer, president of American's Research Group, a
market-research firm, said a study he did for the booksellers
association concluded that the Christian retail industry ``is
currently doing about one-sixth of their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the market is seen in the humor of some products.
For years, the industry felt the seriousness of the mission _ to
spread the gospel of Jesus _ left little room to poke fun. Now,
numerous vendors are showing a lighter side and are marketing to
mainline Protestant Christians as well as their faithful
evangelical-Christian customers.
</P>
<P>
   There's the toddler-size hooded sweatshirts with ``Precious Lil'
Protestant'' embroidered on the front, and infant bibs with such
catchy sayings as ``Perky Lil' Presbyterian,'' ``Mighty Lil'
Episcopalian'' and ``Itty, Bitty Baptist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumper stickers proclaim, ``Lord, Bless that Tailgater,''
``Caution: Christian in Training, Danger of Derailment'' and ``My
Boss is a Jewish Carpenter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians can look at themselves tongue-and-cheek,'' said Dan
Zimmerman of Spirit Marketing Inc. in Minneapolis, Minn. His line
of doormats include such lighthearted sayings as ``Dear God, help
me to be even half the person my dog thinks I am,'' and ``Jesus is
coming. Quit standing around on this mat.''
</P>
<P>
   In smaller print on the bottom of each mat is ``Knock and the
door will be opened Matt. 7:7.''

STADIUM PROPONENTS MUST REACH FOR THE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The proponents of modernizing the Coliseum got it
all wrong. They figured the NFL will choose the owners and site of
Los Angeles' next pro football team based on serious factors like
financing, location and which stadium model looks the least like it
was built by a 14-year-old hopped up on glue.
</P>
<P>
   Having a fancy scale model to plop down on the presentation
table is so important that Hollywood Park executives, who want to
put a stadium in the racetrack parking lot, paid $35,000 for
theirs. For $35,000 it should have come with a fully functional
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, one reason Hollywood Park apparently has
dropped off the A-list of possible stadium sites is the proximity
of LAX would make it impossible to fly a blimp there. As we said,
serious factors.
</P>
<P>
   But now the money men behind the so-called New Coliseum
understand there's more to impressing the NFL than all that.
</P>
<P>
   This being Los Angeles, they've come to realize there are
certain expectations that don't apply to other would-be NFL cities.
Put another way, if the league wanted a succession of gray suits
with ledger sheets under their arms, they could spend all their
time in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they want glitz. Here, they want stars.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum people caught on after Michael Ovitz, the
Hollywood deal maker who wants to build a stadium on a former dump
site in Carson, suggested the team owners might include Tom Cruise
and Kevin Costner. All over the NFL, from the Park Avenue
headquarters to Green Bay, men of substance perked up like
schoolgirls at a Hanson concert.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum people happen to find it absurd, the thought
that even a multi-millionaire actor could play much of a financial
role in a project with a price tag in the high nine figures. But
they seem to have gotten the message: The future of L.A. football
might belong to whoever gets the biggest star to attach his or her
name to the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably one of the things that make the NFL angry at
us,'' said John Semcken III, executive vice president of the New
Coliseum partners, who include Kings owners Ed Roski Jr. and Philip
Anschutz. ``We're just boring old real-estate guys.... We've got to
get a few more of those (celebrities) to get on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Semcken said this over crab cakes at a Westwood bistro. Maybe he
hoped to find a star there.
</P>
<P>
   If the competition for a franchise were a football game, this
would be the long TV timeout before the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has been awarded a team _ the new Browns _ for 1999.
Los Angeles is in the running for 2001, against, reportedly,
Houston, Toronto and even Mexico City. The NFL not only hasn't
decided among the candidate cities, it hasn't even decided among
the possible L.A. sites. The league figures it will benefit from
the dragged-out competition. The NFL not only hasn't set a
timetable for deciding, it hasn't even set a timetable for setting
a timetable. But something could break at the league meetings in
October or next spring, after stadium referendums in Denver and
several other cities determine if franchises will move.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum people say their proposal will be ready for
presentation when the NFL gets serious. At this point, the only
problem is a $61 million gap in the financing, but guys like this
can scrape that much together from between the sofa cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Semcken is convinced the New Coliseum should and will be the
home of our next NFL team. The plan is to construct a multi-deck
stadium within the existing, 75-year-old walls as part of a
proposal to make Exposition Park a year-round entertainment
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Coliseum) and the Hollywood sign are probably the two
most recognized structures in Los Angeles,'' Semcken said.
</P>
<P>
   There's Hollywood again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these aren't exactly stuffed shirts, the New Coliseumites.
Roski just got back from climbing K2, or three-quarters of it,
anyway. Semcken is a former fighter pilot who advised the makers of
``Top Gun.'' He even appeared in a bar scene.
</P>
<P>
   But sharing the screen with Tom Cruise might not constitute
sufficient star quality for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever eventually puts the ``style'' in ``peristyle'' must be
``a unique individual,'' Semcken said. ``They're going to have to
be interested in doing something for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   And convinced they're joining the winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person in that position doesn't want to be associated with a
project that doesn't get done,'' Semcken said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Keyshawn Johnson, the New York Jets receiver from USC,
signed on as a spokesman for the New Coliseum and Exposition Park
revitalization. An NFL star _ that's a step in the right direction.
Disney chairman Michael Eisner has endorsed the plan. An
entertainment mogul _ even better. Magic Johnson was interested but
the price for his support, a stake in the franchise, was too high.
Just as well. Nobody would connect Magic with show business.
</P>
<P>
   Needed: a real, high-magnitude star with some mad money and a
love for football.
</P>
<P>
   How about Leonardo DiCaprio? He needs a new team, after he
became the Lakers' second-most visible fan and they turned into the
second-biggest shipwreck of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey? Truman, his entire life manipulated for the benefit
of television, would fit right in with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the (begin ital)ideal(end ital) would be an NFL
superstar with L.A. roots who is also an actor. Unfortunately, the
only man for the job is busy these days hunting for the real
killers.

 &HT;    Concert review: Thamyris with Tania Leon, Pheeroan akLaff and
Dianne Monroe
 &HT;    Georgia State University Recital Hall
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the too well-kept secrets of the National Black Arts
Festival is its focus on contemporary chamber works by
African-American composers. One of the too well-kept secrets of the
Atlanta music scene is the dedicated and adventurous ensemble
Thamyris, which has, for years, been steadily, keenly going about
its business: creating imaginative programs that push the envelope
in thoroughly inviting ways.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Tuesday night as Thamyris was joined by
several special guests -- and a host of composers in the audience
(yes, they're alive) -- to perform recent works and revisit some
prior commissions as part of the NBAF's ongoing mission. These
concerts are remarkable for their consistency and synergistic flow;
there's something almost tart and crisp in the way the musicians
connect with these pieces, which ranged from the oscillating
percussive overlay of Anthony Davis's 1981gamelan-influenced
``Wayang II -- Shadow Dance'' to Wendell Logan's 1992 ``Moments,''
an apt title for a work rich in dramatic interludes, discrete
embellishments and sustained rhythmic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The program built up from works that featured spare
instrumentation (Tania Leon's ``A la Par,'' T.J. Anderson's
``Inermezzi'') into denser constructions for the full-scale
ensemble (plus such guests as violinist Diane Monroe and drummer
Pheeroan akLaff, known for work in the jazz world, and
conductor/composer Leon). The critical mass was complex without
being confounding. For sheer impact, though, it was the solemnly
piercing soprano of Cheryl Boyd-Waddell (on Alvin Singleton's
``Between Sisters,'' a setting of Rita Dove's poem ``The House
Slave'') that struck home with chilling simplicity.

 &HT;    Smoltz in top form as Mets fall
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No elbow specialist can forecast just how John
Smoltz's elbow with endure the rest of summer of '98. Tuesday
night, that elbow spoke up on its own behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his most impressive work of the season, Smoltz won
for the third time in five starts since coming off the disabled
list, beating the Mets 4-2 in the first of two games at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (7-2) allowed two runs on a Todd Hundley soft liner in
the third that bounced out of Andruw Jones' glove as he
crash-landed. But that was all he allowed them (six hits, two
walks, six strikeouts) before Kerry Ligtenberg worked the ninth for
his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones drove in a pair of with a third-inning double and
a fifth-inning solo homer, his 24th of the year. The win was the
fourth in four games with the Mets this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves avoided tying their longest losing streak of the
season, although Smoltz pitched with a bit of history on his side.
The Braves' rotation had not gone 0-4 in consecutive road starts
since Aug. 2-5, 1990, when Tom Glavine, Smoltz, Charlie Leibrandt
and Steve Avery all lost in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones increased Atlanta's lead to 4-2 with a solo home
run in the fifth inning, his 24th of the year and the fourth of his
career in 28 career at-bats against Mets starter Bobby Jones. That
gave Jones six homers in his last 10 games and leaves him six shy
of setting a career high.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz helped himself in the fourth when, with men on second and
third, he slapped a hanging 2-2 curveball into right to score Javy
Lopez for a 3-2 lead. The RBI was Smoltz's fourth in just 20
at-bats. He did not help himself one batter later, however, when
Walt Weiss sent a soft liner to second, where Carlos Baerga caught
it and threw to first to double-up Smoltz and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud singled and Mike Piazza doubled with two out in the
third inning, but Smoltz appeared to have escaped the inning when
Hundley lifted a shallow flare into center. Andruw Jones gloved the
ball in a lurch but it popped out when he hit the ground, bringing
both men in and tying it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Stringing together a pair of two-out shots in the top of the
third, the Braves went up 2-0. With Weiss on first after a walk,
Chipper Jones hit a deep ball to the opposite field that eluded
catcher-turned-left fielder Hundley and bounced hard off the wall.
Weiss scored easily on Jones' double, his 10th extra-base hit of
the month, and right there it might have stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But when Andres Galarraga next lined a ball to right, Butch
Huskey misjudged how hard it was hit and wound up making a feeble
back-handed reach as the ball skipped past him.

BOXING CRITICS CITE MINDS THAT HAVE TURNED TO MUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Chacon, 46, has the mentality of a small child. A look
into the eyes of once-charismatic Jerry Quarry, 53, his sister says
sadly, and ``no one is home.''
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget the startling image of Muhammad Ali, 56,
shaking uncontrollably as he tried to light the Olympic flame in
Atlanta in 1996?
</P>
<P>
   This, as much as rich lore and rich purses, is the legacy of
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment the possibility of death in the ring.
Statistically, boxing is well down the list of sports when it comes
to fatalities. However, this cannot be denied: Boxing leads the way
in chronic brain damage, an all-too-overlooked reality that turns
too many robust men into living, breathing zombies. Chacon, Quarry
and Ali are only high-profile examples of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an important question: Is it time to ban the sport?
</P>
<P>
   Those who say ``no'' argue that aspiring fighters know the risks
and have the God-given right to take them, pointing out that boxing
officials go to considerable lengths to make the sport as safe as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Those who say ``yes'' point to the victims, the fighters whose
brains have been destroyed, and ask, ``Does this belong in a
civilized society?''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's an emotional issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do anything to get boxing stopped,'' said Dianna Quarry,
who watched helplessly as two of her brothers, Jerry and Mike,
deteriorated after successful boxing careers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bad for the brain
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association is one entity
that advocates a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Its editor, Dr. George Lundberg, was once a fan of the sport. He
marveled at the ability of fighters like Ali and Floyd Patterson
and rarely missed the Friday night fights on television.
</P>
<P>
   And then the data came in. Studies done in the early 1980s in
the U.S., Italy and Finland concluded roughly the same thing: 75-80
percent of boxers with a substantial number of fights _ he
suggested 20 but pointed out that many blows are taken in sparring
_ show evidence of chronic brain damage that can only worsen.
</P>
<P>
   That's when both the journal and Lundberg took their ban-boxing
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I thought the risk was sporadic,'' Lundberg said.
``Sure, once in a while someone died and once in a while someone
became punch drunk. It was the nature of the sport, an exciting
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the numbers came out (in the studies), though, as a
physician, I had to change my mind completely....
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is medically wrong and morally wrong. Medically wrong
because of the frequency of chronic brain damage and morally wrong
because a boxer wins by harming his opponent. While this might
occur in other sports, in theory it's an undesired side effect and
not the purpose of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Jerry Quarry is tragic but not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry was once one of the top heavyweights in the world, a
contemporary of Ali and Joe Frazier who never realized his dream of
winning the championship. He was a brawler, a fighter who was
willing to take punches to give them. Ultimately, the repeated
blows to his head _ and their effect on his brain _ began to take a
toll.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, he gradually lost his short-term memory and,
as a result, his ability to function normally. For example, he
might ask a question but cannot retain the answer.
</P>
<P>
   He must be cared for by his family. He lived with Dianna in
Atascadero for six years but recently moved in with another sister,
Brenda, in Paso Robles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted him for a while,'' Dianna said. ``He's degressing,
of course. She wanted to spend time with him while he's still able
to recognize her....
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what the world wants? A man who, beginning at around
40, has the mind of an 80-year-old? A man who can't always
recognize members of his own family? For what? A few dollars? For
what people call `fame?' They're willing to sacrifice a mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to act as if nothing is wrong, to avoid eye contact
(with Jerry). Otherwise, I'd break down, I'd just break down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A matter of choice
</P>
<P>
   Those who defend boxing have compassion for their brethren.
Boxing is an extremely tight fraternity. At the same time, they
demand the right to determine their own destiny _ even if they
endanger themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What about mountain climbing? Or sky diving? Or motorcycle
racing? Or, a popular sport boxing people mention often, football?
Are we also to ban these activities because they're dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, boxing provides so many boys _ particularly those
from poor neighborhoods _ a direction. Even if they don't become
professional boxers, it teaches them discipline and respect,
provides a sense of belonging and gives them an outlet for
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, some make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone was meant to carry a briefcase,'' said former
champion Sugar Ray Leonard. ``Not everyone was meant to get a
college degree. There are certain opportunities that exist for us,
for people who are unfortunate. Boxing is one of those
opportunities. We're not hurting anyone but ourselves. And there
are risks in everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a capitalist society and this is the vocation I
decided upon. How can someone want to abolish the sport that made
me the man I am today?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boxing and legislation
</P>
<P>
   The British Medical Association also advocates an end to boxing.
And it actively pursues a ban.
</P>
<P>
   BMA doctors engage in public debates with boxing authorities and
they produce anti-boxing advertisements. And, apparently, people
are listening: A proposed bill to ban boxing failed to pass by a
single vote in parliament's upper house in 1994, according to Dr.
Bill O'Neill, a research adviser to the BMA.
</P>
<P>
   He believes a tragedy in connection with boxing's latest
phenomenon _ women fighters _ might be all it takes to kill the
sport in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Here, an end to boxing is nowhere in sight. The Journal of the
AMA stands vociferously against it, but no meaningful action has
been taken to bring about its demise.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, doctors, boxing officials and now
politicians _ U.S. senators John McCain and Richard Bryan, whose
bill to improve safety standards is now law _ do what they can to
protect the fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Among a litany of regulations in California, which has the most
stringent standards: To be licensed, boxers must take physical, eye
and neurological exams and be tested for HIV and hepatitis B. They
cannot fight for at least 45 days if they're knocked out. Two
doctors must be present at all bouts. And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Ringside physicians, who regularly meet to discuss safety
issues, also are constantly seeking ways to make the sport even
safer and to address issues facing the women fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the AMA to have a negative opinion (of boxing),''
said Dr. Paul Wallace, a ringside physician. ``But it's not their
choice. The job of physicians is to make the participant as safe as
possible given the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dentist doesn't say you can't eat candy. He says if you're
going to eat it, brush your teeth afterward. In boxing, we adhere
to certain standards. They have physicals, neurological exams and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``These participants aren't my private patients. I'm just here
to see that the environment is made as safe as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, those opposed to the sport don't buy such an
argument. The risk, they say, is simply too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like saying, `If you want to be heroin addict, go ahead.
If you want to drive your car at 150 miles per hour on a mountain
road, I guess you can do that.' I mean, you could sell out Soldiers
Field (in Chicago) for a shootout with six-guns if the parties
signed a consent,'' Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make it all right. At times people have to be
protected from themselves. That's what public health is all
about....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more sad than anything else. It's the nature of humanity
that causes some people to get their excitement and joy out of
other people's pain.''

 &HT;    Truck, witness revive feds' search for bombing suspect
 &HT;    (EDS: Use this latest version.)
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrews, N.C. _ The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have
been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators
to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to
finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion
clinic and three Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that
a Macon County, N.C., man who reported his truck stolen knew
Rudolph and had seen him in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear to investigators was why the pickup was not
reported stolen immediately, giving Rudolph time to escape with
another six months' worth of food, which he is believed to have
stolen from the owner of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said this does not mean that the owner of the
truck, identified by the Associated Press and WSB-TV as George
Nordmann, operator of The Better Way Health Food Store, was trying
to help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph. ``What would
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force
investigating the Birmingham bombing and Atlanta bombings: ``This
is a witness of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann's 1977 blue Datsun pickup truck was recovered Monday
shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested
area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C. Investigators said Nordmann
told them the pickup truck was stolen Thursday, along with a large
amount of food.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was
a friend. And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left
him money to pay for the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The man waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according to
ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great
hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and
a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were
found on the pickup. ``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we
may,'' the ATF agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators indicated they believe they are closer to Rudolph
than they have been since he was named in February as a suspect in
the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed a
policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson of the bomb
task force declared, ``We are confident that we are dealing with
Eric Robert Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they may have missed the 31-year-old
carpenter and experienced outdoorsman by just hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF official said a local law enforcement officer had passed
through the area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found
Monday and that the truck was not there. ``It was not in the
location where it was found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,''
Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million
reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said Rudolph, who as a teenager moved with his mother
and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is
believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard
and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has
re-energized the manhunt. Rudolph had last been reported seen at a
video store in Murphy on Jan. 30. A few days later, a pickup truck
registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the day
of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near Murphy.
Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of the
forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters in
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup
truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at
1-888-ATF- BOMB.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph
was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina. They also
believed he was acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that,'' Enderson said. ``The search has been
intensified significantly.'' The number of agents in western North
Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had
about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared
into the woods. ``He had stolen another six months worth, or at
least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are
approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was first approached as if it might be
boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain
near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks
that reach 4,500 to 5,000 feet into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foilage is so thick you can't see ... you can't find
anything,'' Thompson said. ``I said all along he was here and he'll
be here until he's caught.''

COMMENTARY: THE REV. AL SHARPTON THINKS THE VERDICT OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may be wondering whether the Rev. Al Sharpton feels sorry
for Steven Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, a former assistant district attorney in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., has spent the last decade under the cloud of Sharpton's
charges that he was part of a gang of white men who supposedly
raped and abducted Tawana Brawley. This week a jury found Sharpton
liable on seven counts of defamation, apparently agreeing with a
grand jury's earlier conclusion that Miss Brawley had made the rape
story up.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, who gave up his legal career to pursue the case against
Sharpton and two of his associates, expressed pleasure at the
long-awaited verdict. His wife, at his side, had the look of a
woman who might have preferred to spend the last 10 years living
quietly in another state.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sharpton, he speaks of a remorse that seems to stop short
of agonizing repentance. ``I don't regret getting involved,'' he
said. ``I don't regret repeating what a victim said, what I
believed she said. Do I regret the personal attacks? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Al Sharpton was very much in the shadow of the
attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, both of whom have since
fallen off the edge of the world of political influence. Sharpton
has become a far more influential and inclusive figure, having
undergone what he refers to as ``my metamorphosis.'' But his core
constituency includes many people who passionately believe that
Tawana Brawley told the truth _ or that to question her story is to
betray all the black women who were raped and disbelieved
throughout American history.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Sharpton said he still did not believe the
incident was a hoax, and he is not going to disavow Miss Brawley's
story at this late date. But at times, he comes pretty close.
Speculating about legal strategy for the inevitable appeal, he
says: ``If the grand jury's theory was that Tawana and her mother
did it'' _ made up the rape story _ ``to fool the stepfather, why
wouldn't somebody say she could fool me and Maddox and Mason? How
would we know her better? You can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   When the defamation verdict came in, Sharpton's first reaction
was to position himself up against the long-suffering Pagones as a
victim. ``After all I've been through, this seems very civil,'' he
said, recounting his resume of fasts and jailings and having been
stabbing by a white man. His next response, which also seemed to be
partly aimed at Pagones, was to go back to that metamorphosis. A
key moment comes when Sharpton forgives the man who stabbed him and
asks the court for leniency. ``I admit to having grown, to having
the need to grow. I'm wondering have others grown with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a performance that will appeal only to a specific
audience. Many people find Sharpton far too slippery for comfort.
But it comes as a certain relief after the rhetoric of Mason and
Maddox, now both disbarred lawyers still rearguing the Brawley
case, promising proof that does not arrive, branding dissenters as
racist. Sharpton never gives the impression he is operating in a
separate reality. He is working very much in this one, and trying
to make his way out of a difficult corner with all the verbal skill
at his command without doing the obvious, which is to say he's
sorry for a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton noted that his co-defendants were found guilty of
defaming Pagones after the grand jury exonerated him. ``But I
wasn't sued for anything beyond the grand jury,'' he said. There
was, of course, an interview with a magazine writer in which
Sharpton cited unnamed witnesses and unproduced sperm samples that
he claimed could prove Ms. Brawley had been raped by a gang that
included Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but I wasn't sued for it,'' he said.

OWNER OF ABORTION CLINIC TARGET OF LAWSUITS IN OTHER STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER, JODIE SNYDER  
 and HEATHER RATCLIFFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Phoenix abortion clinic where two women bled to
death in the past three years is one of several clinics owned by a
New York doctor who's been the target of numerous complaints and
lawsuits in Arizona and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At least two complaints against Moshe Hachamovitch involve the
deaths of patients _ one a 15-year-old girl _ who suffered
complications after having abortions at his clinics in New York and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, investigators reported various problems at the
clinics _ from unsanitary conditions to unsafe equipment to poor
record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator noted that the Texas clinic presented a
``serious and immediate threat to the health and safety of its
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch was cleared in one death; the other remains under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch and one of his clinics, or both, have also been
named in at least eight lawsuits. And Arizona medical records show
seven complaints against Hachamovitch, while New York records show
three complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch is listed as the CEO of at least three abortion
clinics in the Valley: A-Z Women's Center in Phoenix and Family
Planning Institutes in Phoenix and Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The A-Z Women's Center has come under fire in recent days
because of a near-abortion performed there by Dr. John Biskind on
June 30. According to police, Biskind was attempting to abort a
fetus but instead ended up delivering a full-term baby.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier examination by clinic personnel showed the fetus to
be 23 weeks old; it turned out to be 37 weeks old, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Biskind was admonished by the Arizona Board of
Medical Examiners eight years earlier for nearly aborting another
full-term baby.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind has also been investigated in the deaths of two
patients, one in April and one in 1995. Medical board records show
both women bled to death. Biskind was censured for gross negligence
in the 1995 death; the other death is still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Biskind for comment have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Hachamovitch is based in New York, where he
operates at least two clinics. But he also has medical licenses in
Arizona, Texas and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the medical boards in Texas and Pennsylvania
report no past complaints about Hachamovitch, but noted that they
cannot comment on pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the state Department of Health filed a lawsuit against
an A to Z Women's Services in Houston, Hachamovitch and then-clinic
administrator Kristen King Fehr in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, a 15-year-old girl underwent an
abortion in February 1994; four days later, she was admitted to a
hospital suffering symptoms of blood poisoning, with a fever,
chills, abdominal pain and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials determined that the girl had a tear in her
cervix and a post-abortion infection. She was placed in the
intensive care unit but died March 2, 1994, as a result of the
infection.
</P>
<P>
   A state investigator sent to the clinic found surgical
instruments used in abortion procedures that had dried red material
on them, instruments that may not have been sterilized and staff
who were not properly trained in how to clean instruments,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In one case, an instrument called a curette _ a spoon-shaped
instrument used to scrape tissue away _ that should have been
smooth was jagged, the investigator noted.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic also did not report the death of the girl within two
days as required. The death was reported nine days later. That case
is still pending in Travis County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Hachamovitch was disciplined after a woman died in
one of his clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a woman in her second trimester went to his Bronx
office for an abortion. Prior to the procedure, she complained
about pain, severe bleeding and other ills but the procedure was
performed anyway, according to the New York State Health
Department. She went into cardiopulmonary arrest and died hours
after the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The state health department also investigated separate
complaints involving poor record keeping, such as neglecting to
mention how much blood a patient lost during a procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Health Department charged Hachamovitch with gross
negligence, improper delegation of duties and inadequate
recordkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The review panel looking at the charges found Hachamovitch was
in no way responsible for the woman's death. But it did find him
responsible for record-keeping violations.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it wanted to send Hachamovitch a stern message,
but also wanted to acknowledge his level of skill and practice. It
suspended his license for a year but stayed 11 months of the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch contested the 1993 decision in court. In 1997, the
penalty was imposed, said Frances Tarlton of the health department.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, medical board records show seven complaints against
Hachamovitch. Three letters of concern were issued in two of the
cases _ one for problems with medical records and one for failing
to file fetal death certificates, which are required if the fetus
is 24 weeks or older.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint from April remains under investigation, said Eric
Nickell, the board ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   The other complaints were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Superior Court records show seven lawsuits that
name Hachamovitch, Biskind or the A-Z clinic in Phoenix. One of
them involves the death of Biskind's patient in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The A-Z clinic in Phoenix also was fined for at least one
serious and 11 non-serious health hazards in 1996 by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The serious fine, which totaled $2,500, was for not cleaning
equipment and surfaces after contact with blood and potentially
infectious materials.
</P>
<P>
   The report filed on May 1, 1996, said a suction machine in the
operating room was contaminated with blood, dirt and dried soap. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was with ``a great burst of naivete'' that Diane
O'Neill McGivern submitted her name in 1991 to join the New York
State Board of Regents, the state's highest educational authority.
A nurse and a teacher, she headed the nursing division at New York
University, but had no political experience and had never tangled
with behemoths like the United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs now, as if recalling youthful innocence. An article
in The Staten Island Advance, her local paper, had mentioned a
vacancy on what was then a sleepy group of overseers, and she
applied with the passionate but vague hope of improving education
and the process for licensing medical and other professionals,
another of the regents' duties. There wasn't much competition.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few years, education had swiftly moved to the top
of the political agenda, elected officials began to campaign on
school issues, and the regents awoke from their slumber to become a
significant force in statewide education policy. They imposed tough
graduation requirements on high school students, took control of
poorly performing schools and issued the first school-by-school
performance reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGivern, along with the board's chancellor, Carl Hayden,
and the education commissioner, Richard Mills, has quietly but
forcefully been in the forefront of those efforts. As the board's
vice chancellor, she was named co-chairwoman of what may be the
board's most contentious initiative yet, the task force to improve
teaching in the state.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee's report, two years in the making, is approved
by the full Board of Regents on Thursday, it will begin one of the
most sweeping changes ever made to teaching standards in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real sense of frustration,'' she said Tuesday
in her office at NYU. ``Every year we revisit school failure, we
revisit large numbers of children not reaching the literacy or the
math levels we'd like. It seemed that all these incremental things
that we were doing were not having much impact. And I suppose that
once you have a lot of that frustration for a while, collectively,
you feel the need to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent proposal in the report, and the one that has
drawn the most concern from the highly organized groups of teachers
around the state, is the one that effectively ends the permanent
licenses now held by the state's 202,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal does not explicitly end tenure, it
requires new teachers to take 175 hours of continuing education
every five years to retain their licenses. (Existing teachers are
exempt from the requirement.) It is unclear how school districts
will pay for such education.
</P>
<P>
   The task force would also strengthen requirements for teacher
education at state colleges, and require administrators to impose
tougher standards in evaluating a district's teachers. At the same
time, it proposes a package of financial incentives to attract and
retain the best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGivern is aware that many teachers, already feeling
underpaid and underappreciated, may see the report as yet another
attempt to blame them for the failings of the education system, at
a time buildings are falling apart and classrooms are overflowing
with children. She insists that is not the case, but believes that
if students are held to higher standards, teachers should be as
well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For reform to work, the other side of the equation is the
teacher, and that is the last piece to fit into the reform
effort,'' she said. ``People say that once you start down this
road, you're criticizing teachers, you're not holding them in
enough regard. But if you look across the state, the quality of
teacher preparation and performance is very variable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her restraint in this description, much appreciated by her 15
colleagues on the board, reflects a diplomatic awareness that she
must balance reform with recognition of the power of teachers'
unions, who can often block change. But the final report, the
subject of considerable compromise and horse trading, has won
something like praise from both the State School Boards
Association, representing administrators, and the teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of
Teachers, the New York City teachers union, said she respects Ms.
McGivern's quiet tenacity. Steven Sanders, chairman of the state
Assembly's education committee, said that quality is one reason she
was reappointed earlier this year when the Assembly was replacing
regents right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no accident her term of office was extended,'' he said.
``She was one of the few who actually went out and spent time in
schools, and we were very impressed with her demeanor and her
assertiveness in supporting more rigorous standards. She is a real
consensus builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her school visits take place in Brooklyn and Staten
Island, the two boroughs she represents. Ms. McGivern, 59, lives in
Dongan Hills, on Staten Island, with her husband, Bernard, an oral
surgeon, and about a dozen Hungarian pointers, which she and her
husband breed. She grew up in a suburb of Cleveland, and never left
New York after coming to study nursing in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much things have changed that when she
calls ahead for a school visit, one of six or seven a month,
teachers and principals scramble. ``You have to call ahead, or they
would really faint,'' she said, laughing. Something must have
shaken them up.

EFFORT BEGINS TO KILL BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned that too few bilingual students are becoming
proficient in English, more than a dozen Tucson parents and
educators have begun pushing for a ballot initiative to end
bilingual education in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Their worries are based partly on findings by the Arizona
Department of Education last month that just 2.8 percent of
students classified Limited English Proficient in the state learn
enough English to enter the academic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   And they have been joined in their concerns by Superintendent of
Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan, who said she believes a
major change in bilingual education is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mary Mendoza of Tucson, one of the leaders of the group, said
the figure is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no academic component to bilingual programs,'' she
said. ``Their goal is to keep Mexican students illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, California voters approved an initiative to end
bilingual education in that state. Faced with the same kind of
measure here, the state's bilingual educators are scrambling to
explain figures in last month's Department of Education report.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt the numbers altogether _ particularly that so few
students become proficient in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question whether the figures are really that low,'' said
Barbara Volk, director of related services for the Peoria Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   Volk said that, in Peoria, 71% of students in bilingual programs
exit within three years and an additional 16% leave within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some accept the figures but complain about a lack of a common
vision for what bilingual programs should be. Others say another
factor could be a lack of accountability by districts for the
success of bilingual programs.
</P>
<P>
   The state's report, the first assessment of bilingual programs
in four years, came at a time when native-language instruction is
under fire across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic assault occurred in California, where voters
approved Proposition 227, which requires that all students be
placed in English classrooms. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday
on a request for an injunction to keep the measure from being
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cries of ``racism'' from bilingual supporters, much of
the recent criticism is coming from Hispanic parents who are
concerned that teaching students in their native language might
keep them from learning English as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the group of parents and educators has met several
times to plot strategy for launching a similar ballot initiative in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The group is concerned that districts are actually harming
students _ especially Hispanics _ by leaving them in bilingual
classes too long.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some say that while administrators claim parents can request
that their children be removed from bilingual programs, removing
students is nearly impossible. &UR; Others claim that the bilingual
educators have shifted away from the goal of teaching English and
toward maintaining students' ability to speak their native
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bilingual education has turned from a transitional model to
one of native-language instruction,'' said Hector Ayala, a leader
of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, an English teacher at Cholla High School in Tucson, said
bilingual programs also try to improve students' self-esteem and
preserve their cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by Keegan, who cited her department's
figures as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They point to the fact that we've lost sight of what these
programs are for, that being for students to learn English,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed that the emphasis of many programs has strayed from
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   And while Keegan believes that a ballot initiative in Arizona
may be a blunt instrument that ``forces everyone to choose sides,''
she remains confident that some kind of reform is imminent. She
said it may be aimed at limiting the number of years that students
spend on a bilingual track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's going to happen in the Legislature this year,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ayala said representatives of the Tucson group will
be traveling to Phoenix on Tuesday to meet with Rep. Laura
Knaperek, R-Tempe, who this year sponsored an unsuccesful bill to
limit state funding of bilingual programs to three years. Knaperek
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens in the Legislature, members of the Tucson
group want to put their initiative on the ballot. Ayala said the
group _ English for the Children of Arizona _ has contacted the
sponsors of California's Proposition 227 and plans to launch a
ballot initiative here in time for the 2000 election. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the scenario the Mets have craved. An
important series at Shea Stadium against the awesome Atlanta Braves
_ even if it is for only two games _ and another chance for the
Mets to prove that they are serious contenders to play in October.
With Todd Hundley back in the lineup, the Mets had momentum and,
most of all, they had hope.
</P>
<P>
   But hope changed to hopelessness for one more dreary night as
John Smoltz asserted himself on the mound and the Braves asserted
themselves on the field by marching to a 4-2 victory. The Mets?
They did not assert themselves. Instead, they aggravated
themselves. Again.
</P>
<P>
   While the final score sounds reasonably close, the outcome was
not in much doubt once the Braves took a two-run lead in the fifth.
Smoltz limited the Mets to one hit over the last five innings he
pitched to help Atlanta end a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can play with them,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
had said before the team's deficit behind the first-place Braves
increased to 12 1/2 games. ``To win games, we've got to play well
and make a break or two. We're due for a break or two.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine failed to get a break in a key situation that
helped doom the Mets in the seventh inning. He instructed Edgardo
Alfonzo to try a sacrifice bunt with runners on first and second
and none out, a sound enough choice for advancing the potential
tying runs. But the problem came after Alfonzo fouled off two
attempts and had a 2-2 count.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine removed the bunt sign, but Alfonzo, a good contact
hitter, tried one anyway. The ball rolled foul along the third base
line.
</P>
<P>
   The strikeout sucked the enthusiasm out of Shea and, apparently,
out of the Mets. John Olerud followed by flying out to left field,
and Mike Piazza had a weak at-bat against Smoltz as he reached out
and tapped a pitch back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 38,000 fans groaned about the lost opportunity,
which also proved to be New York's last opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (7-2), who permitted two runs and six hits in eight
innings, retired the last six batters he faced. The Mets' Bobby
Jones (7-6) pitched decently while allowing four runs and eight
hits in seven innings, but the right-hander now has one victory in
his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley singled in both runs for the Mets, who are 2-1 since his
return.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz hurt New York's chances in the fourth, but in an
unexpected manner. With the score tied, 2-2, the Braves had runners
on second and third and one out because Javier Lopez had singled
and Andruw Jones had doubled. Jones needed to retire Smoltz, an
easy enough task, but he hung a 2-2 curveball, and Smoltz waited
and then slapped it softly to right for a run-scoring single. It
was Smoltz's fourth hit and fourth run batted in of the season, and
it gave Atlanta a 3-2 lead. One inning later, Chipper Jones homered
to right field to make it 4-2. It was Jones' 24th homer of the
season, his first in 90 at-bats as a left-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were deflated by Smoltz's hit, especially since they
had tied the score in the third on Hundley's two-run single. With
two outs, Olerud singled and Piazza doubled to put two runners in
scoring position and put Hundley in an inviting position. The
catcher-turned-outfielder smoked a line drive to center, which
briefly belonged to Andruw Jones. He dived as if center field was a
10-foot pool, trying to make a nifty two-handed catch, but the ball
bounced free when his glove slammed against the ground. Olerud and
Piazza scored, enlivening Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had grabbed a 2-0 lead in the third inning, also by
scoring after there were two outs. Chipper Jones doubled off the
left field fence to knock in the first run, and Andres Galarraga
scorched a single to right to drive in the second. Butch Huskey
charged in too far on Galarraga's hit and then awkwardly tried to
block it with his glove. That failed, and Galarraga took second on
the miscue, but Bobby Jones stranded him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maurice Sorrell, a photographer who covered the height of the
civil-rights era in the South and became the first black member of
the White House Photographers Association, died on June 22 at
Providence Hospital in Washington. He was 84 and lived in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell was a news photographer in the Washington bureau of
Johnson Publishing Co., which publishes Jet and Ebony magazines,
from 1962 until he retired in 1993. He photographed civil-rights
events during the 1960s despite ``dogs snipping at my heels, tear
gas, bayonets at the back,'' he once recalled in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the White House Photographers Association in 1961
after some trouble working with other White House photographers. As
he recalled: ``They had a little thing where they would get arm in
arm and try to push me back. Once they found out that I could shoot
as well as they could, they accepted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell was born in Washington, went to schools there and became
fascinated by photography. He worked for years at the federal
Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and at the Defense Department _
not as a photographer _ and went on to be a staff photographer for
The Afro-American newspaper in Washington before joining Johnson
Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Beatrice, and a sister, Lillian
Strange, of Hyannis, Mass.

PAUL CHOW, 69, WHO HELPED SAVE IMMIGRATION SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paul Chow, who helped lead the effort to
preserve and restore the Angel Island Immigration Station as the
Ellis Island of the West Coast, died on June 30 at his home in San
Francisco. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver disease, said Daniel Quan, president of the
Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, a transportation engineer, volunteered his time for the
past 25 years to preserving the legacy of Chinese immigration to
the United States by helping to protect one of its most significant
cultural landmarks. From 1910 to 1940, Angel Island, in the San
Francisco Bay, was the main Pacific gateway for immigration into
the United States, processing more than 1 million immigrants from
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which limited Chinese
immigration until 1943, thousands of Chinese, including Chow's
father, were detained on Angel Island and interrogated about their
eligibility to immigrate. Many were held there for weeks, months
and, in some cases, years before they were deported to China.
</P>
<P>
   After the station was closed in 1940, it was used to house
Italian and German prisoners of war, but in 1945 the barracks was
boarded up and abandoned. As the state was poised to demolish the
remaining buildings in the early 1970s for the California State
Park system, a park ranger discovered that Chinese characters had
been etched into the walls of the barracks. A group of
Chinese-American scholars found that the carvings were of hundreds
of poems by detainees writing of their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Chow led the effort to create an Angel Island Immigration
Station Historical Advisory Committee in 1974 to promote the
restoration of the immigration entry point. Following the group's
recommendations, the state of California financed that restoration
with $250,000. The site was then opened to the public, and it is
now visited by about 300,000 people each year. Chow himself gave
docent tours of the station in his free time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Chow founded the Angel Island Immigration Station
Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to continue
advocating on both state and federal levels for historical
designation of the site and for a museum in the barracks, similar
to the one on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, part of Chow's vision was accomplished when the
Interior Department designated the site a National Historic
Landmark. Quan, the foundation's president, credited Chow's
persistence for that designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very concerned about the telling of forgotten chapters
of history,'' Quan said, ``and he wanted to make sure that this
particular chapter in history got told.''
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Lowe, a documentary film maker and vice president of the
foundation, first met Chow when she was researching ``Carved in
Silence,'' a 1988 documentary about those detained and employed at
Angel Island. The greatest contribution to the preservation effort
was Chow's ability to convey to people the significance of the
immigration center, Ms. Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was very effective in inspiring the imagination and the
hearts of people to the fact that this was not a story of
statistics,'' she said, adding that he was able to ``translate into
human terms, the cost of exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   For his preservation work &UR; ,  &LR;  Chow received awards and
commendations from President Jimmy Carter, the Internal Revenue
Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Most
recently, on June 18, he was honored with the Free Spirit Award
from the Freedom Forum, a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation focused
on journalism and First Amendment issues, for ``his vision in
seeing the lessons that could come from a place that had meant fear
and despair to so many.''
 &UR;  &LR; From 1964 to 1976, Chow was also a member of the Juvenile Justice
Commission in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quingpoy Chow, who was born in 1928 in San Francisco,
graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a
degree in civil engineering. He later joined the California
Department of Transportation in 1953 as a junior engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Chow is survived by his wife of 20 years, Dorothea Char; his
children, Gail and Gary Chow; his stepchildren, William Char and
Patricia Char Miller; two brothers, Frank and Martin Chow; two
sisters, Ruby Huey and Betty Tom, and and four grandchildren.

INVESTIGATORS IN SQUEEGEE SHOOTING FOCUS ON REQUEST TO OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators are exploring the possibility that a
New York City police officer charged with trying to kill a squeegee
man in the Bronx last month may have asked another officer to cover
up for him in the minutes after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may need your help on this,'' Officer Michael Meyer told
Officer Sheila Hennessy about 20 minutes after the June 14
shooting, according to court papers unsealed Tuesday. Investigators
said they were looking into the possibility that the remark was a
request for a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday to a charge
of attempted murder in the shooting of Antoine Reid, a squeegee man
who had put soap on his windshield while he was stopped in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's lawyer, Bruce Smirti, said he did not believe that Meyer
had asked anyone to cover up the crime or commit perjury to protect
a fellow officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smirti called that interpretation a ``sinister spin,'' and
added, ``People normally don't like to get involved as witnesses,
and he was saying, `Look, you're going to have to testify.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has been
investigating whether the first detectives on the scene tried to
prepare their reports to make it appear that Reid was trying to rob
Meyer. Witnesses, and Reid, have said that Meyer shot Reid after
becoming enraged, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the shooting, according to the court papers, Meyer
told the first police officers who arrived: ``He tried to rob me.
He hit me in the face. He hit me with the squeegee.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was arrested the night of the shooting and arraigned
Tuesday on charges of attempted murder, two counts of assault,
criminal use of a firearm and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meyer has been in trouble with the department before. After he
accumulated an unusually high number of civilian complaints
accusing him of using excessive force on duty, he was removed from
patrol and placed in the department's building maintenance section,
where he would have little contact with the public. But he was
allowed to keep his 9-millimeter service pistol, the handgun that
prosecutors say he used to shoot Reid.
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately after the shooting, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, the officers' union, appeared to distance
itself from Meyer by saying that because the shooting occurred
while he was off duty, it had not decided whether to pay his legal
fees. Tuesday, Smirti and union officials said the union would pay
the fees.
</P>
<P>
   Several union leaders and dozens of officers were in the Bronx
courtroom Tuesday for Meyer's arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are backing him, and as the facts unfold, I believe you'll
see why,'' said Dan Tirelli, a union financial secretary in Queens.

WATKINS ABBITT, 90, FORMER VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watkins Abbitt, a Virginia Democratic congressman who advocated
school segregation but supported a black candidate for governor
more than 30 years later, died on Monday at Virginia Baptist
Hospital in Lynchburg, Va. He was 90 and lived in Appomattox, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Abbitt had been suffering from leukemia, said his son, Watkins
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Abbitt, a native of Appomattox who was still working as a lawyer
as recently as last week, spent most of his life in politics. He
served in the House from 1949 until retiring in 1973, representing
the 4th Congressional District in rural south-central Virginia, and
from 1964 through 1970 he was chairman of the state Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   A leading figure in the political machine led by Sen. Harry Byrd
that ruled Virginia's Democratic Party for more than 35 years,
Abbitt was a strong voice in efforts to resist court-ordered
integration of Virginia's public schools in the 1950s. He called
the Supreme Court's ban of racial segregation in the landmark 1954
case Brown vs. Board of Education ``the naked and arrogant
declaration of nine men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the epitome of old, conservative rural Virginia,'' said
Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of
Virginia, describing a political style that embraced segregation
along with traditional conservative positions, including support
for farmers and businessmen and opposition to increases in federal
authority and spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbitt's fervor for segregationist policies waned,
culminating with his support for Douglas Wilder, who became the
United States' first elected black governor in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins Abbitt Jr., a member of the Virginia House of Delegates
from Appomattox since 1985, said his father's change of heart had
had much to do with ``raising a family that included three
enlightened children,'' referring to himself and his two sisters,
Anne Abbitt Kerr of Appomattox and Corinne Abbitt Hynes of
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ran, I supported the Equal Rights
Amendment,'' Abbitt said. ``At the time, nobody else in Southside
Virginia supported the Equal Rights Amendment. Except for my two
sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Virginia Democrats said the elder Abbitt had been too
shrewd a politician not to soften his views as Virginia's
electorate turned moderate. They ascribed his early support for
segregation as the politically expedient course for someone
representing a region that was closely tied to the Old South, and
his denunciation of it as the expedient course when it was no
longer politically prudent to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made by the Virginia political leadership in
the '50s to actively resist integration,'' said Craig Bieber, the
executive director of the state Democratic Party. ``Wat had active
input in the decision-making process to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   As decades passed and even rural areas of Virginia learned to
accept integration, Abbitt ``evolved in his thinking about black
people and progressiveness in Southside Virginia,'' Bieber said.
That led Abbitt to support a series of Democratic candidates for
governor: Charles Robb in 1981, Gerald Baliles in 1985 and Wilder
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Abbitt's son explained his father this way: ``He came 180
degrees. He worked as a lawyer for free for any black church that
needed him. We're even having a black minister speak at his
funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his children, Abbitt is survived by his second
wife, Mary Ann Schmidt Abbitt; two brothers, Herbert of Appomattox
and Charles of Austin, Texas, and two sisters, Dora Abbitt Conner
of Appomattox and Eloise Abbitt Snead of Lynchburg, Va. His first
wife, Corrine Hancock Abbitt, died in 1989.

DEFENDANT SPOKE OF WANTING TO BOMB SUBWAY, AGENT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal agent testified Tuesday that a man charged
with plotting to explode a powerful pipe bomb in a New York City
subway told him that he had wanted to bomb a rush-hour train on the
B line in Brooklyn ``because there are a lot of Jews that ride that
train.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar, is one of two
Palestinian immigrants on trial on charges of conspiring to bomb
the subway. Prosecutors say they were motivated by a hatred of
Israel and Jews generally, and by opposition to the peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first trial testimony to cite a specific subway line
as a target. The B line runs through Brooklyn's Borough Park
section, home to one of the city's most concentrated populations of
Orthodox Jews, on its route between Coney Island, Brooklyn, and
Manhattan and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Michael Anticev said in the second week of the federal
trial that Abu Maizar also told him during questioning that he had
been only hours away from placing the bomb on July 31 during that
morning's rush when the police raided his apartment in Park Slope,
Brooklyn, shortly after 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar, 24, and the second defendant, Lafi Khalil, 23, were
shot and wounded in the raid, in which the police said they seized
a ``fully rigged'' pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Abu Maizar have not disputed that their client had
the bomb, but they have maintained that he did not intend to
explode it. Rather, they have suggested that he planned to use it
as a prop in a plot to defraud a government anti-terrorism program
of reward money. Khalil's lawyer has not yet addressed the jury,
but Khalil told investigators after his arrest that he had not
known that the bomb existed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The defendants were shot, officers testified earlier in the
trial, because they feared that one was trying to set off the bomb
and that the other was trying to grab an officer's gun. Anticev
questioned Abu Maizar in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar's lawyer, Jan Rostal, sought Tuesday to cast doubt on
the reliability of her client's purported statements. Although
Anticev said that Abu Maizar had been ``alert and responsive''
during questioning, Ms. Rostal suggested during her
cross-examination that Abu Maizar could not have been able to speak
rationally, because he had been in surgery for several hours
earlier and was under medication.
</P>
<P>
   She got the agent to acknowledge that Abu Maizar ``was in
obvious pain'' and that he had not recorded the session.
</P>
<P>
   Anticev also testified that before they talked, he had told Abu
Maizar that he had a right to remain silent. Ms. Rostal implied in
her questions that Abu Maizar's medical condition meant that his
waiver of his rights was not truly voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reena Raggi interrupted the testimony to tell the jury
that the issues it would decide would include whether Abu Maizar
had made the statements Anticev attributed to him, and whether they
were voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the raid, the police said the defendants had
been planning to blow up the busy Atlantic Avenue subway station in
downtown Brooklyn, but more recently investigators have not spoken
of that station. The B line does not stop at that station, but it
does stop at the Pacific Street station, which is connected to it.

PATAKI'S FUND-RAISING EFFORT SURPASSES '94 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki has collected $15.5 million for
his re-election effort, surpassing his total for the entire 1994
campaign and apparently far outpacing his Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki took in $4.3 million in the first half of this year
alone, according to figures released by his campaign Tuesday night.
If he continues harvesting money at this rate, he is likely to rank
as one of the most successful fund-raisers in the history of state
politics. Four years ago, when he was an Republican state senator,
Pataki collected more than $14.5 million in defeating the
Democratic incumbent, Mario Cuomo, who raised more than $11
million.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has $12.2 million on hand, after spending $3.3 million in
the first half of the year, mostly for television and radio
advertising and fund-raising events, according to a summary of his
disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Details on contributors to the governor's campaign will not be
available until Wednesday, when the full report is to be filed with
state election authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The four Democratic contenders did not release figures Tuesday
but are expected to on Wednesday. In their last disclosure in
January, the Democrats reported having far less money than Pataki,
who has hewed to a strategy of raising money aggressively
throughout his term in order to avoid having to do so in the final
weeks of his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats with the biggest bank accounts as of January
were Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, both of whom had raised more than $2 million. The
vast majority of Ms. McCaughey Ross' money came in a single
contribution from her husband, the financier Wilbur L. Ross Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, did not respond to phone
messages Tuesday night. But she has said in the past that he has
excelled at fund-raising because people are pleased with his
policies on issues like crime, welfare and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have contended that the governor's fund-raising is
unseemly, pointing out that much of the money is from donors with
interests before the state government.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his own campaign money, the governor can also rely on
the financial support of the New York Republican State Committee,
which has been collecting record sums since Pataki took office in
1995.

   NEW YORK _ Would District Attorney JEANINE PIRRO of Westchester
County really rather be a fashion model? There she is, one of 30
women in ANNIE LEIBOVITZ photographs in a 32-page magazine
advertisement for Anne Klein, the struggling sportswear
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   But no, she is not trading politics for photo shoots and day-in,
day-out dieting. She found that posing with LISA LESLIE, the
women's basketball star _ and being attended to by makeup and hair
stylists _ was ``awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This, I thought, was an opportunity to say women could be and
do anything they could do and still have a soft side,'' she said.
``I think there are women who still don't feel they have the same
opportunities as men, but the women in this campaign are successful
women. They're women out there doing it without being anorexic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, times have changed. ``When I was a little girl
growing up in Elmira and said I wanted to be a lawyer, people would
say, `Don't you want to be a mother?''' she said. ``I grew up
thinking they're mutually exclusive. Now my son says, `Mom, can
boys be DAs?'''
</P>
<P>
   `Abbie!' Is a Movie!
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbie!,'' a film about Abbie Hoffman, the 1960s radical who
helped organize the protests at the 1968 Democratic convention in
Chicago, will go into production, exclamation point and all.
VINCENT D'ONOFRIO will play Hoffman, JANEANE GARAFOLO his ex-wife
ANITA, and KEVIN CORRIGAN his fellow Yippie JERRY RUBIN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's 37-year-old son ANDREW, who runs a soup kitchen in
Cambridge, Mass., is complaining that he has not been consulted.
``I would like them to have the input of his children,'' Andrew
Hoffman said. ``Abbie's entire life was about the youth of America,
and I think that I would have a lot to offer. I was at the Chicago
Seven trial when I was 8 years old. I was witness to a lot of
important political moments in the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s, and
I'm just saying, hey, what about me, don't forget the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT GREENWALD, the producer of ``Abbie!,'' said that he did
not want to forget anyone, and added that Anita Hoffman would
appear in a courtroom scene.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hoffman said he was worried that ``Abbie!'' would be
``Abbie meets `Starsky and Hutch.''' But at least Greenwald met
Abbie Hoffman before his death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point when he was underground, he was in Los Angeles
and he wanted to meet a few people, which I assumed would be three
people hiding in a car someplace,'' Greenwald said. ``Instead, it
was this incredibly elaborate dinner in a restaurant, 25 people
sitting on the floor. He'd taken over the entire restaurant. He was
fearless.''

   Fretful for Flowers

   NEW YORK _ After the 74-foot-tall Christmas tree was finally
turned into mulch a few weeks ago, DAVID MURBACH turned his
attention to Rockefeller Center's $3.5 million flower and garden
show, which opens Wednesday night. It is, he declared as he
scurried beneath the 25-foot-high faux mountain that has appeared
between 48th and 51st streets, the only true outdoor flower show in
the country (no tents).
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest fear I have is always torrential downpours,'' said
Murbach, the manager of Rockefeller Center's gardens division. ``A
hailstorm would be horrendous. Hail destroys flowers and destroys
leaves, which in a garden is bad. Flowers bloom out a week or two
later. In a garden show, you don't have that leeway. We're on the
stage, the performance is now.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough of summer. Christmas is just around the corner, as
far as he is concerned. So when will he pick this year's tree?
``I'll be making my decision shortly,'' he said. ``There's a
miniature-train garden from the New York Botanical Garden in the
show that's called Christmas in July. It's a way of reminding me
that I don't have much time.''

STARS OPT FOR YOUTH, SPEED IN TRADING VETERAN BASSEN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Dallas Stars yesterday made a move toward youth and speed,
but they continue to lose toughness.
</P>
<P>
   In shipping veteran left winger Bob Bassen to the Calgary
Flames, the Stars were not so intent on getting versatile center
Aaron Gavey in exchange as they were in opening a spot on the left
side for promising prospect Jamie Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the emergence of Jamie Wright and with some of our other
left wingers, we decided we needed to give them a chance to play,''
said Doug Armstrong, assistant to Stars general manager Bob Gainey.
``We're sad to see Bob Bassen go, but this is a move that helps us
get younger and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassen, 33, was injured for much of his three seasons with the
Stars. But during the playoffs the past two seasons, he was an
important contributor, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wright, 22, gave the Stars a new dimension in the
playoffs _ speed. That speed could become even more important as
the NHL continues to try to reduce obstruction and open the game by
moving the goal line two feet forward next season, making it
tougher for goalies to play the puck and increasing the need for
speedy forecheckers to run the dump-and-chase style of offense.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wright, the Stars likely will also give burly
prospect Jason Botterill the chance to get some playing time on the
left side.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey, 24, is by no means a ``throw-in'' on the deal. At
6-foot-1, 195 pounds, he is a durable checking line center who
likely will be pegged as a reserve this season and a possible
replacement for Guy Carbonneau, who at 38, is playing year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey, who is scheduled to make $525,000 this season, played in
26 games for the Flames last season, scoring two goals and adding
three assists to 24 penalty minutes. In 156 career NHL games, he
has 18 goals and 18 assists with 126 penalty minutes. He might be
best known for the 1996 on-ice accident in which he was struck in
the face by a skate and required 120 stitches to close the gash.
</P>
<P>
   Bassen, who was the Stars' first big free-agent signing with a
four-year, $4 million contract in 1995, played 117 regular-season
games for the Stars, scoring eight goals and adding 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the town of his birth with the trade _ a place his
family still calls home. Bassen's dad, Hank, was an NHL goalie for
nine seasons and still is one of the better-known figures in
Calgary.  &LR; tagtop:Mike Heika (817) 390-7760
