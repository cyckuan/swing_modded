   LOS ANGELES _ Way up in the nether regions of Staples Center,
where the air is thinner and the beer is just as expensive, the
fans know they're in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie Mendoza from North Hollywood sits at the top row of
section 330, located in a dark corner way above the Los Angeles
Lakers bench and excitedly stands, jumps and bangs her noisemakers
as the Pacers attempt free throws, even though she's too high and
way out of the camera's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' she said. ``I think they can hear me. Don't
you think so?''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, 28, is here with her boyfriend, John Urteaga of Los
Angeles. Urteaga bought the pair of $37 tickets from a friend of
his because the friend had to work. The two also attended Game 2
and sat in almost as bad seats across the way in the upper reaches
of section 304.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is complaining, of course. The beer tastes great, people
nearby let them use their binoculars, and they're feeling pretty
festive, Urteaga in his ``Los Angeles Lakers Since 1960'' shirt and
Mendoza in her Kobe Bryant home jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see pretty good,' Urteaga said. ``The best crowd's
always up here. The rich people are mellow. We're glad to see the
Lakers, and we can't afford the expensive tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza can't either, but that doesn't diminish her enthusiasm.
She visited friends in Hawaii while the Lakers played in
Indianapolis and said she was the only one rooting for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else was for the underdog,'' she said, ``so before I
came tonight, I called them. How can you beat this?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she could. She was at the Forum that June night in
1988 when the Lakers last won an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Johnson,'' she gushed. ``He was really hot, the way he
played.''
</P>
<P>
   On that night, she sat in a loge-level seat, courtesy of her
father's company. On Monday night, she sat far higher and felt just
as much elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be here, come on!'' she screamed above the noise.
``Even if I was outside, I'd be cheering the same way.''

FOREST STILL MUGGY AFTER 12 LONG YEARS

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A dozen years ago this month, on a hot, humid day, they
buried Officer Ken Collings.
</P>
<P>
   I stood with a somber crowd of uniformed cops outside SS. Simon
and Jude Roman Catholic Church and watched the first vehicles of
the funeral motorcade appear to the south on 27th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The procession of cars and motorcycles passed through heat waves
rising from the pavement as if they were rolling through a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than a week since Collings had been shot during a
robbery at a Valley National Bank branch on - McDowell Road. One of
the two men responsible was still on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the stickup I talked to a young guy named Jeff
Haines, who was driving on McDowell when the robbers made their
getaway. Haines saw what was happening and, without thinking,
rammed his truck into their car. It didn't stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Other civilians kept track of the suspects, though, helping
police corner one of them at the Syl-Mar Apartments on Camelback
Road.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shootout, leaving one robber, Ismael Conde, wounded
and captured. He later was convicted and sentenced to almost three
centuries in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Rudy Romero, got away, supposedly headed for
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For the officers who stood outside the church as Collings'
casket was slowly unloaded, the thought of Romero running free was
as unavoidable and as uncomfortable as the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But we're all supposed to feel better, now.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, Romero was caught and wounded during a
shootout in southern Mexico. For years, law enforcement officials
have had a pretty good idea where Romero was hiding out. They've
had trouble getting cooperation from Mexican authorities, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government won't extradite suspects in cases that
could draw a death sentence, like this one. Besides that, fugitives
have been known to pay off Mexican law enforcement officers to
avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Romero visited Phoenix more than once in the 12
years since the murder. But now he's caught, and since Arizona
prosecutors promised not to seek the death penalty, he's expected
to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
   And we're supposed to feel better. Relieved.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Romero finally will face American justice, after
having enjoyed 12 years of freedom. Twelve years to go where he
wanted and do what he wanted. Twelve years of everyday living.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if we're lucky, Arizona taxpayers will get to pay for
Romero's room and board for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel better?
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but look at it from Romero's perspective. If you
were in his shoes, would you rather spend the rest of your life in
a hellhole of a Mexican prison, or in one of Arizona's?
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Collings was shot I ran into a nephew of his,
Gary Howes, at the apartment complex where Conde was wounded. The
police fired round after round at the guy.
</P>
<P>
   `And the bastard lived, can you believe that?` Howes said. `He
lived after all those shots, and Kenny . . . Kenny gets it with
one. . . . It isn't right. It isn't right.`
</P>
<P>
   No, I told Collings' nephew, it isn't right. It wasn't then.
It's not now. &QL;

DODGERS SUSPENSION APPEALS SET FOR WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In April, the Los Angeles Dodgers began the season
with a three-city road trip that was paramount to a strong start to
ease nerves.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Dodgers went on a four-city, 12-game road
trip that wouldn't make their season, but could've possibly
destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight being what is, the importance placed on those road
trips is laughable when measured against what begins today. And it
has nothing to do with playing three games against the Houston
Astros and nothing about the St. Louis Cardinals. Even the possible
return of catcher Todd Hundley is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the shape of a season could be decided in five hours
Wednesday afternoon in a conference room when most of the 16
suspended Dodgers and officials from the players association and
Major League Baseball meet in a mass appeals hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of the commissioner's
office, will listen to arguments decrying the severe sanctions
stemming from a May 16 altercation involving many of the Dodgers
and the fans at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have survived injuries to Kevin Brown, Adrian
Beltre, Kevin Elster, who was at the time their starting shortstop
but is now in a platoon, and Hundley. They made it through a month
without closer Jeff Shaw recording a save, mostly because he had a
``dead arm'' and lost velocity on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Though one can never say it would be the final hurdle for this
organization during Fox's tenure, the next very, very large step
has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we weathered the storm,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``We have one little other thing in Houston, but
things are setting up pretty good for the second half (of the
season).''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials quietly believe a good number of the players'
suspensions, totaling 60 games with fines adding up to $57,000,
will either be wiped out or reduced. But the focal point of the
hearing will be Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of it is there are many facts that aren't in
evidence that we believe were not considered prior to the ruling,''
said Scott Boras, Kreuter's agent. ``That's really what this case
is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was hit the heaviest among the players, suspended eight
games and fined $5,000. And it's his case that could have a
trickle-down effect. Dodgers players have been instructed not to
talk about the incident, and they've held true to that.
</P>
<P>
   Boras said Kreuter went into the stands only after he was struck
in the back of the head and had his hat stolen by Josh Pulliam, who
works for a subsidiary of the Tribune Company, which owns the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was on his way out of the stands when he was attacked by
other fans, Boras said. An integral part of Kreuter's case is that
he was provoked into putting his hands around the neck of another
fan, Ronald Camacho, and Boras has a series of still-frame photos
that he says proves his case. It will also be brought up that
Camacho, who has filed a civil suit against the Dodgers, Cubs and
each player, has been arrested at least nine times since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The photos, in succession, show Camacho walking toward Kreuter
and spitting on the Dodgers' backup catcher. The argument is that
was provocation for Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the commissioner's office, including Sandy
Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations, and
Frank Robinson, vice president of on-field operations and the man
who levied the suspensions, said players should never go into the
stands, no matter the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Boras, and the players association, is also expected to contest
the severity of the suspensions, and point out that former Dodger
Reggie Smith was suspended five games and fined $5,000 when he went
into the stands after a fan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the hearings will be Carlos Perez (suspended five
games), F.P. Santangelo (five), Gary Sheffield (five), Mike Fetters
(four), Terry Adams (three), Geronimo Berroa (three), Darren
Dreifort (three), Shawn Green (three), Hundley (three), Eric Karros
(three), Onan Masaoka (three), Antonio Osuna (two) and Chan Ho Park
(three). Alan Mills (three) was traded to Baltimore but is still
appealing the suspension and Eric Gagne (three) was sent to the
minors, though his case will also be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and players association believes a number of players
with three-game suspensions will have their time dropped or cut
because some suspensions were based solely on a player stepping
over the wall into the stands and turning right back around and
returning to the field.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the case of serving the suspensions. In the
original ruling, because of the number of suspensions, Robinson set
forth the dates on which each player was to begin serving his
suspension. The Dodgers don't agree with that tack, saying that's
managing the team and questioning why Major League Baseball should
decide which player sits against which team.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of Dodgers officials believe baseball will
still dictate when players serve suspensions if the sanctions
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the three suspended coaches - Glenn Hoffman, Rick Dempsey
and John Shelby - and bullpen catcher Travis Barbary are scheduled
to have their cases heard today. The coaches were each suspended
eight games and Barbary was suspended five games. Each were fined
$5,000. They are being represented by the Dodgers.

EX-CARDINAL FACES RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Luis Sharpe hasn't lived in Cuba for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   His five children are in Phoenix with his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers and sisters settled in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Arizona Cardinals lineman could be sent back to
Cuba, deported after serving time for his most recent drug charge.
Sharpe remains detained in Florence, while INS officials decide his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   `He has very little, if any, connection to Cuba,` said Marc
Budoff, Sharpe's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ahr, special assistant to the INS director, said he
couldn't comment on Sharpe's case. However, he did say that people
who are not U.S. citizens can be deported if they break state or
immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe never became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, immigration judges remove as many as 9,000 people
from the Phoenix District. They are barred from returning for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr said judges don't consider how long a person has been away
from his home country. And statistics aren't kept on the number of
years deportees have been away.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring in 1994, the former Pro Bowl player has struggled
with drugs. From November to January, he was arrested twice for
drug-related charges. He was sent to prison in March.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, Budoff said, Sharpe had planned to enter a
rehabilitation program. &QL;

`DIGITAL DIVIDE' PUTS POOR CHILDREN AT DISADVANTAGE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A teacher at St. Vincent's child care center
was explaining how computers work to a preschool class when she
picked up the mouse and asked if anyone knew what it was called.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rat,'' a little boy answered.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he doesn't have a computer at home. In fact, there's
a fair chance he doesn't even have a telephone. Safe bet, too, that
he doesn't know what the Internet is.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this child stack up against children who've been
logging on since they were old enough to sit up straight? And not
just today, but years down the road in college and later in the job
market?
</P>
<P>
   That problem is a focus of Kids Count 2000 released today by the
Annie E. Casey Foundation. The report, which tracks child welfare
state by state, contends the country's ``digital divide'' is
depriving millions of poor children of the latest technology,
putting them at a disadvantage in education and, eventually,
employment.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that 84 percent of families in low-income urban areas
have no computer. Among all families, that figure is 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made that computers and the Internet are still
new enough that not everyone should be expected to have those, but
the report also says that 50 percent of families in low-income
urban areas don't have a car. And those have been around for a
century.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 percent of those poor families don't have a telephone.
Among all families, that figure is 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has lots of families where every member has a
cell phone, and we've got 5 million children who don't have any
phone at all,'' Bill O'Hare, national Kids Count coordinator, told
The Kansas City Star on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report is the 10th compiled by the Casey Foundation,
an advocacy organization based at the University of Maryland. The
group's mission is to provide public policy makers with data that
identify problems and help mold programs to make life better for
children. It is one of the more comprehensive studies of child
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The study looks at 10 areas, including rates for low-birthweight
babies, child poverty, high school dropouts, teen births and teen
death by violence.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that fewer Missouri teens are having babies, but more
are dropping out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Missouri ranked 32nd among the 50 states in child
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas showed a decrease in the number of children living in
poverty, but a jump in the number of children living in
single-parent households.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's troubling because we know the odds are stacked against
those kids in terms of financial and emotional support,'' said Gary
Brunk, executive director of Kansas Action for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas ranked 15th overall.
</P>
<P>
   States with the best showings overall were, in order, Minnesota,
New Hampshire and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The worst numbers came from, in order, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of this year's Kids Count was ``the haves and have
nots'' of critical supports that many middle-class families take
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Families without cars are cut off from jobs and schools. Those
without phones are cut off from friends and relatives. Those
without computers are cut off from information.
</P>
<P>
   These families have been barely touched by the economic boom of
the 1990s, said Douglas W. Nelson, president of the Casey
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Vincent's, 3039 Troost Ave. in Kansas City, about 60
percent of the 400 children live in homes without telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The school might have several emergency numbers for a child, but
those numbers often are not working, said Kim Jacobs, the center's
director of social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have kids who have a phone this month, but won't have
it next month,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she visited a class at an elementary school in the
Shawnee Mission School District and asked which students had a
computer at home. Each raised a hand.
</P>
<P>
   She later posed the same question to a class at St. Vincent's.
</P>
<P>
   Only one child's hand went up.
</P>
<P>
   And for those children who do have computers, the units are
often cast-offs with outdated software, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has gotten better for a lot of people, but our
families are just as poor as they were,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this year's Kids Count:
</P>
<P>
   - Missouri's child poverty rate held at 19 percent while the
country's rate worsened to 21 percent. The state's teen birth rate
improved with 30 out of 1,000 females ages 15 to 17 giving birth,
compared to 32 out of 1,000 females nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's high school dropout rate rose with 11 percent of
teens 16 to 19 being listed as dropouts, up from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Kansas ranks among the best nationally with only 19 percent of
children living with parents who do not have full-time, year-round
jobs. The state also had a 7 percent improvement in the rate of
overall child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of children living in single-parent households
jumped 29 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationally.

LATEST DIRECTOR OF MARSHALS SERVICE HAS IMPRESSIVE LINEAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John W. Marshall embodies two enduring
participants of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Thurgood Marshall, was a crusading NAACP lawyer and
later a U.S. Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   And now the younger Marshall is director of the U.S. Marshals
Service, whose deputies once escorted scores of black children in
the often violent struggle for school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mantle that Marshall wears lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it much,'' Marshall said in an interview
in Kansas City on Monday. ``But I take a lot of pride in both.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who was sworn in to the director's job last fall, is
in Kansas City this week to meet with deputies based here and to
address a national sheriffs convention.
</P>
<P>
   If he seems modest about his heritage, it is because the task of
leading the nation's oldest law enforcement agency into the 21st
century is now first on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service was founded by the first Congress in
1789 to enforce federal court orders, make arrests and handle
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In the country's westward expansion, deputy U.S. marshals
brought law and order to the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Marshall said, the service's primary mission remains
protecting federal judges and the courts, and enforcing their
orders. Deputies also face an array of tasks never imagined by its
founders 211 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marshals transport nearly 200,000 prisoners a year on its ``Con
Air'' inmate airline as well as administer the federal witness
protection program. They even help guard nuclear warheads and
missiles when the weapons are moved between military facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshals Service also is responsible for the daily housing
needs of more than 32,000 federal prisoners awaiting trial or
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But solidifying the marshals' most basic police function _
arresting fugitives and putting them in jail _ has Marshall's
attention now. Deputy U.S. marshals make about 55 percent of the
federal felony arrests recorded each year. With additional
deputies, Marshall said, they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Marshall submitted an aggressive budget
request, still under consideration in Congress, that would suspend
a hiring freeze and allow him to add 400 officers to the force of
about 4,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fugitive apprehension is an area where I'd like to see us
expand,'' Marshall said. ``But we can only do that with additional
people. We don't have enough deputy marshals who come in and work
strictly fugitives. It's all about getting dangerous people off the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 41, comes by his interest in basic police work from
his early days. While a student at Georgetown University he became
friendly with a member of the Virginia State Police, who soon sent
recruiters his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said his career choice, which included stints as a
Virginia State Police motorcycle patrol officer and narcotics
investigator, caught his father by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was very supportive,'' Marshall recalled. ``It helped
him seeing things from the bench as the father of someone in law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, President Clinton appointed the younger Marshall
as U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Virginia. That paved
the way for his appointment as director of the service last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now his weeks are filled trying to convince Washington
policy-makers that the mission of the Marshals Service remains
vital in an era where federal law enforcement might appear
fragmented in a rainbow of FBI-DEA-ATF acronyms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the word out about the Marshals Service and
educate our political leaders about what it does,'' Marshall said.
``We need to get the attention of Capitol Hill about what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's tenure as director of the Marshals Service barely
touched the 1990s, a decade that was not kind to the public
perceptions of some federal law enforcement agencies, with episodes
at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Marshall, however, said he was determined
to run the service in a manner that honored both its heritage and
the standards for which his father fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said law enforcement can be done properly when you don't
cut corners,'' Marshall said. ``He thought it could be one of the
noblest professions in the country.''

 INVESTIGATORS IN SERIAL MURDER CASE TURN TO k-sTATE ANTHROPOLOGY (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A week ago investigators working on the John
E. Robinson Sr. serial murder case thought they'd solved the final
two pieces in a macabre puzzle by tentatively identifying the last
two women found in a Cass County storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators figured Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 were
Sheila Dale Faith and her daughter, Debbie Lynn Faith. Authorities
had linked the Faiths to Robinson, a 56-year-old Olathe, Kan., man.
Robinson has been charged in the deaths of five women found in
barrels in the locker and on Robinson's Linn County, Kan.,
property.
</P>
<P>
   But the dental records and X-rays didn't match up.
</P>
<P>
   So now investigators will look to Michael Finnegan, a professor
of anthropology at Kansas State University, for help.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster said Monday that he hopes
that Finnegan, an expert in forensic anthropology, can provide more
clues about the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get basic information, such as the age of
women and the time period in which they have been dead,'' Koster
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using skeletal remains, Finnegan said, he can determine a
person's age, sex, stature and race or ancestry. Police can then
compare that information to profiles of missing people.
</P>
<P>
   Koster and Finnegan will discuss later this week whether the
tests should be conducted in the Kansas City area or whether the
remains should be taken to Finnegan's lab in Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about half of the investigators who had been working
on the Robinson case returned to their regular jobs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen investigators from several departments remain on the
Lenexa-based task force, tracking down new leads and working on the
murder cases against Robinson, said Lenexa, Kan., Sgt. Rick Roth,
the team's spokesman. Detectives are trying to narrow down the
times when several women connected to Robinson were last seen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five dead women for which Robinson is
charged, authorities are investigating the disappearances of five
other women and a baby.
</P>
<P>
   As media across the country pick up news about the
investigation, the task force has received calls from people who
knew Robinson or his alleged victims. But the phone call load, now
30 or so a day, is just a trickle compared to the flood of calls
when police first made their three-month investigation public early
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have talked to people on the phone but have not
flown to meet them in other states, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leads have come from other police agencies. Police
in Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb, asked the task force
whether Robinson might be connected to one of their old murder
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some women in trash cans, but we're satisfied that he
was in prison when that happened,'' Roth said. Real Jesse James
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan has been called on before by authorities and military
personnel worldwide. Among his more notable cases: verifying the
identity of outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of a J. Frank Dalton believe the outlaw faked his
death in Missouri, assumed the name Dalton and moved to Texas,
where he died in 1951 at age 104.
</P>
<P>
   Those relatives recently secured a court order to exhume the
body in Texas for testing.
</P>
<P>
   But DNA tests done in 1995 indicate that the real Jesse James is
buried at Kearney, in Clay County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texans are having some difficulty with that,'' Finnegan
said. ``But that is Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   When examining human remains, Finnegan said, he could use any
number of about 30 tests.
</P>
<P>
   To determine race and ancestry, he looks to the nose, or more
precisely, the nasal aperture. In African-American skulls, the
opening is wide and squat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an upside-down valentine,'' Finnegan said.
</P>
<P>
   For those of western European origin, the opening is longer and
``droopy and skinny'' at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators already know that the two unidentified
women found stuffed in barrels died of blows to the head, little is
known of how long they have been dead.
</P>
<P>
   But by studying any trauma inflicted on the bodies before,
during or after death, Finnegan may be able to answer some of those
questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for determining age, that science is more precise with
youngsters than with adults.
</P>
<P>
   If the unidentified person is 7 or younger, Finnegan said, he
can estimate the age within six months. Clues such as loss of front
teeth and the presence of certain teeth are telltale indicators, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hip bone is another good indicator of age. In teen-agers,
the bone's surface resembles ``a freshly plowed field,'' Finnegan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, those ridges erode and modify, the furrows
fill up and you get a smoothing of the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That technique works well up until age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, scientists can examine other sections of bone,
which change constantly from birth until 80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of cases Finnegan has worked, only three victims
remain unidentified, he said. In all three cases, no missing person
report seemed to match the data from Finnegan's tests.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said even if the two Jane Does are never identified, he
is prepared to continue with his case against Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible they may go as Jane Doe indefinitely,'' he said.
``It's conceivable that we may never know who these women are.''

VICTIMS OF GRAHAM RENEW EXECUTION CALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SALATHEIA BRYANT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ While protesters in Austin pleaded with state
officials to keep Gary Graham alive, his victims lined up in
Houston on Monday to plead that the debate over the convicted
killer end in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, meanwhile, said he was considering Graham's
last-minute appeals before his scheduled execution by lethal
injection Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers from the Department of Public Safety arrested
about two dozen Graham supporters, who had to be dragged from the
driveway of the Governor's Mansion late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While a crowd of about 150 protesters chanted anti-Bush slogans,
several Austin police in riot gear and DPS troopers marched
lockstep, 14 abreast, shouting ``Move!'' before approaching the
crowd, cuffing the protesters and dragging them to waiting police
vans.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's victims said the demonstrations turned their hellish
ordeals into a political ploy. In a news conference organized by a
victims' rights group, they expressed their wish that the execution
be carried out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Sanford, who said he was robbed at gunpoint by Graham in a
parking garage after Graham pretended to need directions,
questioned whether celebrities who have called for a new trial for
Graham would like him released to their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are personally offended by it, and it's all in the game of
trying to abolish the death penalty,'' Sanford said. ``Anyone who
has sympathy or compassion for Gary Graham, they are either sadly
misinformed or they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the criminal justice department has one less case to
worry about after Thursday,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted of capital murder for killing Bobby Lambert
during a May 1981 robbery in a supermarket parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has gained local, national and international support for
a new trial. His supporters include movie stars and political
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca Jagger with Amnesty International USA delivered to Bush's
Austin office a letter of support for Graham signed by Hollywood
celebrities, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to hear Graham's most
recent appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only action pending in the case is the petition lawyers
Jack Zimmermann and Richard Burr filed to the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles asking for a full or conditional pardon, a
120-day reprieve for a hearing or a commutation of his death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Included in their information to the board was a 26-minute video
of an interview with Sherian Etuk and a 23-minute interview with
Ronald Hubbard, who both worked at the supermarket in 1981. Neither
testified at trial, but they believe the killer was shorter than
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters complain that Graham didn't receive adequate
representation at trial and challenge the eyewitness testimony of
Bernadine Skillern. Skillern was the only witness at the scene of
the shooting to positively identify Graham at trial. She remains
convinced she picked the right man.
</P>
<P>
   But two jurors, Dennis Graham and Bobby Pryor, told ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' on Monday they would have found him innocent if they
had heard all the evidence that has come to light since and if Gary
Graham's lawyer, Ron Mock, had presented a more compelling case.
</P>
<P>
   During a flight from Austin to Portland, Ore., for his
presidential campaign, Bush reiterated to reporters his support for
capital punishment but said he's giving thoughtful consideration to
the last-minute appeals of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``People view me as a sensitive person on the subject. But
they've also got to know I'm going to stand on principle,'' Bush
said. ``The principle is the death penalty is administered justly
and fairly to save lives. I believe that. Not only do I believe
that, the people of my state believe that. It's the law of the
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush can unilaterally grant 30-day reprieves or he can grant
other relief if recommended by the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, I've been spending a lot of time on it. I'm
doing more when I get back (Wednesday night),'' Bush said. ``I
review each case very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could intervene in cases where lawyer competency is
an issue or innocence is claimed, Bush said, ``That's what the
appellate process is for. We're going to make sure we set the
precedent for DNA (retesting). I'm open-minded about reforms to the
system, but the appellate process is there to review, to make sure
a person has full access to a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will be in Texas on Thursday when Graham is
scheduled for lethal injection. He said he expects the parole board
to make its final ruling today or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police linked 22 crimes, including the Lambert murder, to Graham
during a weeklong violent crime spree. He was convicted of 10
aggravated robberies but said he did not shoot Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County prosecutors say Graham's case has been reviewed
more than 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   The four Graham victims sat next to each other at the news
conference with one empty chair at the table marked for Bobby
Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Justice for All President Dianne Clements said victims Lisa
Blackburn, David Spiers, Greg Jones and Rick Sanford survived their
encounters with Graham. Jones and Spiers told of being shot by
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each and every one of them survived the manipulation,
deception and brutality of Gary Graham ...,'' Clements said,
recollecting that Graham allegedly told Jones, ``I'm just a
hustler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still hustling today,'' Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn introduced herself as Gary Graham's last victim.
</P>
<P>
   She said Graham abducted her in 1981, when she was a 57-year-old
cabdriver, at a gas station. She said he took her to a vacant place
and repeatedly raped her. Eventually they went to her house. There
he took her valuables, shot up the walls of her apartment and
threatened to take her to the Fifth Ward and sell her.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Graham got undressed and fell asleep. She then took
his gun and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Her ordeal with Graham lasted five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he kept saying to me: `I've killed three people, and
I'm going to kill you ....' I believed him,'' Blackburn said.

TWO SHARE BOND THAT ENDS WITH LOVE, TEARS AND MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ He was the biker who calmed her tears. She
was the little girl who made him cry.
</P>
<P>
   What a love story they told.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Hutchison found Tiffany at a hospital. She had suffered
severe brain damage during birth and had cerebral palsy. She
couldn't see or hear. Doctors said she would soon die. Nobody
wanted her.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a 6-foot-2-inch Harley rider with a ponytail and
tattoos, took her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be here for you,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the promise more than 15 years. Tiffany died Monday at
her home in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss her already,'' Hutchison said a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on the front porch, out of the light rain that fell in
the midafternoon. Hospice workers carried out medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she wanted to hang on through Father's Day,'' he said
in a breaking voice. ``She gave me a watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift had been purchased by Hutchison's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers of The Kansas City Star will remember their story.
Hutchison was working as a paramedic that September day in 1984
when Tiffany was born at Truman Medical Center. Her mother, who was
mentally disabled, didn't even know she was pregnant. She gave
birth while sitting in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The umbilical cord was wrapped around the infant's neck,
shutting off oxygen to her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who had taken a patient to the hospital, heard about
the baby and went to see her. Her spine was severely curved. Her
hips and shoulders were deformed.
</P>
<P>
   He thought she was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse told him the baby was headed to an institution where she
probably would soon die.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with his wife and son, Hutchison took Tiffany
home. She survived that winter and the one after that. Hutchison
and his wife adopted her in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has since divorced, with him prevailing in a custody
fight for Tiffany. Then in 1993, Hutchison's son, Chad, was killed
in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tiffany were on their own. He tended her every need.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with the Missouri Division of Family Services praised
his dedication to Tiffany. His touch often was the only thing that
calmed her.
</P>
<P>
   He took her on dates, letting women know up front they came as a
package.
</P>
<P>
   But he always knew he could lose her. Doctors told him that
Tiffany's heart was working too hard and could give out any time.
</P>
<P>
   So every morning when he left for his job installing lights and
ceiling fans, he kissed her as if the day would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   He promised her that as long as she fought, he would fight for
her.
</P>
<P>
   And he told her that when she got too tired to fight, he would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   That time came Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to let Tiffany go was made last week after doctors
said her body was shutting down and rejecting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends gathered at the home. Hutchison knew Sunday
night the time was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her little heart just kept getting weaker and weaker and it
finally stopped,'' he said. ``She was a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany also was a teacher. Just ask those who knew her best.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has lived a half-century and ridden his bike all over
the country, but says Tiffany taught him about life, love and
family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Eilene, whom he married last fall, said she was a
little scared of the responsibility of Tiffany's medical care when
she began dating Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is the sweetest thing in the world, and she taught me
how little we all really need to live and be happy,'' Eilene said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Tiffany died, Hutchison leaned over and kissed her
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll hurt no more, baby,'' he whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Later, out on the porch, he looked back on 15 years with the
little girl he found by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered whether two parents couldn't have done it
better. But then she'd smile, and I knew nobody could love her more
than me.''

HIGH COURT SLAPS DOWN MASSACHUSETTS' BURMA ACT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court dealt a blow Monday to state and
city governments' efforts to levy sanctions against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a unanimous decision, struck down a 1996
Massachusetts law barring state agencies, under most circumstances,
from contracting with companies with financial ties to the country
whose military regime has renamed it Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Massachusetts could not use its economic
muscle to keep companies from doing business with Burma's rogue
regime because the law infringed on the federal government's power
to determine U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter, writing for the court, said the
Massachusetts law ``is at odds with the president's intended
authority to speak for the United States among the world's nations
in developing a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to bring
democracy to and improve human rights practices and the quality of
life in Burma.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have long accused Burma of abuses ranging
from the use of slave labor to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law barred the state government from awarding
a contract to a company doing business in Burma, unless that
company's bid was 10 percent better than all other competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision upheld a federal appeals court in Boston's
ruling a year ago that the law was unconstitutional.

   By April 1998, 346 companies _ including 44 U.S. firms _ were on
Massachusetts' list of undesirable contract partners. A number of
other municipal governments, including New York City, Los Angeles
and San Francisco, have passed similar ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, three months after the Massachusetts law went
into effect, Congress imposed sanctions on Burma. And in May 1997,
President Clinton issued an executive order barring new U.S.
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the federal action, the National Foreign Trade Council,
a Washington-based group representing 550 U.S. firms doing business
overseas, sued Massachusetts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the court agreed with the trade council's contention
that federal law pre-empted the Massachusetts statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not merely that the differences between the state and
federal acts in scope and type of sanctions threaten to complicate
discussions; they compromise the very capacity of the president to
speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with other
governments,'' Souter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly, in a prepared
statement, said state officials were disappointed by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this law addressed basic human rights and allowed the
state to decide who it did business with,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties were divided over the scope of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormously powerful victory for those of us who
believe that foreign policy is to be made at the national level and
the national level only,'' said Gregory Castanias, an attorney with
Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue in Washington who had represented the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stumberg, an attorney representing 78 lawmakers from
Capitol Hill supporting Massachusetts in the lawsuit, said the
court sidestepped some of the broader questions about state and
local sanctions, limiting the ramifications only to Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials had argued in the case that Congress had
failed to forbid state and local governments from enacting
sanctions. County and city sanctions laws were common during the
1980s as a way of non-federal governments underscoring their
opposition to South Africa's practice of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we never ruled on whether state and local sanctions
against South Africa in the 1980s were pre-empted or otherwise
invalid, arguable parallels between the two sets of federal and
state acts do not tell us much about the validity of the latter,''
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal Corp., Texaco and Houston-based Baker Hughes are among
companies that have done business in Burma in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal is still a partner in an offshore natural gas field and
gas pipeline that transports gas across Burma to the border with
Thailand. Texaco and Baker Hughes have pulled out, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that engagement is the way to bring
about change in countries like Burma, and our record and our
history in Asia shows that is the proper course to follow,'' Unocal
spokesman Barry Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said none of the state or local sanctions have affected his
company.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, 99-474.

the country is expected to approve a new law that would give it the

   NUKE-ENRICHMENT (Bethesda, Md.) _ Ever since Richard Nixon

federal government quit the business of enriching uranium for
nuclear power plants. It took decades but the Clinton
administration finally pulled it off two years ago, with Vice
President Al Gore claiming it as a victory for reinventing
government. But it may have came at the worst possible time. The
government never ran the enterprise particularly well. Since
privatization, however, the company has done much worse. The price
of shares in United States Enrichment Corp., as the new company is
known, closed Monday at $4.6875, down from $17.50 soon after the

BANK ROBBER'S ATTORNEY DEALS TO AVOID POSSIBLE COUNTERSUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; An attorney for North Hollywood bank robber Emil
Matasareanu said Monday that he will dismiss a civil rights lawsuit
against two Los Angeles police officers if they agree not to sue
for ``malicious prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley Gage, an attorney for one officer, said John Futrell
intends to sue attorney Stephen Yagman to recover the $300,000 in
lost earnings and attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost to my client has been horrible,'' Gage said after a
hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. ``He no longer works
for the Los Angeles Police Department. He's a security guard now.
He was falsely accused by Mr. Yagman of being a cold-blooded
murderer, which we know is untrue. That's defamatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a federal judge declared a mistrial in the case after
jurors deadlocked 9-3 in favor of the officers, who were accused of
allowing Matasareanu bleed to death after the rolling gunbattle on
streets near a Bank of America branch in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Brian Lysaght, whom Yagman enlisted to help settle the
case, said he has asked the judge to dismiss the case with
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to cut off what would become a malicious prosecution
tennis match, we have asked the judge to make it clear in her
dismissal that the police didn't prevail at trial, that there was a
hung jury and that those conditions cut off any possibility of any
frivolous litigation,'' Lysaght said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Christina A. Snyder said she would
send the attorneys to another judge to attempt to mediate the case.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said if the city of Los Angeles agrees to pay the attorney
fees, that would be an ``acceptable'' resolution to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant City Attorney Thomas C. Hokinson said the city
has no intention to pay Gage's fees.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman and Matasareanu's children decided to seek dismissal of
the case because there is no reason to suspect a second jury would
reach a different verdict, Lysaght said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no new facts, and no new evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Snyder dismisses the case without prejudice, that would allow
Futrell to sue the city of Los Angeles or Yagman for his lost
earnings and attorney fees, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the Los Angeles police have often been unfairly
sued and they have a right to respond,'' Gage said. ``This was the
LAPD's finest hour and now the officers find themselves stuck in a
lawsuit without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant City Attorney Don Vincent, who represented retired
Officer James Vojtecky in the trial, said Vojtecky does not intend
to sue Yagman or the city.

ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS LACKS HEALTH INSURANCE, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Despite a booming economy, and insurance costs
well below national norms, nearly one out of four Californians
lacks health insurance, according to a report released Monday by
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
<P>
   The non-insurance rate stands at an even more alarming 40
percent among the state's growing Hispanic population, which helps
explain why Californians of Spanish extraction report the poorest
health of any group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are part of a comprehensive report that compares
California's health care system with that of the nation. The report
by the Kaiser Foundation, which is not affiliated with Kaiser
Permanente, was assembled from government and private data.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Foundation health analyst Larry Levitt, who coauthored
the report, said in addition to finding big differences between
California and the nation, the study revealed a health care divide
between rich and poor Californians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a tale of two states,'' said Levitt, who said
``the dot.com phenomenon'' has simultaneously boosted California's
per capita income ($27,579 here vs. $26,482 in the nation) and left
it with a higher poverty rate (15.4 percent in California vs. 12.7
percent in the U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   The report's most striking finding shows how ethnicity,
immigration status, low insurance rates and poor health status all
converge to the detriment of California's Latino population.
</P>
<P>
   With a lower percentage of whites (50 percent in California vs
71 percent nationwide), a higher percentage of Hispanics (30.3
percent vs 11.7 percent) and more non-citizens (15.8 percent vs 6.1
percent), California lives with several factors that contribute to
its unfavorable health care comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos nationwide have the lowest insurance rate of any
ethnic group, and California has nearly three times as many Latinos
as the national average,'' Levitt said. ``That to a large extent
explains the state's challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic diversity can't explain other troubling findings in
the report. For instance, California employers pay lower HMO
insurance premiums than their counterparts in other states ($405
per month here versus $445 nationwide). Yet only 48 percent of
California employers offer health insurance benefits, compared to
61 percent of employers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a contradiction we can't explain,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry lobby Walter Zelman, president of the
California Association of Health Plans, put a positive spin on the
state's low insurance costs. ``If our insurance costs were higher,
the uninsurance problem would be worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another finding sure to aggravate the ill feelings between
doctors and insurers, the report found that the average California
physician earns about 14 percent less than M.D.s in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Report coauthor Helen Halpin Schauffler, with the Center for
Health and Public Policy Studies at the University of California at
Berkeley, said this finding marked the first statistical support
for California doctors, who have long complained about falling pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, to our knowledge, is the first data'' to back up the
anecdotal complaints of California doctors, Schauffler said. The
disparity cannot be explained away by a physician glut. Whereas
California did have far more doctors, per capita, than the rest of
the nation in 1975, by 1997, the state and the nation were in a
statistical dead heat, with 278 M.D.s per 100,000 people in
California, versus 276 for every 100,000 people in the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Schauffler said the lower pay trend affected both primary care
doctors, who earned $140,500 a year in California versus $161,100
nationwide, and specialists, whose annual salaries topped $222,000
in the rest of the U.S. but were $193,800 here.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings help explain why the California Medical
Association recently made a bit of legal history, by filing a
lawsuit that charged the state HMOs with creating a ``racket'' to
restrain insurance costs and doctors' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Schauffler, who stopped short of endorsing that suit, said the
top five health plans in California _ Kaiser, PacifiCare, Health
Net, CaliforniaCare and Blue Shield _ now control 78 percent of all
health insurance in the state. Nationally, the top five health
plans control 68 percent of all insurance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing cause for concern that the industry in
California and the nation is approaching an oligopoly'' in which a
few insurers dominate health care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for California's lower health insurance costs has
been the fact that large employers here have banded together to
increase their bargaining power vis a vis insurers.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-90s, these bargaining tactics allowed California
employers to cut their insurance premiums by as much as 9 percent.
But beginning with 1998, insurance rates began to shoot up in the 7
percent to 10 percent range, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said those rate hikes are yet another warning for
California and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of the most booming economy many of us have ever
seen, insurance coverage has not increased at all,'' he said. ``It
makes you wonder what would happen if we hit a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said the Kaiser Foundation compiled this comparison
report because California is considered a bellwether for health
trends nationwide. He also said the report was intended as a policy
guide at a time when California's new governor and state
legislature are considering a wide range of health care bills.

 MORE CALIFORNIA OTTERS POP UP IN COASTAL CENSUS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a tentative but encouraging sign for the
imperiled California sea otter, an annual spring census conducted
by the U.S. Geological Survey has found that their numbers
increased in the past year by 11 percent to 2,317 animals.
</P>
<P>
   The census, which covered 375 miles of coastal habitats from
Half Moon Bay to Santa Barbara, also found that the number of new
pups increased by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey's leaders, James A. Estes and Brian Hatfield,
warned that encouraging results from a single year cannot show a
clearly rising trend. It will take at least two or three more
annual counts before wildlife experts are convinced that the otters
are in fact recovering, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's count, teams of spotters based on shore and
aboard boats and low-flying aircraft used high-powered spotting
scopes and binoculars to tally individual otters and mother-infant
pairs.
</P>
<P>
   The teams did their tedious job between 9 a.m. and about 2 p.m.,
a time when the otters are easier to count as they gather to rest
and feed in close-knit groups, called ``rafts,'' amid floating
kelp, Hatfield said. They spend the rest of the day foraging for a
smorgasbord of clams, mussels, snails, prawns, crabs, abalone, sea
urchins and other seafood.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative survey included biologists from the Geological
Survey, the California Department of Fish and Game and the Monterey
Bay Aquarium, aided by a corps of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly extinct by the end of the 19th century after hunters
preyed on them for their water-resistant pelts, the population of
otters along the Northern California coast recovered steadily until
the mid-1970s when growth ceased and the numbers began to decline
again.
</P>
<P>
   They were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act
in 1977, and began to recover after emergency California
regulations restricted the use of fixed fishing nets. But their
numbers have declined once more during the past five years _ due to
a combination of disease, parasites, sharks attacks and
entanglement in fishing gear.
</P>
<P>
   The population increase tallied by the latest survey is
``certainly a reason for some optimism,'' Estes said. ``But it will
take another year or two before we can make a meaningful running
average and know whether the population trend is really heading up
and the period of decline is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea otter populations along coastal areas of the North Pacific
vary widely, Estes said. British Columbia, southeastern Alaska and
Washington state are strongly increasing by rates of 17 percent to
20 percent each year, while the otter population in the Aleutians
has been ``strongly declining'' for several years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animals also populate Russia's northeast sea coast, but the
data on numbers there are inconclusive and there have been reports
of widespread poaching there since the end of the Soviet Union,
Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent estimates by specialists at the Canadian National
Aquarium in Vancouver, B.C., indicate these current sea otter
populations outside of California: In Washington state, 450; in
British Columbia, more than 2,200; in Russia, 13,000; and in all of
Alaska, 150,000.  &LR;

FOREST STILL MUGGY AFTER 12 LONG YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A dozen years ago this month, on a hot, humid day, they
buried Officer Ken Collings.
</P>
<P>
   I stood with a somber crowd of uniformed cops outside SS. Simon
and Jude Roman Catholic Church and watched the first vehicles of
the funeral motorcade appear to the south on 27th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The procession of cars and motorcycles passed through heat waves
rising from the pavement as if they were rolling through a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than a week since Collings had been shot during a
robbery at a Valley National Bank branch on - McDowell Road. One of
the two men responsible was still on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the stickup I talked to a young guy named Jeff
Haines, who was driving on McDowell when the robbers made their
getaway. Haines saw what was happening and, without thinking,
rammed his truck into their car. It didn't stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Other civilians kept track of the suspects, though, helping
police corner one of them at the Syl-Mar Apartments on Camelback
Road.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shootout, leaving one robber, Ismael Conde, wounded
and captured. He later was convicted and sentenced to almost three
centuries in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Rudy Romero, got away, supposedly headed for
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For the officers who stood outside the church as Collings'
casket was slowly unloaded, the thought of Romero running free was
as unavoidable and as uncomfortable as the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But we're all supposed to feel better, now.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, Romero was caught and wounded during a
shootout in southern Mexico. For years, law enforcement officials
have had a pretty good idea where Romero was hiding out. They've
had trouble getting cooperation from Mexican authorities, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government won't extradite suspects in cases that
could draw a death sentence, like this one. Besides that, fugitives
have been known to pay off Mexican law enforcement officers to
avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Romero visited Phoenix more than once in the 12
years since the murder. But now he's caught, and since Arizona
prosecutors promised not to seek the death penalty, he's expected
to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
   And we're supposed to feel better. Relieved.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Romero finally will face American justice, after
having enjoyed 12 years of freedom. Twelve years to go where he
wanted and do what he wanted. Twelve years of everyday living.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if we're lucky, Arizona taxpayers will get to pay for
Romero's room and board for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel better?
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but look at it from Romero's perspective. If you
were in his shoes, would you rather spend the rest of your life in
a hellhole of a Mexican prison, or in one of Arizona's?
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Collings was shot I ran into a nephew of his,
Gary Howes, at the apartment complex where Conde was wounded. The
police fired round after round at the guy.
</P>
<P>
   `And the bastard lived, can you believe that?` Howes said. `He
lived after all those shots, and Kenny . . . Kenny gets it with
one. . . . It isn't right. It isn't right.`
</P>
<P>
   No, I told Collings' nephew, it isn't right. It wasn't then.
It's not now. &QL;

 HUMAN ERRORS ... AND SOME OTHERS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Human error has been cited as the cause of that
hard-drive snafu at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   That brings back memories. I once owned a Hard Drive Snafu, for
my money one of the finest cars ever produced in the Ganges Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's comforting to know that the nation's most secret
nuclear secrets were misplaced by human error, thus ruling out the
alien-robot-invasion theory.
</P>
<P>
   What probably happened is some office flunky was carrying the
hard drives, he stopped at the copy machine to Xerox his rear end,
he heard the boss coming down the hallway, and he scampered away,
forgetting the X files.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the missing computer files will lead to security
reforms. Currently, secret stuff is classified as ``Secret'' or
``Top Secret,'' but now they're going to add even higher categories
like ``Way Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lab guys might have kept better tabs on the hard drives
had they been classified ``Victoria's Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN ERROR was also to blame for the missing excitement at the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody let Tiger Woods into the tournament, despite warnings
that his lack of human error was likely to ruin the competition.
</P>
<P>
   After a desperate search Sunday, tournament officials finally
found all the other golfers hiding behind a copy machine in the
press tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' one of the pros explained, ``we don't want any part of
being on the same golf course as Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, the tournament was only 72 holes long. It
could have gotten  &UR; really  &LR; embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger won the Masters in '97, then spent a year totally remaking
his swing. I hear he is planning to sue his father, his coaches and
the Stanford Athletic Department for malpractice, for forcing him
to spend the first 21 years of his life burdened with a klunky
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's only hope: Tiger starts playing left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   TV ERROR was to blame for the world hearing Tiger swear. Woods
was miked Saturday, and when he duffed a shot he said a bad word.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lacey reveals, ``Tiger's sponsor, Nike, is considering
changing its slogan to `Just % &LR; f it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO women really want?
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's Examiner &AMP; Chronicle singles want-ads, Bob Perry
spotted this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``Very attractive, intelligent, independent SAPF, 38, seeks
handsome, compassionate, well-manured, sincere, unpretentious SPM.
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a fertile relationship?
</P>
<P>
   CEASE &AMP; DESIST, that's what the WebVan people are demanding of
the ArtVanSF folks.
</P>
<P>
   ArtVanSF is a whimsical concept of giving away free art from the
back of an old delivery truck, a playful tweak at the city's (some
say) overpriced and pretentious art-gallery scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the ArtVanSF logo looks a bit like the WebVan logo, so
WebVan is flexing its corporate legal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ArtVanSF`s response? ``We feel violated, angry and uncleaned,
saddened, confused and hungry and slightly chafed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do I sense a no-win situation for WebVan, launching a battle
against two guys with edgy senses of humor and not a lot of money
who are giving away art?
</P>
<P>
   HANGING IN THERE: It's been seven weeks since he was suspended
for his in-court admission that he was horse-trading favorable ink
for political favors, but his name still tops the Examiner's
editorial-page masthead, right under the proud Hearst eagle:
</P>
<P>
   Timothy O. White, Editor and Publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't whoever is actually editing and publishing that paper
get some credit?
</P>
<P>
   HEY, GREAT, we all worked together to coax Steve Young into
retirement seconds before his brain became Jello.
</P>
<P>
   Now all we have to do is work on the several hundred remaining
NFL players who are likely to wind up addle-pated or
severely-gimped by the game.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, taken slightly out of context here, has the best
description of football: ``Stuff breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   I GET MISTY just thinking about how nice it is that San
Francisco named North Beach Playground after Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   But if we're naming civic treasures after famous local heroes,
says Steve Cannata, why not name something after Johnny Mathis?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a home-grown product and a wonderful singer,'' Cannata
notes, ``and he was a track star at Washington High and at S.F.
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis ran hurdles and tried out for the Olympic team in the
high jump.
</P>
<P>
   It might even be a good idea to name a playground after Mathis,
because as Cannata observes, ``His romantic crooning has been
indirectly responsible for a lot of the kids who play on those
playgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAD WHALES, when did they become the Bay Area's No. 1
sightseeing attraction?
</P>
<P>
   On the TV news, the beached whales attract gawkers like flies.
Or is it vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   But if the authorities decide to dispose of the next rotting
whale carcass by blowing it up with dynamite, save me a spot on the
beach.

CALIFORNIA HIGH COURT DISALLOWS INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST  INDIVIDUALS WITH AIDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Giving protection to many people with chronic
diseases, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday that an
insurance company cannot deny disability benefits to a man with
AIDS solely because he was already HIV positive when his policy was
issued.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous vote, the high court held that state law bars
insurance companies from denying benefits to a policyholder who has
been paying premiums for at least two years, even if he has a
disease that was evident before the policy was issued.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those with AIDS, the decision is expected to
protect benefits for people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
disease, cancer and a host of other longterm disabling conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``saves one of the few real protections that
consumers have under health insurance,'' said Peter Groom,
assistant chief counsel for the state Department of Insurance,
which filed a brief in support of the policyholder.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled against Paul Revere Life Insurance Company,
which argued that it did not have to pay benefits to Mark Galanty,
now 52, because he had tested HIV positive almost two years before
he received the disability insurance policy in March 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Galanty, of Studio City, did not disclose the test results when
he applied for the policy. He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The court based its decision on a standard clause in all
disability policies. Insurance companies have two years to screen
for pre-existing conditions and deny benefits. If the insurer has
not uncovered an illness during that time, it cannot halt coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The provision ``bars Paul Revere from denying coverage for
Galanty's disability, whether or not the causative disease first
manifested itself before the policy's date of issue,'' wrote
Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar in the court's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The court reversed a state appeals court decision that said the
insurance company could exclude coverage for pre-existing
conditions. Monday's ruling also overturns a separate state appeals
court ruling against a woman with multiple sclerosis who was denied
benefits by Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has arisen in 17 states, including New Jersey, where
the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major victory for consumers in saying that insurance
companies can't sell you a policy, collect your premiums and then
years later look for an excuse to deny payments,'' said Jon
Davidson, one of Galanty's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to affect a lot of people beyond the HIV
community,'' said Galanty, who worked as a court reporter before he
became disabled from AIDS. After more than four years in
litigation, he said he was thrilled by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that since 1989 insurance companies have been
allowed to test for HIV those applying for insurance policies. But
the lawyer for Paul Revere noted that in this case, the insurer had
no reason to suspect that Galanty had the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Cohen, the lawyer for both Paul Revere and Mutual Life,
said that when Galanty applied for his policy, the company wasn't
allowed to test applicants for the HIV virus. In any event, she
said, ``the insurance companies have to rely on the honesty of the
applicant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a message that you're much better off lying on an
insurance application and concealing your condition,'' she said,
``because if you lay low after two years you get off scot free.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Cohen said, the court's ruling will mean increases
in premium rates for everyone with disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Galanty drew support from a number of AIDS and disability groups
who argued that insurance companies were trying to circumvent a
consumer protection law that has existed for almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert K. Scott, vice chair of the American Bar Association's
disability committee, said it was an attempt by two companies to
say that any prior manifestation of a disease _ even a series of
headaches years before being diagnosed with brain cancer _ allowed
them to deny benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Beach lawyer said that companies can always refuse
to underwrite someone after they conduct an investigation and they
can do further medical checking for two more years after issuing
the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, he said ``protects our consumers for events in
their medical past that even a physician would not have known.''

CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON DNC BAILOUT REQUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; City Council approval as early as Tuesday of a $4
million taxpayer bailout of the Democratic National Convention
would rid Mayor Richard Riordan of a potential $1 million liability
and free the party from pressing Hollywood contributors for money.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of Riordan's conflict of interest over his $1 million
letter of credit to the Convention 2000 Host Committee, and the
lack of a campaign to raise money from celebrities and
entertainment executives who have given heavily to the party, comes
as the council faces an intense lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the eight votes needed to approve the bailout are
assured Alex Padilla from the Northeast Valley and Nate Holden and
Jackie Goldberg. Council President John Ferraro, the leading
supporter, will not attend Tuesday's meeting because of medical
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Only East Valley Councilman Joel Wachs and West Valley
Councilwoman Laura Chick are firmly opposed and Chick expects to
miss the vote for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Host Committee officials acknowledged they have no specific
fund-raising plan devoted to the Hollywood community _ even though
Hollywood's wealthy, including Michael Eisner, Steven Spielberg,
Harrison Ford and Nicholas Cage, to name a few, have given
generously to Vice President Al Gore's campaign and to other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was understood from the start that we would do what we
could to help secure the convention, but that the money to be
raised for it would come elsewhere,'' said Andy Spahn, spokesman
for DreamWorks SKG, the partnership of Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and Host Committee co-chairman David Geffen, all of whom
are heavy contributors to Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to be up to the mayor and Eli Broad and the others to
raise the money while we would be free to concentrate on our
support for the vice president and other Democratic candidates.
There have been some events, but the entertainment industry was
never the primary focus on fund raising for the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Host Committee officials said they have raised all but $2
million of the $35.5 million guaranteed for the convention but that
the demand for more money led to seeking the city's help.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of individuals, the Host Committee relied heavily on 75
mainly corporate donors that include $1 million each from Broad's
SunAmerica, Microsoft, Staples Center, Arco and AT&AMP;T among others
as well as lesser contributions such as the $100,000 each donated
by Times Mirror Co., Amgen, Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher and Riordan's
Original Pantry restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials also expect some help from President
Clinton, who is coming to Los Angeles on Saturday for a
weekend-long fund-raising trip on behalf of Sen. Dianne Feinstein
as well as the state and national Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Clinton's events Saturday will be a fund-raiser for
the convention at Riordan's home, attended by numerous business and
civic leaders who have yet to contribute or given only what are
considered modest amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's conflict on the issue arose because he is among a
group of backers who signed a $1 million letter of credit to be
used by the Host Committee to cover the costs of staging the event.
Others also signed letters of credit that could be protected by the
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Riordan said he is aware of the perception of a
possible conflict, but insist he has not taken any actions that
would affect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why all the requests have come from the Host Committee
and the Democrats and he hasn't taken any actions directly,''
spokesman Manuel Valencia said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the Host Committee, money would be
drawn against the letter of credit when the committee doesn't have
sufficient cash to pay for services, meaning the city allocation
could relieve the mayor of that liability.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the City Attorney's Office said Riordan did not
request a legal opinion on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of City Council members shows nine members are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Even Goldberg's support is contingent on two issues: designating
Pershing Square as a safe ground for protesters and creating a
special ad hoc council committee to monitor police activities up to
and during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Goldberg) has some concerns she would like to see addressed
regarding the protests and make sure they are not ignored,''
spokeswoman Sharon Delugach said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs complained the city doesn't have enough money to provide
adequate services and should not have to bail out the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention will go on no matter what,'' Wachs said. ``The
city shouldn't have to bail them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs appeared on several radio talk shows Monday calling for
public opposition, prompting a number of people to call in to
council offices.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. is having a tough time justifying
the spending, aide Barry Glickman said, while Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski has some misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has some grave doubts about this, but wants to hear the
arguments,'' spokesman Glenn Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming out against the spending was City Controller Rick
Tuttle, who said the arguments in favor of the city making a
contribution were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to set a precedent which will lead those who do
business with the city to believe that if they can just get a
project far enough along, the city will capitulate to any demand?''
Tuttle asked.

LATEST DIRECTOR OF MARSHALS SERVICE HAS IMPRESSIVE LINEAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John W. Marshall embodies two enduring
participants of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Thurgood Marshall, was a crusading NAACP lawyer and
later a U.S. Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   And now the younger Marshall is director of the U.S. Marshals
Service, whose deputies once escorted scores of black children in
the often violent struggle for school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mantle that Marshall wears lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it much,'' Marshall said in an interview
in Kansas City on Monday. ``But I take a lot of pride in both.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who was sworn in to the director's job last fall, is
in Kansas City this week to meet with deputies based here and to
address a national sheriffs convention.
</P>
<P>
   If he seems modest about his heritage, it is because the task of
leading the nation's oldest law enforcement agency into the 21st
century is now first on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service was founded by the first Congress in
1789 to enforce federal court orders, make arrests and handle
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In the country's westward expansion, deputy U.S. marshals
brought law and order to the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Marshall said, the service's primary mission remains
protecting federal judges and the courts, and enforcing their
orders. Deputies also face an array of tasks never imagined by its
founders 211 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marshals transport nearly 200,000 prisoners a year on its ``Con
Air'' inmate airline as well as administer the federal witness
protection program. They even help guard nuclear warheads and
missiles when the weapons are moved between military facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshals Service also is responsible for the daily housing
needs of more than 32,000 federal prisoners awaiting trial or
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But solidifying the marshals' most basic police function _
arresting fugitives and putting them in jail _ has Marshall's
attention now. Deputy U.S. marshals make about 55 percent of the
federal felony arrests recorded each year. With additional
deputies, Marshall said, they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Marshall submitted an aggressive budget
request, still under consideration in Congress, that would suspend
a hiring freeze and allow him to add 400 officers to the force of
about 4,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fugitive apprehension is an area where I'd like to see us
expand,'' Marshall said. ``But we can only do that with additional
people. We don't have enough deputy marshals who come in and work
strictly fugitives. It's all about getting dangerous people off the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 41, comes by his interest in basic police work from
his early days. While a student at Georgetown University he became
friendly with a member of the Virginia State Police, who soon sent
recruiters his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said his career choice, which included stints as a
Virginia State Police motorcycle patrol officer and narcotics
investigator, caught his father by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was very supportive,'' Marshall recalled. ``It helped
him seeing things from the bench as the father of someone in law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, President Clinton appointed the younger Marshall
as U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Virginia. That paved
the way for his appointment as director of the service last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now his weeks are filled trying to convince Washington
policy-makers that the mission of the Marshals Service remains
vital in an era where federal law enforcement might appear
fragmented in a rainbow of FBI-DEA-ATF acronyms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the word out about the Marshals Service and
educate our political leaders about what it does,'' Marshall said.
``We need to get the attention of Capitol Hill about what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's tenure as director of the Marshals Service barely
touched the 1990s, a decade that was not kind to the public
perceptions of some federal law enforcement agencies, with episodes
at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Marshall, however, said he was determined
to run the service in a manner that honored both its heritage and
the standards for which his father fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said law enforcement can be done properly when you don't
cut corners,'' Marshall said. ``He thought it could be one of the
noblest professions in the country.''

LAKERS HOLD OFF PACERS TO WIN NBA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After 12 years, the Los Angeles Lakers finally
gave Hollywood something to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 41 points and Kobe Bryant buried four
late free throws as the Lakers rallied to defeat the Indiana
Pacers, 116-111, to win their first NBA championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled Lakers forward Glen Rice made two free throws for a
112-109 lead with 1:16 left. With 32 seconds remaining, Reggie
Miller rushed downcourt and tossed up a wild3-point shot from 28
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was fouled with 13 seconds to go, and his two free throws
pushed the Lakers' lead to 114-109.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis' rebound dunk brought the Pacers to 114-111 with 5.4
seconds left. But Bryant made two free throws with 2.5 seconds
remaining to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who won the best-of-seven series, 4-2, were so
convinced they were going to wrap up the title Monday night that a
lot of folks around here treated Game 6 as if it were an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a downtown parade, scheduled for Wednesday, were
already mapped out. Some fans were selling championship T-shirts _
two hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers to a Lakers championship party hosted by Magic Johnson
were passed out Sunday night to patrons at a swanky Hollywood
nightclub. Johnson is the Lakers' part-owner and vice president,
and the party is scheduled to take place Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Let the party begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers used a torrid rally in the fourth quarter to ease
past a Pacers squad that led, 25-24, after the first period, 56-53,
at the half, and, 84-79, after three periods.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was voted the Most Valuable Player of the Finals,
completing the full circle. O'Neal was the regular season MVP,
coming one vote shy of it being unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, this wasn't Tiger Woods at the U.S. Open. This
was more like Shane Mosley eking out a decision over Oscar De la
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   But the locals didn't care. All they wanted was the Lakers'
championship banner to be raised into the Staples Center rafters,
and it will be in next season's home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant aided the Lakers' cause with 26 points, and Rice added
16.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 29 points. Miller had 25, Davis
popped in 20 and Austin Croshere added 16. But the Pacers got just
two points on 1-of-8 shooting from center Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took the lead for good with 9:02 left when O'Neal's
layup gave them a 91-90 lead. It was their first lead since late in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, was crying tears of joy
after the game. This was his first championship since he led San
Antonio Cole High School to the 1989 Class 3A state championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say thank ya'll for being here,'' O'Neal told
the crowd. ``And we're going to get one again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if there was going to be a Game 7. The
Pacers were controlling the tempo for most of the night and were
beating back every rally the Lakers threw at them.
</P>
<P>
   But back-to-back rebound dunks by O'Neal, a pair of 3-point
field goals by Robert Horry, and some poor shot selection by Rose,
Croshere and Miller were the main reasons the Lakers will be
partying.

PDQUICK TAKES NEW NAME NATIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Goodbye PinkDot, hello PDQuick.
</P>
<P>
   The home-delivery retailer whose snappy cars have darted around
the streets of Los Angeles and Orange County for more than a decade
is going national.
</P>
<P>
   Under its new name, the company plans to open 30 new locations
and begin doing business in Baltimore, Phoenix, Sacramento, San
Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Washington, D.C., by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Now officially known as PDQuick, the Camarillo-based company
operates 12 neighborhood centers that fill orders coming in via
telephone and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with its new identity, PDQuick has a new Internet
address (www.pdquick.com) and a new phone number (888-PDQUICK). For
phones without the letter Q on the keypad, the number is (888)
737-8425.
</P>
<P>
   PDQuick is entering a volatile market segment fraught with eager
competitors that have ambitious expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Homegrocer.com and Kozmo.com are among them, and the market
segment has been touched by the early dot-com shakeout, with
Peapod.com folding after 10 years of on-demand service.
</P>
<P>
   PDQuick's specialty is convenience items _ popular grocery
brands and prepared foods such as salads and sandwiches _ delivered
quickly for a moderate service charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the market for home-delivery services, particularly over the
Internet, is a growing one, according to Forrester Research, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester analyst Evie Black Dykema predicts on-demand delivery
firms will grow into a $20 billion market.
</P>
<P>
   PDQuick's expansion includes new locations in Southern
California, including the first location to open under the new name
in Fullerton. Sites in Reseda and Long Beach will follow in short
order, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Slama, manager of the Long Beach store that is set to open
July10, said the location will make deliveries between 6 a.m. and 3
a.m., and will employ 60 to 70 people.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-hour operating schedule is a possibility in the near
future, Slama said.
</P>
<P>
   PDQuick chief executive officer Dan Frederickson said the
company intends to dominate the market with its dual sales strategy
that allows customers to order online or by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mandate is simple: to redefine the way customers think
about convenience,'' Frederickson said. ``Our goal is equally
simple: to dominate this fast-growing consumer market on a national
basis just as we already do in one of the largest consumer markets
in the country.''

`DIGITAL DIVIDE' PUTS POOR CHILDREN AT DISADVANTAGE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A teacher at St. Vincent's child care center
was explaining how computers work to a preschool class when she
picked up the mouse and asked if anyone knew what it was called.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rat,'' a little boy answered.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he doesn't have a computer at home. In fact, there's
a fair chance he doesn't even have a telephone. Safe bet, too, that
he doesn't know what the Internet is.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this child stack up against children who've been
logging on since they were old enough to sit up straight? And not
just today, but years down the road in college and later in the job
market?
</P>
<P>
   That problem is a focus of Kids Count 2000 released today by the
Annie E. Casey Foundation. The report, which tracks child welfare
state by state, contends the country's ``digital divide'' is
depriving millions of poor children of the latest technology,
putting them at a disadvantage in education and, eventually,
employment.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that 84 percent of families in low-income urban areas
have no computer. Among all families, that figure is 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made that computers and the Internet are still
new enough that not everyone should be expected to have those, but
the report also says that 50 percent of families in low-income
urban areas don't have a car. And those have been around for a
century.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 percent of those poor families don't have a telephone.
Among all families, that figure is 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has lots of families where every member has a
cell phone, and we've got 5 million children who don't have any
phone at all,'' Bill O'Hare, national Kids Count coordinator, told
The Kansas City Star on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report is the 10th compiled by the Casey Foundation,
an advocacy organization based at the University of Maryland. The
group's mission is to provide public policy makers with data that
identify problems and help mold programs to make life better for
children. It is one of the more comprehensive studies of child
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The study looks at 10 areas, including rates for low-birthweight
babies, child poverty, high school dropouts, teen births and teen
death by violence.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that fewer Missouri teens are having babies, but more
are dropping out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Missouri ranked 32nd among the 50 states in child
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas showed a decrease in the number of children living in
poverty, but a jump in the number of children living in
single-parent households.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's troubling because we know the odds are stacked against
those kids in terms of financial and emotional support,'' said Gary
Brunk, executive director of Kansas Action for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas ranked 15th overall.
</P>
<P>
   States with the best showings overall were, in order, Minnesota,
New Hampshire and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The worst numbers came from, in order, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of this year's Kids Count was ``the haves and have
nots'' of critical supports that many middle-class families take
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Families without cars are cut off from jobs and schools. Those
without phones are cut off from friends and relatives. Those
without computers are cut off from information.
</P>
<P>
   These families have been barely touched by the economic boom of
the 1990s, said Douglas W. Nelson, president of the Casey
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Vincent's, 3039 Troost Ave. in Kansas City, about 60
percent of the 400 children live in homes without telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The school might have several emergency numbers for a child, but
those numbers often are not working, said Kim Jacobs, the center's
director of social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have kids who have a phone this month, but won't have
it next month,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she visited a class at an elementary school in the
Shawnee Mission School District and asked which students had a
computer at home. Each raised a hand.
</P>
<P>
   She later posed the same question to a class at St. Vincent's.
</P>
<P>
   Only one child's hand went up.
</P>
<P>
   And for those children who do have computers, the units are
often cast-offs with outdated software, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has gotten better for a lot of people, but our
families are just as poor as they were,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this year's Kids Count:
</P>
<P>
   - Missouri's child poverty rate held at 19 percent while the
country's rate worsened to 21 percent. The state's teen birth rate
improved with 30 out of 1,000 females ages 15 to 17 giving birth,
compared to 32 out of 1,000 females nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's high school dropout rate rose with 11 percent of
teens 16 to 19 being listed as dropouts, up from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Kansas ranks among the best nationally with only 19 percent of
children living with parents who do not have full-time, year-round
jobs. The state also had a 7 percent improvement in the rate of
overall child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of children living in single-parent households
jumped 29 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationally.

INVESTIGATORS IN SERIAL MURDER CASE TURN TO K-STATE ANTHROPOLOGY
PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A week ago investigators working on the John
E. Robinson Sr. serial murder case thought they'd solved the final
two pieces in a macabre puzzle by tentatively identifying the last
two women found in a Cass County storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators figured Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 were
Sheila Dale Faith and her daughter, Debbie Lynn Faith. Authorities
had linked the Faiths to Robinson, a 56-year-old Olathe, Kan., man.
Robinson has been charged in the deaths of five women found in
barrels in the locker and on Robinson's Linn County, Kan.,
property.
</P>
<P>
   But the dental records and X-rays didn't match up.
</P>
<P>
   So now investigators will look to Michael Finnegan, a professor
of anthropology at Kansas State University, for help.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster said Monday that he hopes
that Finnegan, an expert in forensic anthropology, can provide more
clues about the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get basic information, such as the age of
women and the time period in which they have been dead,'' Koster
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using skeletal remains, Finnegan said, he can determine a
person's age, sex, stature and race or ancestry. Police can then
compare that information to profiles of missing people.
</P>
<P>
   Koster and Finnegan will discuss later this week whether the
tests should be conducted in the Kansas City area or whether the
remains should be taken to Finnegan's lab in Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about half of the investigators who had been working
on the Robinson case returned to their regular jobs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen investigators from several departments remain on the
Lenexa-based task force, tracking down new leads and working on the
murder cases against Robinson, said Lenexa, Kan., Sgt. Rick Roth,
the team's spokesman. Detectives are trying to narrow down the
times when several women connected to Robinson were last seen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five dead women for which Robinson is
charged, authorities are investigating the disappearances of five
other women and a baby.
</P>
<P>
   As media across the country pick up news about the
investigation, the task force has received calls from people who
knew Robinson or his alleged victims. But the phone call load, now
30 or so a day, is just a trickle compared to the flood of calls
when police first made their three-month investigation public early
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have talked to people on the phone but have not
flown to meet them in other states, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leads have come from other police agencies. Police
in Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb, asked the task force
whether Robinson might be connected to one of their old murder
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some women in trash cans, but we're satisfied that he
was in prison when that happened,'' Roth said. Real Jesse James
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan has been called on before by authorities and military
personnel worldwide. Among his more notable cases: verifying the
identity of outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of a J. Frank Dalton believe the outlaw faked his
death in Missouri, assumed the name Dalton and moved to Texas,
where he died in 1951 at age 104.
</P>
<P>
   Those relatives recently secured a court order to exhume the
body in Texas for testing.
</P>
<P>
   But DNA tests done in 1995 indicate that the real Jesse James is
buried at Kearney, in Clay County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texans are having some difficulty with that,'' Finnegan
said. ``But that is Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   When examining human remains, Finnegan said, he could use any
number of about 30 tests.
</P>
<P>
   To determine race and ancestry, he looks to the nose, or more
precisely, the nasal aperture. In African-American skulls, the
opening is wide and squat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an upside-down valentine,'' Finnegan said.
</P>
<P>
   For those of western European origin, the opening is longer and
``droopy and skinny'' at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators already know that the two unidentified
women found stuffed in barrels died of blows to the head, little is
known of how long they have been dead.
</P>
<P>
   But by studying any trauma inflicted on the bodies before,
during or after death, Finnegan may be able to answer some of those
questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for determining age, that science is more precise with
youngsters than with adults.
</P>
<P>
   If the unidentified person is 7 or younger, Finnegan said, he
can estimate the age within six months. Clues such as loss of front
teeth and the presence of certain teeth are telltale indicators, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hip bone is another good indicator of age. In teen-agers,
the bone's surface resembles ``a freshly plowed field,'' Finnegan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, those ridges erode and modify, the furrows
fill up and you get a smoothing of the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That technique works well up until age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, scientists can examine other sections of bone,
which change constantly from birth until 80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of cases Finnegan has worked, only three victims
remain unidentified, he said. In all three cases, no missing person
report seemed to match the data from Finnegan's tests.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said even if the two Jane Does are never identified, he
is prepared to continue with his case against Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible they may go as Jane Doe indefinitely,'' he said.
``It's conceivable that we may never know who these women are.''

MILLER PUTS SCARE INTO LAKERS WITH A TORRID START 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even after he had mimicked his coach, the great
Larry Bird, in three straight games in Indiana, there were
questions. Which Reggie Miller would show up at the Staples Center
on Monday night? The one who had been confounded by the
surroundings and backdrop of Los Angeles's cavernous arena, or the
one who had laid waste to the Lakers' vaunted defense with a flurry
of points that not even Shaquille O'Neal's domination could
overcome?
</P>
<P>
   The glamorous crowd surrounding the court found out almost
immediately. Miller scored 7 points in the first quarter alone, his
final basket of the period coming on a 3-pointer. It was clear from
that point on that the man who had missed 15 of 16 shots in Game 1
was not in the building.
</P>
<P>
   And while Miller was not enough to keep Los Angeles from
winning, 116-111, to claim its first National Basketball
Association championship since 1988, it was enough to put a scare
into the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who averaged 31 points in leading Indiana to two
victories in three games at the Conseco Fieldhouse, continued his
wicked shooting on Monday night in Game 6, finishing with 25 points
to keep the outcome in doubt until the waning moments. Strong all
night, he started a late-game run that nearly foiled the Lakers'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 minutes 41 seconds remaining, Miller hit a 22-footer from
the left corner to move Indiana within 5 points. The Pacers pulled
within 1 point, but then, with the Lakers ahead by 112-109, Miller,
shooting quickly and perhaps ill-advisedly, missed a 26-footer with
30 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   When Glen Rice grabbed the rebound for Los Angeles, the
celebration began.
</P>
<P>
   Though Miller had been so spectacular of late, shooting 51
percent over all and 55 percent from 3-point range over the last
three games, there was doubt as to whether he could replicate those
performances in Los Angeles. Like the rest of the Pacers, he had
found the Lakers' new arena a tough place to sink baskets. In four
games at the Staples Center, including two regular-season losses to
the Lakers and the woeful Clippers, Miller had shot just 32.8
percent from the floor. From behind the 3-point line, where he is
one of the best ever, he was only 2 for 18.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation abounded as to why Miller and the Pacers, who shot
39.5 percent in their three previous road games against the Lakers,
had struggled so in Staples. The Pacers said they got the same
shots in Los Angeles that they did in Indiana, so it wasn't
necessarily the Lakers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bird mentioned that the background of the baskets in the
cavernous arena might have been responsible. Miller, who scored
just 28 points on 8-of-32 shooting in Games 1 and 2, made no
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it feels any different,'' Miller said before the
game. ``It's just missed shots. They're making shots, so there
can't be anything wrong with the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The rims and their background were no issue on Monday night. The
Pacers shot 50 percent in each of the first two quarters. Along
with Jalen Rose who scored 12 points in the first half, Miller was
the dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's performance in the finals, in which he averaged a
team-best 24.2 points over the first five games, added to a
tremendous postseason for Miller, a 34-year-old soon-to-be free
agent. After failing to lead Indiana in regular-season scoring for
the first time since 1990, Miller took back the team's top role in
the playoffs, averaging 23.9 points.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he put on some outstanding performances and, not
surprisingly, was at his best in the most crucial times. With the
Pacers facing the possibility of a first-round elimination against
Milwaukee, Miller scored 41 points, his postseason career high, in
Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   In the next game, he set the tone for the series against
Philadelphia by recording 40 points, 21 of them on 3-pointers. And,
of course, against the New York Knicks, he scored at will over
Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Chris Childs in posting 17 of
his 34 points in the fourth quarter of the deciding Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Though he clearly feeds off of pressure, Miller claimed to be
playing stress-free against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure on us,'' he said after Game 5. ``From the
get-go, they were supposed to beat us, to sweep us.''
</P>
<P>
   From the get-go, observers should have known that Miller would
not let that happen. &QL;

TWO SHARE BOND THAT ENDS WITH LOVE, TEARS AND MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ He was the biker who calmed her tears. She
was the little girl who made him cry.
</P>
<P>
   What a love story they told.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Hutchison found Tiffany at a hospital. She had suffered
severe brain damage during birth and had cerebral palsy. She
couldn't see or hear. Doctors said she would soon die. Nobody
wanted her.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a 6-foot-2-inch Harley rider with a ponytail and
tattoos, took her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be here for you,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the promise more than 15 years. Tiffany died Monday at
her home in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss her already,'' Hutchison said a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on the front porch, out of the light rain that fell in
the midafternoon. Hospice workers carried out medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she wanted to hang on through Father's Day,'' he said
in a breaking voice. ``She gave me a watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift had been purchased by Hutchison's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers of The Kansas City Star will remember their story.
Hutchison was working as a paramedic that September day in 1984
when Tiffany was born at Truman Medical Center. Her mother, who was
mentally disabled, didn't even know she was pregnant. She gave
birth while sitting in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The umbilical cord was wrapped around the infant's neck,
shutting off oxygen to her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who had taken a patient to the hospital, heard about
the baby and went to see her. Her spine was severely curved. Her
hips and shoulders were deformed.
</P>
<P>
   He thought she was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse told him the baby was headed to an institution where she
probably would soon die.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with his wife and son, Hutchison took Tiffany
home. She survived that winter and the one after that. Hutchison
and his wife adopted her in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has since divorced, with him prevailing in a custody
fight for Tiffany. Then in 1993, Hutchison's son, Chad, was killed
in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tiffany were on their own. He tended her every need.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with the Missouri Division of Family Services praised
his dedication to Tiffany. His touch often was the only thing that
calmed her.
</P>
<P>
   He took her on dates, letting women know up front they came as a
package.
</P>
<P>
   But he always knew he could lose her. Doctors told him that
Tiffany's heart was working too hard and could give out any time.
</P>
<P>
   So every morning when he left for his job installing lights and
ceiling fans, he kissed her as if the day would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   He promised her that as long as she fought, he would fight for
her.
</P>
<P>
   And he told her that when she got too tired to fight, he would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   That time came Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to let Tiffany go was made last week after doctors
said her body was shutting down and rejecting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends gathered at the home. Hutchison knew Sunday
night the time was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her little heart just kept getting weaker and weaker and it
finally stopped,'' he said. ``She was a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany also was a teacher. Just ask those who knew her best.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has lived a half-century and ridden his bike all over
the country, but says Tiffany taught him about life, love and
family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Eilene, whom he married last fall, said she was a
little scared of the responsibility of Tiffany's medical care when
she began dating Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she is the sweetest thing in the world, and she taught me
how little we all really need to live and be happy,'' Eilene said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Tiffany died, Hutchison leaned over and kissed her
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll hurt no more, baby,'' he whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Later, out on the porch, he looked back on 15 years with the
little girl he found by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered whether two parents couldn't have done it
better. But then she'd smile, and I knew nobody could love her more
than me.''

EX-CARDINAL FACES RETURN TO CUBA

(PHOENIX) - Luis Sharpe hasn't lived in Cuba for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   His five children are in Phoenix with his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers and sisters settled in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Arizona Cardinals lineman could be sent back to
Cuba, deported after serving time for his most recent drug charge.
Sharpe remains detained in Florence, while INS officials decide his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   `He has very little, if any, connection to Cuba,` said Marc
Budoff, Sharpe's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ahr, special assistant to the INS director, said he
couldn't comment on Sharpe's case. However, he did say that people
who are not U.S. citizens can be deported if they break state or
immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe never became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, immigration judges remove as many as 9,000 people
from the Phoenix District. They are barred from returning for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr said judges don't consider how long a person has been away
from his home country. And statistics aren't kept on the number of
years deportees have been away.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring in 1994, the former Pro Bowl player has struggled
with drugs. From November to January, he was arrested twice for
drug-related charges. He was sent to prison in March.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release, Budoff said, Sharpe had planned to enter a
rehabilitation program. &QL;

LAKERS PRODUCE A TITILE FOR TINSELTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal spent much of the
last four years trying to meet high expectations, and deal with
heartache and the perception that they were simply too young and
immature to seize a world championship. Hurdle after hurdle, their
Los Angeles Lakers team leapt over everyone this season _ until
only Reggie Miller and the resilient Indiana Pacers remained.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, before a screaming crowd at the Staples Center,
the Lakers sailed to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   With Coach Phil Jackson folding his arms in serene contentment,
having won his seventh title in the last nine seasons, the Lakers
won their first National Basketball Association championship under
his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering down the stretch, coming from behind for three
quarters, O'Neal, Bryant and Los Angeles finally caught the Pacers,
winning by 116-111 in Game 6 and securing the franchise's first
title of the post-Magic Johnson era.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal completed a majestic triple-crown season _ he had won the
scoring title and the league's most valuable player award _ by
scoring 41 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, and being named MVP of
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Few shots were bigger than the running floater he hit on the
right side with just over nine minutes remaining. Hit by Derrick
McKey and Austin Croshere, O'Neal somehow converted the layup that
gave the Lakers their first lead since the last second of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When Rick Fox put in a soft 3-pointer from the left wing with
less than nine minutes left to give the Lakers a 4-point lead, the
Lakers had scored on their last nine possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who ended with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists,
dropped in a 22-footer from the right wing with 3 minutes 28
seconds remaining that gave the Lakers a 109-103 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also closed the Pacers out. Hitting a pretty turnaround
from the left baseline about 15 feet away, he gave the Lakers a
4-point lead when Indiana was drawing close.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, he was dunking in missed putbacks, bringing the fans
to their feet and the Pacers to their knees. The Lakers won the
series, four games to two, and won all three games they played at
their home arena.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 29 points and Miller added 25.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. Down by 7 points in the fourth quarter, the
Pacers roared back. Rose tied the game with a 3-pointer from the
right baseline with 5:04 remaining that forced the Lakers to call a
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry, Ron Harper and the stingy Lakers defense also
played an important role in the Lakers' first title since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were trying to become the seventh team in National
Basketball Association history to recover from a 3-1 deficit in a
seven-game series and the first team to accomplish the feat in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three quarters, they looked determined to force a
Game 7. Moving the ball around the perimeter, getting clutch
shooting from Miller and Rose and inspired play off the bench from
Croshere and Sam Perkins, Indiana was in command.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow the Lakers found the missing element from their
fairy-tale season, the one thing they needed to erase the
perception that they lacked a killer instinct: the hammer, a
fourth-quarter performance so dominating that nothing could be left
to chance in a deciding game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They found it, and that is why the streamers and confetti
descended from the rafters, the embroidered championship hats and
T-shirts were distributed and O'Neal, having scored more than 40
points in three of the six games, grinned wide and proud and hugged
Bryant, his 21-year-old teammate, as the buzzer sounded and the
party began.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers misfired on many opportunities through three
quarters. As Los Angeles recovered from 7- and 8-point deficits in
the third, Bryant missed a short pull-up shot in the lane when the
Lakers were trailing by 1. Rice then missed two free throws on the
next possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were within a point several times at the end of the
quarter, only to be repelled from taking the lead. When Rose put in
a difficult jumper over O'Neal at the third-quarter buzzer, giving
him 18 points in the game, the Pacers took a 5-point lead into the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers possessed two of the league's top five players,
the Pacers have shown they have a better team from Miller through
their 12th man. Never was this more apparent than during a flawless
possession with less than nine minutes left in the third quarter,
when all five Pacers touched the ball before the score.
</P>
<P>
   Rose threw an entry pass to Dale Davis on the left block. Davis,
with nowhere to go, found a cutting Mark Jackson in the lane. With
the defense collapsing, Jackson flipped it to Rik Smits on the
right baseline, who unselfishly gave it Miller behind the 3-point
line on the right wing. The shot was good, the exclamation point to
a ball-movement clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, an ordained minister, threw up a prayer from a few feet
inside midcourt to end the first quarter. It hit only nylon,
sending the Pacers in front by 26-24.
</P>
<P>
   But down by as many as 12 points in the quarter, the Lakers
bailed themselves out before intermission. With Bryant harassing
Jackson in the backcourt and O'Neal cleaning up the offensive
glass, they went on a 6-0 run in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Outplayed for much of 24 minutes, the Lakers went to the locker
room trailing by only 3 points, 56-53. They looked reinvigorated,
capable of putting the Pacers away early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is as it seems with this Lakers team.

BIRD'S SWAN SONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a sickly, strangely exciting feeling Larry
Bird felt Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The same feeling he has before every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous; I'm scared,'' he said. ``And it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no apprehension in his voice, no emotion. His anxiety
was buried somewhere deep inside his gut, and he needed no rhetoric
- no Norman Dale ``Maybe we don't belong here!'' that Gene Hackman
performed for us so beautifully in ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was nervous and scared, but he felt no fear.
</P>
<P>
   He knew his team belonged here, and so did his players. Which is
why they played with the kind of heart that forced a series against
a clearly superior team to reach six games, and nearly seven.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird coached his final game for the Indiana Pacers on
Monday, a 116-111 loss. He approached it as he did his first, and
he flatly stood by his word that his tenure would last three years
and no more.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a great basketball player, he was denied the finish because
of injuries,'' said Pacers assistant coach Mel Daniels, a man who
coached Bird at Indiana State and has known him for as long as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think right now maybe he thinks he has carried this
program as far as he could carry it and it's time to step back,''
Daniels said. ``So it's a statement of how good he really is. I
think getting to the Finals is the culmination of his entire career
in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three years brought two trips to the Finals, a
regular-season record of 147-67 - his .686 winning percentage the
best for that time span in Pacers history. He won consecutive
Central Division titles and the NBA named him its Coach of the Year
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As long as his players play hard, Bird fears nothing - win or
lose. What he does fear, what terrifies him, really, is
underachieving. Austin Croshere, the Santa Monica native who grew
up idolizing Magic Johnson at a time when Bird, too, was an idol,
hardly spoke to Bird his first two seasons with the Pacers. Bird
knew Croshere was too soft, too eager to sit out with a minor
injury, too wide-eyed at the talent that now surrounded him in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   For a year now, beginning in summer league, Bird has ridden
Croshere softly but mercilessly. ``Don't be a sissy,'' Bird told
him. And often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constantly,'' Croshere said. ``Just walking by me. ... Without
eye contact, or even stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, no one who watched these Finals would consider saying that
about Croshere, the Pacers' most consistent player throughout - at
least not without risking Bird's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when the in thing may be to yell and scream, act
crazy and draw attention, here's a coach that simply coaches the
game, prepares his team, believes in us,'' Indiana guard Mark
Jackson said. ``He has faith in us and trust in us and allows us to
go out and play the game and never panics.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic is for those who are desperate, those who fear the future.
Bird embraces the future as few former professional athletes can.
Bird was desperate in the final moments of Monday's game, but only
for the men who again brought him to this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``After going three years with these guys and knowing that some
of them have come to the end of their careers, knowing that they
work very hard for me, they've had an opportunity to win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for them. I'm happy they're here. If we'd won the
whole thing, I'd be more happy for the players than I would for
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bird the coach will never be remembered for his tactical genius.
He has relied on two veteran assistants - Rick Carlisle and Dick
Harter - for that, especially in the first season. He knows a
coach, foremost, must make his players fulfill their potential, a
philosophy likewise mastered by Phil Jackson and painfully lost on
Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come a long way,'' Bird said. ``I've been very fortunate
to pick a team of guys that play hard for me. That's the key in
this league. If your guys play hard, you'll win a lot of games. If
you got talent, you'll have an opportunity to play for the world
championship. And that's what these guys have done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Bird did for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing is, it doesn't just happen,'' said Chris Mullin,
who has been around long enough to know. ``The same things that
made him a great player make him a great coach - dedication, hard
work, being consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The same things ensure Bird will be successful no matter what
follows. His team played hard; he succeeded. He succeeded simply by
bringing the series back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jack Nicholson had to shake Bird's hand when the buzzer
sounded Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Daniels put it, ``It's time to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird will return to his home in Florida, and he does not yet
know what that something else is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's been a great ride,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You knew, with Larry Bird, there is no other kind.

SPORTS COLUMN: AUERBACH WON'T JOIN THE BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Jackson won his seventh championship in nine
seasons on Monday night. When the Los Angeles Lakers found a way to
get past the Indiana Pacers, 116-111, their coach had won a title
without the greatest player in the history of the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   So, irrespective of what his supporters and detractors think, he
can do it without Michael. People are talking about his genius _
his ability to get his players to perform at their highest levels _
in the same vein they once talked about Red Auerbach, whose Boston
Celtics won 11 titles in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder what Red thinks.
</P>
<P>
   From his home outside Washington, the former Celtics patriarch
has been watching the NBA finals. He still enjoys the games. But he
doesn't understand the fuss over Jackson, the need to anoint him
the greatest coach of his era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any place he's gone, he's had the team given to him,'' the
82-year-old Auerbach said before Monday night's game. ``I had to go
make my team and put it together. I had to draft the players
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry West gives him a team, and Jerry Krause gives him a
team. And he goes ahead, and he wins with those teams. He's a good
coach, but let's not get carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   Either out of spite or wounded pride, Auerbach went on:
</P>
<P>
   ``He got blown out three times in the playoffs. He was supposed
to run the table with these guys. He was lucky in that Portland
game. They just fell apart at the end; that's why they won.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Auerbach refusing to give another successful coach his
due. Arrogant in his day, despised by many in his profession, he
would light up victory cigars with games in hand, celebrating as
much he was rubbing it in.
</P>
<P>
   Phil may not want to admit it, but he has a lot of Red in him.
The condescension aimed at the other team and its crowd, the
inability to give effusive praise to another team's staff, the
idea, deep down, that he's Phil Jackson and you're not.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much trouble his team appears in, Jackson has
never given the impression that he or his players have panicked and
nearly thrown a series away. Tested severely against Sacramento and
Portland and then Indiana, Jackson still had this serene demeanor
about him, as if he knew how it would end with Shaquille O'Neal
just as he knew how it would end with Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sacramento series, to make sure his players were
paying attention to the game film, Jackson had look-alikes for
Kings Coach Rick Adelman and Jason Williams spliced into the
videotape. For Adelman, he used Adolf Hitler. For Williams, he had
edited in a clip of Edward Norton's skinhead character in
``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the times, the harder you try, the harder it is not
to,'' Jackson said when asked if he has alienated some of his NBA
peers. ``I don't know. I just let it slide. You just have to let
that kind of stuff slide in this profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the comparisons to Auerbach, he said humbly, ``When
you retire, 10, 15 years down the road _ God willing you're still
alive _ you think about those things at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Auerbach was also not singing Larry Bird's
praises. Bird, who planned to retire after the season, after taking
the Pacers to two Eastern Conference finals and one NBA finals in
three years, was drafted by Auerbach in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry, he also took a ready-made ball club,'' Auerbach said.
``He doesn't want to go through the process of rebuilding, which is
a smart move. He doesn't really want to coach. He's so wealthy, why
is he going to kill himself? But, basically, he did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   As old school as you can possibly get, Auerbach was asked about
Jackson's coaching philosophy, which includes a lot of new-age
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't follow that routine,'' he said. ``When you win, you
can all of a sudden worship the moon. When you lose and you say
it's Zen or zip, or whatever they call it, they laugh at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said they got no ballplayers outside their two stars.
What is Rice? Chopped liver? What about Robert Horry. Rick Fox, I
know a lot of ball clubs who would want him on their team. He's not
doing it with mirrors, so why doesn't he come out and say, `I got a
good ball club'?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is these days. Coaches have a tendency in
all sports to downgrade their ball club. So when they win, they're
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who gets coach of the year now is a guy that
finishes second that was supposed to be fourth. I like Doc Rivers,
but why did he win? What can you do more than win? Isn't that the
job?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach was not all gloom and doom, saying O'Neal belongs in a
category with Russell and Chamberlain. But he saved his choicest
comments for Jackson, the Renaissance man who many feel has
eclipsed Pat Riley as the best coach in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you can do it the way he's doing it, it's easy,''
Auerbach said. ``You walk right into a ball club. He didn't make
any moves. He didn't do anything. They'll say the other coaches
that were there didn't win. Maybe they weren't given enough time to
mature with that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he had to do anything with their immaturity, I don't
know. But when you're older, things start to fall in place. You
tell yourself: `Last year we lost. Why did we lose? Let's play
together.' That's what's happened to those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach has never been incredibly complimentary regarding his
peers, just as Jackson has not exactly endeared himself to his
generation of coaches. They won't ever admit it, but they're more
like each other than they both realize.  &QL;

FINALLY, A CHANCE TO CELEBRATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They had waited 12 years and six NBA Finals games
and four excruciating quarters to be NBA champions. The Lakers
could wait another 2.5 seconds to party.
</P>
<P>
   And so the celebration on the court started modestly after Kobe
Bryant's free throws set the 116-111 final score with only those
two ticks left on the clock. During the Indiana Pacers' final
timeout, Lakers players exchanged perfunctory high-fives near their
bench, and veteran guards Ron Harper and Brian Shaw hugged.
</P>
<P>
   That would be it for Lakers celebration - until the timeout
ended, Reggie Miller's last desperate shot bounced away, and the
Staples Center exploded around them.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed gratification turned out to be the best kind.
</P>
<P>
   It was 9:05 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Public address announcer Lawrence Tanter rumbled, ``The Los
Angeles Lakers are world champions!'' and could barely be heard
above the jet-engine roar of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gold streamers and purple and gold confetti rained from the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen Lakers players bounded around the court, trading what
must have been 132 hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Someone waved a sign reading, ``It's in the Fridge!''
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson bear-hugged Shaquille O'Neal and planted a kiss on
the center's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal fairly swam through the crowd of well-wishers to embrace
his mother near the celebrity seats.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's grin filled the message-board video screen and the
crowd erupted in a deep-throated cheer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, now wearing a championship cap, appeared on the screen,
and the fans launched one more chant of ``MVP! MVP! MVP!''
</P>
<P>
   Workers erected a small stage at center court, and within six
minutes of the final buzzer, players, coaches and Lakers owner
Jerry Buss were accepting their prize from commissioner David
Stern, who exclaimed about the Lakers' and Pacers' ``six
heartstopping games'' having exhibited ``the best of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The players thrust ``No. 1'' fingers into the cloud of confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Buss took the trophy from the commissioner and handed it to
Harper, who passed it around to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Queen's ``We are the Champions'' blared through the arena, as it
probably blared through the Forum in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first of many (championships), just like before!''
Buss shouted into an NBC camera.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal accepted the finals MVP trophy and said that Phil Jackson
was the real MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna get one next year, too!'' O'Neal promised - and
you remembered how Pat Riley promised a repeat after the Lakers'
1987 title and they got it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Champions'' gave way to Randy Newman's ``I Love
L.A.,'' another sensory sensation from the old days.
</P>
<P>
   It was all enough to make you forget that the Lakers were being
labeled disappointments by many for struggling through four playoff
rounds as teams with 67 regular-season victories aren't supposed
to, that their postseason foibles had diminished them in many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 teams that won 65 or more regular-season games and the
NBA title, the Lakers are the first to lose eight playoff games,
first to lose any games in the first round, first to need seven
games in the conference finals, first to fail six times in
elimination games, first to lose five times by double digits, and
first since Philadelphia in 1967 to fail to sweep a series.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the most egregious of the double-digit losses -- by
29 to Portland and by 33 to Indiana - the Lakers managed to give up
more points than they scored in both their conference finals and
NBA Finals series.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered now.
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes after the Lakers wrapped up their 4-2 victory
over Indiana, after trailing by as many as 12 points in the first
half, not a man or woman in the Staples Center was sitting, and it
seemed that nobody was standing on the floor, instead climbing on
their chairs, the better to take in the entire scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, the celebration had threatened to begin eight
minutes prematurely, after the Rick Fox 3-pointer that followed the
tumbling O'Neal hook shot that gave the Lakers the lead at 91-90.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial card section in the southeast corner of the
Staples Center that had been spelling out ``ON A MISSION'' switched
to ``WORLD CHAMPS.'' The arena was positively pulsating - the fans
indoors incited by the message-board images of the rollicking crowd
watching the game on a giant screen on 11th Street.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that beefy men wearing earpieces began to
unwrap the yellow rope they would use - (begin ital)mostly(end
ital) with success - to keep fans off the court after the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers players would resist the temptation to begin the
party then.
</P>
<P>
   Only after letting the Indiana Pacers catch up, and after
regaining control of the sensational game, and after Bryant's free
throws in the final seconds rendered their lead insurmountable, did
the home team begin to acknowledge the title they'd waited so much
longer than expected to make official.
</P>
<P>
   Gratification delayed was that much sweeter.

UNRULY FANS TARNISH CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; L.A. came back Monday night and delirium gripped
the City of Angels as the Lakers battled their way to the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But an hour after the city's 12-year drought without a world
championship ended, the celebration turned ugly and anarchic with a
television equipment van looted and smashed and an SUV battered and
set afire by dozens of vandals without an LAPD officer in sight. A
police car was then put under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Police moved in about 20 minutes after scenes of disturbance
were broadcast nationally and moved the crowd out. Officials noted
that no one was injured and the destruction was contained to the
three vehicles. For a city long troubled by riots, economic
collapse and devastating earthquakes, the disturbance tarnished the
joy shared by Laker fans who celebrated the victory by dancing
merrily around harmless bonfires outside Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers struggled to a sixth-game victory, 116-111, led by
triple MVP Shaquille O'Neal's 41 points and 21-year-old superstar
Kobe Bryant's on-court leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for L.A.! What a way to start a millennium!'' said
coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers' first-year coach who won two titles
as player, six as coach of the Chicago Bulls and now his first as a
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Fans outside waved fans, threw water balloons and climbed up
light posts in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is L.A. all day, all night!'' exulted Vic Camarillo, 19,
of San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Jason Addcox predicted a dynasty: ``The Lakers are
the champs!''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of victory inside Staples Center, shouts rang out,
purple and gold confetti filled the air, and people jumped up and
down and embraced each other throughout the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Jack Nicholson, the Lakers' No.1 fan, reached out and
shook hands with Indiana coach Larry Bird for the valiant effort
his Pacers team put up.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers' legend Magic Johnson, a team vice president, hugged
O'Neal and Bryant, praising the players for their season-long drive
to a title that had eluded the city since 1988, when the Magic-led
Lakers and the Kirk Gibson-led Dodgers last won world titles for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   City officials declared Wednesday as Laker Day and said the
victory parade through downtown will start at 11 a.m. with a
ceremony at the Department of Water and Power Building on Hope
Street and work its way along Figueroa Street to the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Players in double-deck buses or other vehicles will start on
First Street, go down a ramp to Figueroa Street and down to Staples
Center at 11th Street and Figueroa, where the big celebration will
be held outside the arena in parking Lots 2 and 3, which can
accommodate 90,000 people. Jumbotrons also will be set up.
</P>
<P>
   Police added bike patrols, mounted units, and set up a command
post near Staples Center early Monday in case anything went awry,
but police officials said they didn't expect anything but
good-natured celebrations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Staples Center, as police clashed with dozens of unruly
fans outside, it was the fans that Lakers owner Jerry Buss and the
players themselves praised.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Buchanan, 27, from Los Angeles, clad in a Lakers jersey and
hat, was hugging everyone in sight outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers victory is the whole wide world to me,'' he said.
``I thought they would take the last game, but they didn't and it
broke my heart. But they mended it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 12 years for this,'' said Alredo
Tardencilla, 21, of Los Angeles. ``The Lakers are the best _ in the
new millennium. We won and we are going to keep going.''

WHAT'S NEXT FOR RICE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It might be the ultimate irony that Glen Rice
finally became relevant in what might have been his last game as a
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Rice did everything he was supposed to do as the third member of
the triangle offense, scoring 16 points, hitting all three of his
3-pointers and grabbing six rebounds in the Los Angeles Lakers'
116-111 victory over Indiana before 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   He even hit two clutch free throws with 1:16 left to give the
Lakers a 112-109 lead they would not relinquish en route to their
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   But before Rice could even get drenched in champagne, he was
forced to answer questions about his future. Someone even asked his
son, G'mitri, where he would like dad to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami,'' the junior Rice blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   But Father Rice quickly informed everyone, ``He was just born
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been plenty of speculation that the
free-agent-to-be Rice might end up in Miami, or even Orlando next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's about. I've endured all the trade rumors and
ups and downs,'' Rice said. ``To win an NBA title, it's been worth
it. Hopefully, I'll be here as well next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all the things I've been through, and winning a
championship helps. I had a great time. I'm happy for the team. We
worked hard together. I feel this team has a lot of great wins
ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Rice be around to enjoy those wins? He made $7 million
this season, and becomes a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Florida makes sense. It's where his wife is from, and
he played for the Heat before being traded to Charlotte five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat can only offer $2.25 million next season because
it's over the salary cap, so Rice is unlikely to end up in Miami.
The Lakers could sign-and-trade Rice, however, if he were to accept
less than a 20 percent raise, and the Heat were willing to part
with a high-salary player like Jamal Mashburn or P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando is a different story if the Magic is unable to land
Tim Duncan, Grant Hill or Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what happens,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions were being made Monday night, though, and Rice was
enjoying every moment of his first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of dissatisfaction that culminated in
Indianapolis when his wife publicly criticized coach Phil Jackson
over Rice's inconsistent role with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was even willing to dole out some compliments to Jackson,
who implemented an offense (the triangle) that is ill-suited for a
spot-up shooter like Rice, because he never gets screens for an
open look at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Phil Jackson a lot of credit,'' Rice said.
``He enforced things. Everyone was ready to accept when he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice seemed to take matters into his own hands in Game 6,
scoring seven quick points in the first quarter and going 3 for 3
on his 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm greedy when it comes to being involved in the offense,''
Rice said. ``I got it going tonight. I got into the flow. I had
open shots and I took them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect world for Rice and the Lakers. They both earned
an NBA title, and Rice made the contribution he has yearned for
most of the season. In other words, it was no place for complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely worth it,'' Rice said.

LAKERS CREATE NEW SHOWTIME AT STAPLES CENTER WITH TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A promise delivered, a moment to savor, a time to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA championship in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after they captured the last title of the Showtime
era, a very different group defeated the stubborn Indiana Pacers,
116-111,on Monday night to bring the Lakers their seventh title in
the L.A. franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   One-year after the gray-haired Phil Jackson _ the Zen-speaking
mystic of bottomless calm _ was hired to lead the Lakers back from
a season of turmoil to the pinnacle of the NBA, the Lakers ended
the best-of-seven series in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first of many _ just like it was before,'' said Lakers
owner Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   The title follows an empty decade for L.A. professional
championships and a troubled era for the city as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first pro title for the City of Angels since the
Lakers and Dodgers both captured championships in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This one was marked by the flash and dare of guard Kobe Bryant
and the power and thunder of Most Valuable Player Shaquille O'Neal,
a combination of style and substance that other teams challenged,
but ultimately no one could match.
</P>
<P>
   When the tense game, led by the Pacers most of the way, finally
ended, O'Neal could not hold his emotions in check. Tears streamed
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bryant leaped into his arms; O'Neal next searched out his
mother, embracing her with his giant arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've held my emotions for almost 11 years,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years in college, eight years in the pros. I always
wanted to win. It just came out. I'm happy for L.A. It's a great
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were this man-child throughout the postseason, a
young but talented team with its core of O'Neal and Bryant
straining mightily to take the crown.
</P>
<P>
   They would look dynamic one night, a maturing team reaching for
the basketball heavens. And then they would come back to
disappoint, the sheepish child knowing it had failed to live up to
expectations, if even its own.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, an NBA postseason record, they failed to close out a
series. They seemed determined to find the difficult path, to
tantalize their fans before reaching their greatness.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no amount of growing pains would stop their ascent
to the NBA summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best feeling in the world,'' said Lakers forward
Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers made the Lakers earn their title Monday, pushing them
hard and forcing them to dig deep to pull out the title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers led throughout most of the contest, still firing away
from beyond the 3-point line and threatening to force a decisive
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who duplicated his regular-season and All-Star MVP
triumphs, took command in the fourth quarter, scoring 13 of his
game-high 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 103 with 5:04 to play after a seven-point
Pacers run, the Lakers connected on consecutive baskets by Robert
Horry, O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   They had a lead they would cling to until the final buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and purple streamers and confetti fell from the ceiling,
``I Love L.A.'' blared and the celebration began.
</P>
<P>
   The championship validated the coaching greatness of Jackson,
who after winning six titles with the Chicago Bulls, captured a
championship in his first season with the Lakers. He and Alex
Hannum are the only coaches in the NBA's 52-year history to win
titles with two different teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grand confirmation for team Executive Vice President
Jerry West, who nine years after the Lakers last made it to the NBA
Finals, pieced together an entirely new team to earn his sixth
title as a Lakers executive.
</P>
<P>
   It was another reason to party for Buss; for veterans Rice, Ron
Harper, A.C. Green, Brian Shaw and John Salley to feel young; for
the 21-year-old Bryant to feel his star rise; and for O'Neal to
establish himself as the most imposing force in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It was even partial redemption for the brand new Staples Center,
maligned for its sterile and subdued environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers clinched each of their four playoff series at home,
and Monday it rocked like never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a start for the Staples Center,'' Jackson said. ``What a
start for the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers first exerted their dominance in the regular season,
rolling to a league-best 67-15 mark. The playoffs offered a wild
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are still trying to figure out how they won Game 7
of the Western Conference Finals, a game that saw them overcome a
15-point fourth-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a miracle game, seventh game against Portland,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing moments of Monday's game, as Bryant walked to the
bench, he held up his left hand to the crowd and pointed to its
ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one ring,'' Bryant said. ``We did it for ourselves. We
did it for Los Angeles, because they deserved it. It's been a long
drought.''

</P>
<P>
   ``Three years in college, eight years in the pros. I always
wanted to win. It just came out. I'm happy for L.A. It's a great
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were this man-child throughout the postseason, a
young but talented team with its core of O'Neal and Bryant
straining mightily to take the crown.
</P>
<P>
   They would look dynamic one night, a maturing team reaching for
the basketball heavens. And then they would come back to
disappoint, the sheepish child knowing it had failed to live up to
expectations, if even its own.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, an NBA postseason record, they failed to close out a
series. They seemed determined to find the difficult path, to
tantalize their fans before reaching their greatness.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no amount of growing pains would stop their ascent
to the NBA summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best feeling in the world,'' said Lakers forward
Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers made the Lakers earn their title Monday, pushing them
hard and forcing them to dig deep to pull out the title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers led throughout most of the contest, still firing away
from beyond the 3-point line and threatening to force a decisive
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who duplicated his regular-season and All-Star MVP
triumphs, took command in the fourth quarter, scoring 13 of his
game-high 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 103 with 5:04 to play after a seven-point
Pacers run, the Lakers connected on consecutive baskets by Robert
Horry, O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   They had a lead they would cling to until the final buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and purple streamers and confetti fell from the ceiling,
``I Love L.A.'' blared and the celebration began.
</P>
<P>
   The championship validated the coaching greatness of Jackson,
who after winning six titles with the Chicago Bulls, captured a
championship in his first season with the Lakers. He and Alex
Hannum are the only coaches in the NBA's 52-year history to win
titles with two different teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grand confirmation for team Executive Vice President
Jerry West, who nine years after the Lakers last made it to the NBA
Finals, pieced together an entirely new team to earn his sixth
title as a Lakers executive.
</P>
<P>
   It was another reason to party for Buss; for veterans Rice, Ron
Harper, A.C. Green, Brian Shaw and John Salley to feel young; for
the 21-year-old Bryant to feel his star rise; and for O'Neal to
establish himself as the most imposing force in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It was even partial redemption for the brand new Staples Center,
maligned for its sterile and subdued environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers clinched each of their four playoff series at home,
and Monday it rocked like never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a start for the Staples Center,'' Jackson said. ``What a
start for the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers first exerted their dominance in the regular season,
rolling to a league-best 67-15 mark. The playoffs offered a wild
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are still trying to figure out how they won Game 7
of the Western Conference Finals, a game that saw them overcome a
15-point fourth-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a miracle game, seventh game against Portland,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing moments of Monday's game, as Bryant walked to the
bench, he held up his left hand to the crowd and pointed to its
ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one ring,'' Bryant said. ``We did it for ourselves. We
did it for Los Angeles, because they deserved it. It's been a long
drought.''

WHAT'S NEXT FOR RICE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing slug) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It might be the ultimate irony that Glen Rice
finally became relevant in what might have been his last game as a
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Rice did everything he was supposed to do as the third member of
the triangle offense, scoring 16 points, hitting all three of his
3-pointers and grabbing six rebounds in the Los Angeles Lakers'
116-111 victory over Indiana before 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   He even hit two clutch free throws with 1:16 left to give the
Lakers a 112-109 lead they would not relinquish en route to their
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   But before Rice could even get drenched in champagne, he was
forced to answer questions about his future. Someone even asked his
son, G'mitri, where he would like dad to play next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami,'' the junior Rice blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   But Father Rice quickly informed everyone, ``He was just born
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been plenty of speculation that the
free-agent-to-be Rice might end up in Miami, or even Orlando next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's about. I've endured all the trade rumors and
ups and downs,'' Rice said. ``To win an NBA title, it's been worth
it. Hopefully, I'll be here as well next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all the things I've been through, and winning a
championship helps. I had a great time. I'm happy for the team. We
worked hard together. I feel this team has a lot of great wins
ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Rice be around to enjoy those wins? He made $7 million
this season, and becomes a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Florida makes sense. It's where his wife is from, and
he played for the Heat before being traded to Charlotte five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat can only offer $2.25 million next season because
it's over the salary cap, so Rice is unlikely to end up in Miami.
The Lakers could sign-and-trade Rice, however, if he were to accept
less than a 20 percent raise, and the Heat were willing to part
with a high-salary player like Jamal Mashburn or P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando is a different story if the Magic is unable to land
Tim Duncan, Grant Hill or Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what happens,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions were being made Monday night, though, and Rice was
enjoying every moment of his first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of dissatisfaction that culminated in
Indianapolis when his wife publicly criticized coach Phil Jackson
over Rice's inconsistent role with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was even willing to dole out some compliments to Jackson,
who implemented an offense (the triangle) that is ill-suited for a
spot-up shooter like Rice, because he never gets screens for an
open look at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Phil Jackson a lot of credit,'' Rice said.
``He enforced things. Everyone was ready to accept when he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice seemed to take matters into his own hands in Game 6,
scoring seven quick points in the first quarter and going 3 for 3
on his 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm greedy when it comes to being involved in the offense,''
Rice said. ``I got it going tonight. I got into the flow. I had
open shots and I took them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect world for Rice and the Lakers. They both earned
an NBA title, and Rice made the contribution he has yearned for
most of the season. In other words, it was no place for complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely worth it,'' Rice said.

LAKERS WIN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One more sputter for suspense. One more pause for
dramatic effect. One more blistering, dazzling, stubborn charge up
the hill, one big grasp for the crown.
</P>
<P>
   One more banner for the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   One long drought ended, wiped out by a cloudburst of confetti
and multiple champagne showers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, title-less since Showtime faded out more than a
decade ago, are NBA champions once more.
</P>
<P>
   Their 116-111 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night
clinched the Finals, four games to two, and set off a thunderous
celebration on the Staples Center floor, with 18,997 of the Laker
faithful joining in.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, brought together four years
ago to bring about this renewal, embraced at midcourt after the
final buzzer, the Lakers having at last restored a feeling not felt
since their last title in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' said Bryant, ``that champagne burned so much
when it gets in your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old star quickly got used to the feeling. Everything
else he felt, he could hardly describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't, man. I just feel so numb,'' said Bryant, his fiancee
Vanessa Laine at his side, and his mother Pam standing nearby. ``I
just feel numb. I put the championship T-shirt on, put the hat on,
celebrated with my family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory will bring a seventh championship banner to Staples
Center. It comes in just the first season for coach Phil Jackson,
who brought the magic touch and the steady hand to L.A. that won
him six titles with the Chicago Bulls. It's Jackson's seventh title
in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first title for his young proteges, Bryant and O'Neal,
who figure to add several more before they are through here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through ups and downs, but the most important thing is
that we believed in one another,'' said Bryant, who scored 26
points - including the last four - in the victory, ``and we
believed in the system. We believed in sitting in a room, and
meditating and Phil lighting incense in the room and doing all
kinds of crazy stuff. But we believed in it and we believed in one
another and this championship shows it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, whose 41 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots led
the Lakers on Monday, was the unanimous choice for Finals MVP,
adding the trophy to his regular-season MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lot. We've been able to grow together,'' said
Glen Rice, who scored 16 points. ``I'm just, I'm so happy for the
team right now. I really am. That's what it's all about. I mean, we
really worked hard, we fought together and to be able to raise that
trophy up out there is an unbelievable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers showed their Hollywood side, scripting an appropriate
final chapter:
</P>
<P>
   The imperfect championship game, for the imperfect championship
team.
</P>
<P>
   It took multiple tries to win every round of the playoffs. But
the fits and starts and the hiccups only intensified the suspense,
added to the anticipation and made the crowning moment that much
sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 was simply a repeat of everything the Lakers have done to
date. From the iffy start to the late deficit to the dramatic
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   They lost every quarter until the fourth - trailing by two
points after the first, three points at halftime and by five
heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's hook off the glass with 9:02 left gave the Lakers a
91-90 lead, their first since the first quarter, and the boost they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox followed with a 3-pointer over Austin Croshere, and
Staples Center erupted as the Pacers called a timeout and Fox
bumped chests with Rice at the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Then a Robert Horry 3-pointer, then a pair of O'Neal putback
jams, and the tide seemed to have turned for good, the Lakers
leading 101-94.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers, who provided a stiffer challenge throughout the
series than many anticipated, scrapped back, and the Lakers - as
they have done all postseason, gave one more scare.
</P>
<P>
   With a 9-2 run, and seven points from Jalen Rose, the Pacers
tied the game at 103, capped by a Rose 3-pointer over Bryant. The
building went nearly silent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers, who have made a habit of comebacks, launched
their final surge.
</P>
<P>
   Horry hit a running jumper. Ron Harper picked off a Mark Jackson
pass. O'Neal swished a turnaround from the baseline, then blocked a
Rose layup. Bryant hit a turnaround 21-footer over Rose, and the
Lakers had a 109-103 lead with 3:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers briefly resorted to Hack-a-Shaq, but even as he
missed three of four free throws, the Lakers held the lead.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Croshere free throws provided the final chill, cutting
the lead to 110-109 with 1:32 to go, but Rice made a pair of free
throws with 1:16 left, then Bryant provided the final four points
from the line. After his final two, with 2.5 seconds left, Bryant
walked toward the bench, looked to the stands and pointed at his
ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``After those two free throws, I knew we had it,'' Bryant said.
``I didn't think there was a way mathematically for them to get
back in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, it was all champagne and cigar
smoke. O'Neal tackled Fox in the center of the room. John Salley
kissed the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Teammates chased A.C. Green, not
yet doused with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like I'm dreaming right now, like you guys
aren't even here,'' Bryant said. ``I swear, man. I must be trapped
in `the Matrix.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 12 points in the first half, the
Lakers looked anything but ready to claim a championship. But they
stayed within striking range throughout and Bryant hit a 3-pointer
with 2.3 seconds left to cut the deficit to 56-53 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The shot capped off a 10-3 Lakers run that started with a Rice
jumper and was aided by a pair of Pacer turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 21 points by halftime, hitting 10 of 19 shots, and
Bryant, despite some shaky moments, scored 12 points on 4-of-12
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the change of venue, from Conseco Fieldhouse to
Staples, the Pacers kept their hot shooting touch, making 21 of 42
field-goal attempts in the half. Jalen Rose scored 12 points,
Reggie Miller added 11 and Dale Davis got nine points to go with
eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Early momentum belonged to the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled to hold off the Lakers in a seesaw first quarter
but ended the period with an answered prayer - Jackson's
buzzer-beating shot-put over Bryant, on an inbounds pass from just
past midcourt, gave Indiana a 26-24 lead.

VETERANS GET TASTE OF THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ron Harper caught a glimpse of general manager
Mitch Kupchak in the chaos of the Los Angeles Lakers locker room
Monday night and stopped puffing on his cigar just long enough to
bellow, ``Hey Mitch, I quit! I quit!''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, obviously joking, couldn't stifle a laugh at his own
comment, but the serious question is, will Harper, now 36 years
old, and a handful of other Lakers, be there for a repeat run?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's up to Phil and all them,'' Harper said. ``We've got
a deal. If Phil calls me and says he still needs me, I'll be back.
If he thinks he has all the guys to get it done without me, that's
just fine too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 14 years in this league, and I wouldn't trade those
14 years for these bad knees for anything. I wouldn't trade these
last six, seven, eight years for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the excitement of the moment, but all three of the
Lakers' elder statesmen didn't sound ready for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets sweeter every time,'' said 36-year-old backup center
John Salley, who won a championship with his third team. ``It's
like wine, and I don't think there's any better feeling than
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward A.C. Green, 36, who started for most of the season but
deferred to Robert Horry for the important minutes of each game,
said he would be ready for training camp this fall, ``without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep the good times rolling,'' Green said.
``We're going to savor this right now and for the next few weeks,
and pretty soon it will be time to get back to business.''
</P>
<P>
   The status of other Lakers is less certain. Trade rumors have
circulated around Glen Rice practically since his arrival in Los
Angeles, and Brian Shaw was signed primarily as a fill-in when Kobe
Bryant broke a bone in his hand in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he would ``love to return, if the situation is
right,'' but was content to celebrate the first NBA title of his
10-year career. Fellow veterans Shaw (10 years) and Rick Fox (eight
years) also had their first taste of championship champagne Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still experiencing it right now,'' Fox said as he
videotaped the locker-room scene. ``There's a lot of good feelings
right now, everything from elation to just breaking down and
crying.''

UNRULY FANS TARNISH CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: updating with further police action) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; L.A. came back Monday night with the Lakers
winning the NBA championship, but delirium over victory soon turned
to anarchy as dozens of fans outside Staples Center rioted and set
vehicles on fire as police stood passive.
</P>
<P>
   Joyous scenes of fans dancing merrily around harmless bonfires
celebrating the end of a 12-year drought without a championship
turned ugly with a television equipment van looted and smashed and
an SUV battered and set afire by dozens of vandals without an LAPD
officer in sight. Two empty police cars were then attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Police moved in about 20 minutes after scenes of disturbance
were broadcast nationally and dispersed the heavily drinking crowd,
which continued to attack vehicles, set new fires and loot a
computer store in advance of the several hundred officers assigned
to crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   A tactical alert of police citywide was declared more than an
hour after the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there were several minor injuries and the
destruction was contained to vehicles, but some officers at the
scene said they were embarrassed at being ordered to hold their
positions in the face of the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying our best to disperse the crowd, but you don't go
up to 2,000 people with just 30 people,'' said LAPD spokesman Jason
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there, you'll just get attacked. This should be a
time for celebration in the city of L.A. The Lakers fans are
supposed to be celebrating, not committing crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   For a city long troubled by riots, economic collapse and
devastating earthquakes, the disturbance tarnished the joy shared
by the vast majority of Lakers fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers struggled to a sixth-game victory, 116-111, led by
triple MVP Shaquille O'Neal's 41 points and 21-year-old superstar
Kobe Bryant's on-court leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for L.A.! What a way to start a millennium!'' said
coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers' first-year coach who won two titles
as player, six as coach of the Chicago Bulls and now his first as a
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Fans outside waved banners, threw water balloons and climbed up
light posts in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is L.A. all day, all night!'' exulted Vic Camarillo, 19,
of San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Jason Addcox predicted a dynasty: ``The Lakers are
the champs!''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of victory inside Staples Center, shouts rang out,
purple and gold confetti filled the air, and people jumped up and
down and embraced each other throughout the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Jack Nicholson, the Lakers' No. 1 fan, reached out and
shook hands with Indiana coach Larry Bird for the valiant effort
his Pacers team put up.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers' legend Magic Johnson, a team vice president, hugged
O'Neal and Bryant, praising the players for their season-long drive
to a title that had eluded the city since 1988, when the Magic-led
Lakers and the Kirk Gibson-led Dodgers last won world titles for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   City officials declared Wednesday as Laker Day and said the
victory parade through downtown will start at 11a.m. with a
ceremony at the Department of Water and Power Building on Hope
Street and work its way along Figueroa Street to the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Players in double-deck buses or other vehicles will start on
First Street, go down a ramp to Figueroa Street and down to Staples
Center at 11th Street and Figueroa, where the big celebration will
be held outside the arena in parking Lots 2 and 3, which can
accommodate 90,000 people. Jumbotrons also will be set up.
</P>
<P>
   Police added bike patrols, mounted units, and set up a command
post near Staples Center early Monday in case anything went awry,
but police officials said they didn't expect anything but
good-natured celebrations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Staples Center, as police clashed with dozens of unruly
fans outside, it was the fans that Lakers owner Jerry Buss and the
players themselves praised.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Buchanan, 27, from Los Angeles, clad in a Lakers jersey and
hat, was hugging everyone in sight outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers victory is the whole wide world to me,'' he said.
``I thought they would take the last game, but they didn't and it
broke my heart. But they mended it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 12 years for this,'' said Alredo
Tardencilla, 21, of Los Angeles. ``The Lakers are the best
</P>
<P>
   in the new millennium. We won and we are going to keep going.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They staged a wild party Monday evening inside and
outside the Staples Center where thousands of people shrieked,
screamed, yelled, pleaded and cheered maniacally for the Los
Angeles Lakers in their climactic match against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in 12 years, the beleaguered city that
has endured earthquakes, civil riots, police scandals and the
disappearance of its NFL franchise during that bleak period,
finally can smile.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since October of 1988 when the Dodgers
shocked the sporting orbit by beating the Oakland A's in the World
Series, L.A. finally has something to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, finally, after bitter stretch of frustrations throughout
the 1990s when all the local professional entries---the Lakers,
Clippers, Dodgers, Angels, Kings, Mighty Ducks, the dearly departed
Rams and Raiders---took turns taking pratfalls, L.A. can rejoice
heartily over becoming Titletown, U.S.A again as it was so often in
the long ago past.
</P>
<P>
   And it can extend a stirring gratitude of thanks to the athletic
franchise, the Lakers, that has delivered the most world
championships to the Southern California basin across the seasons,
with the seventh one coming Monday night when Shaquille O'Neal and
his teammates managed to hold off the Pacers, 116-111, in a match
in which the reverberating crowd of 18,997 might have played as
vital a role in the outcome as O'Neal's dominate work.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tipoff of a game in which the Pacers led
throughout until the tide turned dramatically in the late stages,
the L.A. fans, supposedly so blase and so cool, never stopped
rooting lustily for their heroes, who finally responded to their
pleadings with a 37-point fourth period eruption that caused the
entire city to erupt into a banner-waving, horn-blaring,
bonfire-setting paroxysm of ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get it done when they showed on the scoreboard video
our fans outside the building cheering for us,'' Shaquille O' Neal
would say afterward. ``We just couldn't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't let them down, although a segment of their youthful
followers, alas, lost its senses afterwards, turning the Staples
Center area in downtown L.A. into a riot zone of burning police
cars and rampaging youths.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad for a while that those still inside Staples
Centers were not allowed outside until police---many on
horseback---finally were able to bring the chaos under control.
</P>
<P>
   As desperately as the L.A. patrons wanted a championship to
savor, no one wanted one more than Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1,
340-pound Laker center who had achieved everything in his life
---movie appearances, rap songs, untold riches, staggering
fame---except a world title.
</P>
<P>
   And, after the final horn sounded, after he had poured in 41
points against the Packers including 13 in that decisive final
period, after he had assured himself of the MVP trophy for the NBA
finals after earning one for the regular season, Shaquille O'Neal
warmly embraced the team's other big star, Kobe Bryant, and began
weeping.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure a lot of people in L.A. did likewise at this poignant
sight in the wake of an emotional victory against a resilient
opponent that refused to fold despite the relentless attack of
O'Neal and ear-splitting noise of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this Laker team that took six games to eliminate the
heavily underdog Pacers won't rate among the best in the
franchise's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lakers did win 67 games during the regular season,
they struggled mightily throughout the playoffs, being extended to
the full five games against Sacramento, needing to dispense an
implausible fourth quarter, Game 7 rally to survive against
Portland and getting beaten by an embarrassing 33 points in Game 5
against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But what brought them to the pinnacle of their sport was that
they possessed the game's most overwhelming performer in O'Neal, a
21-year-old player of extraordinary athletic skills in Bryant, a
slew of resourceful, tough role players in Robert Horry, A.C.
Green, Rick Fox, Ron Harper and Brian Shaw, and a stubborn resolve
that was always displayed at their most critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   And they also reacted well to the guidance of Phil Jackson, who
won six championships with the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Jackson is one remarkable coach who was able
to turn the Lakers from being perennial underachievers---they were
swept the past two post-seasons by the Utah Jazz and San Antonio
Spurs---into being overachievers and was able to prove convincingly
that he doesn't need Michael Jordan to win world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps to have a Shaquille O'Neal, who might not be
able to shoot free throws---he was a typical 3 for 12 at the foul
line Monday night---but does enough other good things to now rate
favorable comparisons with the Wilt Chamberlains and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbars and Bill Russells.
</P>
<P>
   But, as awesome as O'Neal was in Game 6---and he took over the
proceedings in that fourth period when he sank all six of his
shots, blocked three shots and grabbed four rebounds---the frenzied
crowd was just as awesome.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising to see people like Mel Gibson, Jack
Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Dyan Cannon, Pamela Anderson, Dustin Hoffman
clapping their hands and rooting passionately for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But even an international corporate type like Rupert Murdoch was
seen getting excited, not to mention wealthy gentlemen like Steven
Spielberg and Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   This was a glorious night for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But even a more glorious one for L.A., which has been in a long
slump in so many areas but broke out if it in a flourish on the
broad shoulders of Shaquille O'Neal and his teammates, with
unrelenting encouragement from what may well have been the loudest
crowd in L.A. sports history.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that some individuals whose brains haven't
quite made it up to their heads decided afterward to tarnish this
bright L.A. moment with the kind of behavior commonplace among the
English soccer hooligans.

UNRULY FANS TARNISH CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: updating with further police action) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; L.A. came back Monday night with the Lakers
winning the NBA championship, but delirium over victory soon turned
to anarchy as dozens of fans outside Staples Center rioted and set
vehicles on fire as police stood passive.
</P>
<P>
   Joyous scenes of fans dancing merrily around harmless bonfires
celebrating the end of a 12-year drought without a championship
turned ugly with a television equipment van looted and smashed and
an SUV battered and set afire by dozens of vandals without an LAPD
officer in sight. Two empty police cars were then attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Police moved in about 20 minutes after scenes of disturbance
were broadcast nationally and dispersed the heavily drinking crowd,
which continued to attack vehicles, set new fires and loot a
computer store in advance of the several hundred officers assigned
to crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   A tactical alert of police citywide was declared more than an
hour after the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there were several minor injuries and the
destruction was contained to vehicles, but some officers at the
scene said they were embarrassed at being ordered to hold their
positions in the face of the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying our best to disperse the crowd, but you don't go
up to 2,000 people with just 30 people,'' said LAPD spokesman Jason
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there, you'll just get attacked. This should be a
time for celebration in the city of L.A. The Lakers fans are
supposed to be celebrating, not committing crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   For a city long troubled by riots, economic collapse and
devastating earthquakes, the disturbance tarnished the joy shared
by the vast majority of Lakers fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers struggled to a sixth-game victory, 116-111, led by
triple MVP Shaquille O'Neal's 41 points and 21-year-old superstar
Kobe Bryant's on-court leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for L.A.! What a way to start a millennium!'' said
coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers' first-year coach who won two titles
as player, six as coach of the Chicago Bulls and now his first as a
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Fans outside waved banners, threw water balloons and climbed up
light posts in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is L.A. all day, all night!'' exulted Vic Camarillo, 19,
of San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Jason Addcox predicted a dynasty: ``The Lakers are
the champs!''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of victory inside Staples Center, shouts rang out,
purple and gold confetti filled the air, and people jumped up and
down and embraced each other throughout the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Jack Nicholson, the Lakers' No. 1 fan, reached out and
shook hands with Indiana coach Larry Bird for the valiant effort
his Pacers team put up.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers' legend Magic Johnson, a team vice president, hugged
O'Neal and Bryant, praising the players for their season-long drive
to a title that had eluded the city since 1988, when the Magic-led
Lakers and the Kirk Gibson-led Dodgers last won world titles for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   City officials declared Wednesday as Laker Day and said the
victory parade through downtown will start at 11a.m. with a
ceremony at the Department of Water and Power Building on Hope
Street and work its way along Figueroa Street to the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Players in double-deck buses or other vehicles will start on
First Street, go down a ramp to Figueroa Street and down to Staples
Center at 11th Street and Figueroa, where the big celebration will
be held outside the arena in parking Lots 2 and 3, which can
accommodate 90,000 people. Jumbotrons also will be set up.
</P>
<P>
   Police added bike patrols, mounted units, and set up a command
post near Staples Center early Monday in case anything went awry,
but police officials said they didn't expect anything but
good-natured celebrations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Staples Center, as police clashed with dozens of unruly
fans outside, it was the fans that Lakers owner Jerry Buss and the
players themselves praised.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Buchanan, 27, from Los Angeles, clad in a Lakers jersey and
hat, was hugging everyone in sight outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers victory is the whole wide world to me,'' he said.
``I thought they would take the last game, but they didn't and it
broke my heart. But they mended it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting 12 years for this,'' said Alredo
Tardencilla, 21, of Los Angeles. ``The Lakers are the best
</P>
<P>
   in the new millennium. We won and we are going to keep going.''

COMPARED TO WILT, SHAQ DOESN'T WILT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal is no Wilt Chamberlain, that much
was obvious Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   That beatific expression O'Neal wore after the Los Angeles
Lakers closed out Indiana 116-111 to win the NBA title, all those
tears mixing with his sweat as he hugged Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice
and his mother, Lucille Harrison? Wilt would have sooner broken
bread with Bill Russell than broken down in public like that.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was too cool a cat to cry. After his Philadelphia
team turned back San Francisco in six games in 1967, the seven
footer to whom O'Neal long has been compared - sometimes
ignominiously - celebrated his first NBA title by keeping his
emotions corked even as the champagne flowed around him.
</P>
<P>
   To show joy or relief, the late Chamberlain explained years
later, would have been to reveal just how much he needed an NBA
championship to complete him. In his crowning moment Chamberlain
was too proud to acknowledge that falling short of the summit, as
he had his first seven years in the league, had made the climb
every year seem a little steeper, a little more back-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Chamberlain sat stoically, alone with his
thoughts in the middle of his teammates' celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Not O'Neal. The center of attention wouldn't dream of shrinking
from the spotlight. He took the microphone upon being named the NBA
Finals Most Valuable Player - completing a divine double-double for
the 7-foot-1 center, who was a near-unanimous choice for league MVP
- and, with tears welling in his eyes, thanked Lakers first-year
coach Phil Jackson, expressed his love for the Lakers' fans and his
teammates and all but guaranteed plenty more titles from whence
this one came.
</P>
<P>
   That's O'Neal, who always has related more to Superman than
Clark Kent. The only thing muted about the man is his voice.
</P>
<P>
   It was only right that the Lakers' revelry revolved around
O'Neal. After all, he was their ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal averaged 29.7 points, 13.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.0
blocked shots during the regular season. On Monday he collected 13
of his 41 points in the fourth quarter and pulled down four of his
12 rebounds in that span to bring the Lakers back from an 84-79
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter unfolded like one of the television scripts
of David E. Kelley, who was sitting courtside at Staples Center.
The drama was cliffhanger kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal gave the Lakers their first lead of the second half, at
91-90, on a layup off a flip pass from Bryant. He drew a foul from
Derrick McKey but flubbed the free throw (O'Neal was 3 for 12 from
the free-throw line and some will say that was a more fitting
reminder of Chamberlain than the black band the Lakers wore on
their jerseys in his honor).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' lead was two points when O'Neal jammed home a Bryant
shot that fell short. Thirty seconds later he put back a Brian Shaw
miss to give the Lakers a seven-point lead (101-94) that seemed to
give his team a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   They'd need it to weather the perimeter shooting of the
persistent Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate how far O'Neal has come this year, it's
instructive to note he was at the center of the storm in 1998 when
Utah blew out the Lakers in the Western Conference finals and again
in 1999 when a squall in the form of the San Antonio Spurs doused
the Lakers' championship aspirations in the Western Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake; O'Neal's fingerprints were all over the
guillotine that dropped on Del Harris early in last year's
lockout-shortened season. The verbose Harris wasted his breath
preaching defense to O'Neal who, for whatever reason (immaturity?
petulance?) wasn't sufficiently motivated to listen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 28, was a conspicuous no-show for the final team meeting
of the 1999 season, conduct most unbecoming of a team captain. His
absence, after a decidedly narcissistic series against the Spurs
(he mustered only two assists in four games), precluded the air
from being cleared along with the players' lockers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Lakers were O'Neal's team, all right, and for that the
rest of the West breathed a little easier. As former standout
center Bill Walton, now a television commentator, noted, ``A year
ago the Lakers represented all that was wrong with pro sports.''
And this year? ``They represent everything that is right,'' Walton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson generally is credited with the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Chamberlain himself once noted, the coach isn't the
one on the floor fighting for rebounds and rising to block shots.
O'Neal deserves his due for remaking himself into the player that
Jackson (and Harris before him) figured he could be and the rest of
the league feared he one day might become.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 Lakers were O'Neal's team, all right, and this
time they were in good hands. His 30.3-point average in the
playoffs carried the team on the court and his playfulness off it
kept the Lakers' locker room from becoming as suffocating as a
sauna.
</P>
<P>
   We'd say there is a movie of O'Neal's life waiting to happen,
but it already has been made. That would be ``Big'' with Tom Hanks
playing the big kid that O'Neal in real life is.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, O'Neal's boyishness was what you noticed, not his
determination to be The Boss. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has become the greatest defensive force in basketball,''
said Walton, who can be stingy with his verbal bouquets. ``He has
become the best passing center in basketball. He's got newfound
levels of toughness but also newfound levels of patience and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to this year, you would never have a conversation about
who the greatest center was,'' Walton added. ``It would have begun
and ended with Wilt Chamberlain. After this season, you've got to
start talking about Shaquille O'Neal in the same class.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Chamberlain died, O'Neal honored him in the
most felicitous way imaginable. Hollywood couldn't have scripted it
any better. In winning his first NBA title in his eighth season,
same as Chamberlain, O'Neal earned his best nickname yet. He
henceforth shall be called, ``The Big Dipper Deux.''

KOBE WINNING TITLES COULD BECOME HABIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant sat on a table in the trainer's room
Monday after the Los Angeles Lakers' 116-111 victory over Indiana
to capture the 200 NBA championship. Dripping with champagne and
sweat, his beautiful fiancee to his left and Magic Johnson to his
right, Bryant looked very much like a young man with the world at
his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, he was still just a typical 21-year old kid trying
to figure out what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I felt,'' Bryant said as he described the
first moments of being a champion. ``When I got up to the podium I
looked at (Phil Jackson) and said, `OK, what do we do now? Where do
we go next? I don't know what to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant might be a bit unsure how to act now, but chances are
good he'll have plenty of opportunities to get it straight over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the start,'' Bryant said. ``It depends on how
long we stay together, but right now we're king of the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson can relate. After carrying the Lakers to the NBA title
in 1980, someone asked the then 20-year old rookie how many more he
hoped to win before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, without hesitating, smiled and said, ``I don't know,
20.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme confidence notwithstanding, Magic fell considerably
short of his goal, winning five over his brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   Time ran out on Johnson, but it could be on the side of another
brash, young Lakers' guard. Bryant, who had 26 points Monday, might
not get 20 rings, but he's clearly on pace to match, even surpass,
the greats of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a (big) run for him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell is the league standard, winning 11 titles after
getting his first when he was 23, two years older than the 21-year
old Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, Russell captured a championship as a rookie, and
both won NCAA titles in college the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan won six titles, but he was 28 when the Bulls won
their first championship, making it impossible to seriously
consider catching Russell. Jordan also hurt himself by sitting out
nearly two years after retiring in 1993 to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant might want to be like Mike, but he's never said anything
about home runs and split-fingered fastballs. Besides, he's already
thinking about getting rings for more than just his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got toes, too,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other true legends of the game, Bryant compares
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who got his first with Milwaukee in 1971,
finished with six titles and Larry Bird had three, the first coming
at 24. Wilt Chamberlain won two titles.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of factors working in Bryant's favor. He's got
youth, scintillating talent and enough confidence to carry out his
plan, which he considers his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also has Shaquille O'Neal, likely for the next six or
seven years, an owner and team president determined to maintain
championship-level teams and the ideal coach to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   The trifecta of Jerry Buss, Jerry West and Phil Jackson pretty
much insures the Lakers will have the leadership and personnel to
stay competitive, and there's no team in the league with the
one-two punch of O'Neal and Bryant.

HALAMA, MARINERS ABSORB A RAYS RAZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As homecomings go, it wasn't as bad as the time Bluto
and the Delta boys ravaged Faber College, but it was right up
there.
</P>
<P>
   After rising to a season-best eight games above .500 with their
best road trip of the season, the Mariners returned to Seattle
Monday night and opened a 10-game homestand with an 10-3 loss to
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in Safeco Field. Starter John Halama
didn't get out of the fifth inning, Seattle stranded 11 baserunners
and Mariners pitchers walked five batters, hit another and allowed
a run in every inning but the second, third and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   So it was one of those nights for the Mariners, who had been
playing well. Monday night marked the first time Seattle allowed 10
runs in a game since the infamous Jose Mesa-John Mabry game against
Tampa Bay at the end of May. Halama and the bullpen kept Mabry off
the mound but accomplished little else.
</P>
<P>
   Halama was a most pleasant surprise for the Mariners when he won
his first six decisions, including an 87-pitch shutout over the
Twins last month. He has struggled in recent weeks though, losing
his past three decisions. He is 0-3 with a 7.71 ERA in four starts
this month. He hasn't made it through the sixth inning in his past
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggled the last few times out and we have to figure
out how to get him straightened out,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``You can talk to the pitching coach about his mechanics, all I
know is the last few times out he hasn't been as sharp as he was
earlier in the year and we need to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's mental. He's getting behind hitters and not
locating his pitches well. And Johnny is not the type of pitcher
who can afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama struggled from the opening batter, allowing a double to
center fielder Randy Winn to open the game. Winn wound up scoring
to give Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead and its first of five runs against the
left-hander. Halama, who depends on his control to be effective,
allowed five runs on seven hits and walked three batters in
four-plus innings. He threw 91 pitches, 54 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fall behind and put guys on base and then you have to make
better pitches,'' Halama said. ``I haven't jumped ahead of guys
like I did before and I have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to say about it? It just hasn't been going
my way. Before, it was. Now it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle came back with a run in the second and another in the
third on Alex Rodriguez's 20th home run to take a brief 2-1 lead.
It was all Tampa Bay after that. The Devil Rays scored three in the
fourth inning and two more in the fifth while chasing Halama.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez took over from Halama and was unable to stop
the scoring. He did slow it somewhat, allowing one run the fifth,
one in the sixth and another in the seventh. Robert Ramsay relieved
him in the eighth inning and quickly allowed two runs on Fred
McGriff's home run to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay is in last place in the American League East but the
Devil Rays have been pitching well recently. They entered June
ranked 29th in ERA but have had the league's lowest ERA this month.
Starter Albie Lopez, who is the only American League pitcher with a
complete game and a save this season, continued the strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez allowed six hits and walked four batters, but held the
Mariners to two runs _ one earned _ in six innings. Seattle
stranded two runners in the first, two in the second, two in the
third and two in the sixth against Lopez, then stranded three in
the seventh against Tampa Bay's bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left a lot of people out there,'' Piniella said. ``We had
some chances early and didn't capitalize. And even late, we had
some chances. But the story tonight was they hit the ball well and
we didn't pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss and Oakland's win, the Mariners dropped two games
behind the AL West-leading Athletics, the farthest they've been out
of first this season.

SHAQ SHOWS HIS SENSITIVE SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His arms opened wide as Kobe Bryant came rushing
toward him, a cacophany of cheers and screams and music from the
Staples Center surrounding him in this wildly public yet deeply
intimate moment.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryant landed in his large limbs and thrust an arm into the
air, a resounding, defiant exclamation point on the end of a team's
and a city's 12-year pro title drought, Shaquille O'Neal dug his
chin into the chest of Bryant and cried like a newborn.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Champion? Yes, very much so after the Los Angeles
Lakers' 116-111 Game 6 win over Indiana gave them the 2000 NBA
title. But he is also The Big Teardrop.
</P>
<P>
   When you are 7-1 and 315, people don't wonder whether or not a
sensitive heart beats inside, whether he yearns for something. A
man big enough to seemingly take whatever he wants doesn't
encourage much empathy. As it was once said about another great
Lakers center, Wilt Chamberlain, no one roots for Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal has yearned for this. Since he came into the league
as its biggest prodigy ever, people have undercut whatever personal
success he had by noting the lack of his team's success, with an
emphasis on the way he and his teams have been swept aside. Whether
or not the critiques were fair, they hurt.
</P>
<P>
   So the tears were a release. It's actually a wonder that O'Neal
was as composed as he was after the tears on the court and the wild
champagne celebration in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've held my emotions for 11 years now, three years in college
and eight in the pros,'' said O'Neal. ``I always wanted to win.
They (the tears) just came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great moment. I watched Magic Johnson and Larry
Bird celebrate their titles as a kid. I'm just happy, very happy.
I'm happy for Kobe, for my teammates, Phil (Jackson), and the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   And the city is happy for Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons why the Lakers won the title Monday.
Credit owner Jerry Buss for providing the wherewithall, and Jerry
West for his foresight to obtain Shaq and Kobe, and Kobe for being
the superb team player he has become, and Jackson for finding a way
to turn a team with embarrassing playoff exits the last three years
into a champion.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal carried this team. He never flinched at the double
teams and triple teams and the intentional fouls, or let his free
throw Kryptonite overcome him.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter Monday, while his teammates were
floundering in the face of inspired and smart play by the Pacers --
Larry Bird shouldn't be allowed to retire after just three seasons
-- O'Neal scored more than half (15) of the Lakers' 29 points. If
he doesn't stay strong, the Pacers extend their lead just like they
did in Game 5, and maybe we're preparing for Game 7 instead of a
parade.
</P>
<P>
   In the final quarter, when the Lakers finally pulled away for
the first time since the end of the first quarter, he was perfect
everywhere except the free throw line -- six field goals in as many
shots, four rebounds, three blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the quarter, as three Pacers surrounded him, O'Neal
grabbed a rebound, spun away and back and dropped a double pump
eight-footer into the basket. Next possession, he dunks off a
beautiful Bryant pass.
</P>
<P>
   Two trips later, he soars from a steep angle to take a Brian
Shaw pass off the glass to score and give the Lakers the lead and
fill the Pacers with doubt.
</P>
<P>
   He would score seven more points, but the rest of his big plays
were defensive -- stepping up to challenge a Mark Jackson shot from
the baseeline, and the next trip down coming out on Jalen Rose, who
was absolutely otherworldly in this game and the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the ugliest 41 points I ever had,'' said O'Neal. ``We
took the game to them in the fourth quarter. We made a couple of
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq was very dominant,'' said Bird, the Celtic great who
imbued the Pacers with a lot of the same characterists his Boston
teams had. ``We had problems with him most of the series. We used
Dale Davis, we used Rik Smits. He was just too much for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is never easy to take. We're all hurt by it. But the
Lakers were a better team. We played as well as we could the first
three quarters. They just had too much going down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever personal joy O'Neal felt, he shared it with everyone
near him. The sight of he and Bryant together was counterpoint to
the supposed rift between them in previous years. When asked about
his contributions Monday, he made a point to single out all of the
big shots and big plays from his teammates in the fourth quarter --
three-pointers by Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He saved his kindest words for Jackson, who won six titles with
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great motivator,'' he said. ``I think we needed Phil
because of his resume. He was a no-nonsense coach. He wouldn't
accept any of the nonsense that we had in the past, when guys would
goof in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of discipline I was used to, from my father,
from (former LSU coach) Dale Brown. It was what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq Monday got what he needed -- a title to go with his big
shoulders, his big heart, and his Big Tears.

LAKERS SHOW SOMETHING TO ADMIRE IN A CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As much as nobody likes Goliath, nobody loves
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is possible to like, just a little bit, a big-market
champion with a mammoth in the middle and a future that glistens,
the 2000 Los Angeles Lakers just might pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if sports fans can accept pleasantly the New York Yankees
as baseball champions, the Lakers at least deserve the air kiss
popular in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Indiana Pacers, 116-111, Monday night for the NBA
championship, they outsmarted and outworked a team that had been
increasing its edge in both departments as the series went along.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Lakers had Shaquille O'Neal, but he scored just one
point in the final 3:28 when the game was in the balance. The
Lakers got scores on 17 of their final 22 possessions by weaving
together scoring from six different players and multiple key stops
from a team defense that had been mostly missing for the past three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Team ball at its finest _ beating a good team playing its best
and a legendary sports figure coaching his last.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's L.A. It's easier to like gravel underwear than L.A.
And Phil Jackson? The man wins six championships with the game's
greatest player, then wins a seventh with the next greatest player.
Do it in Vancouver, Phil.
</P>
<P>
   But those are superficial matters, having nothing to do with the
basketball at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were superb at times, but often demonstrated a
vulnerability, not only this game, but in this series and
throughout the season, leaving open the possibility that a 67-win
team could be had at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the teams of the Chicago Bulls dynasty, or even of the
two championship teams in Detroit, the Lakers were youngish,
mistake-prone and just too rubbery to be ranked with the greats.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't play the greats. They played in the NBA of 2000.
They were good enough to overcome everyone as well as their own
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neal demonstrated in the moments after the title was won,
they were also endearingly human. As the big man wandered from hug
to hug on the floor of the party-time Staples Center, his face was
locked in teary immobility.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has been packing around his potential for most of his 28
years, never having had a championship as a collegian or a pro.
Finally, the burden was lifted, making for considerable eye
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a composed O'Neal explained himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've held my emotions for about 11 years now,'' he said.
``Three in college and eight here. I've always wanted to win a
championship. It just came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his embarrassments of previous seasons, the big man was
entitled. A year ago, the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs by
San Antonio. Two years ago, they were given the O-fer by Utah. And
in the 1995 Finals, O'Neal's coming out party as a pro when he
played in Orlando, he was shut out by the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the bad days. The good days started Monday night when
O'Neal helped the franchise reconnect with its rich history.
</P>
<P>
   Including its time in Minneapolis, the Lakers have been in 25
Finals. Monday night was the 12th championship, but the first since
1988 _ the fifth title during the time of Magic Johnson, when the
Lakers were Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   After coach Pat Riley left in 1990 and Johnson retired in 1991,
Showtime was dead and a royal franchise had fallen. The Lakers went
through six coaches in the next nine years _ producing just 23
playoff-game victories, compared to the maximum 15 this season _
before connecting the best player with the best coach, Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph was plain even to their chief tormentor over the
past two weeks, Indiana's Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil came here and really gave Shaq a boost of confidence,''
said Miller, who scored 25 points. ``From day one, when Phil sat
down and told him whose team it really was _ I know there was some
tension between him and Kobe Bryant _ everything ran through Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's a great complementary player. That's no shame on Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Shaq is Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all that Monday night, scoring 41 points to give him a
38-point average for the series, fourth-highest in Finals history.
Despite his free-throw troubles and a massive swarm of defenders,
O'Neal was the pillar when the rest of the Lakers shook from the
pressure of doing the expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's improved immensely,'' said Larry Bird, the outgoing
Pacers coach. ``He's just so dominating that they have an
opportunity to do something great here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was brought home at the podium afterward. After team
owner Dr. Jerry Buss finished answering questions, O'Neal sat down
next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming, and referring to his contract, O'Neal looked at his
boss and said, ``Extension ... extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss smiled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you want, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a pleasant prospect for non-Lakers fans. But for one night
anyway, it was possible for almost anyone to be a Lakers admirer
because they beat a good team in a good team way, and did it with
team people.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that has often lost its identity as a team game, a
sticky night in Southern California turned refreshing.

RETURN TO GLORY: SHAQ REIGNS, TEARS FLOW AS LAKERS TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Hollywood, where just about everything is done
on a large scale, they finally figured out how to make the Big Man
cry.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's biggest trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, overcome with
emotion _ as opposed to anything the Indiana Pacers threw at him _
fought back tears Monday night after leading his team to a 116-111
Game 6 victory that wrapped up the NBA Finals in Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal allowed tears that
could create puddles to roll down his face as he hugged teammates
and accepted the series MVP trophy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first title for O'Neal, and the first championship
for the Lakers since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional game, and the ugliest 41 points I've ever
had,'' said O'Neal, who added 12 rebounds and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won the best-of-seven series 4-2, completing a
coronation that many had counted on since the Lakers took a 3-1
series lead. Even though the Pacers claimed all week they were
playing a few Game 7s, O'Neal and Lakers didn't want any part of
one.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers used an explosive fourth quarter, outscoring the
Pacers 37-27, to ignite a celebration in the streets of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The victory preserved Lakers coach Phil Jackson's record in Game
6 of the Finals. Dating back to his six championships with the
Chicago Bulls, Jackson's teams had never faced a Game 7 in the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is now 6-0 in those situations after winning his seventh
championship as coach, in addition to a ring in 1973 as a member of
the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed Phil to do it,'' said O'Neal, who earlier called
Jackson the league's ``real'' Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Several Lakers finally stepped up to help O'Neal down the
stretch. Kobe Bryant, who finished with 26 points despite 8-for-27
shooting, made four free throws in the final 13 seconds to seal the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just determination,'' Bryant said. ``And P.J. (Phil
Jackson) did an excellent job. Shaq was marvelous and out bench was
great. We just pulled it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana played well enough to win, but fell apart in crucial
moments. Despite shooting 46 percent and having five players reach
double figures in scoring, the Pacers gave up 21 points off just
nine turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did an excellent job for three quarters,'' said Pacers
coach Larry Bird, whose three-year coaching career ended with the
loss. ``When it came to the end of the game, we couldn't get the
stops that we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose led Indiana with 29 points and Reggie Miller added
25, but neither player scored a significant field goal in the final
three minutes. Rose's jumper with 1.9 seconds left was too little,
too late. After erasing a seven-point deficit in the fourth
quarter, the Pacers trailed 112-109 when Miller missed a chance to
tie the game, attempting a 30-foot 3-pointer that bounced off the
back iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give L.A. credit,'' Miller said. ``Every time we
made a run, they found a way to get back into the ballgame. They
always found an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for questioning whether the Lakers had a killer
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a way to start a millennium,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was clinging to a 110-109 advantage when Glen Rice
hit a pair of free throws with 1:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   Down 110-103 with 2:20 remaining, the Pacers fouled O'Neal every
time he touched the ball. The strategy worked. O'Neal missed three
of four free throws while the Pacers scored six straight points.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward Robert Horry broke a 103-103 tie, hitting a
hanging floater in the lane. O'Neal followed with a fadeaway bank
shot before Bryant's 20-foot jumper demoralized the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana missed four straight shots during the Lakers' run.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who had led for nearly three quarters, found
themselves down 97-92 with seven minutes left in the game. Horry's
3-pointer capped an 11-2 run that revived the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Until that surge, the Lakers' offense consisted mostly of O'Neal
staking out deep post position, converting layups and dunks, and
getting fouled in the process.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed several free throws that would have put the Lakers
ahead. It wasn't until he finally scored on a running hook shot
with 8:58 left that the Lakers went in front. O'Neal's basket put
the Lakers ahead 91-90 _ their first lead since a 24-23 edge in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were on target from beyond the arc. Los Angeles made
10 of 17 3-pointers _ six in the fourth quarter. Indiana made 12 of
25 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well enough to win,'' said Indiana's Dale Davis, who
had 20 points and 14 rebounds. ``We didn't execute down the stretch
like we normally do. We made some mental mistakes, we got some bad
breaks and the ball bounced their way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Pacers exorcised the shooting demons they
encountered in four previous visits to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Every Pacer except center Rik Smits (1-for-7) played with a
sharp shooting eye in the first half. Indiana took mostly jump
shots and made 50 percent of them in the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana could not maintain _ a problem the Pacers endured
throughout the series.
</P>
<P>
   In a tale of two halves, the Pacers began to wither while O'Neal
stayed strong, scoring 13 of his 20 second-half points in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who has several nicknames, all of which carry the prefix
``Big,'' was just that in closing out the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Champion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.

OWNER BUSS GLAD HE SPLURGED TO BRING JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss was about to
leave the postgame press conference when center Shaquille O'Neal,
next up for the media, sat down at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had one word for Buss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extension,'' O'Neal said. ``Extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss, who hadn't been in this celebratory situation for 12
years, was in no mood to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want, baby,'' Buss said. ``Whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss was in a giving mood Monday, after the Lakers had defeated
the Indiana Pacers 116-111 to capture the NBA title in six games.
</P>
<P>
   He had set the stage for the championship a year ago, when he
finally went against his history and shelled out a hefty salary for
Phil Jackson to coach the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident that it would be a big improvement,'' Buss
said. ``But to think that he could take us all the way to the
championship - I couldn't even imagine that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing left to the imagination by the time Game 6 had
come to an end. The Lakers had their 12th title in franchise
history, Buss his sixth as owner of the Lakers and Jackson his
seventh overall - six coming while leading the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Buss said he doubted anyone else could have pulled off this
championship but Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some great coaches, but I think this took a very
special combination of talents,'' Buss said. ``You know, Pat Riley,
a long time ago, was able to knit together a bunch of superstars
and make them into a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil has been able to do that with this team. And at least in
my mind, I'd have to doubt that anyone else could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, of course, was led by O'Neal, both the MVP of the
regular season and the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's noticed this fantastic improvement,'' Buss said.
``The way he passes, the fact that he can shoot so much better.
He's developed a lot of shots that I hadn't seen until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think it's a question of confidence. He just seems
to feel that he is the best player, and he set out to demonstrate
it and certainly did so, I think, to everyone's satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buss' office window overlooking the court at the team's new
practice facility in El Segundo, there are five NBA championship
trophies looking down. Every day at practice, the Lakers have been
able to look up and see what their goal looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite a three-point lead and the ball with 5.4 seconds to
play, Buss said he still wasn't confident he'd add a sixth trophy
to his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax?'' he said. ``Well, at 5.4 seconds, I was still nervous.
But they gave Kobe (Bryant) three seconds to dribble (before
fouling), and I figured that was the end of the game.''

JACKSON'S SPOT IN HISTORY? NOT NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even as he closed within one victory of the
championship, coach Phil Jackson said he was too focused on the
present to think about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The championship the Los Angeles Lakers won Monday night made
Jackson the second coach ever to win championships with two teams,
joining Alex Hannum.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he would put himself in a class with
legends such as Red Auerbach, Jackson declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not important,'' he said. ``To look at it when
you're in the midst of something, you do what you have to do. When
you retire 10, 15 years down the road - God willing, you're still
alive - you think about those things at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing: The Lakers were dismissive of a news report Monday that
executive vice president Jerry West would retire at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the annual `Jerry West is going to retire' rumor,''
Lakers spokesman John Black said. ``And that's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   West was unavailable for comment and did not attend Monday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did not attend a single game, home or away, in the
last two playoff series. West has described watching the games as
too stressful and said he prefers to avoid the media swarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's too nervous,'' Lakers owner Jerry Buss said. ``He has
the hyper-anxiety problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more years: As Buss addressed the media, Shaquille O'Neal
playfully interrupted - ``Extension. Extension.'' - referring to
the contract extension he's eligible for this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, under contract through 2003, can sign for up to three
more years, for a maximum total of $83.5 million. Lakers sources
say it's unlikely they will pay the max, because it would trigger
the NBA's new luxury tax, which Buss has vowed not to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But amidst Monday's championship celebration, Buss could only
say to O'Neal, ``Whatever you want, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Rewarded: Three years ago, Rick Fox turned down millions more
elsewhere to sign a short-term deal with the Lakers, in hopes of
reaching a night like Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, man, the money isn't even an issue right now. You
know, you look at it, I'd play for free to have this feeling,'' Fox
said. ``We've had so many chances to make it happen this year, and
we've fallen on our faces. But the bottom line is we're still
champions, and we got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just settling in,'' he said of the feeling. ``But I
thought of my dad, and I ran to him. I thought of all the years of
trying to get to this point and the joy, then tears, and joy, then
tears, and champagne in the nose. And then a takedown by Shaquille
(who tackled him in the locker room). There's a lot of things I'm
feeling right now, and I'm just enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubious honor: As it turns out, the Lakers set an NBA record
with Friday's Game 5 loss at Indiana. The defeat was their sixth in
an elimination game - the most ever for a single postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' Jackson said sarcastically, offering two
thumbs up and a grin. ``It doesn't say a thing. It says something
about this team a little bit, but that's not the story.''

LAKERS WIN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One more sputter for suspense. One more pause for
dramatic effect. One more blistering, dazzling, stubborn charge up
the hill, one big grasp for the crown.
</P>
<P>
   One more banner for the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   One long drought ended, wiped out by a cloudburst of confetti
and a downpour of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, title-less since Showtime faded out more
than a decade ago, are NBA champions once more.
</P>
<P>
   Their 116-111 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night
clinched the Finals, four games to two, and set off a thunderous
celebration on the Staples Center floor, with 18,997 of the Lakers
faithful joining in.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, brought together four years
ago to bring about this renewal, embraced at midcourt after the
final buzzer - the Lakers having finally restored the glory that
has lain dormant since the last title in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' said Bryant, ``that champagne burned so much
when it gets in your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old star quickly got used to the feeling. Everything
else he felt, he could hardly describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't, man. I just feel so numb,'' said Bryant, his fiance,
Vanessa Laine, at his side, and his mother, Pam, standing nearby.
``I just feel numb. I put the championship T-shirt on, put the hat
on, celebrated with my family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory will bring a seventh championship banner to Staples
Center. It comes in just the first season for coach Phil Jackson,
who brought the magic touch and the steady hand to L.A. that won
him six titles with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for L.A.!'' Jackson shouted to the packed house as
players passed around the Lawrence O'Brien Trophy. ``What a way to
start the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Jackson's seventh title in nine years, and first without
Michael Jordan, cementing his status as the era's greatest coach.
But it's the first title for his young proteges, Bryant and O'Neal,
who figure to add several more before they are through here.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson got the pair of superstars to work together, producing a
67-win season and now the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud of our team for holding up under a lot of
pressure, a lot of criticism,'' Jackson said. ``Their confidence
oozed out. They remained confident. They took a lot of hits, had
resiliency and kept coming back. For that part, I was grateful for
these guys. The spirit was just wonderful with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, whose 41 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots led
the Lakers on Monday, was the unanimous choice for Finals MVP,
adding the trophy to his regular-season and All-Star Game MVP
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Phil when he was coaching for the Bulls it's
not what he did with Michael and Scottie (Pippen), but how he got
the other guys to play,'' O'Neal said. ``When he came here he put
it down on a piece of paper. He said this is how it's gonna go,
this is what were gonna do. And he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 26 points - including the final four - in the
victory, but it took contributions all the way down the bench to
finish the championship run: 16 points from Glen Rice, the
sometimes-disenchanted third wheel; a combined 21 points from
Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher, all former starters who
willingly went to the bench; six points from Ron Harper, a
three-time champion in Chicago; and six from A.C. Green, the lone
link to the Showtime era, who was here for the last celebration a
dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through ups and downs, but the most important thing is
that we believed in one another,'' said Bryant, ``and we believed
in the system. We believed in sitting in a room and meditating and
Phil lighting incense in the room and doing all kinds of crazy
stuff. But we believed in it and we believed in one another and
this championship shows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rice, ``We learned a lot. We've been able to grow together.
... I mean, we really worked hard, we fought together and to be
able to raise that trophy up out there is an unbelievable
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, too, that they would pull it off after so many
missed chances.
</P>
<P>
   It took multiple tries to win every round of the playoffs. But
the fits and starts and the hiccups only intensified the suspense,
added to the anticipation and made the crowning moment that much
sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 appropriately symbolized the entire run. An early
12-point deficit. Trailing continuously until the fourth quarter. A
lead, then a tie. Then another lead. And finally, the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The imperfect championship game, for the imperfect championship
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to happen that way,'' Fisher said, ``because if it
happens too easy, you don't appreciate it, and I think now we
respect that team, we respect the fact that in order to win a
championship, you have to keep working hard all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost every quarter and trailed continuously until the
fourth. But O'Neal's hook off the glass with 9:02 left gave the
Lakers a 91-90 lead and the run for the rings was on.
</P>
<P>
   Fox followed with a 3-pointer over Austin Croshere, Staples
Center erupted, and Fox bumped chests with Rice at the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Then an Horry 3-pointer, a pair of O'Neal putback jams, and the
Lakers led 101-94. But the Pacers, who provided a stiffer challenge
throughout the series than many anticipated, scrapped back. Jalen
Rose scored seven quick points, capped by a 3-pointer over Bryant,
and the Pacers tied the game at 103. The building went nearly
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers, who have made a habit of comebacks, launched
their final surge, taking a a 109-103 lead with 3:28 left. A pair
of Austin Croshere free throws provided the final chill, cutting
the lead to 110-109 with 1:32 to go, but Rice made a pair of free
throws with 1:16 left, then Bryant provided the final four points
from the line.
</P>
<P>
   After his final two, with 2.5 seconds left, Bryant walked toward
the bench, looked to the stands and pointed at his ring finger.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, it was all champagne and cigar
smoke. O'Neal tackled Fox in the center of the room. John Salley
kissed the O'Brien Trophy. Teammates chased Green, not yet doused
with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like I'm dreaming right now, like you guys
aren't even here,'' Bryant said. ``I swear, man. I must be trapped
in `the Matrix.' ''

 &HT;    Roth IRA still not widely understood
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lot of experts believed Roth individual retirement
accounts would be a big hit by now.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA offers a tremendous tax break for people who can put
away $2,000 a year and let it grow. It has big advantages for
people who are planning how they will pass their money along to
their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7 percent of U.S. households own Roth IRAs. Research
suggests that most of the money in those accounts came not from
newly inspired savers but from stock market gains and rollovers
from other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at some of the questions I get about it,'' said
William J. Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``There
is a lot of confusion out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Befuddlement is not the only reason Roths are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that many families are putting their retirement
dollars into the more attractive 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers match a portion of what their
employees put into the plans. ``Faced with a choice, they're
following the money,'' said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Income limits separate other families from Roth accounts. At the
low end, there may not be enough money for investments. In a recent
survey, 23 percent of respondents told EBRI that they couldn't
afford to save. That was the most common reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, both traditional and Roth IRAs have income
ceilings that discourage or ban IRA contributions. To add to the
confusion, limits are different for traditional and Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   But for many other families, the blocks are emotional. They
arise from attitudes, not from legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth IRA doesn't offer an immediate tax break. ``That turns
them off,'' said Kring. ``Until someone explains it, they just
don't see the benefit. It's hard to understand the value of coming
out tax-free 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the major attractions of a Roth: When you
withdraw the money, you pay no income taxes at all. If your
investments have been compounding for several decades, the tax
break will be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional IRAs do provide a deduction for your contribution.
But that benefit disappears if your income exceeds certain amounts.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get a deduction for a full contribution of $2,000,
you will save $560. That assumes the middle-class tax rate of 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether you would rather grab the $560 now or
take the Roth and escape taxes on a much larger amount later.
</P>
<P>
   People believe that Congress will realize how much money is
involved and cancel the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that five or 10 years from now they might say, `This
program is too expensive. Let's stop,' '' Kring said. ``I don't
believe they will roll back the benefits for people who have
already taken advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with traditional IRAs. The program is still
there, but income limits have made it less attractive to new
savers.
</P>
<P>
   People just don't understand Roth IRAs. ``As long as the law
stays as complicated as it is, which discourages advertising by
financial institutions and discourages understanding by consumers,
we're going to have relatively low utilization,'' Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the IRS instruction booklet about IRAs is 84 pages long.
But the basics of Roth IRAs are fairly easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   You can contribute up to $2,000 a year as long as you have that
much in taxable income and your income is below certain limits. If
you are married filing jointly, the ceiling is $160,000. If you are
close to that limit, check the details.
</P>
<P>
   You get no tax deduction now. But you owe no taxes later,
assuming you held the account for at least five years and you are
now at least 59 1/2 years old. There are loopholes, including
death, disability and first-home purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You are not required to start taking the money out after age 70
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Some families just haven't made the commitment to save.
</P>
<P>
   In the EBRI's survey, half the respondents who are not saving
for retirement said that they could save $20 a week , but they are
not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand the magic of compounding and how quickly
assets can grow if you just save consistently,'' said Salisbury.

   Roth investors are somewhat more aggressive. They are younger
than traditional IRA investors (44 vs. 49). In addition, fewer Roth
investors are retired (11% vs. 22%).
</P>
<P>
   Roth investors have lower financial assets ($100,000 vs.
$150,000).
</P>
<P>
   But Roth investors have tucked away more of their assets in
their IRAs ($40,000 vs. $34,000).

 &HT;    Roth IRA still not widely understood
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lot of experts believed Roth individual retirement
accounts would be a big hit by now.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA offers a tremendous tax break for people who can put
away $2,000 a year and let it grow. It has big advantages for
people who are planning how they will pass their money along to
their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7 percent of U.S. households own Roth IRAs. Research
suggests that most of the money in those accounts came not from
newly inspired savers but from stock market gains and rollovers
from other accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at some of the questions I get about it,'' said
William J. Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``There
is a lot of confusion out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Befuddlement is not the only reason Roths are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that many families are putting their retirement
dollars into the more attractive 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers match a portion of what their
employees put into the plans. ``Faced with a choice, they're
following the money,'' said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Income limits separate other families from Roth accounts. At the
low end, there may not be enough money for investments. In a recent
survey, 23 percent of respondents told EBRI that they couldn't
afford to save. That was the most common reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, both traditional and Roth IRAs have income

 &HT;    Roth IRA still not widely understood
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lot of experts believed Roth individual retirement
accounts would be a big hit by now.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA offers a tremendous tax break for people who can put
away $2,000 a year and let it grow. It has big advantages for
people who are planning how they will pass their money along to
their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   But only 7 percent of U.S. households own Roth IRAs. Research
suggests that most of the money in those accounts came not from
newly inspired savers but from stestions I get about it,'' said
William J. Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``There
is a lot of confusion out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Befuddlement is not the only reason Roths are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that many families are putting their retirement
dollars into the more attractive 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most employers match a portion of what their
employees put into the plans. ``Faced with a choice, they're
following the money,'' said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Income limits separate other families from Roth accounts. At the
low end, there may not be enough money for investments. In a recent
survey, 23 percent of respondents told EBRI that they couldn't
afford to save. That was the most common reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, both traditional and Roth IRAs have income
ceilings that discourage or ban IRA contributions. To add to the
confusion, limits are different for traditional and Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   But for many other families, the blocks are emotional. They
arise from attitudes, not from legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth IRA doesn't offer an immediate tax break. ``That turns
them off,'' said Kring. ``Until someone explains it, they just
don't see the benefit. It's hard to understand the value of coming
out tax-free 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the major attractions of a Roth: When you
withdraw the money, you pay no income taxes at all. If your
investments have been compounding for several decades, the tax
break will be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional IRAs do provide a deduction for your contribution.
But that benefit disappears if your income exceeds certain amounts.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get a deduction for a full contribution of $2,000,
you will save $560. That assumes the middle-class tax rate of 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether you would rather grab the $560 now or
take the Roth and escape taxes on a much larger amount later.
</P>
<P>
   People believe that Congress will realize how much money is
involved and cancel the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that five or 10 years from now they might say, `This
program is too expensive. Let's stop,' '' Kring said. ``I don't
believe they will roll back the benefits for people who have
already taken advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with traditional IRAs. The program is still
there, but income limits have made it less attractive to new
savers.
</P>
<P>
   People just don't understand Roth IRAs. ``As long as the law
stays as complicated as it is, which discourages advertising by
financial institutions and discourages understanding by consumers,
we're going to have relatively low utilization,'' Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the IRS instruction booklet about IRAs is 84 pages long.
But the basics of Roth IRAs are fairly easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   You can contribute up to $2,000 a year as long as you have that
much in taxable income and your income is below certain limits. If
you are married filing jointly, the ceiling is $160,000. If you are
close to that limit, check the details.
</P>
<P>
   You get no tax deduction now. But you owe no taxes later,
assuming you held the account for at least five years and you are
now at least 59 1/2 years old. There are loopholes, including
death, disability and first-home purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You are not required to start taking the money out after age 70
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Some families just haven't made the commitment to save.
</P>
<P>
   In the EBRI's survey, half the respondents who are not saving
for retirement said that they could save $20 a week , but they are
not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand the magic of compounding and how quickly
assets can grow if you just save consistently,'' said Salisbury.
</P>
<P>

   Note: Totals exceed 100% because many households invest in

</P>
<P>
   COMPARING THE IRAS
</P>
<P>
   Roth investors are somewhat more aggressive. They are younger
than traditional IRA investors (44 vs. 49). In addition, fewer Roth
investors are retired (11% vs. 22%).
</P>
<P>
   Roth investors have lower financial assets ($100,000 vs.
$150,000).
</P>
<P>
   But Roth investors have tucked away more of their assets in
their IRAs ($40,000 vs. $34,000).

 &HT;    Squirrel dynamics featuring Fats and Sheena
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A feisty new squirrel has moved into my yard
_ and she's a she. At least I'm pretty sure. We haven't talked, nor
have I done any impertinent snooping but I've named her ``Sheena,
Queena Madison Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena isn't much to look at. Her tail isn't the bushiest, and
she has that most unattractive Rodentia overbite, but what she
lacks in beauty, she makes up for in dynamics. In short order, she
has taken over. Even ``Madison Fats,'' the dominant male of the
side yard gets all silly acting now when Sheena comes shimmying
across the mulch.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when Sheena first showed up, Fats tried chasing her
away from his sunflower seed saucer. Apparently shocked by his
ungentlemanly behavior, Sheena backed off a couple of feet, sat up
on her haunches, and gave poor old Fats what for. Naturally, I
couldn't tell what she was calling him in squirrel chatter, but it
worked. Fats doesn't mess with Sheena any more _ hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The other afternoon as I watched from the kitchen window, Sheena
zoomed down the side of the big pine and skidded to a rather
ungraceful halt right at the rim of the saucer where Fats was
enjoying a lengthy petit dejeuner. He dropped a fat seed he'd been
turning over in his paws and stared at the pushy young lady who'd
had the nerve to come between him and his chow.
</P>
<P>
   Fats feinted a move toward her. Sheena stared at him, but didn't
flinch. Instead, she stuck her head out as far as it would go on
her furry neck and told him a thing or two. Now it was Fats's turn
to stare. What with their beady little eyes and all, it was tough
to tell who blinked first.
</P>
<P>
   Sheena quickly tired of this inactivity and moved on. Fats and I
watched as she headed for the new bird feeder that hangs from a
tree limb, six feet from the ground and three feet from the trunk.
We weren't worried because neither Fats nor any member of his clan
had been able to master this huge, three-barreled, squirrel-proof
beauty. Sheena gave it a once-over from the ground, scooted up the
tree, ran out on the limb, and leaped onto the roof, hind paws
scratching for purchase, fingers wrapped around the chain.
</P>
<P>
   One foot at a time, she tried grabbing onto something, anything,
but there was nothing. She skidded first one way and then another,
arching her body to shift the weight so she could ride out the
feeder's wild gyrations. Fats and I gawked.
</P>
<P>
   Shewas that when it comes to off-road driving, one should never
expect to exceed 5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And we wondered why all those SUVs seem to go belly up when
trying to negotiate bad on-road weather conditions at 70 mph. ``You
will want to left-foot brake. You will also want to be very gentle
on both the brake and the accelerator pedal. Never do anything
abruptly or unexpectedly.''
</P>
<P>
   With the basics tucked neatly in mind, it was time to go. We
slowly meandered our way among the West Virginia hardwoods and
conifers, up and down the hills. And then we got to the edge. There
I sat with the Discovery's front bumper extended over heaven only
knew what. Green instructed me to set the hill descent control, a
clever little feature that maintains an almost crawl mode in the
vehicle. ``Let's go, and whatever you do, don't touch the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't touch the brake? The ground is disappearing below me as
I'm about to dive off into an abyss, and she is telling me not to
touch the brake. But you have to trust your instructor, there to
take care of you and the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   So in spite of what every muscle in my body wanted to do, I
didn't touch the brake. Once the vehicle pivoted over the edge, I
could at least see where we were headed and it wasn't quite so bad.
It looked like we were driving down a muddy version of an Olympic
ski jump.
</P>
<P>
   Physics told me Green was right. When you touch the brake, you
transfer weight to the front of the vehicle. With the Discovery
already in what seemed like a vertical drop, the last thing you
wanted to do was to take weight off the tail. Gravity might take
over, and we would tumble down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we splashed through the stream at the bottom. Anything
else was going to be easy. It's an adrenaline rush at 4 mph.
</P>
<P>
   My reward for a job well done was to move to the larger Range
Rover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want me to drive this $70,000 vehicle through that
river?''
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what I was being instructed to do. Water was up
to the middle of the grill, but there was not a drop on my green
waders or the carpet of the Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   If I had any misconception of a cushier course for the cushier
upscale Range Rover, those notions were quickly erased. It was
pretty much the second chorus of the same song, except for that
ski-jumplike decline.

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about prayer is you don't need a church or a
temple or a mosque to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is a rabbi or a priest or a holy blessed sanctioned
uniformed official of any kind absolutely essential to your
mission.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need any structure or any person or anybody's
permission if you want to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter who you are, either. Beggars and death row
prisoners have the same freedom to talk to God as do kings and
billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   In saying that, I mean no disrespect to any houses of worships
or individuals who are heeding a higher calling. Lord knows we live
in times when organized religion can be a great source of strength
and comfort to those whose beliefs conform to a particular brand.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all that stuff is _ brand name worship. Wrap yourself
in your religion and quote scripture or condemn my soul all you
want for saying that, but if you tell me you're 100 percent sure
that your religion is the only right path, the only one with a
direct pipeline to the only one true all-powerful God, I'm going to
tell you I think you're going to have some interesting
conversations in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days I've had two major reasons to pray _
the baptism of a child and the serious illness of a friend. One
involved attendance at a 125-year-old church and taking communion
and reciting sacred vows as the godfather; the other involved
informal appeals and hopes. Nobody's going to tell me one set of
prayers was more effective than another. I don't believe in that
kind of God.
</P>
<P>
   What you can't dispute is this: If anyone on this planet wants
to talk to God or Buddha or the clouds in the sky, if anyone wants
to give all glory and praise to a higher being, if anyone wants to
appeal to the spirits or a statue or a vision or a burning bush,
nobody can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   That's because prayer can be silent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact private prayer may be the best mode of all. Once you
start shouting from the mountain top and preaching to the perceived
heathens and arguing with people whose beliefs and rituals differ
from yours, hatred and war are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is
one of the most important provisions in the Constitution, as it
proclaims the government will not allow the establishment of any
single religion. You may think separation of church and state is a
terrible thing, but let me ask you this: What if the official
national religion wasn't the same as yours?
</P>
<P>
   Now all of a sudden you're talking revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court made a wise and fair ruling Monday with its
6-3 vote declaring prayer in public schools must be private.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the court didn't ban school prayer. It simply agreed
with other rulings on this subject that have been made over the
last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   What frightens me is that three justices voted the other way,
and that many Republicans, including presidential hopeful and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, disagreed with the ruling. The same party
that's always talking about making sure the government doesn't
stick its nose in our business wants government to sanction laws
pushing prayers onto everyone, believers and nonbelievers alike.
</P>
<P>
   What a convenient shift in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this latest controversy is one Marian Ward, a
student at Santa Fe High School in Texas, who uttered the words
``Lord'' and ``Jesus'' over the public address system before
several thousand fans prior to a football game on the night of
Sept. 3, 1999, thus defying an earlier Supreme Court ruling against
the Santa Fe Independent School District, which had been sued by
the American Civil Liberties Union after a series of incidents in
which Christianity was promoted in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question was if Santa Fe was violating the First
Amendment by allowing student-led prayer at high school football
games.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Christian you might shout: Hell (or Heck) no! But
what if the Buddhists, the Muslims, the Mormons and the Jews wanted
equal time? That OK with you? Start lining up all the religions and
the football game will never kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   (Not that the above groups are exactly well represented in the
Santa Fe school district, which is why it's easier to trample their
rights.)
</P>
<P>
   My favorite respondent to Ward's crusade was her classmate,
Amanda Bruce, whose constitutionally correct campaign included the
wearing of a button reading WWJD, for ``What Would Jefferson Do?''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, I believe in the rights of players,
cheerleaders, coaches and fans to pray before, during and after
football games. You can thank God in the postgame interview or
curse Him if you fumbled away the game, even though I seriously
doubt He cares.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep it to yourselves.

PROMISES IN THE SKIES: SO FAR TRAVELERS ARE LARGELY UNIMPRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago this month, the nation's major airlines announced
that they would make travel more pleasant by improving customer
service. Fearing that Congress was about to pass a bill of rights
for passengers in response to the increasing chorus of consumer
complaints, airline executives pre-empted the government's plans by
coming up with their own list of a dozen promises. They vowed to
give travelers information about low fares and flight delays. They
said they would make a ``reasonable effort'' to feed people who
were waiting on runways for hours at a time. They promised to
explain frequent-flier rules clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have just about had it,'' Leo Mullin, the chief
executive of Delta Air Lines, said in a speech last year to the
Wings Club, an aviation group in New York. It was time, he said, to
``restore public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what has happened since then:
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints to the Department of Transportation have
almost doubled. Virtually every independent measure of customer
satisfaction has declined. Lines at airports seem to be longer, and
many travelers say the airlines are not living up to at least some
of their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, travelers, to the year of restored public confidence.
We hope you have enjoyed the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate truth is that flying on an airplane today, while
the safest way to travel long distances, is as unpleasant for many
passengers as it has ever been. The strong economy has sent more
planes into the air and kept them nearly full, but airport space,
the air-traffic control system and the size of airline staffs have
all failed to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Following the set of promises, the industry has improved in a
number of areas, travel experts say. Airlines respond more quickly
to complaints and seem to keep passengers better informed about
delays. But the promises have not caused enough improvement to make
up for the problems that remain. And because many travelers can
cite at least one instance in which the airlines have not followed
their own new rules, the industry has managed to raise expectations
above the level of service they are providing.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general of the Department of Transportation,
Kenneth M. Mead, is now studying how well the airlines are living
up their promises and plans to release a final report in December.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is clear: the airlines vowed to improve service,
and few travelers think they have. ``People who travel frequently
think it's pretty tough out there,'' said Rustin Carpenter, vice
president and general manager in Boston at American Express
Consulting Services, which advises corporations on managing their
travel.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Customer Satisfaction Index produced by the
University of Michigan Business School between January and March
using telephone interviews, the airlines received lower customer
satisfaction scores than any other industry. Their cumulative grade
has declined since 1994, the survey's first year. It held steady
this year mainly because Northwest Airlines saw its score rebound
after it had been hampered by a blizzard last year and a strike in
1998. The scores of most carriers declined.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys offer similarly grim news. Since 1998, for
example, the percentage of Americans who think the airlines do a
good job serving their customers has fallen from 78 to 66,
according to Harris Interactive, which conducted a telephone survey
of 1,024 adults in April. Travelers' frustration has reached the
point that on the day last month that biztravel.com announced an
offer to give its customers partial or full refunds when a flight
on selected airlines arrives late, its Web site received so many
visits that it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the problem, industry executives and analysts
agree, is an overburdened air-traffic system. The number of
passengers on domestic carriers grew 40 percent from 1989 to 1999,
according to the Air Transport Association, the major carriers'
trade group. The traffic has increased delays, especially in the
most crowded regions like the Northeast. Meanwhile, tighter
security rules force people to spend more time in line as travelers
in front of them show identification and answer questions about
their bags' contents. ``The whole airport process is much worse
than it was five years ago,'' said Michael Boyd, president of the
Boyd Group, an Evergreen, Colo., aviation consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently voted to increase the FAA's funding by 30
percent, which should help the agency improve air-traffic control
technology and alleviate some delays. And the carriers are
installing devices in airports that allow passengers who are not
checking baggage to print their own boarding passes. Over all,
though, few experts expect the crowds and delays to get much better
anytime soon. The airlines are unlikely to spend the millions of
dollars to enlarge their staffs. And current efforts by government
officials and executives to build new runways and airports face the
usual resistance from nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is new, however. The promises are new, and the crux
of them is a commitment to give passengers better information about
everything from fares to delays to frequent-flier rewards. Airline
executives say they are doing just that. ``Delta has absolutely
lived up to its promise,'' Mullin, the carrier's chief executive,
said in a recent interview. The airline, for instance, now responds
to consumer complaints in eight days on average, versus about a
month last year, according to a spokesman for the airline, John
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers say they see a difference as well. ``I've noticed
instances where they're saying things clearly and precisely that
I'm surprised by and that I don't think I would have heard a couple
years ago,'' said Carpenter, who flies at least once a week. He
added, however, that ``I don't think it's moved the needle
substantially'' from most travelers' perspective. In fact, some of
the promises represented little change for the airlines. Two of the
plan's 12 parts _ making provisions for passengers with special
needs and treating travelers bumped from a flight fairly _ already
existed in the airlines' written ticket contracts, and another four
represented only a small change, according to an audit by the
General Accounting Office, a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other promises are vague enough to leave the
carriers room for fudging. The airlines say they will strive to
return lost bags within 24 hours. They also talk of providing
``timely and complete information'' about frequent-flier
restrictions and other details, without saying whether the
information will appear in the footnotes of a little-read document
or more prominently in a monthly mailing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The holes in the plans have left the industry's critics and more
than a few frequent fliers skeptical that the promises mean much.
``Thus far it's a pretty flimsy showing _ lots of public relations
and not much substance,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has
pushed for a law that would fine the airlines for breaking their
own rules. ``The airlines are in denial,'' he said. ``They refuse
to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem and the breadth of
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Most damaging of all, many travelers say they can readily cite a
recent instance or two in which the airlines have broken one of
their promises. That has aggravated the industry's credibility
problem and is one reason that complaints to the Department of
Transportation have increased so rapidly, travel experts say.
(Another is the newfound ease with which travelers can register
their complaints, via the Internet or a toll-free phone number.)
``I wouldn't assume airlines are any worse than last year,'' said
Terry Trippler, the airline expert for a travel Web site,
onetravel.com, speaking of the spike in complaints. ``Passengers
are just more fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   They often have good reason. In late April, Continental
Airlines' Flight 1031 was scheduled to leave Newark for Fort
Lauderdale at 12:15. With storms over New Jersey, the flight was
delayed. First it sat on the runway for about two hours, said
William Friedman, a Fair Lawn, N.J., resident who was on the plane
with five family members. Then it returned to the gate, and the
passengers got off the plane and sat in the area around the gate
for about an hour. After another unsuccessful boarding and more
hours of sitting on the runway, the plane finally took off at 9
p.m. and arrived in Florida about 13 hours after the passengers had
originally boarded.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the ordeal, Friedman said, Continental fed the
passengers only the sandwich it had planned to serve on the flight.
The uncertainty of when the plane might depart and the lines in the
airport made it impossible for passengers to get food during the
brief times they were waiting in the gate area, Friedman said.
Recognizing this, a flight attendant asked for more food to be
brought on the plane, but a ground supervisor refused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not arguing they should have flown the plane in that
weather,'' Friedman said. ``But we went from 11:30 a.m. to midnight
with a cheese sandwich. I just felt it was inhumane.'' It also
seems to violate one of Continental's 12 promises, which is to make
``every reasonable effort'' to provide food to passengers stuck on
planes for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the policy applies to planes that are stuck on a
runway, not those that return to the gate for a time, according to
David Messing, an airline spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When Friedman returned home and sent an e-mail to the airline,
the response addressed only the delay, not the lack of food. ``They
either misunderstood the point or purposely evaded what the real
issue was,'' he said. Continental did offer him a $25 voucher, but
Friedman refused it on principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of travelers' biggest frustrations is the quality
of information they get from airlines, in spite of the industry's
promises. A Wednesday-night flight last month on American Eagle, a
partner of American Airlines, from Ronald Reagan National Airport
in Washington to Kennedy Airport, is an example. It was scheduled
to arrive at 9:45 p.m. at Gate 40. By 10 p.m., it had not landed,
but airport computer screens still showed it as a 9:45 arrival.
Agents at Gate 40, working with travelers who were supposed to be
on another late flight, said they did not have time to find updated
information for the people who had come to meet the plane. American
Airlines employees at a nearby gate said they could not help either
because American Eagle, and not their airline, operated the flight.
Finally, the plane pulled up to the gate at 10:07 _ without the
computer screen ever showing it as delayed.
</P>
<P>
   A J.D. Power &AMP; Associates survey suggests such anecdotes are
more than just the rare exception. The research firm asked
travelers in its most recent annual study of the airlines to rate
the accuracy of information given at the gate, and the survey found
virtually no improvement in the category over last year. Of the
airlines rated the top three in communicating with passengers _
Continental, Southwest and TWA _ only Continental did better, said
Michael Taylor, J.D. Power's director of travel services.
</P>
<P>
   The gate isn't the only problem area, either. The airlines
continue to exaggerate the benefits of some of their travel
programs by omitting key information from the documents fliers are
most likely to read. Delta's misleading frequent-flier rules are
typical. In the main section of its membership guide, Delta says
passengers flying economy class on Aeromexico receive Delta miles.
There are no asterisks next to the statement. But 20 pages later,
the footnotes reveal that passengers flying in fare classes G (for
groups) and L (which are specially negotiated) in fact receive no
miles. ``How does the ordinary person know what that is?'' asks
Milton Klein, a retired history professor at the University of
Tennessee who said he was surprised to return home from a vacation
and not be credited for part of the trip. ``Apparently, truth in
advertising does not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar problem crops up on the mileage statement Delta sends
each month to 27 million passengers. It neglects to mention that
one of the most popular awards _ a trip to Europe _ cannot be used
during the summer on the very days most people would want to use
it: Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. Asked about the problems, Kevin
Pinto, system manager of SkyMiles, said the company would fix them.
It is worth noting, though, that Klein's complaint led Delta to
send him a copy of its rules but not to change them.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching problem is that one year after making their
promises, the airlines still seem to lack a fundamental
understanding of how to treat passengers, travel consultants say.
The carriers often reply to passengers' letters by restating a
policy rather than responding to a specific complaint, for example.
Or they install baggage templates halfway between the ticket
counter and the gate, forcing travelers whose bags are too big to
retrace their steps. As Boyd, the Colorado aviation consultant,
said, ``Airlines still want to make passengers do business their
way.''

BEDDING DOWN AT 35,000 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are not even off the runway yet, and already a chubby
businessman is shuffling along the aisle in his jammies and socks,
a contented smile on his face. It is nearly 7 p.m. in New York in
the thorax of a Boeing 747 headed for London, and he is headed for
bed in the new British Airways flying dormitory for trans-Atlantic
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 70 of us getting ready to tuck in for the night,
20 in the upstairs loft of the 747, the rest of us downstairs
behind the first-class compartment. We each have a snug little pod
that converts from a seat to a bed. We have been promised warm milk
and cookies as we doze off in New York, and hot tea and breakfast
when we wake up before arrival in London. It sounds heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a single volley of flights between Kennedy
Airport in New York and Heathrow near London, but expanding to all
of its long-haul routes by the end of this year, British Airways is
the first major airline to equip its business-class cabins with
reclining chairs that convert into fully flat six-foot beds.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not first, Virgin Atlantic also went horizontal
last week with flat beds in its Upper Class service, which is a
hybrid of first and business classes. The service is currently
offered only on selected flights between Dulles near Washington and
Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   Flat beds have been part of first-class airplane travel for
several years, at least on long flights across the oceans. But as
airlines step up the competition to entice the lucrative business
traveler, the flying bed is certain to become one of the more
attractive perks _ at a price that could cause most leisure
travelers to lose sleep.
</P>
<P>
   My bed, for example, costs $2,986.40 for the night. Even so, I'm
guaranteed not to get eight hours of sleep, because the flight from
New York to London lasts only seven.
</P>
<P>
   Forget counting sheep; I'm too busy counting dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With very little planning, for example, an economy-class ticket
on this same plane costs $564.40, one way. (With a lot of planning,
a round-trip fare of just $352 can be found.) Subtracting the
element of travel, then, I'm spending nearly $2,500 extra for the
possibility of a restful sleep in what British Airways describes as
a ``lounge in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, my employer is spending the money.
Airlines long ago recognized that business travelers rarely spend
their own money. As a result, the cost of the ticket is often less
important than the cushier amenities like food, wine, entertainment
and, now, beds.
</P>
<P>
   By some lofty standards, my British Airways business-class
sleeper seat may actually be a bargain. Sometime in the next couple
of years, according to Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin
Atlantic, Virgin will ``bring the romance back to flying'' by
offering private cabins with double beds and showers on some of its
trans-Atlantic crossings. No pricing has been determined, but one
can expect fares to be mile-high.
</P>
<P>
   The beds in first class on this British Airways flight, just a
few steps in front of me, go for $4,895.40 (what's with the 40
cents?) one way. The extra $1,909 over business class entitles the
elite flier to a cotton sleeper suit, more attentive service,
fancier food and wine, more privacy, more space and a bed that is
six inches longer than mine.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, to sleep in a coach-class seat, just
as it is possible to sleep behind the wheel of a car or on a bench
in a bus station. The most relaxing thing about sleeping in coach
is that you are not wasting your entire vacation budget on what is
likely to be a few hours of slumber.
</P>
<P>
   But just for the sake of argument, let us attempt the
justification that business travelers use: A flying bed allows us
to arrive in London well rested at 7 a.m., ready for a day of
important meetings. Sleep, after all, is the best defense against
jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways boasts that it enlisted the aid of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists in the effort to
improve the sleep of its most valued travelers. Among the findings
was that people achieve deep, dream-filled sleep only when they are
fully reclined 180 degrees _ flat, that is. On a typical
business-class seat, in contrast, the maximum angle of repose is
about 130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA influence is evident from the moment I wedge myself
into my cloth-upholstered seat, 18J of business class, on Flight
174. Although not as claustrophobic as the Mercury space capsule
mockup I once entered, it clearly reflects the fact that on an
airliner, even one as large as a Boeing 747, every inch is
precious.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran business travelers know this, and as a result they know
about such things as seat pitch. Pitch, defined as the distance
between a spot on a seat to the same spot on the seat in front, is
73 inches on these sleeper seats _ at least a foot more, British
Airways says, than the pitch of its major competitors'
business-class seats and nearly two feet greater than average for
all business class.
</P>
<P>
   To fit the maximum number of beds into business class with the
minimum loss of privacy, British Airways has arranged the pods in a
most peculiar way. There are eight pods in each row, two by the
port windows, four in the middle, and two by the starboard windows.
All aisle seats face forward. The rest _ the seats closest to the
windows, and the center two rows _ face backward. The pods are
staggered slightly so that the feet of one passenger are not
directly in the adjoining passenger's face. It is the original
S-type love-seat configuration, so that when the seats are in their
upright position, passengers in adjoining seats are almost thigh to
thigh in opposite directions. The two center pods are the only ones
in the traditional side-by-side alignment, except that they both
face backward.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this love-seat fashion that I meet the gentleman in
18G, facing backward, who greets me by offering any kind of
software I want for my laptop computer, free, if I will change
seats to enable him to travel with his business partner.
``Anything,'' he says. ``Microsoft Office, anything by Adobe, you
name it, I've got it.'' And to prove it, he opens a suitcase
crammed full of shiny CD-RO
</P>
<P>
   Declining his offer of bootleg software, I agree to change to an
aisle seat opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It is then that the happy-looking businessman pads down the
aisle in his jammies. We are not even aloft, and he has already
changed into his nightclothes, no small feat given his generous
girth. While the seats have been expanded, the lavatories are still
about the size of a phone booth.
</P>
<P>
   I did not think to pack pajamas. People in first class get
sleeper suits and a duvet and cover, a flight attendant named Omros
tells me, but in business class we get a pair of cotton slipper
socks, a sleep mask and a faux cashmere blanket, along with a
toiletry kit that includes a toothbrush and toothpaste, a razor and
assorted lotions.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Omros if people in first class snore, but this is British
Airways, of course, and he is too discreet to answer. Later,
another flight attendant confides that snoring is indeed a problem
throughout the plane.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Before going to sleep, I examine my pod. It reminds me of an
armchair, with a hard plastic cocoon around my shoulders and waist.
Around me, I notice that there is no place to put my junk. There is
precious little storage space within easy reach, although there is
ample storage overhead (business class allows two carry-ons). A
small compartment under my knees can hold business papers, but it
is hardly deep enough to hold a teddy bear. A reading light on a
flexible stalk snakes out from over my left shoulder. There is a
``cocktail table,'' a fold-down tray just large enough to hold the
glass of milk and cookie. Beneath that, a power plug for a laptop
computer (but it requires an adapter, which fortunately I had
bought in advance).
</P>
<P>
   A larger tray, for a meal or a laptop computer, is embedded in
the right arm of the cocoon. Everyone seems to have trouble
extracting the tray. I break a fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   Under my left elbow is a telephone that doubles as a video game
controller. Games are displayed, along with flight information and
a selection of movies and television shows, on a small, 8.4-inch
video screen that swings out on a swivel arm from the back of my
neighbor's cocoon, just to my left. There are 18 channels,
including one that shows the plane's current position on a map, and
the startling news that it is 70 degrees below zero outside.
</P>
<P>
   Built into the cocoon are a pair of Sally Rand-style plastic
fans that, when fully raised, afford about as much privacy as
Rand's fans did many years ago. That is to say, it is more
perceived than real.
</P>
<P>
   It is a snug affair. I am not a large man _ a little over 70
inches tall _ yet I fill every available inch of my bed and then
some. I notice that several passengers who appear to be much taller
are sleeping reclined but not supine, including a tall, elegant
woman facing me from a center seat. Tall people just won't fit on
the bed without bending somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Length is not the only problem. The seats are narrow, and the
only way my arms will fit inside the hard cocoon is to jam them
against my sides.
</P>
<P>
   I look back at the plump businessman in his pajamas, and he,
like many others around me, is sleeping on his side, perhaps
because he and they cannot fit otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   I choose to stay on my back, with my arms folded over my chest,
but that makes it impossible to banish thoughts of mummies and
coffins _ except that I imagine few people would be climbing over
my coffin. And that is the major design flaw of the flying
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   The beds are 72 inches long. The seat pitch is 73 inches. So,
passengers are literally sleeping head to toe. Because there is
only one inch between rows, people who are not on the aisle _ that
is, half of business-class passengers _ are trapped in their seats
when their neighbors travel to dreamland. The only way to get out
to the lavatory is to climb awkwardly over the passenger sleeping
on the aisle, or to wake the person and ask him or her to drop the
footstool that acts as the bottom foot of the bed. In first class,
every sleeper seat is on an aisle, which avoids this problem.
(Toward the bulkhead I watch one woman in a skirt manage to hurdle
the aisle bed several times in the night with perfect composure.)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blacker, a businessman from New York City, notes from
across the aisle that, conversely, it is equally difficult for the
flight crew to serve the inside rows without reaching over the
sleeper. He later says he stayed in the fully upright position for
the whole trip.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Schwam, a businessman from Westbury, N.Y., who has a window
seat, says he slept for most of the flight, but he complains about
the hard headrest, the lack of air-conditioning controls, and the
cloth seats. He says he prefers the leather seats of American's
business class, and knocks the love-seat arrangement. ``I feel like
I'm on one of those old Coney Island rides,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, the beds will probably entice more customers to
fly business class.
</P>
<P>
   Blacker, one seat over, has an epiphany. ``I know what it feels
like,'' he says after his night aloft. ``It feels like a dentist's
chair.'' Others, pointing out the little metal trays and swivel
arms, agree.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I do manage to snooze an hour or two and awake not
feeling the need to visit a chiropractor. At Heathrow, as part of
the renovations that include the business-class sleeper seats,
British Airways has also spent millions expanding the
business-class arrivals lounge, with showers, a workout room and a
free breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, my luggage fails to make it onto the plane in New
York. I'm told it will catch up to me when the Concorde arrives
that evening. (It actually arrives later that morning.) This gives
me time to kill, since the check-in time for most hotels in London
is 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with some of my dormitory comrades in the arrivals
lounge, it appears that the bed service is, overall, a popular
success. But one experienced trans-Atlantic traveler tells me that
he books a London hotel room for the night before, paying a couple
of hundred dollars extra to have a room ready for his early morning
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   I do the math in preparation for the next time I cross the
ocean, spending my own dollars. Budget an extra day, fly economy,
endure the relative discomfort of coach for a few hours, forgo a
bit of pampering in the air, and save a couple of thousand dollars.
Then, pay a few hundred dollars to guarantee a real bed and a few
hours of sleep on arrival, and take myself out for a good meal.
</P>
<P>
   With the money I save I could even buy a nightshirt at Harrod's.
</P>
<P>

EUROPEAN TRAVEL AGENTS FEAR AIRLINE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Taking a cue from the travel industry in the United
States, European airlines and hotel companies have begun setting up
their own Web sites, where customers can shop for flights and
rooms. And as in the United States, the action is angering travel
agents who fear the sites will cut them off from some of the more
tempting offerings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May, 11 European airlines _ led by British Airways, Lufthansa
and Air France _ announced plans for a Web site where consumers can
shop for fares and order tickets. The site has yet to be named, but
it will be managed by the McKinsey Consulting Group. The airlines _
which also include Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, British Midland,
Finnair, Iberia of Spain, KLM of the Netherlands, Aer Lingus and
Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) _ hope to have it operational
by the end of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, three of Europe's largest hotel groups, Hilton
International and the Forte Hotel Group of Britain, and Accor of
France, agreed to set up a similar Web site for hotel
accommodations. The hotel site is also expected to be up by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a similar booking system called T2 was
announced in January by Continental, Delta, Northwest and United
Airlines, to allow consumers to shop for inexpensive air fares on
participating airlines, and one day perhaps, on all others as well.
The site, which has since been joined by at least 23 other
airlines, is due to start up later this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, as in North America, the goals of the airlines and
hotels are twofold: first, to wean some customers from travel
agents, who charge the airlines commissions. But more important,
airline and hotel executives concede, they are trying to seize back
the initiative from the array of Internet companies that offer
inexpensive flights and hotel accommodations on the Web. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the clicks versus the bricks, unless we did
something,'' said David Michels, chief executive of Hilton
International. ``We have a right to sell our own product direct to
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, said, ``All
our research shows that customers want to be able to compare and
buy offers from a wide range of airlines by visiting just one
site.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilton executives say the plan is not aimed against travel
agents and that they will continue to use agents. Instead, they
say, it is aimed at middlemen, often working through Web sites, who
buy up low-fare plane tickets or vacant hotel rooms and pass them
on to the customer, usually pocketing a thin margin. And indeed,
travel agents themselves will be able to use the hotel site, Hilton
says.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, the plans by the airlines and hotels
are also a reaction to a wave of startup online travel agencies.
The Boston Consulting Group, which is managing the airlines' Web
site in the United States, estimates that total online travel
transactions in Europe was about $930 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than 1 percent of the $116.3 billion Europeans
spent on travel, but growth at British-based companies like
ebookers.com and lastminute.com, as well as dozens of other sites
in Europe, has been dramatic. From 1998 to 1999, European online
travel booking, though admittedly starting at very low levels, grew
280 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the travel agents, who are far better organized than the
online companies, have reacted strongly. In the United States, the
American Society of Travel Agents has asked the Justice Department
to decide whether the plans by the American and European airlines
violate antitrust laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organizations of travel agents in several European countries,
including Britain, Spain and Germany, want to take similar action
in Europe. In May, the two largest Spanish organizations
representing travel agencies wrote to the chairman of the Spanish
carrier Iberia, which supports the European airline plan,
threatening to appeal to antitrust regulators, and accusing the
airlines of ``not trying to improve sales or customer service, but
to begin operating themselves as travel agencies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keith Betton, director of corporate affairs at the Association
of British Travel Agents, said travel agent organizations
throughout the 15-nation European Union were considering an appeal
to antitrust regulators. ``Obviously, airlines and others are
perfectly free to set up Web sites, but they mustn't be
anticompetitive,'' he said. ``We would be very upset if there were
offers online which were not available to travel agents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears unlikely that the pressure on the traditional
travel agents will diminish any time soon. Some European airlines,
including Lufthansa and Finnair, already enable customers using
cell phones with limited access to the Internet to check for flight
delays or to change reservations. Within two to three years, they
expect customers to be able to use their phones to book flights and
buy tickets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Moran, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents
Association, recently described the use of the Web for reservations
as just another form of distribution to which travel agents would
have to adapt. To remain competitive, he said, travel agents would
have to stress other kinds of services, like providing advice and
information.

GETTING THERE: A REALITY CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines runs 699 restaurants, and each has dozens of
seats with a really superb view, but in all of them, the food is
lousy. United boasts that it has removed a row of seats to make
coach passengers more comfortable, but its interior decorating is
mediocre at best. Continental shows lots of movies, but the
selection (not to mention the sound and the picture quality) is
much better at the local cineplex.
</P>
<P>
   How good are the airlines? It depends what you grade them on.
Passengers might be forgiven for being confused on this point;
after all, they expect to get more than just transportation. An
airline customer is different from the customers of most other
kinds of companies, being dependent for everything, from a place to
sit to pretzels to eat, even air to breathe. Most airlines do not
distinguish themselves in any of these categories.
</P>
<P>
   But as transportation companies, they have a good product that
is selling well. The industry will record more than 600 million
domestic passenger ``enplanements'' this year, a statistic that
counts a single passenger walking onto a plane, whether that is the
entire trip or one leg. That number has risen sharply in the last
few years, far faster than economic growth or population growth,
and will grow further in years to come, as plane trips become more
common than ship voyages or intercity train rides ever were, and
almost as ordinary as long drives in the car. They move their
customers at hundreds of miles an hour, day and night, winter and
summer, sometimes late but almost always very safely.
</P>
<P>
   And as the system grows, size helps. Collectively, the scheduled
carriers move nearly two million people a day in the United States,
on about 20,000 flights. As the system gets bigger, each flight is
more valuable to the public as a whole, because more people can
connect to it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the perception is that since the federal government
deregulated the industry, in 1978, service has declined. Alfred
Kahn, a professor emeritus of political economy at Cornell
University, who was instrumental in deregulation as the last
chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board before its demise, says he
has heard the argument over and over. It was repeated quite
eloquently, he said, in a letter from a business executive who was
an acquaintance, complaining about ``an unshaven and unwashed
hippie'' sitting next to him on a recent flight. The executive,
Kahn said, preferred the old days, when he sat next to an empty
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said he answered the letter like this: ``Before responding,
I'm waiting to hear from the hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is shifting out there,'' Kahn said in a telephone
interview. Often the first complaint people had in the years
following deregulation, he said, was that the planes were more
crowded, often with people who formerly did not fly. But that, he
said, was ``in a genuine sense, a counterpart of the cheap fares we
wanted people to have.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the decade before deregulation, planes on average
flew just over half full. In the 1990s they broke into the 70
percent range and some are now above 80 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   And that is certain to annoy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline industry is a victim of its own success,'' said
Clifford Winston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who
specializes in airlines and other transportation issues. With more
traffic, he said, ``there is general tension in coach, people
fighting for luggage space, and even if the space is there, you've
got to climb over someone, and somebody's stuff is there, and
you're in the middle row.''
</P>
<P>
   The good and bad news is that fares are down, he said: ``With
lower fares, you find people who couldn't do it before are now on
the plane.'' Those who flew when fares were regulated, and higher,
remember when planes were empty and airlines competed with
amenities like better meals.
</P>
<P>
   Winston, in fact, argues that the level of complaints to the
government about airline service would be declining, but for the
increasing crowding on planes.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons, of course. In fact, the airlines are
the companies everybody loves to hate. They charge prices many
people find reasonable _ unless the traveler has a specific date
and time in mind in the near future. When the airline knows the
customer has little or no scheduling flexibility, it is merciless,
and with sophisticated computer programs, the airlines always seem
to know where demand will appear and they can ration supply, to
achieve high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another airline innovation, frequent flier miles, also bothers
some people. The miles may be the rubles of the American economy _
a currency that is easier to earn than to spend on anything
worthwhile, since free seats are seldom available on popular routes
at popular times _ but the strategy has helped make the airline
industry a success, so other businesses, like hotel and rental car
companies, have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Probably at the top of every traveler's list is safety, a field
in which the airlines excel. The Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that lobbies for help for
mass transportation, calculated recently that the fatality rate per
billion miles traveled by air carriers was 0.2. Car travel was more
than 50 times more dangerous, with 10.5 deaths per billion miles
traveled. That means that if you drive 10 miles to take a 300-mile
flight, your chance of death is higher in the car than on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, air travel is safer than every other mode but one,
public city buses, which recorded deaths of 0.1 per billion miles
traveled. By comparison, Amtrak was 0.5. Walking was somewhere
between 147 to 316.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics give context to occasional catastrophes, like
the Alaska Airlines crash off Los Angeles in January, or reports of
aircraft parts that may not meet the required specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are so safe, that you are arguably safer in the air
than on the ground. In some years, the biggest cause of death on
planes is heart attacks. There are about 60 such deaths a year, but
that number will probably fall as the airlines install
defibrillators on board. For people at risk of heart attacks, that
may make a plane a safer place to sit than their own living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   They are likely to get safer yet, although not through any
public policy. The airlines are heavily regulated, but what drives
them hardest in directions that are good for passengers _ in
everything from flight safety to defibrillators _ is self-interest,
not government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Take the defibrillators, for example. On May 20, President
Clinton used his Saturday radio address to announce that the
Federal Aviation Administration would propose making the
defibrillators mandatory on all planes that carry at least one
flight attendant. But most major airlines already have them on most
of their planes. A defibrillator pays for itself quickly, they have
determined, by reducing the number of times a plane must land for a
medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the safety area, the FAA proposes dozens of times a year to
require inspection or replacement of a part that has been found to
be causing trouble on some airplane somewhere. By the time those
orders reach major airlines, they have generally already begun the
inspections or replacements, and have often completed them, simply
because acting fast reduces the possibility of disrupted
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That does not make them timely, of course. Only about
three-quarters of planes arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled
time, and in bad months, about one flight in 40 is canceled
altogether. There are a variety of reasons, but chief among them is
congestion in the sky. Not much of that can be blamed on the
airlines. Part of the problem is on the federal level; even the FAA
acknowledges that its air traffic control system is antiquated and
inadequate. Part is local; in the last 20 years, only one major new
airport has opened in the United States, Denver International.
</P>
<P>
   David Hinson, a former administrator of the FAA, has been
traveling the country lately arguing that every major airport
should be trying to triple its runway capacity, because it takes so
long to double the capacity, even more will be desperately needed
by the time that work is done.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, in fact, don't like delays any more than
passengers do. Their crews fear gridlock, too. A story among
pilots, with a ring to it that is apocryphal but telling, deals
with an airline nightmare called ``the death spiral.'' A pilot
brings his plane in very late, taxis to the gate and finds it
occupied by another plane. The other plane is ready to push back,
but can't because it is waiting for its crew. And who, asks the
pilot waiting on the apron, is supposed to be on the plane at the
gate? ``Well,'' says the dispatcher, ``you are.''

INDIGESTIBLE FLYING OBJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling makes me hungry. I want comfort food when I'm bored
and lonely, and exhaustion and enforced waiting combine to make me
ravenous; only huge quantities of protein will do the trick.
Anxiety brings a craving for calming carbohydrates. So the one good
thing about sitting in a plane, where I'm almost always bored,
lonely, exhausted and anxious, is that the fierce demands of my
stomach keep me from worrying whether the mechanics remembered to
check the flaps.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have learned, to my relief, that the airlines get me
where I want to go, I have also learned, to my chagrin, that I
cannot count on them to feed me. This holds true even in the
relatively luxurious confines of business class, where we are all
either traveling on someone else's dollar or cashing in on tens of
thousands of miles of past suffering. Here, the galley might
conceivably prepare a piece of beef that is both rare and hot
(you'll never see that in economy), but it still won't be appealing
_ not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   And in coach, where almost everyone travels all the time, people
rarely get sick from eating airplane food, but horror stories
abound: pasta cooked to death, half-frozen salads, indescribable
flavors, unidentifiable vegetables, leathery meat, leathery
chicken, mushy fish, undercooked food, overcooked food (the norm),
even uncooked food (one of my daughters was once served raw rice),
and now overly ambitious ingredients. What gave the airlines the
idea they should start messing around with croissants when they
have yet to serve a decent piece of bread?
</P>
<P>
   But one must eat. And for the hungry traveler, nothing describes
the situation better than the old joke about the hotel in the
Catskills: Not only is the food bad but the portions are also too
small. Every road warrior has had an experience like this one:
Start a meeting at 11 a.m., preferably in an earlier-than-usual
time zone, so you're hungry already. Sprint for a two-hour flight,
with no time to grab anything, and be handed a ``bistro meal'' on
your way onto the plane, or be informed that you will be served ``a
light snack.''
</P>
<P>
   At times like these you'll eat anything. When you're begging for
a second bag of peanuts (the flight attendants will generally take
pity, and even allow three or four), even the thought of smoked
turkey and American cheese on a soggy croissant with yellow mustard
and wilted lettuce (served with a box of raisins the size of a
priority-mail stamp and a brownie so sweet your teeth hurt can make
your mouth water. And the reality of one of those sandwiches is
enough to make you really believe that your heart and stomach long
for nothing more than baked tortellini with cheese sauce or steak
in wine sauce (known in high school as Salisbury steak, and little
changed since then).
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines hire chef consultants. They correctly perceive the
situation as a public relations problem, but incorrectly believe
that by attaching a chef's name to a bad meal it will magically
become a good one. Although chefs can provide ingenious recipes,
they cannot compensate for third-rate ingredients, precooking in
stages, freezing and thawing, microwaving and reheating, and
cafeteria- and battlefieldlike conditions. Substitutions and
shortcuts are fine, but you still cannot make roast chicken without
a chicken and an oven.
</P>
<P>
   The concept should be straightforward: Simple food is best.
After all there is nothing inherently wrong with a sandwich. But
whether airline food is simple or complicated, it's executed
miserably. It simply isn't worth the money for airlines to serve
good food.
</P>
<P>
   It might be argued, and not entirely without logic, that the
airlines believe that Americans don't care about food, that we view
it strictly as fuel _ fill 'er up, who cares about the brand, and
there's always more where that came from. But the
I-can't-believe-they're-serving-this phenomenon is not limited to
domestic airlines or flights; United States-based companies may set
the pace, but the pattern holds true around the world, and some of
the guiltiest airlines are those originating in the countries whose
cuisines are, theoretically at least, superior.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the theory is that we travelers somehow lose our ability
to tell the difference between marginally appealing food with some
flavor and that which could only be considered when the alternative
is crankiness or worse. But even fast food has punch, and recent
years have seen a move away from blandness and toward bigger
flavors, not only in top restaurants but everywhere. No one in his
right mind prefers a soggy whole wheat croissant with off-colored
meat and warm American cheese to, say, a good bag of Doritos and a
can of jalapeno dip, or a few Chicken McNuggets.
</P>
<P>
   And proof that travelers remain conscious of what they eat is as
obvious as the permanent lines at food courts in some of the
busiest and most recently remodeled airports, like those of
Pittsburgh and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the cheap, relatively flavorful, and popular food of
normal daily life is sold by the ton. Happily coexisting, at prices
significantly higher than those two miles down the road, are
McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Pizza Hut and more. These places
are almost always crowded, and the people crowding them are either
(a) about to get on a plane, knowing that this common fare will be
far superior to the food served on board; or (b) just got off a
plane and don't even have the strength to pick up their bags
without fortifying themselves after the enforced starvation of the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   In my nontravel life, I no more eat voluntarily at these places
than I drive to the airport and try to buy flight food. Yet I'm on
those lines at the food courts whenever I have the time, and
whenever I think a Whopper will save me from eating the plane's
cheese tortellini.
</P>
<P>
   Nor am I alone. Increasingly, my fellow travelers board planes
with McDonald's sack in hand, merrily (or at least hungrily) tuck
into their Quarter Pounder while the plane is still at the gate,
and happily work or sleep through the meal service. Others carry
snacks along with their laptops. Some make do with an apple, or
just skip lunch or dinner. And no one I've spoken with feels happy
about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   It's about money. The airlines' food budgets are set, and the
small portions of bad food must be delivered quickly and their
detritus removed just as fast.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that instant meals mean smaller galleys _
which in turn mean more seats _ and in many instances may require
one attendant less.
</P>
<P>
   Yet having established a tradition of feeding us, the airlines
should make an attempt to do it with the same amount of class and
elan with which they do everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, now I get it. Never mind.
</P>

JOINING THE MILLION-MILE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, airline frequent-flier programs have moved
the target for mileage trophy hunters: it's now a million free
miles. One of the latest examples is courtesy of LatinPass, a
frequent-flier consortium representing 10 Latin American airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In January, LatinPass offered a million-mile bonus to anyone
flying at least one international leg on each of nine of its
members: Aces, Aeropostal, Avianca, Copa Airlines, Aviateca, Lacsa,
Nica, Taca and Taca Peru. (Saeta, an Ecuadorean airline that is
also a LatinPass carrier, cannot fly internationally and is not in
the million-mile bonus program.) Participants also have to take
three flights on partner carriers, stay three nights in partner
hotels and rent a car for five days from a partner car-rental
company. All of this must be done by July 1. There are also
intermediate awards of 500,000 and 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Those requirements may seem restrictive, but on March 20,
LatinPass officials shut off enrollment in the bonus plan. Guy
Booth, program director for LatinPass, estimated earlier this month
that more than 50 pass holders would probably qualify for the
million-mile bonus, with a similar number earning 500,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't envisioned as such a popular program, Booth said, but
LatinPass officials apparently failed to grasp the reach of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially promoted it in a newsletter to our frequent
fliers, but our good friend Randy Petersen got hold of it and
posted it on his Web site,'' he said, referring to
www.flyertalk.com, Petersen's chat room for frequent-flier
fanatics. Petersen also publishes InsideFlyer magazine, designed to
help frequent fliers make each mile go as far as possible. ``It did
catch us a little bit by surprise in not knowing these Web sites
existed and that the mileage hunters were out there,'' Booth said.
</P>
<P>
   Word was also spread by the beneficiary of another mileage-bonus
promotion, David Phillips, a civil engineer from Davis, Calif.,
known as Pudding Guy. He earned the nickname (and 1.25 million
miles on four carriers) in a promotion that offered miles in
exchange for buying Healthy Choice foods. Phillips determined that
by buying some $3,400 worth of products, mostly pudding cups, he
could redeem the lids for 1.25 million miles. He says he has
already used part of his bonus to take his family on a trip to
Europe. Amid the news media attention that seems to be another
bonus accompanying such feats nowadays, Phillips said that he had
also qualified for the LatinPass million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how a million miles in the LatinPass program are
redeemed, Booth said, the bonus could wind up costing the program's
operators anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The LatinPass airlines are among the leaders in the region,
although not as large as major European and American carriers. The
carriers joined forces to form LatinPass in 1995 for extra
leverage. ``On their own, it's difficult for them to have a
frequent-flier participation program with a major hotel chain or
credit-card company,'' Booth said.

PLUCKY INMATES MOUNT COOP D'ETAT IN `CHICKEN RUN'

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit'' gang has plenty to crow about with its
first feature-length animated film, ``Chicken Run,'' a clever,
inventive movie that puts poultry on the cinematic map. The Aardman
stop-motion animators have fashioned a film that works on several
levels _ adventure, comedy and a nifty homage to World War II POW
movies like ``The Great Escape'' and ``Stalag 17.'' Here we finally
have a summer family movie that isn't bird-brained, but instead
smart fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' bears more than a passing resemblance to the
``Babe'' movies both in its story _ animals living under the shadow
of the farmer's ax _ and its dark, foreboding visual design. Of
course, Aardman's Oscar-winning work has always worn its sardonic
sensibilities and subtle, off-center British humor as a badge of
honor. ``Chicken Run'' simply takes those tastes and runs with
them, rather like a chicken with its head cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's action is set at the dreary Tweedy's Egg Farm, a
``fowl'' place of shabby, cramped barracks surrounded by fences
with barbed wire. Here, the English inmates _ the veddy proper
chickens _ must lay eggs regularly or face the chopping block. The
proprietor, Mrs. Tweedy (voiced with pinched perfection by Miranda
Richardson), is constantly looking for ways to boost her profits,
while her husband, the henpecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth),
monitors the chickens' activities.
</P>
<P>
   The birds, understandably, aren't very happy, but being
chickens, they're mostly resigned to their lot. Not so Ginger
(Julia Sawalha), an enterprising hen who longs for a better life
not only for herself, but the entire flock. Ginger devises new ways
to bust out of camp; but all her scheming usually goes no farther
than landing her in solitary confinement (a trash dumpster, where
she bounces a rubber ball, a nod to ``The Great Escape'').
</P>
<P>
   Enter Rocky (Mel Gibson), a brash American rooster who somehow
flies into camp one day. This ``lone free ranger'' has escaped from
his employer, a traveling circus. He and Ginger make a deal: She'll
hide him if he'll teach the chickens how to fly. Time is of the
essence, too, since Mrs. Tweedy has just purchased a contraption
that will turn the birds into chicken pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run,'' in its own way, is every bit as marvelous to
look at as Disney's computer-animated ``Dinosaur,'' and it boasts a
much sharper and imaginative story. Directors Nick Park (the man
behind ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit's'' delightful man-and-dog duo) and
Aardman co-founder Peter Lord take stop-motion animation to new
heights, while never forgetting (and having fun with the fact) that
its creations are lumps of clay. This leads to some great visuals
during those scenes when the chickens try to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also ably helped by his vocal cast. Gibson's manic
personality makes him a perfect fit for the cocky rooster, and
Sawalha, best-known for her work on the BBC sensation ``Absolutely
Fabulous,'' gives Ginger a tough-hearted tenderness that is quite
touching. Another ``Ab Fab'' alum, Jane Horrocks, provides
memorable voicing to Babs, a rotund chicken that's continuously
knitting, and Lynn Ferguson comically brings to life the Scottish
chicken Mac, the coop's counterpart to ``Star Trek's'' Scotty.
</P>
<P>
   That these are but a few of the film's noteworthy characters
illustrates just how well Park and Lord have brought their birds to
life and made them distinctive creatures. The movie, like the
chickens themselves, seems at times to be a prisoner of its static
setting. But when the filmmakers break free, like during an
inspired scene that has Rocky and Ginger going on a roller coaster
ride through Mrs. Tweedy's pie-making machine, their efforts more
than match the sophisticated whimsy of the ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit''
shorts. This is a wonderful film. &QL;

<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: The next time you plan to fly to San Francisco,
consider Oakland Airport _ for two reasons. First, San Francisco
Airport is chronically congested, and prone to heavy fog. If it's
doubtful a flight from Southern California will be able to land on
schedule, the pilot is routinely required to cool his jets on the
ground here before being permitted to take off. Oakland, much
farther inland, is rarely subjected to fog. Second, United Airlines
has a stranglehold on San Francisco and seems to price its flights
accordingly. You can often get a much better fare from Southwest
into Oakland. The drive across the Bay Bridge to the city center
usually takes about 20 minutes. If you drive from the L.A. area,
San Francisco is about 355 miles via Interstates 5 and 580, 440
miles via Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDIO PARTICULARS: The easiest approach is probably from
Lombard Street (Highway 101) just south of the Golden Gate Bridge.
In the Marina district, Highway 101 veers sharply right from
Lombard onto Richardson Avenue on its approach to the bridge. To
enter the Presidio, continue on Lombard _ which actually requires
you to get into a left-turn lane to avoid Richardson and the stream
toward the bridge. Once in the park, follow the signs to the Main
Post, where the visitor center is housed. It is open from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. daily (closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day).
The Presidio is the rare national park that requires no fee to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Hotels in the low $100s are rare in San Francisco, but
you'll find one such option at the no-frills Marina Motel, at 2576
Lombard St. _ just two blocks from the Lombard Gate entrance to the
Presidio. Many rooms open onto an inner courtyard, which blunts the
din of traffic on Lombard. Rooms are almost claustrophobically
small, but who spends any time in a hotel room in San Francisco?
The grounds are lovingly tended, with flower pots and planter boxes
overflowing with geraniums, roses and bougainvillea. Murals are
painted on a couple of the courtyard walls. And this might be the
property's strongest asset: Parking is free and plentiful _ in
garages, no less. Don't judge this place by its exterior. The neon
sign, left over from the 1950s (``Drive In,'' it implores) was
retained for kitsch. Look for it while driving westbound on
Lombard. If you get to Linoleum Larry's, you've gone too far.
Information and reservations: (415) 921-9406 or (800) 346-6118.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: There are some outstanding trattorias in this area,
where seating is confined to a handful of tables and service is so
attentive you feel as if you've dropped in at somebody's house.
Curbside Too, serving country French, is probably the best. Try the
warm goat-cheese salad ($7). Entrees (most in $20s and $30s) are
served with a startling variety of vegetables. The wine prices are
so low, you at first wonder if they are misprints (only $28 for a
1997 Chateau de Bellevue Burgundy Morgan, for example). The chef,
wearing his apron over jeans, twice stopped by our table to make
certain everything was satisfactory. The restaurant is at 2769
Lombard St.; phone (415) 921-4442. Other options: Bistro Aix, 3340
Steiner St., phone (415) 202-0100; and Ristorante Bonta, 2223 Union
St. (in the Pacific Heights district), phone (415) 929-0407.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Presidio Visitor Center can be reached at (415)
561-4323. Web: www.nps.govrsf. At Fort Point, efforts are made to
conduct two tours daily, but that hinges on the availability of
volunteers to lead them. It's best to call the morning of the day
you intend to visit: (415) 556-1693. For general tourist
information on San Francisco, call (415) 391-2000. Web:

An oasis by the Bay &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Once a fortified military base, San Francisco's Presidio is now at
the center of a battle over its future &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Story by Eric Noland/Travel Editor &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The city presses up against its borders like a
fungus. Walk along Lake, Filbert or Jackson streets and you observe
San Francisco in its quintessence: residences and buildings jammed
together, stacked on top of one another, oozing over every vacant
square foot, conferring priceless value on an unobstructed view of
water or a sliver of parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Cross the boundary, however _ over Lyon Street or West Pacific
Avenue _ and it's as if you've stepped into a different world, a
world in which time literally seems to have stood still.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Presidio, which was a military post for 218 years
and has been a national park for the past six. As San Francisco
real estate boomed over the past century, this 1,480-acre parcel at
the northern tip of the city operated in a federal vacuum,
blissfully oblivious to the burgeoning growth that besieged its
edges. And visitors today are the richer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Here is open space lushly overgrown, winding roads and trails
that follow spectacular coastal bluffs, gullies choked with
forests, and charming buildings that date to the Civil War, with
discreet expanses of undeveloped land around them. This is what
makes the Presidio so unique: It is a sprawling urban oasis on the
edge of the most densely settled city in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It came into being in 1994 as part of the wave of military-base
closures that followed the conclusion of the Cold War. It had been
prime defensive turf since 1776, when Juan Bautista de Anza III
stood on a bluff overlooking the mouth of San Francisco Bay and
determined that this would be the ideal site for an adobe fort to
guard one of New Spain's most important harbors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing years, it would be home to Union Army garrisons
during the Civil War, a biplane airfield in the early 1900s, a
defense-intelligence training ground for Japanese-American soldiers
during World War II ... and home to more varieties of menacing
cannons than you can count.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of this, the post has long been a fairly open
environment. San Franciscans could wander in for a walk or a picnic
or a romantic moment, knowing that they might encounter nothing
more disconcerting than an armed patrol tramping by. In the few
years since the National Park Service replaced the Sixth Army as
the Presidio's steward, visitors to the city have begun to discover
it _ and embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the park is very much in a state of flux. While the
Presidio was a pretty peaceful place during its military days (even
during the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846, U.S. Commodore Robert F.
Stockton referred to his ``quiet and undisturbed possession of the
defenseless port''), it is now a battleground involving the park
service, the Presidio Trust, and San Francisco's active
environmental and no-change-now-that-I'm-here groups.
</P>
<P>
   Congress decreed four years ago that the Presidio would have to
be a self-sufficient enterprise by 2013, and the Presidio Trust was
commissioned with the task of generating the park's $35 million
annual operating budget. That is to be done by leasing former
military buildings for commercial and residential uses. A plan to
let filmmaker George Lucas raze a fabulously ugly hospital to build
a movie production center has drawn particular fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the remainder of the park is a hive of activity.
Renovations are planned for some of the Presidio's 510 historic
buildings, many of which are great to look at but are barely
habitable. A new visitor center and museum is due to open next
month. And Crissy Field, an area of bay frontage that was used for
landfill in the less environmentally sensitive time of 1915, is
being restored to its original state as a tidal marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Even as these projects proceed _ and the various factions
wrestle over whether the existing buildings are destined to become
a bustling business park _ the Presidio remains a delightful place
to visit. There are remote paths that afford stunning views of the
Golden Gate Bridge and the craggy coastline below the bluffs. There
are narrow, squiggly lanes ideal for bicycle riding and other forms
of exertion. There are fascinating buildings that provide a kind of
architectural timeline of the post. There is rich history of
military vigilance at the entrance to the bay, even though,
thankfully, it was never tested.
</P>
<P>
   Any visit to the Presidio should begin with a stop at the
visitor center, which occupies a corner of the centrally located
Main Post (near the corner of Montgomery Street and Lincoln
Boulevard, just west of the Lombard Gate entrance to the park).
This stop is essential for one reason only: to acquire a map.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike San Francisco itself, which is laid out in a reassuring
grid of streets, the Presidio's roads date to horse-and-buggy days,
and they twist and turn along the natural contours of the land.
Thus, plunking down $2.71 for the Official Map &AMP; Guide to the
Presidio of San Francisco, published by the Golden Gate National
Parks Association, is sure to spare you a good deal of aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   During my visit in May, a tourist pulled her car to a sudden
halt within a few feet of me and, in obvious exasperation, asked
for directions to ``the road back to the city.'' She had been
driving in circles _ less than half a mile from one of the exits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to explore the Presidio's hidden delights
is to take a walk on some portion of the Coastal Trail, which
meanders 1.5 miles from near the southern promontory of San
Francisco Bay to the broad expanse of Baker Beach along the Pacific
Ocean. (The map is helpful here, too, because the path isn't
particularly well-marked.)
</P>
<P>
   Over its course, the trail passes beneath the Golden Gate
Bridge, picks its way along coastal bluffs and skirts seven
different gun-battery sites from different eras, including some
earthen-work defenses that date to 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Take your camera. The trail affords some stunning views of the
Golden Gate Bridge, sometimes through breaks in the verdant forest.
For one of the best views of the bridge, locate the concrete shell
that is Battery Boutelle (it's on the map), climb its staircase and
iron ladder, and venture out to the edge of the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Early one weekday morning, the trail was all but deserted. The
hum of inbound commuters approaching the bridge toll booth on
Highway 101 competed with the deep, plaintive blasts of foghorns.
The morning fog was so thick that it collected on tree boughs and
dripped like rain. Wildflowers along the trail were shoulder-high
in some stretches. The air was rich with the scent of cypress
needles. Waves assaulted the rocks far below. And the city felt
far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular walk is the Ecology Trail, which describes a
two-mile loop at the center of the Presidio grounds, beginning and
ending at the Main Post. Along this route, you'll get a sense of
the Army's prodigious tree-planting efforts in the final few years
of the 19th century. The Army stuck 100,000 trees in the ground
over an 11-year period, mostly eucalyptus, Monterey cypress and
Monterey pine. Today, the park service and the trust lament the
fact that the soldiers didn't choose trees native to California,
but why quibble? The forests are nonetheless lush and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   At many points along the path, flowers grow in thick patches,
brightening the landscape with clusters of nasturtium and San
Francisco lessingia.
</P>
<P>
   Near its conclusion, the walk follows a ramrod-straight stretch
lined with street lamps. This is Lovers' Lane, so named because in
the 1860s it was the primary route for soldiers headed for town.
</P>
<P>
   On its final leg toward the Main Post, the walk crosses an 1885
footbridge over El Polin Creek. Alas, this quaint, 115-year-old
structure has been despoiled with spray-paint graffiti _ one of the
unfortunate byproducts of increased public access to a former
military reservation. It makes you wish the area was still
patrolled by sticklers for order with fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Post itself is laid out in precise, military fashion, a
tidy rectangle configured around a former parade ground. Typical _
although the beauty of San Francisco Bay lies about a quarter-mile
away _ not one building has a bay-view aspect.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of historic architecture on this post, and some
of the most intriguing buildings are right here, along Funston
Avenue. They are former officers' quarters, dating to 1862, built
in Queen Anne/Stick style. Stroll among these structures and you
might feel as if you're in a small town in Pennsylvania,
contemplating the latest act of President Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio grounds feature some hidden quirks _ including a
cemetery where the pets of some post residents were buried _ as
well as several locales that have been well-trodden by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Beach stretches along the Pacific coast in the southwest
corner of the park. Once again, the views of the Golden Gate Bridge
to the north are terrific, especially if you're lucky enough to
find it partly shrouded in fog. However, parents with young
children and those of modest sensibilities should be forewarned:
Baker Beach appears to be exceedingly popular with San Francisco's
aging, overweight male nudists.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, Fort Point is a favorite. Docents dress up in
Civil War uniforms and conduct free, hour-long tours of the
prison-like fortress that stands in the shadow of the Golden Gate
Bridge's southern footings. Our guide, Chris Burgin, was
exceptionally knowledgeable, holding interest even as most of us
shivered in the drafty, depressing edifice of granite, brick and
concrete that was commissioned in 1850 to protect the newest state
in the union.
</P>
<P>
   On a walk through the former powder magazine, we were told that
soldiers commonly put their socks on over the shoes before
entering, because a shoe nail striking a floorboard nail could
generate a disastrous spark.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the sun was shining on the Golden Gate Promenade, a
broad, three-mile path that hugs the edge of the bay from Fort
Point nearly to Fisherman's Wharf. It seemed a welcomed antidote to
the bowels of the fort, but it passes alongside the massive
construction project that is the Crissy Field restoration, so it
figures to have considerably more appeal when the work is completed
next spring. Even so, it was crawling with walkers, joggers,
cyclists and skaters.
</P>
<P>
   In its six years as a national park, the Presidio has proven to
be quite a curiosity, and its positioning on the edge of a major
city has undoubtedly contributed to a crush of visitation. Some 14
million people wander through here annually, according to park
spokesman Roger Scott. Thus, it ranks behind only Great Smoky
Mountains National Park (in North Carolina and Tennessee) in
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of Central Park,'' said Scott, who came
to the Presidio from the nation's only other urban national park,
New York's Gateway. ``With the environmental concern that
Californians have, and certainly the awareness that San Franciscans
have, they want to hold on to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifics of the Presidio's future use might be uncertain as it
strives for self-sufficiency, but there is probably little cause to
fret that its unique ambience will be significantly altered. There
are precious few urban treasures such as this.
</P>
<P>
   Sentries have been posted to make sure it remains so. &QL;

THE SIMPLE CHARM OF CHESTNUT STREET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of NYTimes news service)

By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The appeal of San Francisco lies in the fact
that its many parts produce such a delightful sum. More than a
city, it is confederation of neighborhoods, each with a distinct
sense and soul.
</P>
<P>
   One such region is Chestnut Street, a five-block stretch of
simplicity, charm and funk in the Marina district, tucked neatly
between the Presidio and Fisherman's Wharf. Chances are, you've
passed very near to it without being aware of its existence. It
lies parallel to Lombard Street, which serves northbound Highway
101 traffic on what for many is a hell-bent dash toward the Golden
Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, slow down, turn off and explore a tiny San Francisco
neighborhood that is as comfortable as an old bedroom slipper. No
tourist promenade this. It is a working street, with an independent
grocery store, two ancient movie theaters, several Chinese-run
laundries and dry cleaners, even a shoe-repair shop that appears to
be stubbornly resisting the digital revolution (its shelves are
stacked with old cardboard boxes holding laces, heels, soles).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there are small eateries and coffee houses _ most
with sidewalk tables _ that have no affiliation with any national
chains.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll along Chestnut between Divisadero and Fillmore,
you might notice that the crowd seems primarily composed of
neighborhood residents, and there is almost a European feel to the
place. Planter boxes brim with flowers on the sidewalk and
second-story window ledges. An elegantly dressed lady was seen
guiding two yappy dogs on leashes into the Pottery Barn (OK, there
are a few chain outlets), and nobody so much as blinked. In a
convenience store early one morning, not only was the TV off, but
the shop was filled with the gentle strains of Mozart's Piano
Concerto No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great place to browse through shops or catch a bite to
eat. Or both. A few of the highlights (Chestnut Street addresses in
parentheses):
</P>
<P>
   Earthsake (2076) is a narrow, deep, airy shop with an impressive
selection of untreated fabrics in linens, clothing and bedding
items. It also stocks an eclectic supply of greeting cards, candles
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of enormous, impersonal Staples and Office Depot
outlets, it's encouraging to find an independent stationery store,
Kimmel's (2144), with about 10 feet of street frontage _ but,
somehow, carrying just about everything you'd require.
</P>
<P>
   The Marina Super grocery store (2323) displays its produce in
bins on the sidewalk. It also has a butcher shop. And when was the
last time you encountered a market that promised free delivery?
</P>
<P>
   Mathray's Flowers (2395) also makes maximal use of the sidewalk,
exhibiting many of its colorful and pleasantly scented wares there.
</P>
<P>
   Books Inc. (2251) is part of a small Bay Area chain of a
half-dozen stores. The rear quarter of this store is devoted
entirely to children's books, its walls colorfully painted in
cartoon characters. The shop also carries a selection of
international newspapers and features a great number of books on
cooking, gardening and travel.
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder how Frank's Shoe Service (2412) can subsist
entirely on replacing worn heels or securing loose luggage straps,
but a sign in the window offers a clue: The proprietor bills
himself as an expert on Birkenstock sandals. In this corner of the
Bay Area, that probably means he'll be able to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut Street also features several inviting cafes, delis and
coffee houses. Don't be surprised, however, if cash is the only
form of payment accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove (2250), a popular locals hangout, is a friendly place
to stop for morning coffee or breakfast _ and it will keep you out
of a cookie-cutter Starbucks down the street. The Grove offers six
different gourmet coffee drinks daily. Be advised that the
breakfast menu leans heavily toward vegetarian items.
</P>
<P>
   For heartier fare at breakfast or lunch, it's hard to beat
Judy's Cafe (2268). The portions are substantial and diverse,
including a breakfast scramble featuring smoked salmon, Bermuda
onions and cream cheese. Andale Taqueria (2150) can also attack a
robust appetite with its mesquite-grill Mexican items.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for sandwiches for a picnic on the grounds of
the Presidio, the best option is probably Lucca Delicatessen
(2120), an Old World deli that is worth a stop just for the rich
smells within. &QL;

&HT;     FOR BUSY SOCCER MOMS, FORD DEVELOPS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a vehicle for the Martha Stewart in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans have been known as mom-mobiles for some time now, but a
new version of the Ford Windstar seems to be taking that theme to
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Maytag have joined forces to create the Windstar
Solutions minivan concept, complete with a built-in clothes washer
and dryer, as well as a microwave oven, trash compactor,
refrigerator and vacuum cleaner. Ford says the concept evolved from
research the company commissioned in its efforts to market cars to
women.
</P>
<P>
   But, gee, this seems to be taking the mom-mobile to extremes.
Did I say that already?
</P>
<P>
   Built into the back end, where the tailgate lifts up, is the
nifty little combination washer/dryer, which Ford says can wash and
dry a soiled soccer uniform or party dress in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So now, after mom picks up the kids at the end of the soccer
match, she can go ahead and launder their soiled uniforms while
feeding them dinner in the minivan. The refrigerator can hold a
variety of cold foods, such as luncheon meat and juice boxes, and
the accompanying microwave can heat up soup, hot chocolate or
popcorn. That, alone, might be worth the money _ popping your own
corn at a sporting event instead of buying the expensive stuff from
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   And if you go grocery shopping, there is no need to rush home
with the cold stuff, Ford says. You can continue running errands
after storing the cold stuff in the refrigerator. Besides the
fridge in the rear cargo area, called a ``food drawer,'' there is a
second refrigerated compartment in the rear passenger area, as well
as cup holders designed to keep drinks either cold or hot.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at the beach, or a picnic by a group of toddlers in
the back seat, mom (or even dad or one of the bigger kids) can
vacuum up the sand or dropped food by using the built-in Hoover
wet-dry vacuum cleaner. (Hoover is a subsidiary of Maytag).
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ there is more.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan is equipped with a voice-activated ``home
connection'' device that allows mom or dad to turn on the oven and
other appliances back at home by remote control. You would have to
buy Maytag appliances that are capable of being operated by remote
control, and this technology is still under development. But it's a
technology that will be commercially available soon. Imagine having
your entire house networked with a computer in your minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to and observing the consumer led to the development
of the Windstar Solutions concept vehicle,'' said Jim Schroer,
Ford's vice president for global marketing. ``It is Ford Motor
Co.'s goal to be responsive to our consumers by creating solutions
which improve their quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no word yet as to whether a vehicle with all of these
options will ever find its way to market. If it does, it could be
of help to some moms _ or dads _ who have to spend an inordinate
amount of time in their vehicles, shuttling kids to event after
event all over town.
</P>
<P>
   But a possible backlash could occur: the vehicle just might
steer an even larger number of mothers from minivans to sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Booming SUV sales have been fueled in part by women who have
chosen to trade their minivans for vehicles that aren't quite as
domestic.

<P>
   Here, from a Ford news release, is a complete list of the
special Suzy Homemaker features in the Windstar Solutions minivan,
which is being displayed at various home shows across the nation:
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerator: Maytag's ClimateZone technology food drawer is
featured in the cargo compartment. Consumers will be able to set
the proper temperature for certain foods, especially meat, fruit
and vegetables. There is also a refrigerated compartment in the
rear passenger area. These built-in units provide convenient
storage of perishable items purchased at the grocery store,
allowing for customers to continue their errands without stopping
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Microwave: Placed in the left rear, it's perfect to heat up a
baby bottle, hot chocolate, tea, soup and even popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler: Located behind the driver and front passenger seats, the
cooler stores easily accessible items such as bottled water, sodas
and juice boxes. It is also removable for use at a park or a
football game.
</P>
<P>
   Hot/cold cup holders: Located between the passenger and driver,
these cup holders keep milk cold and coffee hot.
</P>
<P>
   Trash compactor: Windstar Solutions has a trash compactor
located between the front seats and a trash bin in the vehicle
cargo area. The mechanical compactor can crush everything from
apple cores to aluminum cans. Both trash units have a washable
liner, which can be removed for easy cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Wet/dry utility vacuum: The Hoover wet/dry utility vacuum is
placed in the side panel adjacent to the second-row passenger
seating. It can pick up cracker crumbs, beach sand and spilled
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Washer/dryer: Spills on clothing are common, especially with
children in the vehicle. A miniature Maytag combination
washer/dryer is built into the rear cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   Tray tables: Tray tables fold down from the seat backs of the
front captain's chairs, providing children and adults a great place
to eat a snack, complete a crossword puzzle, read or do homework.
</P>
<P>
   Home Connection: Home Connection, a conceptual idea, adds a
unique twist to Ford Motor Co.'s Telematics system. Telematics
brings voice activation and automatic emergency notification into
the Lincoln LS and Jaguar brands. The Home Connection concept could
enable consumers to remain connected to their homes. Customers in
the future could preheat the oven, check home food inventories, and
monitor home security and fire systems while driving, using
voice-activation technology. With the vehicle parked, consumers
could use a touch screen to operate the system.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment package: Family members and friends can experience
hours of entertainment. Individuals can choose between viewing
movies or playing CD-ROM interactive electronic games. Game
controllers and CD storage are built into the rear passenger area.

&HT;     POLITICAL PARTIES HOPING TO LURE VOTERS TO LOG ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   If an Internet service provider furnishes a door to the World
Wide Web, the doorkeeper also has the opportunity to influence the
opinions of those who travel through it.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the national committees for the Democratic
and Republican parties are trying to attract Web surfers to
Internet portals that launch computer users onto the Web through a
kind of partisan filter _ Web pages tailored to deliver party
messages wrapped around the usual links to news, sports and chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats unveiled www.freeDEM.com June 8, party
officials stressed that their Internet access and e-mail services
would be free to anyone, regardless of party affiliation
(advertising on the site pays for the service). The Democrats
crowed that freeDEM would help bridge the so-called ``digital
divide'' between those who can afford to get on line and those who
can't.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's primary goal is to reach out to uncommitted
voters, to expose people to the Democratic message who might not
otherwise seek it.
</P>
<P>
   Log on to freeDEM, and the message at the top of its red, white
and blue page is, ``brought to you by the Democratic National
Committee.'' Links to the Democratic National Committee, the Gore
presidential campaign and other Democratic sites are featured
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of the site is nonpolitical _ the links to
general interest news, shopping, weather, sports and finance that
the average computer user demands.
</P>
<P>
   The comparable Republican site looks similar, but users of
www.GOPnet.com pay a monthly fee for its Internet access service.
GOP officials say the GOPnet site is designed to serve as an
on-line community for the party faithful, not as a recruitment
tool.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, GOPnet is more overtly partisan, its content chosen
to spotlight Republican issues. The GOP site features commentaries
by Republican congressional leaders and even takes jabs at the
opposition through links like ``Gore Gaffes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some theorize the advent of such sites could be a powerful tool
in connecting voters to candidates, like television did in the
1960s. But the trick is generating interest in politics when
Internet browsers have so many other trails they can follow.
</P>
<P>
   Users of both sites can ``customize'' certain selections to
reflect their personal interests, but a certain percentage of
political ``spin'' will be delivered or offered as links to every
user. And users of both sites get the same promise: no political
mail and no solicitations for funds, unless the user requests it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the Republicans and us is they're not
trying to get as many people on line as possible, they're trying to
raise as much money as possible,'' said Democratic National
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is not trying to ``wire'' everyone in the United States,
countered RNC deputy chief of staff Larry Purpuro, because the
private sector is doing a pretty good job of it. And a majority of
Republicans are already on line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched GOPnet in Silicon Valley in January,'' said
Purpuro. ``The Democrats are only seven or eight months behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew countered that the Web sites should not be judged as
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want to make it look like a horse race _ who's got
the best site, who was there first,'' Andrew said. ``What's
important is: Are you reaching the audience you want?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Reform Party officials are also investigating the use of a
similar political portal to reach their audience but won't make a
decision until after their national convention in Long Beach,
Calif., in August, a party spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies providing the Internet connections to subscribers
at freeDEM and GOPnet are what's known as ``affinity'' providers,
who design portals aimed at specific slices of the Internet
population. Instead of building a subscriber list from the ground
up (the competition is already pretty fierce), affinity providers
approach existing organizations and associations and build portals
designed to appeal to their members.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBelong, the Internet service provider for freeDEM,
also provides similar portals for the AFL-CIO and National
Federation of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first presidential election in the Internet age,''
said Bob Viney, who supervises the freeDEM page for iBelong. ``As
Joe Andrew said: Think back to the '60s when Kennedy first used
television. We're really at the same kind of transformation of the
election process. It will forever be different ...because of the
power of the Internet to connect voters and candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be difficult for either freeDEM or GOPnet to make
major inroads in molding public opinion because of the vast number
of choices people have in a diverse communications marketplace,
said Tom Patterson, professor at Harvard University's JFK School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has been conducting surveys on Internet use and
election politics during the current campaign cycle. He finds that
while large numbers of Americans are on line, few are using the Web
to keep abreast of politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone survey of 1,000 adults conducted May 3-7, 75
percent who described themselves as Republicans said they had
Internet access either at home or at work. Sixty-four percent of
independents reported having access, compared with 57 percent of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But only 9 percent of Republicans said they had acquired
information about the presidential campaign from the Internet in
the 24 hours preceding the May survey. Seven percent of Democrats
said they'd used the Web to research the presidential campaign, as
did 4 percent of Independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's underestimated about the Internet is if you're not
interested in public affairs and politics ... you may take a quick
glance (at a site) but you don't stay,'' Patterson said. ``And I
think that's the real challenge that faces people on the Internet.
Not providing access, but building interest.''

 &HT;     SATURN, eBAY OFFER CAR INSPECTION DEAL  
 &HT;     (ATTN: Ind., Texas, Tenn.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to get an honest detailed inspection of your used car to
share with potential buyers, just in case you want to sell it
yourself through the newspaper want ads or through an on-line
auction site such as eBay?
</P>
<P>
   Saturn, that little General Motors car company that has built
its reputation on honest dealing, plans to offer such inspections
through its nationwide dealer network.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saturn worked out the program with eBay, people who
want to have the inspections made don't have to advertise their
vehicles on eBay to avail themselves of the service.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Saturn said, the program gives eBay a way of
increasing sales on its used-car site by giving potential buyers
more information about the vehicles for sale, information backed by
the Saturn name.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an ulterior motive for Saturn: the company's
dealers will have face-to-face contact with a whole new cadre of
potential customers, people who are planning to sell their cars and
might be in the market for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages to sellers and buyers of used cars could be
extended to any sales venue. The biggest question in any potential
used-car purchase is the condition of the vehicle, and for years
consumer publications have urged buyers to pay for an independent
inspection of any used car before plopping down good money for it.
</P>
<P>
   For about $100, a Saturn dealer would do a 135-point inspection
of a seller's vehicle, regardless of make or model. The inspection
report can be linked with the vehicle's auction information on
eBay, if the seller wants. If so, Saturn will do it for them. If
not, the report goes to the seller, who can burn or bury it, or
pass it along to a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn dealerships in Houston, Indianapolis and Nashville,
Tenn., will be the first to offer the service, starting later this
summer, and Saturn plans to expand the program to all of its 433
dealers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection reports won't include any guarantee or promise of
a vehicle's future reliability, Saturn officials said. It merely
will list any problems found.
</P>
<P>
   EBay is among several Internet companies vying for a significant
share of the $360 billion U.S. used-car market, which is far less
regulated than the new-car industry. It's a big market, too: 40
million used vehicles traded hands last year, while 16.9 million
new vehicles were sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many independent repair facilities and some auto
dealerships already perform so-called pre-buy inspections on
virtually any car, so if you're buying or selling a car before the
Saturn program kicks in here, you still have other places to get
the vehicle checked out.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of having a Saturn dealer perform the inspection
is the knowledge such an inspection will be conducted under an
honest and reliable program backed by a major manufacturer.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may be the closest thing yet to a
computer engaging in intelligent thought to answer a user's
question, a new technology will help Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. customers
collect investment data on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One step beyond search sites such as Ask Jeeves, which take a
user's question and respond with a list of Web sites that may
provide an answer, the technology, developed by iPhrase
Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., allows users to type in a
question and receive a tailored answer based on the system's
interpretation of the phrasing and a search of relevant databases.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob Sofman, a senior vice president of Schwab's electronic
brokerage, tried the system out, he typed: ``Compare the P-to-E
ratios for the top five chip manufacturers and biotech firms.'' The
answer, in seconds, was a table created by the program comparing
both fields, ranked in order of largest ratio to least.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it had done was create a dynamic table in response to my
inquiry,'' Sofman said. ``It was remarkable, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   The same question typed into askjeeves.com offered results
varying from U.S. Census statistics and information on business, to
Britannica.com's entry on biotechnology, places to learn about the
math topic ``ratio and proportion,'' as well as this unlikely
result: ``Where can I buy snacks from an on-line store?''
</P>
<P>
   The service will be free to schwab.com users when it becomes
available in the fall. Sofman said Schwab had interviewed 20 to 25
companies before settling on iPhrase, home to several former
scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Terms of
the contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   IPhrase, which also has an office in San Mateo, has attracted
$11 million from venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital,
Greylock Management and Charles River Ventures. The company says
its goal is to provide more acutely tailored search engine
capabilities, rather than the throwing-darts results that sometimes
prevail on the Internet.

<P>
   LONDON _ How can an apparently honorable man take part in an
unspeakable evil and then find a way to live with himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is the central question of ``Albert Speer,'' a new play in
London that pursues its unsettling answers through a 3 1/2-hour
examination of the confessions and equivocations of Nazi leader
Adolph Hitler's pet architect and armaments minister.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trevor Nunn, the play is based on the successful
1995 biography by Gitta Sereny, ``Albert Speer: His Battle with
Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereny, an Austrian-born Briton, wrote the 720-page book nearly
20 years after a three-week interview she had with Speer, who died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high position in the Nazi regime and his
willingness to write about his experiences, Speer long has been an
important figure in the effort to understand the inner workings of
the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confessional and analytical nature of his books,
he has been widely regarded as ``the good Nazi.'' He maintained to
his death that he was unaware of the Holocaust until after the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, this assertion has come under attack in recent years by
Sereny and other writers who doubt that Speer could have been so
comfortably ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is embraced by playwright David Edgar, best
known to Americans for his adaptation of Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar explores the Speer story in two acts. The first represents
Speer's version, a portrayal that is faithful to his books,
``Inside the Third Reich'' and ``Spandau Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene opens with Speer's reporting to Spandau prison in
Berlin to begin the 20-year sentence handed down during the
Nuremberg trials. In the background of the scene are Nazi war
</P>
<P>
   criminals dangling by their necks _ a fate escaped by Speer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intelligent rendering of Speer by Alex Jennings, the
first act is stolen by Roger Allam's mesmerizing Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Allam plays the Fuehrer as an intensely charming prophet with a
grand vision of a strong, pure Germany that will need _ and here's
where the young architect Speer comes in _ a spectacular new
capital on the magnitude of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler comes across as an engaging, good listener with Old World
manners and a gift for flattery. He casts a Faustian spell over the
ambitious young Speer and elevates him to be the second most
powerful man in the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Speer tries to explain how Hitler's charismatic
appeal worked on intelligent, stable Germans _ such as Speer:
``Eighty million people didn't follow him because he was evil but
</P>
<P>
   because they thought he was extremely good!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sereny describes an emotional even ``erotic''
relationship between the two men. Hitler saw the handsome young
Speer as the Aryan of his warped dreams. To Speer, Hitler was the
father-figure he never had. In the play, Speer's own father regards
his son's role in the Reich with icy contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme unfolds as a dark love story that only begins to
unravel in the horror of the last years of the war when Hitler's
loathsome insanity becomes obvious even to Speer.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation comes during one of the play's most
memorable moments. Hitler _ now clearly disjointed and drained _
sits slumped against Speer's white model of the majestic dome that
he designed as centerpiece of the imperial Reich capital that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler rages at the cowards and inferiors who failed him in his
quest to rid the world of the ``Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.''
Speer, at last recognizing Hitler for what he was, bravely resists
the Fuehrer's final demand that he destroy Germany to deprive the
weaklings left behind with any means to recover from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 closes with a chilling 1943 speech made by Heinrich
Himmler, the Nazi SS leader who directed the program of mass
killing. Himmler reveals the full horror of the ``Final Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which shows Speer after his release, shifts from
Speer's account of what happened and begins to chip away at his
story.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the play, Speer is portrayed not as sinner
seeking redemption but as a man seeking comfort in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one character as a ``rent-a-penitent,'' Speer makes
the university and bookstore circuit dogged always by questions
about his role in the Reich. The questions in time overcome his
comfortable and practiced responses.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he is forced to confront himself and the ghost of
Hitler in dreams that allow him no escape from his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he confesses that he must have known _ even though
he could never bring himself to acknowledge what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed, and turned away from what I sensed,'' Speer says
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Speer'' is scheduled to run through July 8. For
tickets, call 011-44-207-452-3000

 &HT;    TURNING 18, BRITAIN'S PRINCE WILLIAM BEGINS NEW RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE MEDIA
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's hunk and future king Wednesday(6/21) is
expected to begin his long and maddening battle against a likely
lifelong nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The press.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday, it is Prince William's fate to turn 18. Now that
he is officially an adult _ and blessed (or is it burdened?) with
the title ``His Royal Highness'' _ the contest can commence in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of shame over the circumstances of the death of
his mother, Princess Diana, and maybe even out of respect for his
youth, the British press has been amazingly mannerly in its
</P>
<P>
   coverage of the prince during his years of schooling at Eton.
</P>
<P>
   But this polite arrangement _ an unnatural state for the
generally frantic British celebrity press _ is likely to come to an
abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even as William studies for his final exams, the rules
seem to be changing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the News of the World, Britain's biggest-selling
tabloid newspaper, ran photos of William next to a story about his
apparent choice of university _ St. Andrews in Scotland _ which it
described as ``St. Randy's'' because of the college's reputation as
a party school.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sunday Mirror tabloid reported that a friend of
William's at Eton had been expelled after being caught with drugs
during his exams.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more restrained Guardian wasn't above it all. Last
week, the respectable broadsheet carried a spread on the prince's
``ladies in waiting,'' a list of 10 women considered fitting dating
</P>
<P>
   material. The list included Sarah Gore, Vice President Al Gore's
21-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the mounting pre-birthday frenzy, a number of newspapers have
been taking the pulse of the public on the William issue. They have
tried to determine where the people stand on the prince's
</P>
<P>
   choice of university and career.
</P>
<P>
   William will need something to do, as he has a few decades to
kill waiting for his father to relinquish the crown _ which, for
the record, still is worn by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that there still will be a throne for William in 30
or 40 years, a poll in the Daily Telegraph found that only 11
percent of the British people want to dump the monarchy in favor of
a republic.
</P>
<P>
   While the public may want to keep the monarchy, polls show
they're not particularly nuts about their current monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles for one, has never found his way into British
hearts, probably because of his longtime romance with decidedly
unpopular Camilla Parker Bowles. The beloved Princess Di blamed the
widely known affair for the demise of her marriage to the prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Express dared ask readers if William shouldn't go
ahead and become king instead of Charles _ the readers were split
on that one.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed popular support for allowing William to
have as normal a life as possible before assuming his royal duties.
He'll apparently have plenty of time because his father has decided
that he won't have any royal duties, like opening hospital or
sponsoring charities.
</P>
<P>
   No public celebration of William's birthday is planned, but a
fancy private family affair is scheduled for Windsor Palace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to William's milestone, the party will mark the
100th birthday of Queen Mother Elizabeth (on Aug. 4), 50th birthday
of Princess Anne (on Aug. 15), 40th birthday of Prince Andrew (in
February) and 70th birthday of Princess Margaret (on Aug. 21).
</P>
<P>
   The press will not be allowed in the palace, but a flashing,
shouting mob is expected to press against the gates. William is not
expected to attend the party, officially to study for exams. (But
it has been widely speculated that he is having a royal tiff with
his father over not being allowed to have his birthday party at a
London nightclub.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for William, he has all the wrong attributes for a
hermit.
</P>
<P>
   He has his mother's grace and good looks molded into a 6-foot-2
man's frame. He is athletic, as demonstrated by new officially
approved photos of him playing water polo and soccer. He is said to
be personable, even it he didn't show it in an officially approved
interview in which he refused to be pinned down on, well, anything.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, he seems determined to have his
privacy _ making him all the more tantalizing to the paparazzi and
royal writers.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview _ actually a series of insipid written
responses to insipid written questions _William made it clear that
he intended to be anything but an open book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep my private life private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He seemed particularly snippy when it came to questions about
his love life, even though he was proclaimed the most eligible
bachelor in Britain while still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   He and has family have demonstrated considerable displeasure
with press reports of his exchange of e-mails with American pop
star Britney Spears and the suggesting that there was more than
electronic pulses between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of nonsense put about by PR companies,'' he
responded. ``I don't like being exploited in this way, but as I get
older it's increasingly hard to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, who has had his own scraps with the press over
the decades, has complained bitterly when even innocuous reports
about his son surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the build-up to William's birthday, Charles last week
expressed his sense that a gloomy future awaits his heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrutiny and interference is just beyond description and I
personally don't envy him at all,'' Charles told reporters.

percent of the British people want to dump the monarchy in favor of
a republic.
</P>
<P>
   While the public may want to keep the monarchy, polls show
they're not particularly nuts about their current monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles for one, has never found his way into British
hearts, probably because of his longtime romance with decidedly
unpopular Camilla Parker Bowles. The beloved Princess Di blamed the
widely known affair for the demise of her marriage to the prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Express dared ask readers if William shouldn't go
ahead and become king instead of Charles _ the readers were split
on that one.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also showed popular support for allowing William to
have as normal a life as possible before assuming his royal duties.
He'll apparently have plenty of time because his father has decided
that he won't have any royal duties, like opening hospital or
sponsoring charities.
</P>
<P>
   No public celebration of William's birthday is planned, but a
fancy private family affair is scheduled for Windsor Palace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to William's milestone, the party will mark the
100th birthday of Queen Mother Elizabeth (on Aug. 4), 50th birthday
of Princess Anne (on Aug. 15), 40th birthday of Prince Andrew (in
February) and 70th birthday of Princess Margaret (on Aug. 21).
</P>
<P>
   The press will not be allowed in the palace, but a flashing,
shouting mob is expected to press against the gates. William is not
expected to attend the party, officially to study for exams. (But
it has been widely speculated that he is having a royal tiff with
his father over not being allowed to have his birthday party at a
London nightclub.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for William, he has all the wrong attributes for a
hermit.
</P>
<P>
   He has his mother's grace and good looks molded into a 6-foot-2
man's frame. He is athletic, as demonstrated by new officially
approved photos of him playing water polo and soccer. He is said to
be personable, even it he didn't show it in an officially approved
interview in which he refused to be pinned down on, well, anything.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, he seems determined to have his
privacy _ making him all the more tantalizing to the paparazzi and
royal writers.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview _ actually a series of insipid written
responses to insipid written questions _William made it clear that
he intended to be anything but an open book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep my private life private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He seemed particularly snippy when it came to questions about
his love life, even though he was proclaimed the most eligible
bachelor in Britain while still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   He and has family have demonstrated considerable displeasure
with press reports of his exchange of e-mails with American pop
star Britney Spears and the suggesting that there was more than
electronic pulses between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of nonsense put about by PR companies,'' he
responded. ``I don't like being exploited in this way, but as I get
older it's increasingly hard to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, who has had his own scraps with the press over
the decades, has complained bitterly when even innocuous reports
about his son surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the build-up to William's birthday, Charles last week
expressed his sense that a gloomy future awaits his heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrutiny and interference is just beyond description and I
personally don't envy him at all,'' Charles told reporters.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Life in the Oklahoma Oil Patch,
1938.
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Dortha Dunkel
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   They were just crepe paper flowers on a tin can base.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy cut the cans, and mama made the flowers to sell for extra
money. Times were hard in the Oklahoma oil patch in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy was working part time for Magnolia Oil Co. (ole Aunt
Maggie, as he called the company) in Oilton, Okla. The hope was he
could get on full time, but prospects weren't bright. The oil field
there was almost depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Our big weekly outing was driving to Tulsa with mama to hear Bob
Wills and His Texas Playboys in their studio at KVOO radio. Of
course, we took along flowers to sell.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday, I became fascinated by a large baby doll in a
store window.
</P>
<P>
   When mama told me to come on and get in the car, that we needed
to start home, I lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Then mama took three bunches of flowers from the back seat and
went into the store.
</P>
<P>
   We hadn't sold any flowers that day. I was hoping she would find
some buyers in the store and stay awhile, and I could feast my eyes
on the doll.
</P>
<P>
   A sales lady came and took the doll from the window. I thought
how great it would be for the little girl who got it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the impossible happened. Mama came out of the store with
the doll. She had traded her flowers for it.
</P>
<P>
   My head swam as she handed me the doll, and I held it tightly
all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   When we got home, daddy had good news. There was full-time work
with Magnolia Oil in Salem, Ill., and we were going there to see if
he could get a job.
</P>
<P>
   What a great day! A new doll! Maybe a new job!
</P>
<P>
   In the days to follow, I hugged my doll through the selling of
our house and furniture. I held it to ease the pain of things
familiar which would be gone. I held it close as my voice echoed in
rooms empty of furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Even mama's pride and joy, her mahogany dining room suit and
eight chairs, were sold. Through it all, that was the only time
mama cried.
</P>
<P>
   Our few worldly goods were reduced to a large Oxydol box of
linens and dishes which was placed in the back seat of our black
1936 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   With tears in my eyes, I looked out the car's back window as we
drove off.
</P>
<P>
   Silently I said goodbye to the four-room unpainted oilfield
house and the sheet metal barn behind it. That's where the kids of
the neighborhood put on amateur shows, sang and danced and used
mama's good clothes, unknown to her, for costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Everything grew smaller, then disappeared. The past was gone,
but the future looked bright.
</P>
<P>
   I turned, hugged my doll and began to vie for my share of the
back seat with the Oxydol box and my sister.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if there was always snow on the ground in Illinois.

LIFTING THE VEIL ON MALPRACTICE IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Like the cardiologist who has a heart attack or the
radiologist who discovers a tumor, Hideaki Nakajima, an orthopedic
surgeon, felt a pain in his hip one day.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the beginning of Nakajima's transformation _ from
doctor to patient and, finally, to outspoken critic of Japan's
medical system.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Nakajima had been a typical doctor, examining a
parade of patients each day, his practice at a university hospital
a textbook example of what the Japanese call ``three-minute
medicine,'' which refers to the average length of time a patient
spends with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Nakajima had no time to explain his procedures or his diagnoses
to patients, but that didn't matter. In Japan, patients usually
aren't even told what's wrong with them. The medical system is
paternalistic, with doctors as the all-knowing fathers, leaving the
patient with few rights _ no access to medical records, little
chance for second opinions. Drugs are often dispensed in little
white boxes so patients don't know what they're taking. They're not
even likely to be told if they have a terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that patients don't need to know, and that it's
not good to give them all the facts. It will just confuse them and
won't make sense,'' said Rihito Kimura, a leading bioethicist at
Waseda University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   That is beginning to change. Recently, small patients advocacy
groups have sprung up and are questioning the system. They want a
patient's bill of rights, similar to one drawn up by US hospitals
in the early 1970s that gave patients a right to ``informed
consent'' before they are subjected to medical procedures or
treatments, a privilege that still doesn't exist in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese are even doing something normally frowned upon in
this nonlitigious society. They are suing.
</P>
<P>
   When Nakajima became a patient, his world view turned upside
down. ``When I was working, everything seemed fine,'' he said.
``Only now can I see that doctors don't really take care of
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   His metamorphosis began when a fellow orthopedist operated on
Nakajima's hip to remove loose cartilage. Afterward, Nakajima
thought something didn't feel quite right. He questioned the
doctor. Everything was fine, he was assured.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nakajima broke his hip, was hospitalized three times, and
had to take a year's leave of absence from work. He began to
suspect the break was caused by something that had gone wrong in
the surgery. He increasingly pressed his surgeon, and the hospital
where they both worked for information, but got nothing except
growing hostility.
</P>
<P>
   He finally discovered, he said, that the doctor had made a
blunder during surgery by pulling his hip joint out of place. But
it wasn't the mistake that outraged Nakajima. It was the cover-up
by his fellow doctors, and their unwillingness to explain his own
condition to him. No one, all the way up to the head of the
department where Nakajima worked, would admit that anything had
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I confronted the doctor, he still just tried to hide
it. He wouldn't tell me the truth,'' Nakajima said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese public is growing worried about medical mistakes.
In recent months, newspapers have carried almost daily accounts of
hospitals and doctors being forced to come forward and admit
blunders: Lung surgery performed on a man with a heart ailment; a
woman implanted with someone else's fertilized egg; a nurse who
inadvertently put disinfectant in an intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that such mistakes are more likely in Japan because
of the veil of secrecy that protects hospitals from regular public
scrutiny. But many analysts think the apparent rash of deadly
blunders is not so abnormal; it's just that hospitals are being
forced to admit them by increasingly vigilant patients, the media,
and other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it would have been possible to hide these
things, because colleagues would automatically agree to secrecy,
whereas now they don't,'' said Ian Neary, a British academic who
has extensively studied the Japanese medical system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Japan is not the only country struggling with ways to
make the medical system more publicly accountable. A landmark study
last December by the National Institutes of Health estimated that
doctors' mistakes kill 44,000 to 98,000 Americans every year, more
than from auto accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   No similar figures are available for medical errors in Japan,
but one thing is certain: Japanese patients are far less likely to
sue over these mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the estimated half-million medical malpractice
lawsuits pending in the United States, the numbers in Japan are
miniscule, but they are growing. Today, there about 3,000 cases
pending, double a decade ago. Analysts estimate there is also an
increasing number of out-of-court settlements, but figures are hard
to come by, in part because the doctors' powerful lobbying group,
the Japan Medical Association, refuses to publicly release
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits and patient anger are increasingly directed, not at the
medical blunders themselves, but at the lack of information. Kana
Okaniwa's father was given an experimental medicine by his doctor,
and died eight weeks later. She contends the medicine killed him,
and that he was not informed of the potential side effects by the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor never even told him what the medicine was for,''
Okaniwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, she filed a lawsuit, which is much more difficult
in Japan than in the United States. There are only a few dozen
lawyers who pursue malpractice suits, and just five in the entire
country who handle them full time.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a doctor to testify on the plaintiff's behalf is equally
difficult. Okinawa wound up flying to Philadelphia to find an
American doctor who would offer medical testimony for her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical profession is much more closed than in the US,''
said Kimura, who also has taught at Georgetown University for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1960s, the US medical establishment operated in a
similar fashion. Doctors routinely kept information and records
from patients, sometimes subjecting them to experimental treatments
without their knowledge. Many also were reluctant to tell a patient
of a terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Though less common than before, it still remains the norm in
Japan for doctors not to tell patients they are dying or, in
particular, have cancer. Medical observers say cancer patients are
given the treatments they need, like chemotherapy or radiation, but
are told that their tumors are benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors don't tell patients about their diseases when they
judge that the patient might get depressed, or if it wouldn't help
matters. They do it to protect the patient,'' said Akira Koizumi,
vice president of the doctors' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding such information, however, also makes it impossible
for Japanese cancer patients to take an active role in their
treatment, as American cancer patients commonly do, researching
their disease and asking questions about the best options.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the image of the paternalistic, beneficent doctor
derives from strong Confucian values imported from China. In Japan,
the doctor, who is always addressed by the honorific ``sensei,''
which means teacher, has long been viewed as a wise and
intellectual person.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in Japan, Kimura said, the lack of communication between
doctor and patient is in keeping with the cultural dislike for
direct speech. It's considered much more respectful to talk about
something uncomfortable, such as an illness, either indirectly, or
not at all.
</P>
<P>
   There are small signs that the system is starting to change. The
Ministry of Health and Welfare is adding to the national medical
exam a section on bioethics and patient rights. That, in turn, will
force medical schools to start teaching the subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the doctors' lobbying group, which has close ties to the
government, is trying to preserve the status quo. Last year, the
group managed to squash plans to give patients access to their
medical records. Japanese patients have little reason to complain,
the group has long argued, because they are fortunate enough,
thanks to Japan's national health-care system, to have access to
cheap health care.
</P>
<P>
   In general, in fact, the Japanese are among the healthiest
people in the world, with a life expectancy of 74.5 years, 4 1/4
years longer than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Orthopedic surgeon Nakajima has found out just how powerful the
medical establishment can be, and how unwilling it is to tolerate
dissent within its own ranks. His persistent questioning of his
treatment was unwelcome, he said. When he tried to return to work
at his hospital after his yearlong medical leave, he was forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's filed a malpractice suit, and has been ostracized by
the medical community, leaving him little hope of finding a job at
any hospital. Instead, he spends his time advising other patients
on their legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand as a warning to other doctors,'' Nakajima said, ``to
say if you stand out or stand up, you will be treated like this.''

COMMUNISM GAINS ACCEPTANCE IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
 -BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Motoki Sobue couldn't hide it anymore. The subterfuge
was killing him. So the university student got drunk, telephoned
his parents, and shouted out his secret: ``I am a communist!''
</P>
<P>
   Terrified of what might happen next, he slammed down the
receiver. But Sobue was shocked by his family's reaction. They
weren't angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I went home and explained everything, and now they vote
communist, too. Even my grandmother,'' said Sobue, now 25.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan these days, being a communist is nothing to be ashamed
of. Communism may be out of favor with most of the world as it
rushes feverishly to embrace free-market capitalism, but the
78-year-old Japanese Communist Party is gaining popularity in the
world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The party is attracting an increasing number of disaffected
Japanese _ young voters like Sobue, as well as older ones who are
tired of politics as usual. The Communist Party's populist
preaching about workers' rights and social welfare is finding an
audience in a country suffering from an economic rut that has
destroyed financial security for many.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuo Shii, a party leader and a second-generation communist, is
credited with orchestrating the party's renaissance. Shii, 45,
though unprepossessing of appearance with his fleshy face and big
glasses, is something of an anomaly among Japanese politicians:
He's articulate, even charismatic. He pops up regularly on
television, on everything from political round tables to variety
shows. He plays the piano, he likes the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, he has dropped hard-line communist dogma. Some
say he doesn't sound much like a communist. ``In our view,
communism and socialism are inseparable from democracy,'' he said
in a recent interview at the party's four-story headquarters, which
will soon be replaced by an 11-story tower.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an ill-fitting gray pinstripe suit, his black hair
slicked down, Shii said the violent overthrow of capitalism does
not quite make the party's agenda. Instead he voiced concern about
overtime pay for workers, with controlling the country's spiraling
debt, and with balancing out Japan's ``subservient'' relationship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Communists may be more in favor of a market economy
than the ruling party, which is trying to increase state
intervention and state power, said Shigenori Okazaki, a political
analyst with Warburg Dillon Reed. ``It sounds rather ironic, but
the Communists do see some of the things that the market mechanism
can improve for workers,'' Okazaki said.
</P>
<P>
   The party's goal at the moment, Shii said, is to reform
capitalism. ``We envision a socialist society in the future, but we
are not calling for it just now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His earliest time frame is about 100 years from now, and even
then, it will be more like an evolution than a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``Just say no'' might well be the Communist
Party's motto. As the second-largest opposition party in Japan, it
has set itself up as perhaps the loudest opponent of the status
quo. No matter the issue, it provides vocal opposition to almost
anything the ruling party proposes.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to strike a chord with Japanese, even those who don't
support the Communists. ``We need a strong opposition, someone who
will challenge things,'' said Mieko Yamashita, 58, a retired civil
servant.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Japanese, though, she doesn't want them to get too
strong. ``They make Japanese politics vivid, but I don't think they
should ever lead the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Japanese Communist Party holds 14 percent of the
seats in the Diet. Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who dissolved
Parliament Friday, has called for elections on June 25, and many
analysts expect the Communist Party to do better, but not well
enough to significantly change its position.
</P>
<P>
   Many are still suspicious of the Communist Party, especially in
the business community. They voice worry about the party's growing
appeal with frustrated voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in the Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's
leading newspapers, Toyota's chairman, Hiroshi Okuda, was quoted as
saying, ``If they change their name, we had better watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been widespread speculation that the party intends to
do exactly that, as analysts agree that it would indeed boost the
party's standing. Party officials say they have received many
letters from voters suggesting a name change, but Shii insists that
the Japanese Communist Party will remain just that. ``We have the
history and ideals of our party in this name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The party was founded in 1922, and was illegal through World War
II. It was one of the sole voices in Japan to speak up against the
war, and that legacy earned the party a measure of respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Communists have long steered independent of their
counterparts in the Soviet Union and China. When the Soviet Union
collapsed, the party issued a statement welcoming the implosion.
The Russian model wasn't communism, Shii insists, because it didn't
have freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Under Shii, the party has been particularly effective at winning
local elections. Almost 4,500 Communist Party members serve as
local assembly members. And they can be effective at helping
citizens organize. ``If you want to stop a nuclear power plant or
something, they help stop it. Nobody else will,'' said Steven R.
Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The party newspaper, Akahata, has gone from a propaganda sheet
to a paper perceived as real. It uncovers scandals and pays
attention to stories the normally timid mainstream media does not.
The Sunday edition has almost 2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   This new face of Japanese Communism is managing to attract
younger members in particular. Makoto Abe, 25, got involved with
the party several years ago, after it was revealed that
HIV-infected blood was knowingly being distributed. ``The
government and companies were making light of people's lives to
make profits,'' said Abe, who wore a bright orange Denver Broncos
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks too many people misunderstand communism. Today,
working with the party's youth wing, he has come up with his own
definition: ``to think of the suffering of the people and find a
solution.''

IN ISRAEL, JEWS STRUGGLE TO SAVE YIDDISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ If Yiddish is a dying language, perhaps it is best
not to tell Rivka Basman-Ben-Haim, a poet who believes she can only
express herself in Yiddish, the language she spoke as a child in
her hometown in Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, after the Holocaust, the town she knew is no more,
and Basman-Ben-Haim herself is 75 years old, but she has no doubt
that Yiddish is alive and well. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see more of an interest among young people in Yiddish, but
of course, the life here is in Hebrew, and we Yiddish writers are
like an island, a small island in the Hebrew sea, trying to save
the treasures of Yiddish,'' said Basman-Ben-Haim.
</P>
<P>
   Oy vey, as a Yiddish speaker might say. In Israel, home to
nearly 6 million Jews, Yiddish daily newspapers are no more, the
Yiddish radio hour runs for 25 minutes, and the new chairman of the
World Council for Yiddish Culture does not speak Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   The once-prestigious Yiddish Writers and Journalists Club in Tel
Aviv has more plaques memorializing the dead than members still
living. High schools prefer to offer French over Yiddish. And the
youngest Yiddish writer of renown is 52 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good writers, good poets, good books being published,
but the question is for whom are we writing?'' said poet Moshe
Sacher, 72, sipping red wine at one of the weekly gatherings of the
Yiddish writers club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to buy our writings and when they are in the
bookstores, it seems the books are always put in the anthropology
section under `dead cultures,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that rankles those who love and live the
language, whose usage has declined throughout the world after
Hitler's extermination of 6 million Jews and the assimilation of
Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants into American life.
</P>
<P>
   But pain over the declining use of Yiddish _ some say its death
_ may be even sharper in Israel, the state that was formed to
protect and nurture Jews and their culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish experts complain that the language was ignored _ if not
actively suppressed _ by the founders of the Jewish state and the
Zionist movements that helped shape the new society.
</P>
<P>
   One Zionist language association would stop Yiddish speakers on
the street and give them cards that asked them to speak Hebrew
instead. A more radical youth group burned down a kiosk in Tel Aviv
that sold Yiddish publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Israel was founded, there was an anti-Yiddish campaign
because they felt they couldn't give Yiddish equal rights, that it
might become the language of the land,'' said Gershon Winer, 76, a
former chairman of the Yiddish department at Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now after 40 to 50 years, Hebrew is so rooted that there is no
danger to Hebrew, but there is the danger that after Hitler and
Stalin, Yiddish will be eradicated,'' said Winer.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, maintained that
Jews needed to shake off the mentality and lifestyle of the shtetl,
or Eastern European village, and remake themselves into an
independent people with their own homeland and own language.
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish, a Germanic-based language that evolved between the
ninth and 12th centuries, represented the old way of life in
Eastern Europe, while Hebrew, revived by Zionists and picked to be
the national language of Israel, represented the new.
</P>
<P>
   But because the common language of many of the new immigrants
was Yiddish, its use had to be dissuaded to ensure that Hebrew took
root. There was also a practical matter. Hundreds of thousands of
immigrants coming from Arabic-speaking countries did not know
Yiddish, and it was essential that a common language be created for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Israel did have an active Yiddish cultural life
through the late 1970s. The hundreds of thousands of people who
arrived from Europe after the Holocaust learned Hebrew, but they
maintained Yiddish, publishing daily newspapers and magazines, and
creating Yiddish theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the Soviet Union began to allow some Jews to
leave, Yiddish life here got another boost because it was still the
mother tongue of many of these new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But similar to the United States, where the children of the
Yiddish-speaking immigrants often learned very little Yiddish, the
children of immigrants to Israel were encouraged by schools and
youth groups to learn Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli attitude doesn't make sense,'' said Mendy Cahan,
36, a Yiddish speaker from Belgium who established the Yung Yidish
cultural association in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say that the Bible is the soul of the Jewish people,
then Yiddish is the representation of Jewish civilization,'' he
said. ``It represents 1,000 years of culture, of history, 1,000
years of looking for a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yiddish, which gave the world such words as schlemiel (the guy
who always spills the soup), shlemazel (the man on whom the soup
always falls) and shmatte (the old dress used to wipe up the soup),
was once spoken by 11 million Jews, nearly three-quarters of world
Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Most prevalent in Eastern Europe, it was also the common
language of Jews in such far-flung places as Buenos Aires, New York
and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yiddish represented a great culture. There wasn't a writer in
the world who was not translated into Yiddish, from Shakespeare to
Walt Whitman,'' said Lev Berinski, 61, a poet and director of the
Tel Aviv-based Leivik House, a cultural center named after Yiddish
poet H. Leivik.
</P>
<P>
   There are still pockets of Yiddish spoken _ among some Russian
Jews, elderly Eastern European Jews and within certain
ultra-Orthodox communities _ but for many people, Yiddish is more
about nostalgia than about speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take more than money to make Yiddish culture bloom
again, because there's the biological truth that most Yiddish
speakers are old and nothing can change this,'' said Berinski.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yiddish mavens argue that while the use of the language may
wither, Yiddish will never die, and the important thing is to
search for new ways to encourage interest.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by nostalgia, a summer Yiddish language program in
Lithuania is doing well, as are the Yiddish cabarets, readings and
language classes sponsored by Cahan's Yung Yidish.
</P>
<P>
   ``A language can be alive in many ways and while it may not be
alive like it was in Warsaw, it is still alive,'' said Cahan.

MILLENNIUM, HARD LUCK JOIN ALONG THE THAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Do you suppose it's time they just stopped using the
word ``millennium'' around here?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything the British attach the word to ends in
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   First it was the Millennium Wheel, the biggest observation wheel
in the world, which was supposed to be the premier place to watch
the fireworks over the River Thames on New Year's Eve, but which
didn't pass safety tests and so couldn't start carrying passengers
until a couple months after the event.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Millennium Dome, the $1 billion exhibition
hall a little farther downstream that opened on New Year's and has
become Britain's biggest white elephant. The dome's promoters
breathlessly predicted 12 million visitors would help defray the
construction costs by paying about $35 a head to get in before it
closes Dec. 31. But most visitors and critics have panned it. The
promoters have cut their attendance predictions in half, and many
think even that is overly optimistic. The government, meanwhile,
has to keep sinking cash into what has become Money-Pit-on-Thames.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just three days after it opened, the $28 million
Millennium Bridge that spans the Thames had to be shut down
indefinitely because it was swaying too much. The 1,050-foot
pedestrian bridge, which spans the river between the famous dome of
St. Paul's Cathedral and the new Tate Modern Art Gallery, linked
London's past and present, both figuratively and literally. But
last week it became just the latest victim of the Millennium Curse.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the river's cursed, or maybe the river god Thames, whose
statue adorns a park in Richmond, simply doesn't like all this
construction, which is intended to make the river a more central
part of one of the world's greatest cities. After all, the river
had not had an expanse built across it in London since Tower Bridge
opened in 1894.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, as the Conservative opposition bleats on about, this
is all about Tony Blair's Cool Britannia being nothing but smoke
and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as the outpouring of vitriol prompted by these
disasters along the Thames provides testimony to, a new Battle of
Britain being waged, one pitting the hip reformers led by Blair
against the traditionalists of the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Tories had the idea for the Millennium Dome,
Blair's Labor Party government made sure the thing got built.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the dome is boring and not worth anything near its
price tag, not to mention the infusions of cash it needs so it
won't go belly up.
</P>
<P>
   For all the pessimism, not all is hopeless. After months of
problems in literally getting off the ground, the Millennium Wheel
has spun without trouble since its belated opening. It dominates
the central London skyline and is well on its way to becoming the
institution that its sponsors, British Airways, hope it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The song ``Millennium,'' by Britain's top-selling pop singer,
Robbie Williams, was actually very good and continues to get
airplay.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, meanwhile, enjoy the swaying Millennium Bridge and
are disappointed by the pledges of engineers to fix it by tinkering
with its design.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Emery, who lives in Devon in the southwest of England, came
up to London to walk across the new bridge. While some have
complained of feeling seasick, Emery thought it was one of the best
attractions in the city.
</P>
<P>
   After England's collapse in the European championships last
Monday against Portugal, losing 3-2 after being up 2-0, perhaps
it's time to start calling the national soccer squad the Millennium
Team.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe if this country is as ambitious as Blair claims, some
of the money that's being thrown down the pit known as the
Millennium Dome could be used to persuade soccer star Ronaldo and a
few other Brazilians to move here and apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be that much of a stretch, apparently. Ronaldo,
Brazilian friends insist, is mad about flat beer and rain. If
that's true, he'd love it here.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jessi-Ann Rosenbaum hurt her pinky finger three
years ago and hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a fall on the ice and everything is taken away
from you,'' said Rosenbaum, 41. ``I want my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, who lives in Monticello, N.Y., had no idea that a
sprained pinky would end up disabling her to the point where she
can no longer work, or even clean house. But then, she had never
heard about reflex sympathetic dystrophy, or RSD, until a doctor
diagnosed her with the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something as minor as a sprained ankle can set it off,'' said
Dr. Eugene Lucier, a pain management specialist at the Albany
Medical Center. ``We don't know why it happens. Men and women get
it, old people get it, young people get it. It can happen to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What occurs is somewhat of a neurological mystery. The syndrome
is thought to be the result of damage to the sympathetic nervous
system, that part of the nervous system responsible for much of the
body's routine work _ from relaying messages necessary to keep
organs functioning to controlling the diameter of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Institutes of Health, these damaged
nerves ``send inappropriate signals to the brain, interfering with
normal information about sensations, temperature and blood flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucier likens the problem to putting the nervous system into
``overdrive.'' The result can be devastating. Even a slight breeze
on the skin can trigger intense pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't want to even put shoes on because it hurts
too much,'' Lucier said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how many people suffer from RSD, also known as
complex regional pain syndrome, but the estimates are as high as 7
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guaranteed way to diagnose the condition. ``There's
no definitive standard that rules you in and rules you out,'' said
James Broatch, director of the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy
Syndrome Association of America in New Jersey
(http://www.rsds.org). ``One day you can have all the telltale
symptoms and the next day nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The one standard used by many physicians is ``pain way out of
proportion to the injury,'' Lucier said. There are also some other
signs, including color changes in the skin of the affected area,
swelling and excessive sweating.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosenbaum's case, the RSD spread from her finger into her
other limbs, and has become a chronic condition.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases of RSD have been known to go into remission but the
key is catching the condition early and starting treatment, ideally
within three months of the first symptoms. But in 50 percent of RSD
cases, pain persists longer than six months and sometimes for
years. When that happens, the bones, joints and muscles around the
affected area can become stiff and start to break down, making any
movement difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In treating her RSD, Rosenbaum has tried a variety of drugs,
including a morphine pump. Some of the drugs most often used
include corticosteroids, vasodilators and injections of local
anesthetics, such as lidocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually pull out the entire arsenal when you try to treat
someone,'' Lucier said. ``It's very hard to treat and very
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest frustration for victims of RSD is getting others to
understand their condition. Rosenbaum acknowledges that if she
didn't have firsthand experience with RSD, she would be a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be honest, if this happened to someone my age, I'd turn
around and say, `Get a life,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after suffering from RSD for three years, and with no end
to her pain in sight, Rosenbaum wonders about her future. She and
her 11-year-old daughter live on disability in a rent-subsidized
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   To help pass the time, she has started an on-line support group
at http://www.angelfire.com/me2/rsdpainpals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wash three dishes today and three dishes tomorrow, that's
a good day,'' Rosenbaum said. ``I just want a normal day.''

UNIFIED MESSAGING PROMISES FREEDOM BY WIRELESS PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With the arrival of summer, thousands of people will be
``working from home'' _ read, ``Down the Cape at the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many white-collar workers, leaving the office can mean
big headaches keeping up with two or three voice mailboxes (work,
home, and wireless), multiple e-mail accounts, and the faxes and
snail mail piling up on the office desk.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are signs of relief, and the promise of less worry and
more efficiency _ and if you don't mind an electronic tether to the
office, a version of the relative freedom summer brought before the
technology explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest emerging telecommunications services aimed at
helping the mobile white-collar worker is called ``unified
messaging,'' or ways to get access to all of your communication
through one device.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the technology is still very much in its
infancy. But more than a half-dozen companies are developing
products and systems that allow you to consolidate all of your
voice mail and e-mail in one system you can reach from a wireless
or landline phone or a computer desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Some early users of the systems rave about them. ``I have fallen
in love,'' said Ted Tye, a partner at National Development in
Newton, Mass., which manages more than 7 million square feet of
office space in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Tye began using a system developed by a Seattle
company that lets him get all his messages in a computer desktop or
from his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has made my life so much easier,'' said Tye, who is
frequently on the road overseeing projects while trying to shuffle
40 or more incoming e-mails a day plus dozens of voice-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   At work, Tye can get all his voice mail and e-mail in one
desktop computer, playing the voice mail out of his computer
speakers and storing them in files like e-mail. On the road, Tye
can call in and hear e-mails read by a speech synthesizer, and
dictate answers _ sent back to recipients as ``wave files'' they
open and play on their computer _ hours sooner than he would be
able to if he had to get back to his office or home computer to
write to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a couple of days of getting used to,'' Tye said, but
people who get spoken e-mails from him in his voice ``will write me
back messages like, `How do you do this? Where did you get this
voodoo magic?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tye's Active Voice system is typical of several that allow users
to log on to a computer screen and see all messages listed, with
little symbols next to them showing whether it's an e-mail, a
digitally converted voice mail, or a fax that can be viewed on the
screen or retransmitted to another machine nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Related services let you ring your office calls to several other
numbers simultaneously _ the phone in your seaside cottage, or a
wireless phone _ and call in to hear a synthesized robotic voice
read you the contents of your e-mail and dictate responses.
</P>
<P>
   Hard figures on how many people now actually use some version of
unified messaging, and realistic estimates of how many might in the
future, are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a very dynamic and interesting area,'' said
Dana Gardner, Internet infrastructure research director with The
Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``Unified messaging is likely to ramp up
the way e-mail did.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH-TV in Boston, for example, is in the process of installing
a Lucent Technologies system for its 1,200 employees _ some of whom
may be on the road making documentaries in Mongolia or Bimini _ to
be able to check voice mail, e-mail and faxes with one phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Some data suggest a huge market potential. The Gartner Group has
predicted that by 2002, up to 40 percent of voice mails could be
delivered through unified messaging systems. The total global
market for companies that provide those systems could reach $5.5
billion by 2003, according to IDC in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   IDC estimates the number of US business e-mailboxes will grow
13.5 percent a year to 166 million by 2003, while daily e-mail
traffic will soar from 5.3 billion messages last year to 14.9
billion by the end of 2002. By 2003, 47 million US workers are
expected to be mobile, IDC predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those numbers with projections of several hundred
million wireless data users globally within three to five years,
and there seems to be a big potential market of people who want
access to their voice mails and e-mails from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The etiquette issues of some of these new services _ in
particular spoken responses to e-mails _ could take a little
getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   While Tye has found most recipients of his dicated responses to
e-mail are impressed, analysts note some people might find such a
response somehow arrogant, or a technological headache to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically for when you're stuck in a taxi or something,
so it's great that you even got back to them before you got on the
plane,'' said Rami Safadi, president of UltiVerse Technologies in
Waltham, Mass., a start-up selling services allowing people to use
their wireless phones to get access to Microsoft Exchange e-mail,
calendars, and contact lists.
</P>
<P>
   But given that people have gotten used to getting an e-mail
response to a voice mail, Safadi expects people in time will find
it no big deal to click and hear a spoken response to an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In a related vein, some people wonder how much time people
really want to spend hearing a synthetic, sometimes choppy voice
reading them their e-mail, unless it is a situation where they are
stuck in traffic with no other way of checking their office mail
than the cell phone. An e-mail that can take five seconds to scan
and discard can easily take a minute to hear read aloud before a
listener determines it is useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people lose patience with text-to-speech
technology and, don't forget, you're paying for air time the whole
time'' you have some piece of spam read to you, said analyst Amanda
McCarthy of Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the local action involves companies developing products
for Bell Atlantic or other phone carriers to resell to customers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, iBasis, a Burlington, Mass. company known mainly
for carrying international phone calls over the Internet, has also
developed a Cisco Systems-powered unified messaging service for
telephone companies to resell to customers, at a wholesale price of
$3 to $8 per voice/fax/e-mail mailbox per month.
</P>
<P>
   Also developing systems aimed at phone companies to resell to
homeowners and businesses are Unisphere Solutions in Chelmsford,
Mass., IPeria in Burlington, and hardware maker Comverse Network
Services in Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, a Belgium-based giant in text-to-speech
systems whose main US offices are in Burlington, provides the key
software that powers the iBasis system as well as the free service
offered by Shoutmail.com of Chestnut Hill to hear e-mail read aloud
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more distinctive offerings comes from CanBox USA of
Woburn, Mass., a subsidiary of a German telecom company. Since last
June, CanBox has sold a service that includes all the digital types
of unified messaging as well as a way to have regular mail sent to
your computer: You get a CanBox postal box where clerks scan in
your incoming mail and send it to you as a picture in an e-mail
that you can print out.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, CanBox will take a letter you have prepared to
mail to hundreds or thousands of people around the world and have
it printed and mailed from the location closest to recipients to
save time and postage.
</P>
<P>
   Ultiverse in Waltham, Mass., whose roots date to a 1997
business-plan-of-the-year winner at Harvard Business School, is
perfecting a system that allows people who have Wireless
Application Protocol cell phones to get and send e-mail from the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   They can also use the phone to get voice-powered access to
calendars and personal phone directories they store on their office
computer, so they can say ``Call Joe Smith in accounting'' from the
phone without having to look up Joe's number.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up NowSpeed Inc. of Framingham, Mass. is rolling out a
similar product enabling companies to get access to e-mail through
wireless phones, digital pagers, and devices such as wireless Palm
Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would pay $8 per device per month _ or a maximum of
$20 for multiple devices for each subscriber _ to offer wireless
access to the corporate e-mail account, which could be Lotus Notes,
Microsoft Exchange, or several other systems. A version aimed at
individual subscribers is planned later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to announce this week a promotion offering a
year's free service to the first 5,000 people who sign up, and
25-percent-off rates for people signing up before Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   NowSpeed chief executive David Reske said his company has souped
up the service with some special features, including the power to
convert nine types of document attachments into a format that can
be read aloud over the phone or viewed on the cell phone screen.
Currently most wireless e-mail offerings can not show the contents
of attached documents.
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps your office e-mail ``synched up,'' so when you use
the phone to delete an e-mail, move it to a folder, or forward it,
your e-mail account reflects those changes the next time you log in
from the office computer.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone-only side, Linx Communications of Newton, Mass.
offers a service _ now resold by Bell Atlantic locally _ providing
customers a new local or toll-free number that simultaneously rings
three numbers (say, office, home and mobile). You pay $50 a month
for 400 minutes of incoming and outgoing calls or $100 a month for
1,000 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, it is a less expensive, simpler version of
the Wildfire ``virtual personal assistant'' offered by Wildfire
Communications of Lexington, Mass., which responds to spoken
commands. The promise is you can get one Linx number to put on your
business card that rings to wherever you might be.
</P>
<P>
   People calling your Linx number have to state who they are
before the call goes through, so you can shunt calls to voice mail
or have them transferred to a colleague. Likewise, faxes sent to
the Linx number can be stored for printing out on whatever machine
you can find where you are.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the promise of unified messaging, some analysts
wonder how many people really want to be reachable everywhere by
every mode all the time _ and whether this really signifies
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core problem is that we are all over-messaged,'' said
McCarthy, the Forrester analyst. ``Unified messaging can't solve
that problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is ``assessing the practicality of it, rather than
the `Gee whiz, you can actually do this,' aspect,'' McCarthy said.
``I would bet only 5 percent of companies really need this and
would have IT guys who would shell out for it.''

&HT;     WARTIME DESTROYER DRAWS TOURISTS, VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ What once was a vessel of war is now a siren for
a singular group of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Slater , a World War II destroyer escort, has attracted
33 groups sponsoring military reunions this season. While the ship
is open to the public as a museum, the military veterans constitute
an additional niche market.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated 2,238 reunion guests will spend more than $1.55
million in Albany County _ dollars the area wouldn't have attracted
otherwise, according to an estimate from the Albany County
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every Destroyer Escort Group left will eventually
come to the Slater, I really do,'' said Raymond Crumley, a World
War II veteran from Georgia helping to plan a September reunion for
people who served on the USS Savage.
</P>
<P>
   While the Slater isn't the Savage, it is the only one of 565
original destroyer escorts still afloat, and one of only four
surviving. It was opened for reunions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999 combined, it attracted 30 groups, said
marketing director Deborah Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth _ or word of e-mail among veterans _ has spread,
and people appear happy to travel during summer months for their
reunions to Albany's Snow Dock, where the Slater now is tied up. It
is cared for and owned by the privately run Destroyer Escort
Historical Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Crumley is anticipating the Slater will generate
higher-than-usual attendance at his upcoming reunion, which usually
draws about 50 people, counting spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ship, it stirs attention and brings back memories,
Crumley said: ``A DE sailor is a DE sailor.''
</P>
<P>
   Destroyer escorts were developed in World War II to respond to
the threat posed by submarines. The escort was a smaller, more
maneuverable vessel than the larger ships serving as troop convoys.
The escort's job was to sail along with the troop convoys and try
to detect and deflect attacks from enemy submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Destroyer escorts often took torpedoes before convoys.
Sometimes, the escorts traveled in small groups around a convoy for
even better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some vessels went on into later service. The Savage, for
instance, saw duty in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, Crumley
said, so he is hoping this reunion attracts some Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Christos J. Saffaras, a Navy veteran of World War II from
Latham, N.Y., will be at the Slater again in September for the
reunion of his ship, the DE 104. Saffaras, 75, thinks this may be
one of the last reunions of World War II veterans, because of their
advancing age, and said he is glad the Slater is available for use
as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Crumley and some friends even will help refurbish the vessel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the Slater also has attracted a larger group, members
of the Destroyer Escort Association. That meeting should attract
about 800 people to Albany from Sept. 10 to 15, she said.

WITH AIDS DRUGS, MANY GAY MEN SEE LESS DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It all looked distressingly familiar: a men's sex club,
unprotected intercourse, an outbreak of syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a more common combination 20 years ago,
before AIDS devastated gay communities, prompting a nationwide
crusade for ``safe sex.'' But this syphilis outbreak hit late last
year. Local health workers found that a cluster of men, 11 by last
count, had contracted the disease, and had traced the infections to
the Safari Club, a Boston gay men's spot that had been closed by
the city last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those events, followed by similar ones in other cities, have
health officials worried. Although total syphilis cases reported in
Massachusetts have remained steady, the gay men's share of those
cases has now jumped to 34 percent. This is high enough to concern
Department of Public Health officials, who met with gay activists
on June 16 to address fears of an increase in unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials' vigilance might be premature: The number of
HIV cases in Massachusetts has not increased, although symptoms are
found months after exposure, and diagnosis can be made months after
that.
</P>
<P>
   But a survey of AIDS activists has found that they, too, are
concerned that with a sense of crisis abating, as new drugs
significantly extend the lives of HIV-positive people, many gay men
are relaxing their attitude toward unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say whether it's a significant minority or a
small minority of vocal individuals,'' said Brian Byrnes of the
AIDS Action Committee in Boston. ``But we're definitely hearing
that there are individuals who are making what many of them believe
is an informed choice to have unprotected . . . intercourse with
sex partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are numerous, according to AIDS prevention
specialists: Some men may choose unprotected sex because they and
their partners are already HIV-positive, and they hear that the
likelihood of contracting more virulent strains is slim.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find that unsafe intercourse has become a preference, a
calculated risk in the interest of greater pleasure. And others may
see unprotected sex as a kind of surrender: After years of anxiety
about the disease, some gay men are too fatigued to remain
vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay communities have been living in a kind of emergency for
two decades now about this, and there's a point at which it gets
normalized,'' said a Berkeley psychologist, Walt Odets. ``It's easy
to forget that for gay men, this is like being in London during the
Second World War, and after a while one becomes numb and
desensitized to the extremity of the situation. One way to deny the
emergency is to go out and pretend it doesn't exist. It's like
going to an outdoor cafe during the blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue is more common among older men, psychologists said. For
younger men, with only dim memories of lesion-racked 30-year-olds
leaning on canes, a preference for unprotected sex has arisen
largely as the result of new drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
   For longtime AIDS activists, the situation is disheartening: The
dramatic shift in sexual practices in the 1980s has been a point of
pride among older activists, who note that safe sex took root among
gays more quickly than among straight people.
</P>
<P>
   Gay men, ``in the midst of the epidemic, took responsibility for
each other,'' said Marshall Forstein, medical director of mental
health and addiction services at Fenway Community Health Center and
assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ``The
AIDS epidemic crystallized a political and social movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the message was simple: a condom every time,
no matter what. Vigilance was a matter of life or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed gay male behavior phenomenally, more than any of
us ever thought they could,'' Forstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Because HIV infections can be difficult to trace, transmission
of syphilis has always been a marker of sexual responsibility. In
the early 1980s, gay men accounted for half of all syphilis cases
in Massachusetts. Ten years later, safe-sex messages had been so
effective that gay men accounted for less than 1 percent, according
to state figures. And that small percentage has remained steady for
almost 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   That was why the outbreak at the Safari Club was so alarming,
officials said. At the club, three men had been infected, then had
transmitted the disease to at least eight more men. Half of the men
infected, including the first three, are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not young kids,'' Michael Whelan, deputy director of
sexually transmitted diseases for the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health, said of the syphilis cases that were reported this
year. ``You can maybe understand someone who's missed the whole
AIDS epidemic and they're 18 and just coming out, but that's not
what we're seeing. It's people who have been around, and are aware,
and have just chosen to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fenway Community Health Center reported a doubling of
gonorrhea cases this year. And over the past two years, sexually
transmitted diseases among gay men have spiked in other cities, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Newark among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an indicator of things to come,'' said Whelan.
``If you increase the pool of infected people, you increase the
number of people at risk, and the cost of taking care of the
problem is clearly greater.''
</P>
<P>
   And for each documented instance of unprotected sex, health
officials know there are many more. They say they see anecdotal
evidence that attitudes are shifting, at least among those who
frequent bars and clubs and the Internet. A preference for
unprotected intercourse has even entered the ``hanky code,'' the
lexicon of signals by which some men indicate their sexual
preferences in bars, said researcher Michael Scarce, who is writing
a book on the subject. Its sign is a navy blue kerchief with white
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Scarce, who has talked to scores of gay men for his book, said
that new AIDS drugs have changed the equation. Younger men assume
that if they contract the disease at 30, Scarce said, it will take
10 years before they become symptomatic, and another 15 until the
drug therapies stop working. They might be 55 or 60 before they get
really sick, they figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fool. I don't think HIV has gone away. But life is a
series of risks. It's an issue of quality of life versus quantity
of life,'' said David, a man in his 30s who no longer uses condoms
and spoke on condition his name be changed. ``How many years will
not eating ice cream actually buy me? Smokers go through this all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists who treat gay men emphasize that a desire for
unprotected sex is understandable. It was, after all, perfectly
normal to have sex without condoms before AIDS struck. And they see
many men who engage in unsafe sex at least some of the time:
National surveys have found that at least one-third of gay men
admit to having had unprotected sex with multiple partners in any
six-month period, and that substantial numbers of those men did not
know their partners' HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   At first, specialists had thought that HIV prevention was a war
against ignorance. But now they are increasingly aware that
psychology is just as potent an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men feel it's not a matter of if, but when,'' said Miguel
Rivera, who runs a Manhattan discussion group for men who avoid
condoms. ``They're tired of worrying. Some have buried lovers and
friends, and have this prevailing sense that HIV will catch up with
them at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstein added that in many ways, unprotected sex ``is the most
life-affirming event some men can imagine. How do you keep the
devil at bay? Go head-to-head with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists who treat gay patients say early safe sex
messages, successful as they were, had alienated some men because
they did not take account of the complexities of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '80s, we lied to people,'' Forstein said. ``We
said that safe sex was better sex, telling them it was just as much
fun to do it with a condom as it was to do it without.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Web sites for those who prefer unprotected sex are full of
references to AIDS prevention organizations as ``condom Nazis,''
accusing them of demonizing men who have risky sex the same way
some have demonized homosexuality itself.
</P>
<P>
   Such rejection of safe sex, unthinkable a few years ago, is
largely traced to protease inhibitors, AIDS-fighting drugs that
have dramatically slowed the progress of the disease, making it
less fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   Donations to organizations like AIDS Action have been slipping.
Advertising for this year's AIDS Walk hammered home an idea: ``AIDS
is still a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest statistics in Boston and elsewhere suggest that
slogan may be more than just rhetoric. In Los Angeles County, for
instance, 93 cases of syphilis among gay men have been reported
since March 22. Usually, Los Angeles sees 100 cases of syphilis in
an entire year. Half of the men whose infections were reported this
year are HIV-positive. Having syphilis makes the other men far more
likely to contract HIV from unprotected sex, which worries health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if we didn't have an increase in HIV
transmission and other STD diseases,'' said Dr. Jonathan Fielding,
director of public health for Los Angeles County. ``Syphilis is
treatable. We know we don't have a cure for HIV, and treatment is
arduous. The overall toll is so substantial, so I'm very
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations, AIDS Action and Fenway Community Health
among them, are adjusting to the environment, replacing an
insistence on safe sex at all times with the concepts of safer sex
and harm reduction.
</P>
<P>
   These groups acknowledge that men might not always use condoms
during sex, and they offer them ways to at least reduce the risks.
They are also trying to treat the epidemic as a mental health, not
just an education, problem, recognizing that some men do not insist
on condoms because of low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a support group for HIV-negative men at Fenway, and
the health center is part of a national study called Project
Explore, which tracks thousands of HIV-negative men over several
years to determine what kinds of one-on-one counseling best equip
them to negotiate sexual relations as the disease endures.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Prayers were offered and hymns were sung.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of fellowship as mothers, fathers, children and
couples filled the pews of Rainbow Cathedral on a recent Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved, God truly does love you,'' the Rev. John Nicholas,
pastor of the 200-member church, told his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The service was like many throughout San Antonio on any given
Sunday. There was one big difference: the majority of those in the
pews were gay or lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Being gay while being faithful is something that, when noticed
in other churches, has caused controversy and consternation. Entire
denominations that regard homosexual inclinations or behavior as a
sin are arguing over what role, if any, openly gay churchgoers can
have in religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stotts, president emeritus of the Austin Presbyterian
Theological Seminary, said Christianity has grappled with the
homosexual question since its earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has struggled over the centuries to develop
perspectives on pressing issues,'' Stotts said. ``Racial equality
was one issue. Women being ordained or serving in leadership
positions is another. People take different positions. It's the
same way with the homosexual question.''
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian theology does not prohibit people from being
members or holding office because of their sexual orientation,
Stotts said, but gay Presbyterians are required to remain celibate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual orientation itself is not a sin. But the behavior that
comes with it is,'' Stotts said.
</P>
<P>
   Few pastors in mainstream denominations in San Antonio or Austin
perform same-sex marriages, but one who does said his congregation
has been enriched by not only accepting but embracing as equals
gays and lesbians who enter a committed relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Art Severance, pastor of First Unitarian Universalist
Church in San Antonio, said he has performed about two dozen union
ceremonies for lesbians and two for gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religiously, it's a wedding,'' Severance said. ``Legally, it's
not _ yet. I liken it to the civil rights era when a white would
never marry a black or a minister would be divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   Such unions, and the ordination of gay clergy, have become
topics of open debate at leadership gatherings of Protestant
denominations, and Stotts said it would be foolish to assume gays
and lesbians are not already part of most Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't flaunt it. They're not out of the closet, so
to speak,'' Stotts said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, the openly gay pastor of the Rainbow Cathedral, an
affiliate of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches, said that is precisely why the fellowship of churches was
established in Los Angeles in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is welcome at our church, including heterosexuals,''
said Nicholas, a Navy veteran and pastor of one of a half-dozen
congregations in San Antonio that openly accept gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with an emerging gay and lesbian movement in the
1960s, the establishment of the Metropolitan Community Churches
offered church services for those whose sexual orientation made
them unwelcome, or made them feel that way, in the denominations
they grew up in.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a network called Dignity/USA was formed
to provide Masses for gay Catholics. The Catholic Church has never
officially sanctioned the group, but even in conservative South
Texas, a handful of sympathetic priests celebrate Mass each Sunday.
One of the priests, the Rev. Eddie Bernal, said it's considered an
``outreach ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians have been told a lot of lies and have been
made to feel horrible about themselves,'' Bernal said. ``Many times
people in religion have scapegoated on gays and lesbians, pointing
their finger at them and causing them to suffer from unnecessary
low self esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Dignity they find solidarity, support and love. They find
what every Christian church should offer them: love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jim Cottone, a retired professor of infectious diseases at
the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, being
forced to give up either his sexuality or his religion is out of
the question. He has been attending Dignity services since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity completes me,'' Cottone said. ``It makes me realize
that my upbringing as a Catholic is still part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignity congregants are reluctant to reveal where they hold
services. Nickie Valdez, who has been a member of the group since
1983, remembers a Sunday in 1987 when members got in their vehicles
after Mass and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get far. The lug nuts on their wheels had been
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a message,'' Valdez said. ``Luckily no one
was hurt.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Episcopal
Church will debate sanctioning same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, United Methodist Church leaders voted to uphold
their doctrine that homosexual behavior is incompatible with
Christian teaching. It also adopted a policy requiring clergy to be
faithful in heterosexual marriage or celibate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, messengers at the Southern Baptist Convention in
Orlando, Fla., voted to revise the Baptist Faith and Message
Statement to oppose homosexuality, along with what they called
``all manner of deviant and pagan sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although each Baptist congregation is autonomous, the statement
is viewed as the closest thing the denomination has to an official
creed.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which
represents 1,800 Reform rabbis serving more than 1.5 million Reform
Jews, approved a measure allowing them to perform same-sex
commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Lasalle R. Vaughn, pastor of New Life Christian
Center, a nondenominational Christian church in San Antonio, said
the growing lesbian and gay movement and increasing public
acceptance of same-sex unions is blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the Bible says homosexuality is a perverted
lifestyle,'' Vaughn said. ``Just like all of those having sex
outside of marriage. That's perversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he is offended by the notion that those opposed to
the gay lifestyle are bigots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm African-American and being homosexual does not make you a
minority,'' Vaughn said. ``We're not going to accept it in this
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Giles, who attends services at Rainbow Cathedral, said
anti-gay sermons from fundamentalist pulpits breed hatred and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about hell and damnation, fire and brimstone,
especially if you're gay,'' said Giles, a volunteer coordinator for
the San Antonio Gay and Lesbian Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I run across that hate, my response is John 3:16. Jesus
Christ died for all of us.''

   Q: Which pro golfers were on the committee that voted to
continue the legal fight against Casey Martin?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The nine-member PGA Tour Policy Board, which voted in late
May to petition the Supreme Court about Martin's court-mandated
golf cart, includes four players: John Cook, Mike Hulbert, Davis
Love III and Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco upheld a 1998
Oregon court's decision to allow Martin to ride a cart in PGA Tour
events. The 28-year-old golfer, a college teammate of Tiger Woods
at Stanford, has a degenerative circulatory disease in his right
leg that makes walking extremely painful.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a PGA Tour rookie this year, has made the cut in 7 of 13
events through mid-June, including a 17th-place finish in the
Touchstone Energy Tucson Open.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jennifer Lien left ``Star Trek: Voyager'' and returned this
year for one episode. Did she do any other projects in between?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.D., Woonsocket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: The biggest role for Lien after leaving ``Voyager'' was
playing Edward Norton's sister in the 1998 film ``American History
X.''
</P>
<P>
   Lien, 25, also appeared in the film ``S.L.C. Punk!'' last year
and did voice work for ``Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and the
animated TV series ``Men in Black.''

``Last of the Mohicans?''
</P>
<P>
   _ G.S., Gardner, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Main Title,'' reused several different ways in the 1992
movie, was written by film co-composer Trevor Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 51, is a South African musician whose credits include
``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Notting Hill,'' ``G.I. Jane,'' ``Bad
Influence'' and more than 40 other films.

GLOBAL WARMING COULD ALTER NEW ENGLAND DRAMATICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No colorful foliage in the fall to lure carloads of leaf
peepers, and no sugarhouses for brunch in early spring. Hardly any
skiing in the winter. Dwindling potato fields in the Maine
countryside. And a coastline pounded and eaten away by violent
storms.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the New England of 2100, according to an
unprecedented White House report on the impacts of climate change.
The draft review, issued last week for a 60-day period of public
comment, paints a picture of dramatic change in New England as well
as in the rest of the nation, drawing attention as never before to
the wide variety of effects that could be triggered by the global
warming scientists expect to accelerate over the next century. And,
they emphasize, there could be big surprises as well.
</P>
<P>
   The report marks a significant new phase in attempts to quantify
the results of the greenhouse effect, which causes the planet to
warm up when certain gases _ many of them produced by human
activity _ accumulate in the atmosphere. While previous efforts
have concentrated on global effects, the new report, called
``Climate Change Impacts on the United States,'' attempts to detail
what the results would be in our own backyards. While the effects
are a mixed bag _ agricultural yields nationwide are expected to
increase, but so are both droughts and floods _ the overall picture
is sobering.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it turns out that a great deal of local variation
has been masked in the global summaries, but shows up in detail in
this localized analysis. For example, a small increase in average
temperatures for the whole planet could produce killer heat waves
in some regions, as well as some places that actually get colder.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, said William Moomaw, professor of international
environmental policy at Tufts University, is that ``there are going
to be some losers, even if some areas are better off. Some places
will be much worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States as a whole is expected to experience about
double the globally averaged temperature rise, according to both of
the computer models studied. While the amount of that increase
remains uncertain, the United Nations-backed International Panel on
Climate Change has predicted that the planet's temperature will
rise 1.8 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. In the United States,
however, the new report says the projected increase is 5 to 10
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics last week seemed to misunderstand the distinction
between the global and US forecasts, citing the difference as if it
were a discrepancy between the two reports. In fact, said Peter
Raven, an ecologist who heads the goverment panel that evaluated
the report and made suggestions for revisions on early drafts, the
US forecast ``is not only consistent, it's drawn from the same
model'' as the global forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the US effects are more severe than the global ones, the
White House report says, ``Regional and local level impacts are
much more pronounced than those at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   That difference between regional and global effects is not just
based on projections; it is also reflected in what has already
happened. For example, while temperatures worldwide have increased
about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century, Alaska has already
undergone a 4-degree warming during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the climate on a regional level is even more
difficult, however, than forecasting the planet's temperature, a
task that has required the most sophisticated computer models ever
developed for environmental problems. As a result, the White House
study is the first comprehensive regional climate forecast for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   By identifying these local effects, the report ``really brings
this global problem down to Earth,'' said Susan Moser, a staff
scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the report goes out for a 60-day comment period during
which Anthony Janetos, a scientist with the World Resources
Institute and cochairman of the panel that prepared the report,
hopes for a broad public debate on global warming and its possible
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the report has become part of the larger Washington
debate on global warming, in which the White House has pushed for
actions to reduce US emissions of carbon dioxide and other
so-called ``greenhouse gases'' while many members of Congress have
questioned whether climate change is a real fear. They say the real
issue is the damage to the oil, coal and other industries that
would result from limiting US emissions.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor last Friday, speakers complained that the
two different climate models cited in the report often give
different projections _ and, in a few isolated cases, even opposite
ones (for example, one model predicts Southwestern forests will be
replaced by grasslands, while in the other, trees flourish).
</P>
<P>
   ``These complicated models . . . are still not accurate enough
to provide reliable forecasts on how the climate may change,'' said
Sen. Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. ``The several models
often yield contradictory results.''
</P>
<P>
   But such criticisms are ``a bad misreading of the results and of
how science is done,'' said Tufts' Moomaw. Scientists ``do come at
this in different ways, using different tools. Rather than average
(the two models' results), it is better to have all these concerns
reflected _ it at least raises the possibility of what might
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   During Senate debate, however, study cochairman Janetos conceded
that ``we're not making a specific prediction about what the future
will be like. It would be farcical to try to do that.'' Rather, the
intent was to provide ``what-if'' scenarios based on certain
assumptions, including that no aggressive steps are taken to try to
curb emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, the models actually agree:For example, both show
that, under the expected amount of warming, maples will virtually
disappear from the United States, including all of New England, and
will remain only in Canada. But where the models do disagree, Moser
said, there should be further analysis and research.
</P>
<P>
   And study cochairman Janetos warned that people shouldn't
automatically assume that the less-severe prediction is the one
that is more likely to be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to suspect that one is more likely than
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Moomaw said the 1980s debate over the hole in the Earth's
protective ozone layer should be a sobering reminder that the
reality ``can be worse than we anticipated, instead of better.''
The giant hole in the ozone layer that has emerged over the South
Pole had not been forecast by any model.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is very hard to predict is the way both
agriculture and natural ecosystems will adapt to climate change.
The report says that, in general, agricultural yields will increase
because of the fertilizing effect of higher carbon-dioxide levels,
and because of longer growing seasons in some places. (One of the
few exceptions is potatoes, whose yields could decline by more than
20 percent under one model).
</P>
<P>
   But, because the changed climate will alter the optimum growing
regions for different kinds of plants, such increased yields will
only occur if farmers are able to adapt by changing the crops they
grow in a given place. But that is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, shifting crops is more than a matter of
temperatures and rainfall. There also can be significant costs to
farmers for different seeds, fertilizers and machinery, and these
could present real strains in places where farmers are already
working on razor-thin margins. And, while the climate may shift the
growing zone for a given crop northward, that doesn't necessarily
mean that suitable soils will be available there.
</P>
<P>
   As for natural ecosystems, the report warns that, in some cases,
especially in small, isolated zones or where there are boundaries
imposed by urban sprawl, it will simply be impossible for an
ecosystem to shift to a new location. For example, alpine meadows
in the rockies and coral reefs off Florida and Hawaii could suffer
irreversible damage, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Many such systems already face problems because of unrelated
pressures, such as air or water pollution or urbanization. ``One
has to consider climate change in the context of a lot of the other
environmental stresses people are concerned about,'' said Janetos
of the World Resources Institute. Assessing the interactions among
all the factors that will affect land, air, water and living things
is ``extremely difficult to do. We've made a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental system is so complex, there will be
surprises,'' Moser said. ``We should take that as seriously as any
of the other findings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the science is a cautionary tale,'' Moomaw said,
``particularly if the consequences are highly damaging and
irreversible. Then, we ought to use the precautionary principle,
rather than use uncertainty as an excuse for inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   On one thing at least both the report and its critics
wholeheartedly agree _ the need for far more research to try to
reduce the uncertainties. ``Science must drive policy and not vice
versa,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho. ``We owe to
our constituents and to future generations to seek answers and not
hide from whatever turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   Janetos, who cochaired the White House study, feels that the US
political response so far, while decidedly mixed, is moving in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now a lot of people around the country who are
taking a step back from the ideology and saying this is an
important issue, we need to understand it and understand what the
adaptation options are. I hope it will be an ongoing process.''

<P>
   ABERDARE NATIONAL PARK, Kenya _ Tiger Woods will never be called
on for this shot. But a wandering Texan named Bill Evans is
undaunted by the high-and-mightily-mobile hazard in front of the
green at the fourth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``What club would you like to clear that giraffe, sir?'' asks
Evans's caddy _ me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the 10-iron will do it just fine,'' Bill says.
</P>
<P>
   Since club selection is fairly limited (three instruments: 10
and 5-irons, plus putter, on rental from the pro shop), I briskly
hand him the 10. The rubbernecking giraffe, sensing our approach,
just as briskly glides off into a woods no tiger will inhabit. But
possibly a lion or two. We saw one down the road a couple of hours
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, saying the 10-iron will serve as well as a wedge, lofts
his ball onto the green. Beautiful _ except that the ball stays
where it lands, as though encountering emerald molasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the only rolls are at lunch,'' he muses correctly
after 3-putting from 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piga mzuri, bwana!'' shouts guide Kim Edmonds. ``That means
good shot, sir, in Swahili, the local tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Aberdare Country Club in the East African wilds, a
lush course where you may move a ball 6 inches without penalty if
it has alighted in an animal hoofprint on the green. Or in a stack
of elephant doo-doo anywhere. Whenever an elephant hollers, it may
not sound like ``Fore!'' but it's probably wise to get out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free drop given if a baboon takes the ball,'' advises the
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-minute flight from Nairobi, past snowy Mount Kenya and then
a jaunting bus ride, the ACC is a zoo without bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not your every-day round,'' says Bill, who has golfed across
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But there are nine holes, and a 19th hole overflowing with
Tusker beer and tales _ preferred lies? _ you won't hear at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass. Such as bodily holes-in-one by
poor souls tumbling into aardvark tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Guide Edmonds, says, ``In an earlier time if you asked somebody,
`What did you shoot today?' the reply might be, `Three over _ and a
buffalo and a couple of water bucks on the sixth.' But hunting is
no longer permitted in Kenya.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but,'' wonders Bill, ``does it go both ways? Are the
resident beasts prohibited from hunting us?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Magondu and Francis Ojul, a couple of groundskeepers
toiling at the tri-level, steeply uphill seventh, are reassuring.
``I don't think any player has been trampled by an elephant or
eaten by a lion,'' Ojul says. ``But if a baboon wants your ball let
him keep it. They can be foul-tempered.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you can't carry a gun, maybe a fixed bayonet on your
putter would be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   A Kenyan named Phil West says he once tried the course, but
thought better about playing through a rhinoceros snorting around
the second green. The twin horns looked like a double-bogey to
West, and ``I decided to retire to the bar where I'd rather take my
chances with pink elephants than a black rhino.''
</P>
<P>
   A lovely layout with adventurously lumpy greens, tilting
fairways and sawdust bunkers, the course is decorated by plenty of
handsome trees: fig, olive, acacia, pink-flowering chestnut, and
euphorbia (built like a green candelabra). Mount Kenya looms as the
backdrop. Congregations of vividly-hued birds, like red-feathered
fire finches and yellow-and-black weavers, provide the sound track.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever we putt, black-winged creatures called go-way birds
utter hoarse laughs, sounding, ``Gway! Gway!'' Among other
chittering kibbitzers are leaping, long-tailed colobus monkeys.
Black with white faces, they bear a bearded and hooded resemblance
to Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   The constant up and down plodding is good exercise. ``Too many
hills and gullies ever to have carts here,'' says Bill. ``You'd
have a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of pars 3 and 4 add up to 33, none of them longer than
297 yard No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rate it sportily different. ``Much of the sport lies in watching
out where you're walking _ dodging and avoiding you-know-what,''
says Bill, a nimble hop-scotcher. ``This is the best fertilized
course I've ever seen. Can you tell who or what's been here, Kim?''
</P>
<P>
   Any good guide is an expert excrementologist, Edmonds no
exception. ``Zebra and dik-dik _ a tiny antelope _ here,'' she
points. ``There's giraffe, warthog, peacock. Some eland and water
buck. You ought to be carrying a pooper-scooper club.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the short length, three blind greens and sharp dog legs
make the round a little tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here call them hog legs,'' says Edmonds. As if on cue,
a family of five tusked warthogs scoots down the fairway, waddling
but quick.
</P>
<P>
   Bill likes the fifth hole, especially because a maintenance road
curls near the green. ``The local road hole. Reminds me of the
famed Road Hole at St. Andrew's in Scotland. Except that Jack
Nicklaus never chipped a ball into a giraffe footprint there. I'm
one-up on him in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The stone clubhouse behind the ninth green dates back to 1932,
colonial days when the ruling Brits installed golf here. Cascading
bougainvillea and poinsettia trees enhance the finish line. Tall
hedges and a bright flower garden near the building preserve a
British air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' says Bill. ``Nothing like this in Dallas. But I
sure couldn't read those greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were in Swahili.

 &HT;    Use of placebos can help in healing
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the back of his wooden wagon he learned forward toward the
crowd. In one hand he held up a brown bottle, hailing its potent,
curative powers. His other hand mesmerized the audience by twisting
his lengthy handlebar mustache around his long graceful fingers.
Was he a snake oil salesman or a purveyor of alternative medicine,
a century before his time? In either case, the success of his
magical remedies was largely dependent on the power of the placebo
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo's history dates back to medieval times when
mistranslations of the 116th psalm in the Hebrew Bible resulted in
the Latin phrase ``I shall please.'' In the middle ages,
professional mourners were hired to sing vespers (placebos) for the
dead. By the early 19th century, placebo referred to a medicinal
treatment given more to please than to benefit the patient. Medical
problems where the patient's self-report is used to measure
intensity such as migraine headache, back pain, post surgical pain,
rheumatoid arthritis, angina and depression often respond well to a
placebo. Other more objectively measured problems such as blood
pressure, some skin conditions such as warts, and heart rate can
also respond significantly to placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Placebos are also used in experimental medicine. The
experimental (active substance or treatment) is given to one group
of patients and an inert (inactive substance or treatment), a
placebo, is given to a control group. At the end of the study the
two groups are compared in order to assess whether any changes that
take place are due to the experimental treatment or to
psychological factors. Some medical researchers have concluded that
between 30 and 70 percent of any treated group will respond to a
placebo. In fact, some studies have shown the placebo effect to
exceed those attributed to the active drug.
</P>
<P>
   There are several explanations for the placebo effect. Perhaps
the most widely accepted is that the placebo effect appears as an
involuntary conditioned reflex of the patient's body. People who
have experienced relief in medical settings or from ingesting a
pill are ``primed,'' like Pavlov's dogs, to do the same again. The
placebo effect then is a result of the patient's expectation of an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Current medical thinking encourages health-care providers to
make use of the powerful self-healing forces of the mind-body
connection. The savvy health-care provider introduces treatment
with enthusiasm and optimism rather than simply suggesting that the
treatment may or may not be of assistance to the patient.

material was originally published in Dave Barry's book Dave Barry
Turns 50.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... would see?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unplanned as ever, I decided to try a group tour and to let
someone else do the heavy lifting and thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Several days before its nine-day, seven-night trip to Sicily was
to leave, the Richard Durgan Travel Service of Stoneham informed me
that there was a space for me in a group of 38, most of whom were
friends, relatives, or neighbors who had traveled together before.
</P>
<P>
   Once committed, I began to worry. What if no one talks to me or
wants to eat with me? Can I spend hours on tour buses with total
strangers? Can they do the same with me?
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to worry. At Logan Airport, I was met by a
friendly, smiling woman named Mary, the tour leader, who had
already brought our tickets to the Alitalia counter.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hours later at Milan's Malpensa Airport, Mary saw to it
that we all went to the right gate on time for the 1 1/2-hour
flight to Catania Airport in Sicily. Under her watchful eye, our
luggage arrived the same time we did.
</P>
<P>
   At Catania, we were met by Rosa Rizza, one of the local guides
engaged by Durgan Travel and one of the finest. Rosa went to Sicily
23 years ago from her home in Plainville, Conn., to attend
university. She married a Sicilian and now has two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa saw to it that we and our luggage all got on the same bus
for the hour's ride to the Hotel Ariston in Taormina, a resort high
on the slopes of Mount Tauro overlooking Sicily's Ionian coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief for me not to have to run around trying to find
a room.
</P>
<P>
   The three-star Ariston is a charming Mediterranean-style hotel
constructed of white cement, with a red-tiled roof and wrought-iron
balconies draped with wisteria and tropical flowers. After some of
the hotels I had stayed at in my travels, it was paradise.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, we were able to eat three scrumptious meals a
day from a buffet table laden with in-season vegetables, local
fish, meat, poultry, and homemade breads, including panetonne.
</P>
<P>
   In my lone travels, most of my meals have been of mysterious
content from street stalls, usually eaten standing on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Ariston's chef, Carmelo Catania, told me he prepares
eggplant, my favorite food, 23 ways. I hoped to sample them all.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, Rosa, Mary, and several other tour guides made
life easy for us. I could always trust that Mary would sit with me
at meals, just as she was there for the others in the group. When
one of us felt nauseous on the bus, Mary was there with the
wastebasket. When another was buffeted by winds walking to a
historic ``duomo'' (church) on a cliff, Mary commandeered a private
car to take her down to the bus.
</P>
<P>
   When I had to change dollars to lira, Mary took me to a bank,
told me how to check my camera in a cubicle outside, as required,
and then pass, one at a time, through a glass enclosure as a guard
watched our movements.
</P>
<P>
   Our seven days in Sicily were filled with activity. When we
weren't riding along spectacular mountain roads with hairpin turns
in Mercedes buses navigated by drivers named Angelo, Giovanni,
Mauricio, and Dino _ all with nerves of steel _ we were walking up
cobbled streets and steps for another breathtaking site.
</P>
<P>
   We walked a lot, mostly uphill, but what we found was always
worth it. Being a mountain goat would have helped; but, I never saw
an overweight Sicilian.
</P>
<P>
   One day, I went on my own on an optional bus tour to Agrigento
to see the stunning Greek ruins at the Valley of the Temples and I
missed my regular tour buddies. The strangers I had met the week
before at Logan Airport had become friends.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, we said our goodbyes when Mary and the group
went to Rome and I headed for five days in Malta, a 25-minute
flight from Catania. I had thought there was a ferry running
between Sicily and Malta but I would have had to go far south to
Pozzallo to catch one and that depended on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel lonely as I watched my group leave. I can't wait
to see the photo the men took of us women out front of the church
at Forza d'Agro where some of the scenes in ``The Godfather'' had
been shot.
</P>
<P>
   As I waved goodby to Mary, I suddenly felt like a child who had
lost its mother in a department store.
</P>
<P>
   Malta, I told myself, would prove that I could still travel on
my own. It did, but it wasn't so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel back in my ``loner'' groove on Air Malta's
flight back to Catania to connect to Milan and, then, home.
</P>
<P>
   I passed up Air Malta's 4 a.m. flight to Catania. Maltese use it
for a day's shopping trip. I opted for the 5:25 p.m. flight, happy
it would get me back to Catania, a city I didn't know, before
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, we were still on the ground in Malta. The plane
was waiting for in-transit baggage from Casablanca; the owners of
the baggage were already on board.
</P>
<P>
   A reservation had been made for me at a hotel in Catania. ``A
three-star,'' I had been told, unaware how varied that rating can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Finally off the ground in Malta, it was 9 p.m. before I finally
cleared customs in Catania, too late, I decided, to be driven
through the streets of a big, strange city only to have to return
the next morning for the flight to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I made up my mind to stay awake at the airport all
night and read. Looking around for someone who spoke English so I
could ask where the comfortable seats were, one young man
responded.
</P>
<P>
   When I found his only English was, ``Hi, baby,'' I decided
staying at the airport was not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   A Mr. Alloni, a kindly Alitalia employee at the airport who did
speak English, convinced me of that. The ``polizia'' would evict
me, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, exhaustion had shattered my broken Italian. Mr. Alloni
told the cab driver the hotel I wanted and asked the fare: 35,000
lira, or about $18.
</P>
<P>
   The ride through Catania to the outskirts seemed a lot longer
than the 15 minutes I was told to expect. The hotel was dismal. It
reminded me of the places I stayed in my pre-tour days.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's feisty proprietess and I did not hit it off. The
room with breakfast was priced at 170,000 lira, or $97, she told
me. ``Big bed, big bed,'' she said, touting its double bed.
</P>
<P>
   Too tired to quibble, I took the rickety elevator to the
fourth-floor room to find the ``big bed'' was two cots pushed
together, a phone that didn't work, and a hand-held shower.
</P>
<P>
   I put my coat on over my pajamas, my shoes on bare feet and went
to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   `'This is a dump,'' I said, trying to imitate the line made
famous by Bette Davis in the 1949 film, ``Beyond the Forest.''
``Not worth $97.''
</P>
<P>
   (Right now, the easiest way to convert lira to dollars is to
halve the amount, so 170,000 was closer to $85. What Miss Davis
actually said was, ``What a dump!'').
</P>
<P>
   The proprietess stood firm. ``I am going to report you to the
polizia,'' said I. A paper and pencil appeared on the counter.
``120,000 lira'' was written down, now $60 instead of $97. I left
for the airport at dawn the next morning, arriving four hours
early. I skipped the ``breakfast included'' at the hotel.

   SMALL-SCHOOLS _ WASHINGTON _ Students in Chicago's new small
public schools are less likely to skip classes or drop out, and may
perform better academically, says a multi-year academic study to be
released and discussed here Tuesday. The findings support Education
Secretary Richard Riley's call to ``stop building high schools the
size of large shopping malls.'' But cost-conscious skeptics remain
unconvinced. Pros and cons of the dispute over how to handle the
upcoming increase of 1.3 million in high school enrollments in this
decade. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 25.

   HITECH-RR-XINGS _ BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ We watch Tuesday as the
federal Department of Transportation and Georgia Tech researchers
field test a possible high-tech solution to railroad crossing
collisions. A transmitter aboard a Georgia Northeastern Railroad
Co. locomotive will beam a signal to antennaes near railroad
crossings that will then relay it to transmitters that can be
carried on vehicles - including school buses - to warn a train is
approaching. Such a device might have prevented the tragic
train-bus collision in Tennga, Tenn., this spring. (Ledford,

</P>
<P>
   HEARTLAND-PA _ Before we begin, will Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge
be Gov. George W. Bush's running mate? If the answer is yes, and it
might be, then move Pennsylvania into the GOP column and go on to
the next topic. Even Democrats in the Keystone State concede that
putting the popular governor on the ticket would guarantee Bush a
victory. ``I think he's a solid leader with a great, sparkling
resume,'' a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly
said. ``Now, if Ridge is on the ticket it would make things more
difficult for me....''Perhaps more than any other state,
Pennsylvania is a vexing jumble of political identities. Anchored
by major urban centers Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on opposing
corners, vast miles of the state are rural farm and hunting land.
Last week the state mourned the death of a beloved former
Democratic governor who gained national fame as a rare opponent of
abortion in his party. Ridge, the popular Republican of today,
favors abortion rights. The winner in Pennsylvania will have to
avoid offending Catholics, who outnumber all other regligious
groups in the state, appease one of the largest retiree populations
in America, deal with pockets of deep union support, and thread the
needle on gun control between rural gun advocates and suburban
voters hypersensitive to the dangers of firearms and children.

   HEARTLAND-PABAR _ From most any downtown angle, the renaissance
is hard to see. A warren of one-way streets surrounds the main
drag, which is ruled by faintly traveled dime stores and the odd
tattoo parlor. On successive blocks off this road, called Hamilton
Mall, worn row houses still project the image of a working class in
decay. The Allentown of the Billy Joel song back in 1982. A place
still best defined by the absence of something, which in this case
would be the absence of Big Steel.But what a few dismal vistas fail
to reveal is that a sense of optimism now beams through Allentown
and neighboring Bethlehem, twin anchors in a two-county region
known as the Lehigh Valley. This cradle of industrial innovation
and might, where plans were drawn and steel was forged to build the
Golden Gate Bridge and large chunks of the New York skyline, is in
the midst of a rebirth. The Lehigh Valley of the 21st Century is
pulling itself up with bootstraps sewn not from leather, but from
fiber optic cable. In a state where political identity feels
transitory, few places are more in transition than the Lehigh
Valley. The fate of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee
for president, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee, seems likely to rest here on the direction to which
cross-party voters flow. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily News). 20.

WHY DO YOU NEED SO MUCH WATER EVERY DAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q.Health guidelines indicate that eight glasses of water should
be consumed every day. I can understand why caffeinated beverages
cannot be substituted, but why not herb tea? Does it really have to
be straight water?
</P>
<P>
   L.P., Lexington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You lose water all day long through a combination of
perspiration and other bodily processes, and you obviously have to
replace it or you'll die. The eight glasses you cite are a sort of
nominal guess for what might make sense, but, of course, you have
to modify it according to your personal needs. Clearly you'll need
more on a hot day or when you're exercising.
</P>
<P>
   Your body will get the water it needs from any food or drink
containing water, so there's no real reason not to go for juice or
tea (herb or otherwise). One thing to watch out for is that if you
drink beverages that contains diuretics (caffeinated or alcoholic
ones, for example, or so-called medicinal teas that contain other
diuretics), you may stimulate your body to excrete water and have
to take in even more to compensate. You may also want to watch for
the calories that you take in with drinks that contain sugar or
alcohol; pure water is calorie free. Finally, you may find that you
absorb water better when it has some salts and electrolytes in it,
such as sports drinks or fruit juices.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, common sense is a good guide.

<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ They come to the shores of Cape Cod every
year for a summer mating festival, and they make biologists very,
very happy. The slim, translucent squid give scientists insight
into everything from the roots of Alzheimer's disease to the
mechanics of vision, and they're ripe for the picking in the waters
around Woods Hole.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also valuable deep-fried and dipped in tartar sauce.
</P>
<P>
   That has Woods Hole scientists worried: As demand increases and
fish populations decline, there's ever more pressure on the squid _
what the scientists call ``Loligo pealei'' and the rest of us call
calamari.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conflict that reflects the precarious balance of ocean
life, and the state of commercial fishing around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Because of increased demand, more efficient gear, and years of
fishing with few limits, many ocean species have been overfished,
so much that some biologists fear they're in danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the biggest troubles have hit the traditional
staples, haddock and cod. As stocks have decreased and restrictions
have increased, many fishermen have turned to other species, said
Roger Hanlon, director of the Marine Resources Center at the Woods
Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. Over the last three or four
years, he said, more and more of them have been catching squid.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of losing the squid carries an even greater
risk. If scientists lose their research tools, we could be eating
our way out of a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the squid has become the third most valuable
fishery in the Northeast, accounting for $33 million in annual
sales, Hanlon said. The market, for now, is mostly overseas, but
it's growing everywhere _ as evidenced by its popularity on local
menus.
</P>
<P>
   Calamari is served at nearly every Woods Hole cafe, to
decreasingly squeamish patrons. Mark Roscoe, assistant chef at the
Landfall Restaurant, said interest in the dish is on the rise, as
long as there are no tentacles on the plate. While many Cape chefs
buy frozen squid in bags, demand for fresh and frozen catch across
the region is clearly increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is greater than ever before,'' Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of squid that fishermen catch along the East Coast is
what biologists have nicknamed the ``Woods Hole squid,'' which has
a life span of one year. The squid spends winters out at sea near
the Continental Shelf, but comes to coastal waters every summer to
spawn. It has eight tentacles called ``arms,'' a pair of uncannily
human eyes, and a large central nerve known as an axon.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies much of the squid's special value: The axon is 100
times wider than a human neuron, capable of being seen by the human
eye and studied in-depth with a powerful microscope. (It also has
the ability to live and function for six to eight hours after being
removed from the squid.)
</P>
<P>
   Discovered in the 1930s, the axon's research potential draws
hundreds of scientists to Woods Hole every summer, largely to study
the way nerve cells transmit chemicals and information. George
Langford, a biology professor at Dartmouth College, has been
studying the squid at Woods Hole since 1972. In three decades, he
said, he has seen the understanding of nerve functions grow
exponentially, particularly as scientists learn more about the
makeup of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Langford and his students are studying the way
chemicals travel along the nerve, research he hopes will soon yield
information that will eventually help Alzheimer's patients and
people with spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the squid isn't only good for its nerve. Hanlon has been
studying the squid's behavioral patterns, which he says give
insight into how birds and mammals choose their mates.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, for a squid, is a complex thing, Hanlon said. The squid
change their coloring dozens of ways to attract and repel each
other. Males alter their tactics for moving in on females,
depending on the size and strength of the competition. Females
narrow down the field of partners by waiting for males in
hard-to-reach places.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with DNA fingerprinting, Hanlon and other researchers can
measure the results of the squid pickup scene better than ever,
determining exactly which males have fertilized which eggs, and
learning which tactics are most successful _ for squid and for
other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in evolutionary terms, there's a lot of benefit to
looking at different animals,'' Hanlon said. ``The commonalities
just stare at you after awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this research demands a lot of squid. Langford said his
laboratory group, one of 25 that study the squid every summer,
dissects about 200 of the creatures every week. Overall, the Marine
Biological Laboratory goes through about 10,000 squid _ each of
which weighs less than a pound _ every season, Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing compared with the 15 million pounds of squid that
will be caught in Massachusetts waters this year, but it's an
important cache, Langford said. Scientists haven't yet perfected a
way to raise squid in a lab, he said, so Woods Hole researchers
depend on the wild variety, pulled from the water in nets and
stored in huge, cylindrical tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it a lot,'' Langford said of the squid fishing
crunch. ``If we cannot get animals for our research, then we are in
very, very big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon has been busy promoting squid conservation in recent
years, working with state and federal fisheries managers and
independent groups of fishermen to study populations and assess the
health of the stocks. The inshore summer fishery isn't his only
concern, he said; a 5-year-old winter fishery, farther out in the
North Atlantic, takes in three times as many squid each year. And
because cod and haddock like to eat squid, he said, an ample
population is key to restoring the stock of those fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the dangers to the squid probably have decreased in recent
years, because of new state and federal restrictions, said Dan
McKiernan, a biologist at the Massachusetts Division of Marine
Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, he said, the federal government
limited by half the amount of squid the offshore fleet could catch,
``a big, big thing'' by squid fishing standards.
</P>
<P>
   And about a decade ago _ sensing the kind of pressure Hanlon
fears _ the state set limits on inshore squid fishing as well.
While squid were once fair game all summer, McKiernan said, now
they can only be caught near the shore for about six weeks a year,
at the start of the spawning season.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Hanlon and his colleagues aren't proposing a
moratorium on squid-eating. ``I love calamari,'' Hanlon said, and
he has strong opinions on the best way to cook it (for maximum
tenderness, he says, cut the tube lengthwise instead of in rings.)
</P>
<P>
   And posted in Langford's laboratory is a former student's recipe
for ``squid fantastic'' _ breaded and served with a special dip
made of mayonnaise, pickles, and roasted red peppers. It's tasty
enough to make biologists put aside their worries at their picnic
each summer, Langford said.

ANTHONY LIGHTS IT UP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Latin-pop sensation Marc Anthony didn't need the Lakers victory on
Monday to kick the crowd's excitement level up a notch at the Greek
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   But when hooting erupted between songs and someone handed
Anthony a tiny TV on stage, he couldn't help but make the post-game
announcement that drew cheers: ``Reggie Miller's crying, so it
looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was icing on the cake during a perfect evening that saw the
salsa star bring a tropical heat wave to the packed outdoor venue.
Often lumped with Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, the razor-thin
Anthony seems more driven by music than media.
</P>
<P>
   A tasty orchestra, which included 17 elegantly attired musicians
and backup singers, offered a propulsive, percussion-fueled romp
through old and new material sung in English and Spanish, along
with ``stuff I probably have no business doing,'' Anthony joked
early in the set.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, born in New York's Spanish Harlem to Puerto Rican
parents, showed there were few songs he had no business doing. A
consumate showman, the singer and actor, who cut his teeth singing
backup for teen group Menudo and later performed in Bronx and
Manhattan dance clubs, was in constant motion throughout the first
of two nights at the Greek, running across the stage, leading the
band with king-fu kicks and greeting a steady procession of women
bearing roses and lingering smooches.
</P>
<P>
   However, the recently married Anthony, 31, seemed to lack a
great deal of natural charisma, even while commanding attention
with heartfelt readings of such smoldering ballads as ``Don't Let
Me Leave'' and ``De La Vuelta,'' from his self-titled second mostly
English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps he prefered to let his music speak for him, which it
did with eloquence on the moving Top 10 hit ``I Need to Know,''
which Anthony performed on the Grammys telecast earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the best moments during the warm set came when Anthony
returned to his salsa roots and allowed his superb band to work out
on extended tunes like ``De La Vuelta,'' which started slowly but
morphed into an uptempo dance number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to stand up,'' Anthony told the heavily female crowd,
which didn't need to be prompted.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Anthony, who played a dreadlocked homeless psycho in
Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' created a frenzy just
by walking out on stage.
</P>
<P>
   But when he interjected at one point, ``The Lakers won, folks,''
an exceptionally hot night got that much hotter.

A FEW INTENTIONALLY SEEK OUT HIV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They compose a tiny minority, and inhabit the fringe of the gay
community, but many of the health professionals who work with gay
men and HIV have seen or heard of a few of them.
</P>
<P>
   They are men who have moved beyond embracing unprotected
intercourse as a sexual preference to embrace HIV itself.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a generation after it was first reported, some men have
turned the virus that causes AIDS on its head, seeing in it
appealing qualities like community and kinship.
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of the burgeoning chat rooms and Web sites
devoted to the subject, they are called ``bug chasers,'' men who
deliberately try to convert their HIV status from negative to
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another whole level of distress people are carrying
around,'' said Marshall Forstein, medical director of mental health
and addiction services at Fenway Community Health Center in Boston.
``These are people who don't feel entitled to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstein knows of one man who was 65, and shunned by his family
after coming out late in life. Also isolated from the gay
community, the man fantasized about getting HIV, Forstein said,
``because suddenly, he'd have a whole world of people around him,
delivering meals to him, paying attention to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because of the role HIV has played in gay
communities since AIDS was first reported in 1981. Then, gay men
mobilized more effectively than ever before, taking charge of
prevention, and solidifying ties to each other. That brought them a
respect from the mainstream that had hitherto eluded them, from
people as diverse as President Ronald Reagan and red ribbon-wearing
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV allowed gay men a public presence and a demonstration of
intelligence and competence and management skills that they hadn't
had an opportunity to express publicly,'' said a Berkeley
psychologist, Walt Odets. ``The other more uncomfortable thing is
that gay men have gained a lot of acceptance by being sick and by
being chaste.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Valenzuela, a California activist who stopped using condoms
and eventually contracted the disease, said, ``AIDS was a great
war, and there's a great amount of courage and respect and
romanticism that surrounds soldiers in war. When I was entering the
gay community at the height (of the epidemic), I felt like I'd
joined a war. And that somehow transformed HIV into this rite of
passage as opposed to something to be reviled and avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   In postings by men who want to get, and give, HIV, the virus has
also become a means of kinship. Some Web sites and chat groups
advertise ``conversion parties'' at which an HIV negative man has
unprotected sex with several HIV positive men to ensure he
contracts the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the chat groups, the virus is framed in the language of
birth, not death: here is HIV infection as genealogy. The HIV
positive man who infects another man with the virus _ called ``the
gift'' _ is a ``father.'' Men infected by the same HIV positive man
are ``brothers.'' The moment of infection is spoken of like
impregnation: one chat group devoted solely to conversion stories
is called ``Knocked Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Infection creates ``a death to the old life and a rebirth to the
new one,'' wrote a frequent contributor to one chat group, who
calls himself GiftGiverSF, and identifies himself as an HIV
positive. ``The new life includes gaining a new Dad, many brothers,
whose genealogy will be traced and given to all who want it, an
intense bonding for life, and for death.''

NO CELL PHONE, NO SUV, NO E-TRADE . . . SURVIVE THAT! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fat and happy with the runaway success of its mid-season hit,
``Survivor,'' CBS announced last week that next season's
installment will plop a new group of 16 contestants in the
Australian outback, where they will spend 39 days whining,
conniving, and generally showing humankind at its double-crossing
best.
</P>
<P>
   Reports say the show's producers also considered the African
wilderness and the Peruvian Andes as follow-ups to the current
jaunt on an island off Borneo. There, contestants who are supposed
to work together inevitably turn on each other like mad dogs, then
vote one member off the island each week. The ``survivor'' will
pocket $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, episode three drew 23 million viewers. After
thoroughly tattooing Regis Philbin's monochromatic hide during its
first two weeks, ABC moved its once-unbeatable ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' With such enviable ratings (which have increased
each week), it's a sure bet the other networks are scrambling to
concoct their own hokey, and _ they hope _ deliciously addictive
``Lord of the Flies'' knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they'll have to tweak the formula a bit. See, while
there's something to be said about watching city folk stumbling and
bumbling about on a deserted island, killing and eating rats for
dinner (much to the chagrin of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals), or slurping down beetle larvae in yet another round of
Stupid Survivor Tricks, producers need not traipse half a world
away to find a setting for their show.
</P>
<P>
   We now have a sense of what it's like trying to inhabit a
deserted island. But it would be even more interesting watching
people trying to survive in their familiar surroundings with all
their amenities and creature comforts taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine it: Sixteen people in the big city with no credit cards,
cell phones, pagers, CD players, or computers. No access to bank
accounts. No tony apartments or houses like on MTV's ``The Real
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, make folks abandon their current jobs and work for
minumum wage _ that's $5.15 an hour. If you think people behave
badly when they have limited fresh water on an island, think of a
40-year-old investment banker stripped of his Palm Pilot and Range
Rover, reduced to donning a paper hat and name tag while trying to
survive the lunchtime crunch at the local fast food joint. Then we
could watch him waiting forever at one of those awful 24-hour
check-cashing places whose fees would eat up way too much of his
measly pay.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's entertainment!
</P>
<P>
   The show could be set in just about any sizable American city.
Contestants would have to work together in such things as dealing
with difficult landlords, and buying groceries at overpriced
convenience stores since, on minimum wage, no one could afford to
live in a neighborhood with a decent supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each show would be tailored to fit the particular
peccadilloes of each locale.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, contestants would be allowed to earn no more than
$15,000 a year. In a city where the monthly damage for a
one-bedroom apartment averages $1,600, participants could vie for a
$600 a month domicile by trying to be the first to make it from
Greenwich Village to the Bronx on a Saturday night when station
after station is closed for never-ending construction. And there
would be a special reward for anyone who survives reaching for
their wallet when surrounded by police in the foyer of their
apartment building. (This seems like the sort of thing that Fox,
after years of airing ``Cops'' and ``World's Scariest Police
Chases,'' could really pull off.)
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, contestants would have to get around the City of
Angels without cars _ an impossible task _ relying instead on the
world's most inept mass transit system. On the upside, the LA
participants wouldn't even need apartments since they would spend
all their time waiting for buses that never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, of course, contestants would have to endure just
the opposite _ they would have to drive every single day without
benefit of a street atlas. They would have to suffer the constant
slings and arrows of cranky, ticket-happy meter maids,
mind-boggling rotaries where no one ever yields, and parking
problems that grow more unwieldly each week.
</P>
<P>
   As in New York, yearly salaries could not exceed $15,000 which,
these days, couldn't even secure a park bench on the Common. In the
Big Dig portion of the competition, there could be tribal games to
see who could make the quickest trip between Ashmont and North
Station during morning rush hour with the fewest instances of horn
honking, cursing, or obscene gestures.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought watching people eat a rat last week was tough,
imagine being trapped in a car with Rudy, that annoying retired
Navy Seal, on the Central Artery. Now that would be something to
survive.

NATALIE COLE COMES BACK INTO HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natalie Cole won glory _ and Grammy awards _ for reprising
jazz-pop standards from the 1940s and 1950s heyday of her father,
Nat King Cole. For the past seven years, and through countless
orchestral concerts, Natalie has stayed faithful to that formula,
but now it's time for a change, as she rediscovers her own roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience that has stayed with me my whole career likes to
see me come up with different things,'' says Cole. ``And if they
enjoy variety, then the more the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest tour celebrates her 25th anniversary in show business
and returns to the grittier pop and R&AMP;B for which she had been
known, including a hit version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Pink
Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer does she pack her set with standards, which had been
her routine in the 1990s. She is down to just 20 minutes of
standards from ``Unforgettable,'' her Grammy-winning album.
``Frankly, I'm bored with some of that at this point,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is on my music this time,'' says Cole, 50, who
has a big year ahead. In November, she releases a ``Greatest Hits''
album. That same month her autobiography, ``Angel on My Shoulder,''
will be published and NBC-TV will produce a bio-pic based on the
book. In the film, she'll play herself as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be such a blitz that month that people will say,
`Oh, I am so sick of seeing her!' '' Cole says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, she's feeling rejuvenated. ``I didn't do my pop and
R&AMP;B stuff for 15 years for nothing. I'm really enjoying it again _
it's fun to do `Pink Cadillac' _ and I'm doing some new songs, too,
which I'm excited about. Some nights I can't wait to get through
the `Unforgettable' stuff to get on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   One new song, which will be among up to three fresh tracks added
to the ``Greatest Hits'' album, is ``Livin' for Love,'' which Cole
describes as ``a big, phat dance tune.'' She cowrote it with Denise
Rich, who wrote Mary J. Blige's duet with Aretha Franklin, ``Don't
Waste Your Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole figures the time is right for a change because so many of
her peers have done their own albums of standards, taking away some
of the luster from the genre. Carly Simon, Phil Collins, and Joni
Mitchell are just a few artists who have done so. Cole has heard
them all _ and she especially likes Mitchell's ``Both Sides Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it because Joni's voice is so different,'' says Cole.
``She's not trying to sound like Ella (Fitzgerald), and she's also
a great arranger and picks great tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, really, to see my contemporaries do that, instead
of turning to do hip-hop or something else that might not suit
them,'' she adds. ``But doing some of the old standards is not for
everybody. When Tony Bennett or Sarah Vaughan would bring a song to
you, they knew what they were singing about, and the audience knew
they knew. But as a contemporary artist, you have to be careful
that the love of the music is equal to your ability to present it.
That's not always the case.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the autobiography she's writing _ in collaboration with
Digby Diehl, who helped on Esther Williams's autobiography _ Cole
is reluctant to give away any juicy details. All she'll say is,
``Writing the book was hard. It was an experience I wouldn't put on
my worst enemy. But I wrote it as honestly as I could and it ended
up being quite therapeutic. I've had a lot of great memories, but
there are some unpleasant ones in there as well. You'll have to
read it to see.''

ONLINE TRAVEL FIRMS GAIN GROUND BUT BUMPS REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A longtime Internet shopper, Kathy Keating deftly maneuvers
through the Web's music and book stores. But her recent attempts
online to plan a six-week trip to Europe may send her running back
to her trusty travel guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a jungle out there,'' said Keating, 32, a public
relations director. ``I'm just trying to book a regular vacation
and I'm like, this is a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   As the summer travel season heats up, customers have been racing
to the Web in record numbers to bid on airline tickets, book hotel
rooms, and to rent automobiles. But shoppers are quickly
discovering that planning an entire vacation online is far more
complex and frustrating than purchasing a novel on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, for instance, says she has been unable to find a
comprehensive Web site that offers her the lowest airfares, the
best hotels, and detailed maps. In recent weeks, she has grown
irritated by the number of sites that require passwords, which she
sometimes forgets.
</P>
<P>
   She likes the idea of booking unique lodging online, but she
doesn't quite trust Web sites to weed out hotels and inns with
leaky roofs, seedy neighborhoods, and ill-tempered innkeepers.
``I'm like, `Who are these people?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Web travel sites have made great
strides in recent years. Indeed, Internet agencies have grabbed
enough customers to hurt some traditional travel agents. By 2004,
online leisure travel purchases are expected to balloon to $32
billion, or 12 percent of the industry, from $7.8 billion last
year, according to Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the giants, Expedia.com and Travelocity.com, are molding
themselves into powerful, full-service travel agencies, offering
consumers an array of tools to compare airfares, hotel prices, and
car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   At Expedia.com, customers can book a castle in Umbria, Italy,
for $6,000 a week. Like Priceline.com, another popular site,
Expedia.com allows its customers to bid on airline tickets.
Travelocity.com's strengths are in its hotel offerings, which
include maps, a bed-and-breakfast directory, and a place where
customers can rant and rave about hotels (and they do).
</P>
<P>
   But consumers and industry observers say the online travel
business still has a long way to go before it lives up to promises
of providing busy vacation planners with the lowest prices, the
best customer service, and a one-stop shopping experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have bits and pieces right now,'' said Terry Trippler, a
consumer advocate who writes for 1Travel.com. ``They have to prove
themselves. Next summer is the time that you'd better have your act
together _ or you're going to be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, most travel consumers on the Web are browsers, not
buyers. Less than 5 percent of new visitors to travel sites end up
booking a trip or flight. By comparison, Internet retailers like
Amazon.com, Pets.com and Sears.com bring more than 10 percent of
surfers to the cash registers, according to May figures from PC
Data, a technology research firm in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Travel site executives say the gap is natural and reflects the
graduation of consumers from simple purchases of books and compact
disks to more complicated and expensive transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken a while to really have a meaningful percentage of
people (buying travel online),'' said Richard Barton, chief
executive of Expedia Inc. ``People had to get comfortable with
using the service before hitting the buy button. They had to
believe the service was capable and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Susana Lopez, an advertising consultant in Brookline, has become
a convert. She has used the Web to help book trips to New Orleans
and London with her husband and two children. She's now perusing
travel sites to plan a family skiing trip to Chile in August.
</P>
<P>
   The sites give her the freedom to research smaller towns and
make arrangements from her desk in the wee hours. Travel agents,
she said, can't help her unless they specialize in the kind of
off-the-beaten-track travel she prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (travel sites) have made great advances in five
years,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ed Boudrot, a product manager for an Internet firm,
decided to book a last-minute and much-needed trip to Bermuda from
Travelocity.com. He said he and his wife had been under enormous
stress and had not had the time to plan a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lot of confidence in it, to tell you the
truth,'' Boudrot said. ``At that point, it was like rolling the
dice. I kind of put my trust in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, he said, was mediocre. And he said he probably could
have found a better vacation package if he had had the time to do
extensive research. But in the end, Boudrot said he was pleased.
``Overall, it solved our problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other customers aren't as pleased with the state of online
travel sites. Numerous sites have sprung up, offering cluttered and
sometimes glitchy Web pages. Shoppers also complain about Internet
sites that refuse to answer e-mails or pick up their phones _ even
during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites have tried to win customers' trust by offering
ratings and reviews of lodging and restaurants. But some consumers
aren't convinced that Web sites are as diligent as travel guides
such as Fodor's and Frommer's.
</P>
<P>
   Those suspicions aren't far off the mark. Expedia.com, for
instance, ``screens'' customer reviews of hotels listed on its
Vacationspot.com site. Although it claims to edit only the comments
that don't appear credible, you'll have to search long and hard
before you find any reviews that don't contain words like
``fabulous,'' ``beautiful,'' and ``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating experiences online have a few customers racing back
to the bookstores for travel books. Still other online shoppers are
knocking on the doors of their old travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kutrubes Travel Agency in downtown Boston, owner Kathy
Kutrubes says a woman recently called for help after a Web site
refused to refund her airline ticket. ``She said she would never do
it again,'' said Kutrubes.
</P>
<P>
   A desperate family called Village Tours &AMP; Travel after
discovering that they had booked a flight for the wrong month,
thanks to an online typo. They had showed up at the airport, but
had no ride. ``It was ugly,'' said Deb Carr, owner of Village
Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Carr says that online travel sites don't always provide the
lowest airfares or best lodging. An experienced travel agent, she
said, knows when the airlines are cutting prices _ and how to sniff
out reliable and unique hotels around the world. That's why she
doesn't mind when her clients flirt with the e-travel sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some go to e-commerce,'' Carr said. ``But they end up coming
back.''

   Seventy percent.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, that's how many start-up companies,
fueled by the technology-investing fervor of the late 1990s, are
likely to fail. And when they do fail, they could leave a costly
trail of wreckage behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those young companies are billions of dollars in venture
capital. This once-mysterious realm has become as pervasive as real
estate speculation in the 1980s, and its failures will be felt
across a broad swath of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of dollars pouring into venture poses risks
that economists are only beginning to ponder. And the Federal
Reserve is taking notice, proposing tighter limits on how much
banks can bet on the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are just one stream in the raging river of cash out there.
Among those inking deals and fattening the coffers of venture firms
are corporations, pension funds, insurers, mutual funds, and
wealthy individuals _ all of them hungry for big returns, few of
them experienced in this highly risky corner of the investment
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the invisible hand of capitalism at work,'' said
Oliver Curme, a general partner with Battery Ventures in Wellesley,
Mass. ``That's the drunken hand of capitalism wasting money. And
it's wasting money on a scale comparable to the S&AMP;L crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists injected $48.34 billion into 3,649 companies
from Boston to Silicon Valley last year, a 152 percent jump from
1998, according to Venture Economics in Boston. Meanwhile, firms
raked in new venture money at the same clip, reaping a record
$46.55 billion from investors eager to join the party. That's 67
percent more than they raised in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Curme, a former banker, and other seasoned venture capitalists
worry that too much money in the hands of inexperienced investors
will translate to scores of bad deals. With every collapsed Web
company will come layoffs, broken leases, and a string of lawyers,
advertising firms, and other service firms left in the lurch,
sometimes holding worthless stock options they accepted instead of
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The collapses have already started to come in e-commerce, and
industry watchers expect scores more. Historically, only three in
10 start-ups has made it, and no one from Wall Street to the Web
research houses expects the new economy to change that.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how much damage a slew of failures could inflict
on the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
   There's about $100 billion in venture money sloshing around the
market, half of that waiting to be invested. That's a lot of cash
to wash over the economy in a brief period. Mark Zandi, chief
economist at RFA/Dismal Sciences of West Chester, Pa., calls the
phenomenon ``quite dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   In relative terms, it's far less than, say, the $5.2 trillion
market value of the stocks listed on Nasdaq, or the $1 trillion
managed by mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments. But it's in the
ballpark with the big run-up in commercial lending by thrifts from
1982 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Zandi said, venture firms don't carry the kind of
central role in the economy that thrifts did. But the venture shops
clearly have played a huge role in propelling the new economy, he
said. Any mass failure of companies they've backed could cause
ripple effects in the economy _ especially in New England, where
there's a heavy concentration of venture firms and the high-tech
companies they finance.
</P>
<P>
   Consider an example of how venture has worked its way into the
fabric of the economy. In one of the last patches of decay in
Boston's South End, a developer is turning old mills into chic
rental space. There's exposed brick, original wood beams, high
ceilings, and sunlight streaming through sparkling new windows.
</P>
<P>
   Digs that only artists and students would have called home a
decade ago are being wired for work stations and Internet
connections. Young entrepreneurs are clamoring for such space. And
in a recent bidding war for 25,000 square feet in this emerging
high-tech SoWa district, the winner was TechSpace, a venture
capital-backed real estate firm that caters to Web start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   TechSpace's business _ which started in New York and is
expanding to other cities _ depends on the continued health of the
venture business. The same is true for the start-ups that move into
the building _ and for GTI Properties, the developer.
</P>
<P>
   People enmeshed in the tech world remain optimistic. Said Read
Coughlin, a former real estate broker who's building up TechSpace
in Boston: ``I can see the real estate market slowing down. I can
see the stock market slowing down. But I don't see technology
slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do evangelists like Howard Anderson, a founder of
Battery Ventures, the Yankee Group, and the YankeeTek Incubator.
But even the true believers see excess in this market. Anderson
predicted recently: ``You're going to see some abject failures in
venture capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is clearly waking up to the venture frenzy
and zeroing in on the banks it regulates. The Fed is proposing that
banks set aside 50 cents of reserves for every dollar of venture
capital they invest, vs. a modest 4 cents today. The idea is to
create a bigger cushion against losses.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also wants to impose a cap of $6 billion on
private equity activities by banks, or 30 percent of a bank's Tier
1 Capital, whichever is less. For FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s
venture group, the nation's number two bank-owned venture group,
behind Chase Manhattan, that would mean a cap of about $4 billion _
not far above the size of its current $3.3 billion portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers are objecting strenuously to the limits.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a US Senate panel Tuesday, Rick Fritz, chief
of Fleet's main venture group, BancBoston Capital, said the unit
had been profitable in all of its 41 years of business. Some
investments have been losers, Fritz said, but the portfolio as a
whole has always made money.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston vice chairman and chief financial officer Eugene
McQuade said in an interview that there should be leeway for
longtime players like BancBoston. To let bigger but less
sophisticated groups amass bigger portfolios, he said: ``We think,
from a risk standpoint, doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed governor Laurence Meyer, testifying before Congress last
week, praised venture capitalists for helping propel the new
economy. But he warned that the easy gains made in taking companies
public in recent years could dry up.
</P>
<P>
   The bull stock market has delivered more ``home runs'' on IPOs
in recent years than is typical, Meyer said, making up for any
losing bets in spades. In a less hospitable market, he said,
``Small declines in asset values would eliminate large proportions
of (banks') small equity base.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has $187 billion of assets, and Tier 1 capital of about
$13 billion, so even a total wipeout in its venture activities
would take no more than a 15 percent bite out of its capital base,
McQuade said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks account for only a sliver of all venture deals. What
economists don't know _ and won't for some time _ is what havoc
venture investors are wreaking far away from the Fed's watchful
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Battery's Curme offers a grim forecast. ``Most of what's been
funded over the past three years will go belly-up, or it will get
merged,'' he said. ``It'll be very, very ugly. But people won't see
it for another 18 months.''

TRAVEL WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel agents can barely conceal their contempt for online
travel sites, which continue to swipe more of their sales. And even
among the virtual travel players, few pleasantries are traded.
</P>
<P>
   But both online and offline travel firms have united now that
they've discovered a common and more formidable foe in their back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   The new enemy is Orbitz.com, an upcoming online site backed by
five major US airlines. Debuting later this summer with $100
million in funding, it is expected to be a dominant force, offering
Web shoppers everything from airline tickets to cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The looming threat has travel agents and their online
counterparts complaining to politicians and federal regulators.
Last week, an Internet travel trade organization that includes
Travelocity.com and Expedia.com accused the airlines of creating an
``Internet travel cartel.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual and traditional travel agents fear the airlines will use
Orbitz.com to offer steep discounts to consumers, only to raise
rates once the competition has been clobbered. If this sounds
familiar, it's because American Airlines was sued last year by the
Department of Justice for allegedly battering discount carriers
with predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concerted effort to change what e-commerce is all
about: openness, freedom, and competition,'' said Ed Rothschild,
spokesman for the Interactive Travel Services Association, which
represents the dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Orbitz.com officials have defended the site, saying it will
behave without bias. But the Department of Justice is now reviewing
the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time federal watchdogs have taken note of
giant industry alliances on the Web. The Federal Trade Commission
has been looking into a new Internet marketplace developed by the
Big Three automakers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers could forfeit up to $19 billion in revenue this
year if they fail to improve the online shopping experience,
according to a recently released report.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, some sites have become less customer
friendly, said Phil Terry, chief executive of Creative Good, a New
York consulting firm that published the report.
</P>
<P>
   The problems? E-commerce sites have gotten carried away with
fancy features, failed to adequately staff call centers, and, in
some cases, lost their focus by rushing into new markets, Terry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry remains confounded by the number of e-commerce sites that
appear to pay more attention to their investors than their
shoppers. As evidence, he cites the increasing number of e-commerce
sites that require customers to remember passwords to enter their
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Although Web sites claim passwords help them protect and better
serve customers, Terry says the requirements may backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine going to a store and having a security guard stop you,
saying, `Before you pay, you have to say the secret word,' '' he
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, customers surveyed by Gomez Advisors said they
had the most confidence in eToys Inc., compared to other online toy
stores. Their next-best picks were other Internet-only retailers
such as SmarterKids.com and Toysmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing behind the virtual stores were toysrus.com,
wal-mart.com, and other sites backed by traditional retailers. Last
Christmas, these sites angered customers with poor inventory
controls and late deliveries, among other problems.
</P>
<P>
   But virtual retailers that pride themselves on well-designed
sites and reliable deliveries are learning a harsh lesson: Deep
pockets are just as important as good customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com collapsed last month after its major investor, Walt
Disney Co., pulled its support. Shares of SmarterKids.com, a
publicly held company known for in-depth educational offerings,
have taken a nosedive. Even eToys, once a rising e-commerce star,
is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, eToys announced that it had raised $100 million from
a group of investors led by Promethean Asset Management. But it
turns out that the terms of this deal were less favorable than
previous financings.

<P>
   The end of an era, it is said. And good riddance to it, if true.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad's 30-year dictatorship is honored for giving Syria
stability after years of political chaos. But it was stability of a
kind that most countries would gladly be without: an equilibrium
enforced by a coercive regime with the help of a dozen intelligence
agencies, which deprived people of free speech and led the economy
into a statist dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, once in the van of Arab intellectual life, deserve
better.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bashar Assad, the son-of-dictator-about-to-be-president,
belong to the evanescent twilight of the old era, or does he usher
in a more enlightened one? Can he perhaps be helped to move from
one to the other?
</P>
<P>
   He seems decent enough: modest, intelligent, reform-minded. In
his brief apprenticeship, cut short by his father's death, before
taking his place in the Arab world's bizarre system of republican
dynasties, he set about modernizing Syria's antique economy,
introducing innovations such as mobile telephones and access to the
Internet, which had previously been considered too dangerous to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his open-mindedness extends to politics is still
unclear. But there is at least a chance that Syria's new president,
like Morocco's new king, will, after a respectful pause, try to
drag his country free from a father's leaden legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for Bashar Assad to have made his opinions known
on foreign policy. His exposure to western ways, during his
training in Britain as an ophthalmologist, may make him an easier
man for outsiders to deal with than was his unbending father.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will be mistaken, however, if they believe that the
son, any more than the father, will yield on the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israelis, whose public comments
have been less respectful of the dead Assad than most outsiders'
carefully phrased official epitaphs, seem divided on the timing of
their next approach.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis believe that the new Syrian regime must show
itself to have a fair-to-good chance of survival before there can
be any renewal of peace-seeking. And this, they wager, could take
months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   An indefinite postponement is less worrying to Ehud Barak than
it would have been in his first months as Israel's prime minister,
when peace with Syria was his foreign-policy priority. But the
Syrian exchanges came to a rough halt and, with Israel's soldiers
safely out of Lebanon, the need is now less pressing.
</P>
<P>
   It was always known that it would be a struggle to get a Syrian
deal approved by a referendum in Israel, but now, with an
increasingly uncertain majority, Barak faces a struggle in
parliament too. This inhibits all peacemaking, including Barak's
ploy of playing the Syrians against the Palestinians and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, waiting for Syria to settle down will suit many
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way of looking at things. If Bashar Assad is
truly a reformer, bent on making his country a freer, more
forward-looking place, he needs help.
</P>
<P>
   A deal in which he completed his father's quest to win back the
Golan Heights would help remarkably. The agreement collapsed
because the Syrians insisted on getting the whole region back and
the Israelis insisted on retaining control of the Sea of Galilee's
shoreline. Both sides were stubborn, and emotional too.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever an issue called for some creative formulaic
solution, probably with an international ingredient, to save Syrian
honor while calming Israel's fears about its water, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Assad may well have been hoping for something along
those lines when he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had their
disastrous meeting in Geneva in March. After that meeting, it is
more difficult to get things right, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bashar Assad has been crowned president (sorry, for that
should read: once the Syrian parliament has approved Assad's
nomination, and the Syrian people have accepted or rejected him,
and the results have been made known by the end of July), the
Syrian-Israeli peace track could be replayed _ but with a more
imaginative ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, who were put off by the unsmiling countenance of
Assad senior, should be able to expect a warmer face from the son.
And the Syrians, who will be on the lookout for signs of Bashar's
weakness, will have to be assured that the entire Golan Heights
will, at least in stages, become theirs once more.
</P>
<P>
   What has Barak to gain from embarking on a new formula-seeking
initiative? As Bashar Assad himself observed, in a rare interview
with a Saudi-owned newspaper shortly before his father died,
Israel's prime minister is in a weak position at home to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole region, Israel included, stands to gain if
Syria can move out of the darkness that has eclipsed it for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has inherited the presidency but may not be able to
keep it. His legitimacy is, at best, dubious. A second son, plucked
from his chosen career when his playboy elder brother was killed in
1994, he is inadequately groomed for the job, his support network
not yet in place. He belongs to a minority sect, resented by the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt old guard could oust him. But if it turns out that
he has indeed set his face in the direction of reform _ the
evidence as yet is slight _ outsiders have a strong interest in
encouraging him.
</P>
<P>
   Success could mean not only an Israeli-Syrian peace, but the
re-emergence of a Syria that was stable, and not because of fear. &QL;

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES FOR E-COMMERCE STARTUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, at the height of the b-to-c craze,
JuniorNet.com _ an online service for kids _ was reveling in its
good fortune. The Boston-based start-up had just landed $70 million
in venture financing, in the biggest early-stage deal Boston has
seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Alan Rothenberg told the Globe then that he'd left piles
of money on the table. He only wanted $20 million, he said, but he
got offers as high as $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   JuniorNet.com has fallen on hard times since then. The company's
lead investor, RCN Corp., the Princeton, N.J., telecom and cable
giant, has installed two new executives to run the company.
Rothenberg has been ushered to a nonexecutive board seat. A slew of
top executives has left the company, and money is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Yetming, one of the new co-CEOs at JuniorNet.com, says:
``Whenever there's a shift in strategy, you're going to have some
fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift is significant. JuniorNet.com started as an ad-free
access point to games, educational tools, and interactive stories
from the likes of ``Ranger Rick'' and ``Bear in the Big Blue
House.'' It touted itself as a kind of America Online for kids. And
it charged a $9.95 monthly subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a warning against Peter Lynch-style investing when it
comes to venture capital. RCN president David McCourt said he
decided to invest when he couldn't drag his 8-year-old son away
from the Junior.net service. Three other venture firms
participated, including Boston Capital Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Yetming says the company is now retooling itself as a ``new
media'' play. RCN appears to be trying to ride the convergence
wave, where television and Web services meet.
</P>
<P>
   JuniorNet.com owns a TV production company, Lancit Media, which
it bought from RCN for $25 million as part of last year's deal.
Lancit has developed two PBS television series for children
(``Reading Rainbow'' and ``The Puzzle Place'') and RCN wants to see
more money spent to develop TV programs with links to the Web
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to spend a lot of money developing our own
television show, JuniorNet TV,'' Yetming says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's blind spot may be that it fancies itself different
from the others out there vying for kiddie viewing time, because of
its education bent. But there's Disney, Nickelodeon and FoxKids.com
to contend with, just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``JuniorNet provides enlightenment,'' suggests Cecily Truett,
co-president of Lancit. But, she concedes, ``We know, as realists,
we compete with folks like Disney.''

   Like other consumer Web companies, JuniorNet.com will be more
carefully watching its money, Yetming says. He's scrapped a costly
and ineffective direct mail campaign, he says. And a search is
afoot for additional financing. Last August, Rothenberg told the
Globe he was looking for another $50 million, and he planned to
spend heavily on advertising. There has been no formal round of
financing to date, only bridge loans.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the only sob story in Web land, of course. A Wayne,
Pa., Internet media company, put out a press release this week that
blared, ``4Anything.com secures $11 million in funding, reduces
workforce by 33 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the turmoil continues at beleaguered Furniture.com in
Framingham, Mass. On Monday, employees received a rare note of
encouragement from the boss, chief executive Andrew Brooks, urging
them to hang in there.
</P>
<P>
   But by week's end, more senior execs had marched out the door of
the online furniture seller. The departures included Mike Sudik,
senior vice president of operations, as well as the company's vice
president of engineering and its chief of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is, well, not exactly sunny at the company, which had
filed plans to go public in January but canceled them after Nasdaq
cratered in March. The company fired about 30 people in a
mind-numbingly nasty way (go to your desks and wait for the phone
to ring) and has since seen a parade of guys in suits stopping by.
For one recent visit by financial types, a source says, managers
had customer service people sit in the tech quarters, to beef up
the thinning ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com's early investors, CMGI's (at)Ventures and
Bessemer Venture Partners, reportedly took a pass in the ``cram
down,'' or declined the chance to dump more money into the company.
</P>
<P>
   While rumors swirled Friday that the company's financial
situation was dire, people familiar with the efforts to raise money
said Furniture.com had managed to land about $20 million _ half the
amount it was seeking _ part of which will go toward a new venture.
</P>
<P>
   These are ugly days for e-commerce.

   BRITAIN-WORCESTERSHIRE (Worcester, England) _ In
English-speaking countries and many others, Lea &AMP; Perrins
Worcestershire Sauce is as ubiquitous as taxes. Lea &AMP; Perrins
Worcestershire was first formulated in 1835, and it has been
manufactured since 1897 in a handsome red-brick Victorian factory
on Midland Road in Worcester, a mile from the city's fine medieval
cathedral and 125 miles northwest of London. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   CAFE-NICHOLSON (New York) _ In a New York restaurant scene

</P>
<P>
   HARRIOTT-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Tackling the recipes in
``Ainsley Harriott's Meals in Minutes'' (Dorling Kindersley,
$19.95) calls for energy, concentration and dexterity. It often
means doing two, three or even four things at the same time.
Harriott, who has one television program in Britain and another
filmed in New York and shown in the United States, is a chef in
high gear, enlisting audience and celebrity assistants to work on
salads, whip up a marinade, sear chicken and somehow assemble a
dish while keeping up a steady, energetic patter. By Florence
Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   SEA-BEANS (Undated) )_ They go by so many names they would seem
to be as common as corn: sea beans, sea asparagus, samphire,
salicornia, pousse-pied, glasswort. Until recently, though, these
salty little vegetables were just an oddity turning up once a year
or so between the pea shoots and the cipolline onions in high-end
produce markets. Now, thanks to new farming techniques, fresh sea
beans are becoming more abundant and available. And they are more
than a novelty. By Melissa Clark.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Once again the Supreme Court has
fulfilled its role as guardian of last resort of our constitutional
rights. By ruling that school-sanctioned organized prayer at
football games violates the principle of separation of church and
state, the high bench protected religious minorities from the
public promotion of a specific religion. Gov. George W. Bush,
pandering to the religious right, was disingenuous to claim the
ruling means students cannot pray. Of course they can, but they
can't impose their prayer on others. By MARIANNE MEANS.

<P>
   They met, they chatted, they may meet again soon. This week's
summit dispelled some of the personal chilliness between South
Korea's Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il. It made less of
an impression on the deep-frozen hostility that still divides the
two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years spent formally at war, they will have to make up
the rules of re-engagement as they go along, and cautiously. But
for South Koreans _ North Koreans are not at liberty to say _ the
summit has rekindled hope that divided families will be reunited
and that someday, somehow, preferably step-by-step and peacefully,
Korea will be too.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of being leaned on by bigger neighbors, and
decades of being carved up between them, North and South Korea now
have a chance to regain some control over their joint destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that these days the outsiders that matter, America,
Japan, China and Russia, all agree that the Cold War between the
two has lingered dangerously long into the post-Cold-War era.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a measure of peace and predictability on the Korean
peninsula would remove one of the chief threats to East Asia's
stability. Yet even if the ice between North and South Korea really
does start to shift, there could still be some dangerous moments
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the problems the two will face even if
they are sincerely bent on reconciliation. They understand little
of each other's ways.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is a developed, open-market, open-minded success. By
contrast, North Korea's Stalinist tendencies, combined with the
wacky juche (self-reliance) dogma of its leaders, have stranded it
on the wrong side of history. It is an impoverished, feudal place,
unable to feed its people, surviving off the charity of China and
handouts from America, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea long ago lost the battle of ideas with South Korea.
Yet, as the North has tottered closer to collapse, South Korea's
leaders have prudently set aside demands for early reunification,
offering instead to help repair North Korea's shattered economy.
This, they hope, will make eventual union a more manageable
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Kim won his welcome in Pyongyang this week with
offers of investment and promises of big infrastructure projects.
North Korea can use all this sort of help it can get, and South
Korea is the only country offering it.
</P>
<P>
   So will North Korea grasp the South's helping hand? Despite this
week's smiles for the cameras, the northern Kim's intentions are
still unknown. He talks the language of reunification, but his
overriding aim is to keep himself and his cronies in power.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulty is that survival by means of good old-fashioned
repression is getting harder in a world where even the remaining
Marxists find they cannot insulate themselves from some of the
dictates of the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, on a surprise visit to China, he hinted that he
was toying with Chinese-style economic reforms at home.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea desperately needs a shakeup. Yet even a little
reform and opening up to affluent and democratic South Korea could
just as easily spell the end of the North's discredited regime.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea needs to proceed cautiously too. North Korea may not
want to run the risks of real reconciliation. It may simply want to
extract what economic concessions it can _ like the 200,000 tons of
fertilizer South Korea promised just before the summit _ and then
resume hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   If so, there would be little point in South Korea building roads
and bridges in the North only to see them used to ferry more tanks
and troops to their dangerously over-armed border.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be ruled out. North Korea is by now adept at
provoking crises and then demanding a payoff for defusing them
again.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them are in fact fully defused, certainly not the big one
relating to the North's nuclear ambitions, still less the newer one
caused by its testing of a long-range rocket over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And even if North Korea is preparing to take a gamble on reform,
periodic upsets in relations _ whether calculated or miscalculated
in Pyongyang _ are probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   All the more so if, in the effort to keep North Korea talking,
South Korea lets tensions emerge with its two chief allies, America
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, North Korea has played these three off against each
other. By closing ranks in the past two years, they have helped
push North Korea to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Korea's capital, Seoul, is already in range of the
thousands of short-range rockets just over the border, so its Kim
is less worried where North Korea's new, longer-range missiles
might fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has the other Kim's attention, he would rather talk
about trade and family contacts, not the nuclear and missile
worries of his allies. But giving cash to North Korea without
making clear the consequences of its going too far will only
encourage more brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia, after years of shrugging their shoulders and
mostly leaving the crises between the Koreas for America to manage
alone, are now also keen to get in on the diplomatic act. They
could be of help.
</P>
<P>
   If North Korea really is ready to open up a bit to the South,
even the perversely self-reliant Kim will at times need China to
hold his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Keen not to be outdone, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has
invited himself to Pyongyang next month. Both have lately been
encouraging North Korea out of its bunker. But both also have their
differences with America, most recently over its plans for limited
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   They will now be tempted to use the opening between the Koreas
to pursue their rivalry with America for influence in the region.
That would be folly. Even without Chinese or Russian cover, North
Korea needs little encouragement to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, its missile test two years ago is what prompted America
to pursue the missile defenses that so offend China and Russia. Yet
if he thinks they are keen to tweak America's nose, the northern
Kim may miscalculate he can get away with a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mishandled, there is still plenty of danger on the Korean
peninsula to damage everyone's security. &QL;

`FAST EDDIE,' THE MAN WHO LIT A FIRE UNDER SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SANTA CLARA, CALIF. _ THEY CALL HIM fast Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Inc., thinks
it's because he's from Brooklyn, even though he spent a big chunk
of his life in the Boston area working for Raytheon Corp., Data
General Corp., and Apollo Computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says I sleep fast,'' Zander said in an interview last
week. ``I'm from New York, so I'm New York fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Greek and Polish immigrants, Zander has the hustle of
a street kid spoiling for a good fight. Last week, he took aim at
EMC Corp., the reigning heavyweight champion of the computer
storage industry, by rolling out products to compete head-to-head
with the Hopkinton company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is here,'' Zander said, and with a mischievous
smile added: ``So don't upgrade your houses in Hopkinton yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Zander. Feisty, fast, and no-nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities led Sun's chief executive, Scott McNealy, to
spend six years recruiting Zander from Apollo, a competitor to Sun
during the 1980s. (Apollo was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co. in 1989.)
In 1987, Zander relented and moved to join what he then called the
``West Coast crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good move, for both Zander and Sun, which became the
dominant supplier of workstations and computer servers. Since 1995,
Sun's market valuation zoomed from $9 billion to $146 billion last
week. Executives within Sun and company watchers credit Zander for
much of that success.
</P>
<P>
   Zander, 53, thinks Sun's ability to thrive is related to its
willingness to reinvent itself at times when the company was at the
top of its game. When Sun's workstation business boomed, the
company went after the server market. Now that Sun servers are the
industry standard, it's going after the Internet and preparing to
push out an array of products and services for e-commerce
companies, from storage devices to Web consulting. It was Zander
who came up with the slogan: ``We're the dot in dot-com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big project to rip up the guts of Sun and `dot-com'
our company.'' Zander said. ``Usually you look at the height of
success for the birth of a new paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Resting on laurels is something Zander learned to avoid while in
Boston. After graduating with a bachelor's in engineering from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, Zander moved to
Massachusetts to work as an engineer for Raytheon. In 1972, he went
to Data General and earned his master's in business administration
from Boston University. It was then that Zander discovered he had a
talent for marketing. After witnessing the decline of the
minicomputer, he joined Apollo in 1982 as head of marketing, and
left Boston in 1987 to join Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Zander, a sports fanatic, still has a fondness for Boston, where
he met his wife, Mona, and where his two sons were born. ``The
trouble out here,'' Zander continued, ``is that these San Francisco
people always win. Then they go out and have their white wine and
tofu, and they go surf. They don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zander comes back to Boston frequently now because Sun has
designated Massachusetts and Colorado as its hubs outside of the
company's headquarters in Palo Alto. The company has 2,000
employees in Burlington and Chelmsford, Mass. In May, Sun embarked
on a project to add 300,000 square feet of office space to its
existing 540,000 square feet in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Silicon Valley was seen as the center of the
technology universe, but the Internet has changed that, Zander
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has had a leveling effect on business culture,''
Zander said. ``It's become so homogeneous that you can start an
Internet company anywhere now. Sure, Silicon Valley has more
service providers, more incubators, more venture capital, more
entrepreneurs. But I just think Boston is back, back big time.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   So Tony Blair is mortal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months Britain's prime minister has suffered a
series of reverses. His party was defeated in the local elections
and humiliated in the London mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   An innocuous if incompetent speech by Blair to the Women's
Institute was heckled and slow-handclapped. The Tories under
William Hague have found their voice and closed to within three
points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Blair entered 10 Downing Street, it is
imaginable that Labour could actually lose the next election.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects Blair commands sympathy. His overall record is
creditable _ particularly on the economy. He showed courage over
Northern Ireland and Kosovo. Some of his domestic reforms,
especially his efforts to raise standards in schools, are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a certain justice in the difficulties New Labour
has encountered. The party based its appeal on wildly overblown
political rhetoric. Its problems are rooted in a growing public
realization of the gap between all that talk and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Blairite hyperbole has taken a variety of forms. During the 1997
election, New Labour lamented 18 ``wasted'' years of Tory
government and bewailed ``savage cuts'' in public services.
</P>
<P>
   In power, Blair has continued to indulge his taste for
evangelical, transformational exuberance _ promising to
``modernize'' all he sees, to make Britain the envy of the world
and a ``model country for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also made some specific rash promises _ to end waiting
lists in the National Health Service and eradicate child poverty,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Labour's electoral pitch was always contradictory. Blair managed
simultaneously to denounce the legacy of the Tories, and to assure
the electorate that he would preserve its most important features:
low taxes, light regulation, privatization.
</P>
<P>
   In government the chasm between all the talk of revolutionary
change and the reality of moderate continuity has begun to dawn on
people and wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour has been genuinely radical in reforming the
constitution. But the party's key promise was that it would revive
Britain's public services _ health and education, especially. Blair
argued that voting for Labour was a matter of ``saving'' the NHS.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour pressed home the idea that spending on the health
service had been cut under the Tories, and that money had been
wasted by the creation of an internal NHS market.
</P>
<P>
   All this was thoroughly disingenuous. Health spending under the
Tories had consistently risen in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   In power New Labour said it was dismantling the internal market;
in fact it has preserved, and arguably extended, its crucial
feature _ the split between purchasers and providers of health
services.
</P>
<P>
   For all his avowed radicalism, Blair's record on public services
is essentially one of pragmatic, well-intentioned conservatism.
While he is in thrall to ``modernization,'' he seems to have no
interest in reforming the fundamental structures of key state-run
institutions like the NHS or the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Truly radical ideas _ like expanding the role of the private
sector in the provision of health, or introducing education
vouchers _ remain firmly off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's approach is to try to make existing institutions work
better by increasing public spending and taxation, and by
tightening central control in the name of spreading ``best
practice.'' This is a perfectly respectable way of trying to deal
with issues like health and education, though one that is likely in
the end to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate difficulty for Blair is that he appeared to be
promising so much more than a program of cautious, tax-raising
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now he still feels driven to dress his policies up in
grand-sounding, ``deeply personal'' and embarrassingly half-baked
political philosophy: the ``third way'' (yawn) and all that.
</P>
<P>
   If British voters are beginning to tire of this blather, he
should not be surprised: they have done well to put up with it this
long. &QL;

NCR IS TAKING ATMS TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all of the blessings of life in America today, it seems
almost a churlish complaint. But many people would agree it's a
hassle to have to fill out and seal an envelope when you want to
deposit a check in an automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   In what may become the wave of the future for ATMs, however,
financial giant Fidelity Investments has begun rolling out new
machines at seven US sites that let you put an endorsed check
straight into a slot.
</P>
<P>
   Out pops a receipt with a little picture of the check you
deposited, something to give you a little peace of mind (and proof
of deposit) when you entrust your holiday bonus check to a faceless
machine.
</P>
<P>
   While the no-envelope deposit system and image-containing
receipts have attracted some enthusiasm, it is only one of dozens
of possibilities for the machine, which is made by NCR Corp. of
Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Fidelity representatives hope to use the machine's
personal computer-based, Internet-connected system to allow people
to do walk-in stock trades and get a printed receipt, or have
research reports printed out, or move money around in their
accounts by using the screen and keyboard, or check stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   By slipping in a module, Fidelity eventually could use the
machine to dispense cash, ski lift tickets, or stamps as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really just a huge amount of intelligence in here that
you won't find in a bank machine,'' said J. Peter Benzie,
Fidelity's executive vice president for ``high net worth''
customers. ``And the machine is really only now doing 10 percent of
what it could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit is a money-saver for Fidelity, which according to NCR
is the first US company using the machines in daily customer
service. And it frees representatives from the drudge work of
processing paper transactions to advise people on buying mutual
funds or opening a brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   What takes 12 steps to do manually _ take an endorsed check,
time-stamp the receipt, and send the check on its way to the bank
clearinghouse _ takes only six steps with the machine.
</P>
<P>
   If only 20 percent of people coming to a branch to deposit a
check use it, a target that has been easily exceeded in some
branches, the machines should cover their low-five-figure cost in
10 months.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity executives rave about the machine, however, a
spokesman for Massachusetts' biggest bank, FleetBoston Financial,
said officials there are a little more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to NCR about this technology, but we have felt
that it's not quite up to par as far as our banking needs and it is
still developing,'' said Fleet spokesman Bruce Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback Fleet officials see is that people depositing
several checks at once would have to enter separate information for
each one and feed them in one at a time, a big hassle for, say, a
store owner or landlord depositing 20 checks on a Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting the system to handle envelopes as well as individual
checks, or a stack of checks without an envelope, however, appears
to be little more than a matter of adding a different module and
tweaked software to the box. If NCR can accommodate people with
multiple checks, Spitzer said, ``We will consider it.''

<P>
   Few things, you might think, are as enduring as a national stock
exchange. From pillared entrance to pulsating floor, they display
an institutional solidity that can surely defy forces for change.
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of the world's bourses are now in turmoil, as they
scrabble to be seen making alliances or mergers, to fend off
electronic competitors, or simply to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York, the biggest of the lot, is worried; while London,
the biggest in Europe, seems to lurch from one misstep to another.
</P>
<P>
   Two outside forces have come together to create all this
turmoil. The first is electronic. The growing power of the computer
and the spread of the Internet have made share-dealing easier and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been increased pressure on intermediaries,
whether stockbrokers or exchanges, to cut their costs. Another has
been the arrival of competition for organized stock exchanges in
the shape of entirely new electronic markets.
</P>
<P>
   The second force is a growing desire on the part of investors,
companies and investment banks to move beyond national borders for
trading shares and raising capital _ and to do it more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   This is expressed most strongly in Europe, where the arrival of
the euro has made the notion of running separate national stock
exchanges seem increasingly pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger goal is global: to move towards a 24-hour market
for blue-chip shares in the world's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The established exchanges are keen to work towards this, not
least because, if they do not, those upstart electronic newcomers
might get there first.
</P>
<P>
   Why has such a global marketplace not been created before?
Shares in, say, IBM or Microsoft are widely held by foreign
investors. Commodities and foreign exchange are traded around the
globe, so why not equities?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies partly in conservatism on the part of investors
and issuers, partly in national regulation and accounting
standards, and partly in downright protectionism on the part of
exchanges. All this is changing, albeit more slowly than it should.
</P>
<P>
   For all today's talk about globalization, most investors have
remained surprisingly parochial. Some fret about taking on foreign
exposure or currency risk. Others simply feel more comfortable
dealing in companies they know.
</P>
<P>
   But both investors and companies are learning the benefits of
spreading their risks across borders. It is already possible to
discern the makings of at least two global networks of exchanges
that are emerging in response.
</P>
<P>
   One, led by the New York Stock Exchange, would encompass
Euronext, the proposed merger of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
bourses, and Tokyo; the other would be built around iX, the
putative London/Frankfurt merger and its associated joint venture
with New York's big rival, Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic network may emerge. And it is equally possible
that, with all exchanges talking to all others almost all the time,
they might all get together, with the outcome being a single global
equity market.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experience, admittedly, suggests that more alliances or
mergers between stock exchanges are planned than carried to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The vested interests that own and control the bourses are hard
to satisfy; regulation of markets that operate across borders is
inevitably awkward, since it has long been jealously guarded at
national level; old-fashioned protectionism impels many governments
to preserve ``their'' stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is now irresistible pressure on the world's bourses to
find some way of going global. This raises issues of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   One is how such a market should be regulated. There is unlikely
to be a world Securities and Exchange Commission any time soon:
regulation will remain largely at national level. But national
regulators should be doing more together on such matters as common
listing requirements and international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   This week's announcement of moves to enforce common accounting
standards across Europe is to be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   If such rules can be brought into greater harmony, fears of
damaging regulatory ``arbitrage'' _ with some investors or
companies seeking to take advantage of locations that have laxer
regulation _ may prove groundless. The evidence is anyway that most
participants prefer to deal on well-regulated markets.
</P>
<P>
   Another legitimate concern is whether a global market will make
it easier to achieve one stated aim of nationally regulated
exchanges: the best prices and execution for all investors.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that all investors, even small ones, will
ultimately benefit from the greater liquidity and lower costs that
a global market should bring.
</P>
<P>
   This will be especially true if clearing and settlement systems,
which account for a big chunk of share-dealing costs and are
especially burdensome for trades across borders, can be merged and
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   A longer-term question is whether to worry about the risk of a
single global stock market exercising monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Because trading always gravitates to whichever market has the
biggest share of liquidity, stock markets have a tendency to be
natural monopolies. They also have some of the characteristics of
public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in stock markets, as in utilities, competition is often the
best way of forcing down costs and ensuring good service.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the rivalry between the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq has benefited both the American economy and the exchanges
themselves, so it would be better for the world to look for two
global equity markets rather than one.
</P>
<P>
   But, as national exchanges have found, even a monopoly is
vulnerable to attack by new rivals. So for now it would be better
if regulators, investors and stock exchanges worried less about the
impact of consolidation than about how to foster it. &QL;

FROM MRS. PYNCHON TO LIVIA SOPRANO, A WEALTH OF THESPIAN RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand, whose acting range spanned both the regal Mrs.
Pynchon on ``Lou Grant'' and the seething, scheming Livia Soprano
on ``The Sopranos,'' died of lung cancer at her home in Stratford,
Conn., on Sunday night, one day before her 72d birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Highly respected by fellow actors, Ms. Marchand enjoyed a
significant career on the stage and fairly steady film work. Her
performance on Broadway in ``White Liars and Black Comedy'' won her
a Tony nomination, and when she ventured off-Broadway, she brought
home Obie Awards for ``The Cocktail Hour'' and ``The Balcony.'' Ms.
Marchand also turned up in supporting parts in movies as various as
``Naked Gun'' and the 1995 remake of ``Sabrina.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was best-known for two TV roles that were nearly two
decades _ and light years _ apart.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Lou Grant'' (1977-1982), a newspaper drama starring Edward
Asner as a curmudgeonly city editor of the Los Angeles Tribune, she
won four consecutive Emmy Awards for her portrayal of publisher
Margaret Pynchon. In that role, the elegantly coiffed Ms. Marchand
epitomized aristocratic grace and rock-ribbed integrity. When the
chips were down and a journalistic principle was at stake, editor
Lou Grant could always count on Mrs. Pynchon to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Soprano was another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw Ms. Marchand's performance as Livia, the mother
of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano in HBO's ``The Sopranos,''
found it hard to forget. Her hair flattened against her head, her
eyes wild and her voice grating, Livia was an unsettling mixture of
whining self-pity and feral fury. Livia's weird and wicked ways
were at the root of Tony's need to visit a psychiatrist every week,
which put him in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Livia also did her part to put him there. Angry at Tony (James
Gandolfini) for depositing her in a nursing home (``I gave my life
to my children on a silver platter,'' she wails, unconvincingly),
Livia coerces Junior Soprano, her brother-in-law, into a murder
attempt on her son.
</P>
<P>
   Or did Livia even know what she was doing? Did she slip Junior
damaging information about Tony out of senility rather than malice?
Was her subsequent stroke real or fake? Such was Ms. Marchand's
skill as an actress that the viewer was left wondering.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Livia originally had been scheduled to die at the end
of the first season of HBO's ``The Sopranos.'' But Ms. Marchand's
performance was so compelling that the producers decided to keep
Livia alive for a second season. Ms. Marchand helped make ``The
Sopranos,'' which premiered in January 1999, one of the most
acclaimed dramas in television history.
</P>
<P>
   HBO had no information Monday on how ``Sopranos'' producer David
Chase would handle Ms. Marchand's death within the show's story
line. During the second season, Livia was seen less frequently,
although Junior kept imploring Tony to ``make peace'' with her.
Filming for a third season of the show is slated to begin this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Marchand enjoyed a major career rebirth with ``The
Sopranos,'' some of her fellow actors viewed it as just desserts.
In an interview with the Globe last year, Tyne Daly of ``Judging
Amy'' offered lavish praise for Ms. Marchand as the consummate
professional, and spoke of how gratifying it was to see the actress
recognized for her gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo, Ms. Marchand had a career that spanned most of
TV history. She appeared in the 1953 Philco Television Playhouse
production of ``Marty,'' playing the girlfriend of the title
character, and did guest stints on ``Naked City'' in the late
1950s. She also experienced television's down side: In the
mid-1970s, she was in the cast for ``Beacon Hill,'' an attempt to
put an American accent on ``Upstairs Downstairs.'' It flopped
miserably.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, in addition to ``Lou Grant'' and ``The
Sopranos,'' Ms. Marchand appeared on such TV shows as ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Coach,'' and ``Night Court.''
On film, Ms. Marchand appeared in ``Regarding Henry'' with Harrison
Ford, ``The Bostonians,'' ``The Hospital,'' ``Tell Me That You Love
Me, Junie Moon,'' and ``Dear God.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marchand leaves her three children, Kathryn, Rachel and
David. Last November, Ms. Marchand's husband of 47 years, Paul
Sparer, died, also of cancer.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ At the center of Al Gore's presidential campaign is
a hole _ and it isn't the candidate's personality. The vice
president, the policy wonk's policy wonk, is weak just where he
should be strong: in defining what policies a future Gore
administration would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser, says Gore's greatest
asset is his ability to spot changes before they appear on the
horizon, master the details, think out the policy implications and
then create the sort of environment in which policies can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in this: Gore saw the significance of the
Internet and global warming long before most. But that makes it all
the stranger that the vice president is showing so few signs of
this skill in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the debate has proceeded as follows.
George W. Bush lays out one policy proposal after another:
education (he wants more competition between different types of
school); Social Security (he wants workers to put a share of their
payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts); nuclear weapons
(he proposes deep, unilateral cuts by America, and says it should
build a big nuclear defense shield unilaterally if need be).
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reaction? He barely tries to offer competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he brushes Bush's proposals away with the same mantra,
``a risky education scheme'', ``a risky retirement scheme,'' ``a
risky...'' _ you get the idea. He then proceeds to talk about the
success of the American economy over the past eight years. It is an
appeal that combines the defense of unreformed entitlement programs
with an exaggerated fear of change.
</P>
<P>
   In one way this is understandable, even sensible. The most
powerful argument in support of Gore's presidential bid is that the
economy is in great shape (which is true), that the administration
is largely responsible for this (debatable), and that to change
horses in midstream would endanger American prosperity (well, worth
a try).
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing Bush's ideas ``risky'' underlines Gore's reputation as a
safe pair of hands. It does not necessarily mean Gore is devoid of
ideas. (Indeed one reason why Bush has had to come up with all his
ideas is to counteract the idea that he is the shallower figure.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore could defend his campaign in two other ways.
First, he could say that if he is being too timid, that is merely a
reflection of the inevitable difficulty of running as a sitting
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Any such unfortunate wants to claim credit for the achievements
of the current administration while simultaneously showing his
future government would not be a clone of the existing one.
Striking the right balance is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more substantially, he could argue that he is right
on individual issues _ that privatizing Social Security and
encouraging school choice are both bad ideas; and that you should
be especially cautious about policy departures when the economy is
doing well.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if you accept this latter argument, that is still
not the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, one by one, the attacks on Bush's policies strike home,
the cumulative effect of this negative approach is disappointing
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   First, note that the difference between Gore and Bush on policy
matters is built into their campaigns. Bush has created the post of
policy coordinator for Joshua Bolten, a former director at Goldman
Sachs, and given him real influence.
</P>
<P>
   Bolten has created a sort of think-tank in Austin, with a staff
of about 20 busy young people dreaming up new ideas and borrowing
from other people (including Democrats).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has formidable figures to call on if he wanted to, notably
Larry Summers, the Treasury secretary, and Richard Holbrooke,
America's U.N. ambassador. He also has a policy coordinator: Elaine
Kamarck, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government who worked
with Gore on his project to ``reinvent government.'' But she has no
formal group around her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, campaign tacticians dominate Gore's operation. Their
skill lies in slicing the American electorate up like salami and
tailoring the candidate's appeal to a series of individual interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's tactics-driven campaign seems to have originally derived
from a miscalculation. He underestimated Bush, thinking that no
serious intellectual competition was likely from that quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the summer wears on, the supremacy of campaign
tactics over policy development is undermining Fuerth's argument
that Gore can see beyond the immediate horizon and producing the
opposite impression: that the vice president is pandering to
entrenched interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, both he and Bush proposed similar ideas for
``digitizing government'' (they want to apply new information
technology to the backrooms of government departments).
</P>
<P>
   This idea was first put forward by the Progressive Policy
Institute, a think-tank close to Gore. Yet it was Bush who adopted
the most dramatic part of the proposal _ to appoint an information
czar to force government bureaucracies to change.
</P>
<P>
   Gore balked at this _ apparently for fear of public-sector
unions. His opposition to school choice may also be influenced by
the strength of the teachers' unions in the Democratic Party. They
are against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   By stroking such groups while concentrating relentlessly on the
past eight years of boom, Gore seems to be saying that the election
is an occasion for the nation to express its grateful thanks to the
administration, rather than a opportunity for America to address
the sort of future concerns that, Fuerth claims, Gore is so good at
framing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late to change. In June of 1988, Vice President
George Bush was ten points behind in the polls _ a gap that widened
to 17 points by the time of the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But convention acceptance speeches are the occasions on which
candidates can define themselves as they want: the older Bush took
his chance to distance himself from his predecessor (as a ``kinder,
gentler Republican'') and went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can do the same thing. For Fuerth is right. Gore is good at
seeing around corners. But he needs to show that.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving all the running to Bush, he is increasing the burden
on his convention speech, and the chances that the next thing
around the corner will be his own defeat. &QL;

   CALGARY _ Canadians have long lived in fear of their country
being torn apart by the secession of French-speaking Quebec. But
today a bigger challenge to their tranquillity _ or complacency _
may come from Alberta, in the western prairies.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta's politicians are promoting a robust, American-style
agenda of less government, more individualism and more private
profit. And they are being successful enough to make opponents fear
that caring, consensual Canada might become a clone of its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2.9 million people, Alberta is home to fewer than one
Canadian in ten. But it is booming: officials expect its economy to
grow by 5 percent this year, the fastest rate of any Canadian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a flood of new migrants, the unemployment rate of 4.7
percent is the country's second-lowest. New industries are pouring
in and others are expanding: projects worth C$58 billion ($39
billion) are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new investment is going to Calgary. Long the home of
Canada's oil and gas business, the city has become a magnet for
high-tech companies and corporate head offices.
</P>
<P>
   It has displaced Montreal and Vancouver to become Canada's
biggest business and financial center after Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks fly on the steel girders of the new factories going up on
all sides, as huge earth-movers lay out new highways. New office
towers rise against the backdrop of the distant Rocky Mountains,
while on the city's northern edge, housing developments march
towards the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   All due to the ``Alberta advantage,'' says the province's
government, pointing to the lowest taxes in Canada, balanced
budgets (in fact, a record C$2.7 billion surplus last year) and a
skilled work force.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Alberta's legislature took two radical steps to
consolidate its advantage. Not only did it approve a bill allowing
limited private-sector participation in health care, but it passed
a law making Alberta the first province with a single provincial
income-tax rate, of 10.5 percent in its case _ Canada's answer to
the flat-tax idea of many Republicans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics see Alberta's success as owing much to a strong
national economy, and especially to a surging oil price. Even so,
it is not surprising that Alberta's politicians should be touting
their model to the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, is that over the past few years the
Albertan agenda, rather than that of Quebec, has come to dominate
Canada's national political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous sign of the province's growing political
influence will come on June 24, when the Canadian Alliance, a new
national right-wing party, will hold a convention to chose its
first leader. The convention, appropriately enough, is to be held
in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is a bold effort to reshape Canada's right by
merging Reform, a federal neo-conservative party of Albertan
origin, with sections of the Progressive Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three main candidates to lead the new party are from
Alberta: Preston Manning, who founded Reform in 1987, and Stockwell
Day, a former finance minister in the province. Neither man would
be out of place among America's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Alberta has long been the most ``American'' of Canada's
provinces. It has been shaped by two influxes from south of the
border: first of ranchers and farmers, and then in the 1950s of
oilmen from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They have helped to imbue Alberta with conservative social
attitudes, Christian fundamentalism and anti-government political
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Alberta's dislike of big government also owes much to the
fact that for years it has paid for more than its fair share of it,
being the largest net contributor to the federal government's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albertans know who the enemy is, and it's Ottawa,'' says Tom
Flanagan, a political scientist at the University of Calgary (and a
supporter of Day's).
</P>
<P>
   In the past, other Canadians dismissed Albertans as ``redneck
cowboys.'' No longer.
</P>
<P>
   At the last national election, in 1997, Reform displaced the
more centrist Progressive Conservatives as Canada's main
opposition, winning 80 seats. Another Calgarian, Ralph Klein,
though a Conservative, as premier of Alberta since 1993 was the
first to put Reform's ideas into practice, slashing spending on
health and education and privatizing many government services.
</P>
<P>
   He has been copied by Ontario's Conservative premier, Mike
Harris, among whose advisers is Tom Long, the third candidate to
lead the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Liberal government has also espoused fiscal
responsibility, helped by several years of steady economic growth.
But many Canadians oppose any assault on their welfare state, and
especially their national health service (known as Medicare).
</P>
<P>
   In May, Klein's government alarmed such people when it pushed
through a new law allowing regional health authorities to contract
out routine operations, such as hip replacements, to private
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that this will cut costs and waiting
lists. Its critics disagree, seeing the law as the start of a move
towards an American-style, two-tier health service in which the
rich get faster, better, service at a price.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that American health-management companies may invoke
the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to force their way
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, opponents of the new law staged nightly protests in
Edmonton, Alberta's capital. Just ``fear-mongering'' by a bunch of
``left-wing nuts,'' said Klein. But the health issue may serve to
limit the Alliance's national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the opinion polls, defending Medicare is Canadians'
top concern. Even a majority of Albertans oppose the new law. Both
Manning and Day favor expanding private health care.
</P>
<P>
   And all the Alliance's would-be leaders favor an Albertan-style
single-rate federal income tax (of 17 percent). They claim that it
would boost growth and prosperity, giving everyone a tax cut. But
as with private health care, the rich would benefit most.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies find favor with many United States Republicans.
But Canadians like to think they have a stronger sense of social
equity. Or has that changed? &QL;

A SHARPENER FOR AL GORE'S MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Bill Daley's last official jaunt as commerce
secretary before getting tapped for a job he had declined a year
ago _ chairing Al Gore's presidential campaign _ was to a town Gore
will carry in November, a town run by a guy who was one of the
initial big shots to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Daley and Mayor Tom Menino of Boston were officially promoting
programs to span the ``digital divide'' between kids with easy
access to the tools of technology and those harder to reach.
</P>
<P>
   But naturally, politics came up. Like Daley's brother, Rich
(another early Gore supporter who runs Chicago), Menino is widely
known around town and in national city circles to grumble that he
can't always hear the relentlessly substantive vice president
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   In politics talk, that usually translates into ``message''
criticism, as in the Gore campaign lacks one or has a poor one.
</P>
<P>
   As middle-class, working family kinds of Democrats and not
traditional liberals, Menino and Rich Daley are tight with a buck,
successful against crime, and focused on economics. But they are
also innovators, and it's no accident that Chicago and Boston are
ground zero in the movement to give mayors control of the schools
in return for responsibility for their reform.
</P>
<P>
   They both see their worlds as potential sources not just of
support for Gore's campaign but as major, big time sources of it if
the message is clear and mobilizing. Right now, their view is that
it isn't _ that Gore's communication is a useless as yesterday's
paper.
</P>
<P>
   This viewpoint from people whose support of Gore was early and
all out and remains so was in Bill Daley's head last week when the
call came from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Daley didn't want to join what was known then with
proper derision as Gore Inc., a big-spending collection of too many
people with clean fingernails endlessly maneuvering for position.
The Gore Inc. plane was full in first class; there was no one in
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Daley, however, had no worries about a place for him in the
campaign he is going to chair. He's been a consultant to it in his
spare time all along; he has worked before with everyone who made
Gore the first Democrat to win the nomination by winning every
primary. In his first detailed exposure to the campaign over the
weekend, Daley did not see any significant manifestations of the
old Gore Inc., much less any important issue position he thought
was off base.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the challenge is to clarify, simplify, and amplify.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Daley was kibitzing with the Gore campaign over the
past year, advisers recall a fairly constant suggestion from this
scion of a Chicago White Sox family: Hit singles. He is no fan of
elaborate strategies but for singles to score runs; they have to be
in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, that requires a campaign that flows every day from
one basic premise that people can readily understand in their busy
lives and relate instantly to the candidate. Unlike his brother,
Bill Daley has gone from Chicago into the nerve centers of the new
economy all over the world. But he's still basically a
middle-class, working family Democrat who thinks the smart use of
the money generated by the economic miracle of the last several
years can broaden the base of prosperity and make it more secure.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's situation, the best case amounts to nothing more
complicated than this: I'm going to fight on your side. It is then
up to surrogates and maybe some TV commercials to make the case
about George W. Bush: he's on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that kind of simplicity, there's an encyclopedia of
substance framed as either/or choices. You can, for example, use
these impending budget surpluses to expand basic health insurance
through the states, offer universal preschool, have a basic
prescription drug benefit within Medicare, give HMO customers a
real bill of rights, win the next round against pollution, repair
the country's public schools inside and out, and cut income taxes
for poor and middle-income working families.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can slash the top income tax rates on the highest
incomes. But you can't do both.
</P>
<P>
   And in social insurance, you can either invest in Medicare and
Social Security, extending their life well into this century as we
now know them; you can even create investment accounts for today's
workers as a supplement to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Or, by not investing in Medicare and by taking vast sums out of
Social Security to create investment accounts as replacements, you
can put all of the burden of eventual ``reform'' onto the basic
benefits structure. But you can't do both.
</P>
<P>
   At this very early point, Bush and Gore are almost mirror
images. Bush introduces very well, makes an excellent, pleasant
impression. But his record in the primaries suggests he's not such
a great second date, especially when questioned beyond the
boundaries of his scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is an acquired taste, a trees as opposed to a forest guy a
lot of the time. But the primaries improved him, especially his
early image of being on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Daley is a believer in the steep hill concept of vice
presidents running to succeed their presidents. The process of
establishing identity after years as number two is painful and
slow; weak; the natural landscape always tilts at first in favor of
making a change in party control of the White House. For now it
looks like that tilt is more slight (as in 1960 with John Kennedy)
than sharp (as in Mike Dukakis in 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Daley won't micromanage. But he has the clout to clarify the
choice to the point where people like his brother and Tom Menino
can hear Gore clearly.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years after the credit card was invented in
Manhattan, its popularity knows no bounds. But the structure of the
industry supplying credit and other charge cards faces
unprecedented scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the trial began of an antitrust lawsuit launched by
America's Department of Justice (DOJ) against Visa and MasterCard,
which together account for around 75 percent of the country's $1.3
trillion credit-card market.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's antitrust watchdog also said it is probing
``Visa and credit cards in general.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, another trial will start, of a class-action suit by
many of America's retailers, seeking damages of $8.1 billion from
Visa and MasterCard for antitrust violations in the debit-card
business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the card industry is uncompetitive may seem
bizarre to most consumers, particularly in America, where,
typically, a couple of card-solicitations arrive in the mail every
day. Almost anybody can get a card _ bankrupts, infants, even pets.
</P>
<P>
   If lack of opportunity for consumers were the alleged antitrust
violation, the charges would surely be thrown out more quickly than
you can say ``American Express.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is slightly more to the accusations than that. The DOJ
is unhappy for two main reasons. One is that it believes that Visa
and MasterCard are not really competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American Express (Amex), a single company, and Discover,
owned solely by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Visa and MasterCard are
each owned mutually, by associations of thousands of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These two associations operate under what is known as
``duality''; member banks are allowed to issue both Visa- and
MasterCard-branded plastic. According to the DoJ, this duality
means that the two leading brands are, in effect, one business.
</P>
<P>
   And second, the DOJ thinks that, although there is competition
between banks using their brands, the dominant market position of
MasterCard and Visa has enabled them to stifle competition from
rivals such as Amex and Discover, notably through exclusivity rules
forbidding banks from issuing rival cards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DOJ launched its lawsuit in October 1998, the
Visa-MasterCard duality has started to unravel. In February 1999,
Citigroup, the world's biggest card-issuer, resigned from the board
of Visa; it is shifting all its business to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the suit was started, John Reed, until recently
the joint-boss of Citi, admitted to Joel Klein, assistant
attorney-general, that it had been a mistake for banks to become
overlapping owners of both brands. He urged Klein, to no avail, to
give the industry more time to sort out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan has since gone with MasterCard, while BankOne's
FirstUSA and Bank of America have thrown in their lot with Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of the crime in this way might seem evidence
of guilt. Not necessarily. Some big banks have long wanted to
downplay the MasterCard and Visa connection, and increasingly their
cards emphasize their own brand.
</P>
<P>
   Some might even quietly welcome the antitrust action. They argue
that they have been subsidizing these two brands at the expense of
their own. The benefit has gone mainly to small banks, which have
been able to compete in the card business only because they carry
the MasterCard or Visa logos.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, one of the main arguments that the two brands offer
in their defense is that the DOJ's lawsuit could result in many of
these small banks leaving the industry, reducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that Visa and MasterCard do not compete vigorously
will be hard to prove. Internal documents suggesting this will be
submitted by the DOJ. They will be met with what is known in
antitrust circles as the ``demented middle-manager defense.''
</P>
<P>
   True, their advertisements do not criticize each other, though
they sometimes badmouth rivals such as Amex. On the other hand the
presence of competitors such as Amex means that the two cannot
afford to be an entirely cozy duopoly. Moreover, it is not clear
that the DOJ's action will increase competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The system of duality was actually introduced back in 1975 at
the behest of the DOJ, which then feared that Visa was becoming
dominant. As it unravels, the immediate impact has been to
strengthen Visa's position further. It had anyway increased its
market share, from 43 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 1999
(against MasterCard's 28 percent). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the current market structure inhibits
innovation has worked well for the DOJ in its case against
Microsoft. So it is no surprise to hear it used again in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence suggests that innovation in the provision of
financial products to consumers has been more advanced in America
than in the rest of the world. It has been ahead in offering cards
to lower-quality borrowers, in varying interest rates and terms and
conditions, and in offering rewards and affinity programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions have been ``smart'' cards, which have had
more success elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The development of wireless products, such as Palm Pilots or
mobile phones that can download money from an ATM and digitally
transfer it to a retailer, is more advanced in Europe than America,
but that is probably because the wireless infrastructure is more
advanced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Visa or MasterCard seem to be less innovative than rivals
such as Amex. They were quicker to introduce affinity programs,
such as MasterCard's pioneering tie-up with AT&AMP;T (no annual fee)
and its air-miles arrangement with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   True, Amex has been first with its ``Blue'' smart card _ though
this is primarily a marketing coup, as the rest of the economy is
not yet smart enough to let it do much more than any other charge
card does.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ will also struggle to prove that merchants are paying
higher fees because of the dominance of Visa and MasterCard. Amex
has typically charged merchants more (though Discover has usually
been cheaper).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it will not be surprising if the DOJ succeeds in its attack
on the rules banning MasterCard and Visa's bank partners from using
other cards, if only because they look so dodgy.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictive agreements are not always unacceptable: nobody
objects to Coca-Cola banning Pepsi from its soda fountains. And
banks can always choose to quit MasterCard and Visa if they want to
offer Amex cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic benefits claimed for the rules do not seem
large: if there were fewer small banks offering credit cards, would
they be missed?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the case against MasterCard and Visa looks weak. But, in
contrast to the Microsoft suit, the result is unlikely to make much
difference, at least to consumers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What Bill Bryson has done for England and the United States, he
has now done for Australia: written a delightfully entertaining
travel book.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson is the kind of guy who would, and did, kill time by
looking through maps for ``ridiculous names, of which Australia has
a respectable plentitude. I am thus able to report that the
following are all real places: Wee Waa, Poowons, Borrumbuttock,
Sugan Buggan, Boomahnoomoonah, Waaia, Mullumbimby Ewylamartup,
Jiggalong, and the supremely satisfying Tittybong.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``In a Sunburned Country'' (Broadway Books, $25), is a
romp through Australia's marvels, mysteries, and, yes, absurdities.
Bryson, author of the bestsellers ``A Walk in the Woods'' and
``Notes from a Small Island,'' travels from Sydney, site of the
2000 Olympics, to the Nullarbor Plain, where desert temperatures
can hit 140 degrees Fahrenheit. He also travels from the nation's
capital of Canberra, where he says the dearth of good restaurants
is noticeable, through the outback to the big red boulder that was
once known as Ayers Rock but is now called Uluru. Along the way,
you can be certain that he will have dozens of encounters and
observations that bring smiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another best-selling travel writer, Paul Theroux, provides a
good look at where he has been going and what he has been thinking
about these last 15 years in a collection of essays called ``Fresh
Air Fiend'' (Houghton Mifflin, $27). This collection, filled with
characters and comments, covers five continents and a lot of water,
too. Whether he's snowbound in the Maine woods or pondering matters
on a remote Pacific island where atomic bombs were once detonated,
Theroux has plenty to say. There are also chapters on how he came
to write the books that he did. In a chapter on ``The Great Railway
Bazaar,'' for instance, he looks at travel writing in the 1960s and
'70s: ``The travel book was a bore. A bore wrote it and bores read
it.'' Whatever you think of Theroux and his sometimes biting
observations, you will never apply the word ``bore'' to him.

<P>
   You won't find the stylish writing of a Bryson or a Theroux in
``My African Safari'' by Kim L. Capehart (Pentland Press, $11.95,
paperback), but you will get an insight into the culture of Ghana
that's not available to the casual tourist. Capehart, who was a
medical intern in Ghana, found a land that's poor in material goods
yet rich in the joy of living. Writes Capehart: ``If experiences of
running from local wildlife, hunting, the Ghanian health care
system, weird and unusual food, and losing my bungalow, toilet
paper, crutches, and soap within the first couple of days sound
interesting . . . by all means keep reading.'' I did.

   This is the year of Rome's Jubilee 2000 celebration, expected to
attract more than 7 million Americans. When in Rome, or before they
go, they might do well to read ``As the Romans Do: The Delights,
Dramas, and Daily Diversions of Life in the Eternal City'' by Alan
Epstein (William Morrow, $20). Five years ago, Epstein and his
wife, who had fallen in love with Rome, took their belongings and
their two school-age children and moved there permanently. ``We
were hooked on the beauty, the thrill, the incomparable joy of
starting over in a new land with a new language,'' writes Epstein.
His book is a celebration of the city but especially the men and
women who populate it. Epstein looks at the Romans' gregarious
culture, in which coffee is ever-present; their artistic flair;
their love of good food; their unusual attitudes toward marriage
and religion; and, yes, their sex appeal.

   One of the best parts of a trip to Poland can be the cuisine _
if you know how to decipher the menus or what to buy at the market.
Accordingly, Joan and David Person have written ``Eat Smart in
Poland'' (Ginkgo Press, $12.95). The book is the fifth in a series
of travel guides for food lovers. Other volumes cover Mexico,
Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil. The Poland book has a menu guide, a
glossary of foods and flavors, tips on shopping in the country's
fascinating food markets, Polish phrases, and a recipe collection.
And while I'm sure the recipes will produce tasty dishes, I'm
equally certain that nothing printed there will ever top my late
Polish grandmother's pierogis.

   National Geographic puts out three good travel magazines, so
it's hardly surprising that the company would issue good
guidebooks. Among the volumes in the ``National Geographic
Traveler'' series, all of them containing the Geographic's
signature photography along with the guidance, are ``Rome''
($22.95), ``Italy'' ($27.95), ``Australia'' ($27.95),
``California'' ($27.95), and ``San Francisco'' ($22.95).

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years after the credit card was invented in
Manhattan, its popularity knows no bounds. But the structure of the
industry supplying credit and other charge cards faces
unprecedented scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the trial began of an antitrust lawsuit launched by
America's Department of Justice (DOJ) against Visa and MasterCard,
which together account for around 75 percent of the country's $1.3
trillion credit-card market.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's antitrust watchdog also said it is probing
``Visa and credit cards in general.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, another trial will start, of a class-action suit by
many of America's retailers, seeking damages of $8.1 billion from
Visa and MasterCard for antitrust violations in the debit-card
business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the card industry is uncompetitive may seem
bizarre to most consumers, particularly in America, where,
typically, a couple of card-solicitations arrive in the mail every
day. Almost anybody can get a card _ bankrupts, infants, even pets.
</P>
<P>
   If lack of opportunity for consumers were the alleged antitrust
violation, the charges would surely be thrown out more quickly than
you can say ``American Express.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is slightly more to the accusations than that. The DOJ
is unhappy for two main reasons. One is that it believes that Visa
and MasterCard are not really competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American Express (Amex), a single company, and Discover,
owned solely by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Visa and MasterCard are
each owned mutually, by associations of thousands of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These two associations operate under what is known as
``duality''; member banks are allowed to issue both Visa- and
MasterCard-branded plastic. According to the DoJ, this duality
means that the two leading brands are, in effect, one business.
</P>
<P>
   And second, the DOJ thinks that, although there is competition
between banks using their brands, the dominant market position of
MasterCard and Visa has enabled them to stifle competition from
rivals such as Amex and Discover, notably through exclusivity rules
forbidding banks from issuing rival cards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DOJ launched its lawsuit in October 1998, the
Visa-MasterCard duality has started to unravel. In February 1999,
Citigroup, the world's biggest card-issuer, resigned from the board
of Visa; it is shifting all its business to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the suit was started, John Reed, until recently
the joint-boss of Citi, admitted to Joel Klein, assistant
attorney-general, that it had been a mistake for banks to become
overlapping owners of both brands. He urged Klein, to no avail, to
give the industry more time to sort out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan has since gone with MasterCard, while BankOne's
FirstUSA and Bank of America have thrown in their lot with Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of the crime in this way might seem evidence
of guilt. Not necessarily. Some big banks have long wanted to
downplay the MasterCard and Visa connection, and increasingly their
cards emphasize their own brand.
</P>
<P>
   Some might even quietly welcome the antitrust action. They argue
that they have been subsidizing these two brands at the expense of
their own. The benefit has gone mainly to small banks, which have
been able to compete in the card business only because they carry
the MasterCard or Visa logos.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, one of the main arguments that the two brands offer
in their defense is that the DOJ's lawsuit could result in many of
these small banks leaving the industry, reducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that Visa and MasterCard do not compete vigorously
will be hard to prove. Internal documents suggesting this will be
submitted by the DOJ. They will be met with what is known in
antitrust circles as the ``demented middle-manager defense.''
</P>
<P>
   True, their advertisements do not criticize each other, though
they sometimes badmouth rivals such as Amex. On the other hand the
presence of competitors such as Amex means that the two cannot
afford to be an entirely cozy duopoly. Moreover, it is not clear
that the DOJ's action will increase competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The system of duality was actually introduced back in 1975 at
the behest of the DOJ, which then feared that Visa was becoming
dominant. As it unravels, the immediate impact has been to
strengthen Visa's position further. It had anyway increased its
market share, from 43 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 1999
(against MasterCard's 28 percent). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the current market structure inhibits
innovation has worked well for the DOJ in its case against
Microsoft. So it is no surprise to hear it used again in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence suggests that innovation in the provision of
financial products to consumers has been more advanced in America
than in the rest of the world. It has been ahead in offering cards
to lower-quality borrowers, in varying interest rates and terms and
conditions, and in offering rewards and affinity programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions have been ``smart'' cards, which have had
more success elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The development of wireless products, such as Palm Pilots or
mobile phones that can download money from an ATM and digitally
transfer it to a retailer, is more advanced in Europe than America,
but that is probably because the wireless infrastructure is more
advanced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Visa or MasterCard seem to be less innovative than rivals
such as Amex. They were quicker to introduce affinity programs,
such as MasterCard's pioneering tie-up with AT&AMP;T (no annual fee)
and its air-miles arrangement with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   True, Amex has been first with its ``Blue'' smart card _ though
this is primarily a marketing coup, as the rest of the economy is
not yet smart enough to let it do much more than any other charge
card does.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ will also struggle to prove that merchants are paying
higher fees because of the dominance of Visa and MasterCard. Amex
has typically charged merchants more (though Discover has usually
been cheaper).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it will not be surprising if the DOJ succeeds in its attack
on the rules banning MasterCard and Visa's bank partners from using
other cards, if only because they look so dodgy.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictive agreements are not always unacceptable: nobody
objects to Coca-Cola banning Pepsi from its soda fountains. And
banks can always choose to quit MasterCard and Visa if they want to
offer Amex cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic benefits claimed for the rules do not seem
large: if there were fewer small banks offering credit cards, would
they be missed?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the case against MasterCard and Visa looks weak. But, in
contrast to the Microsoft suit, the result is unlikely to make much
difference, at least to consumers. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it Cop Lit.
</P>
<P>
   The annals of police writers include novelists like Joseph
Wambaugh, whistle-blowers like Frank Serpico and the unheralded
officers who contribute tales to true crime anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch the definition a bit, and you can add the consultants to
reality-laden police shows like ``NYPD Blue.'' There is even a
policeman with a nationally syndicated weekly radio segment.
</P>
<P>
   Now number among the writing ranks Lucas Miller, a New York City
police detective and former narcotics undercover officer. In a sign
of the times, he writes a column for an Internet publication, Slate
magazine (www.slate.com).
</P>
<P>
   In sometimes wry and sometimes elegaic tones, Miller has
chronicled station house reaction to the acquittal of police
officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo and to the seizing of
Elian Gonzalez. He has given an account of a strangely peaceful
night on patrol in Times Square during last New Year's Eve. He has
written, self-deprecatingly, about an off-duty encounter with
marijuana, about accidentally spraying Mace in the eyes of two
fellow detectives and about finding his car towed while on a date.
</P>
<P>
   His column, which recently acquired the rubric ``Flatfoot,'' has
appeared an average of once a month since the beginning of the
year. Though Slate does not release figures for the number of hits
per article, editors say ``Flatfoot'' is one of the more popular
features.
</P>
<P>
   The column is yet another example of the allure of New York
police stories, a mystique primed by television shows from
``Kojak'' to ``Law and Order'' and countless movies and books.
These days, the genre is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the force, Edward W. Conlon, writes about an
officer's life under the pseudonym Marcus Laffey for The New
Yorker. A somewhat less topical, more lyrical version of Miller,
Conlon is working on a hotly auctioned book about his experiences,
to be published by Riverhead Books.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year veteran of the force, Richard Rosenthal, is coming out
in August with ``Rookie Cop: Deep Undercover in the Jewish Defense
League,'' a memoir of his penetration of the radical group in the
early 1970s. Rosenthal, who retired from the New York department,
is now chief of police in Wellfleet, Mass., on Cape Cod, where he
hired Miller as a part-time officer in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are far more officers out there who have wonderful
stories, who just don't have the facility to put them on paper,''
said Rosenthal, who has written two other police insider books and
a novel. ``We see a section of society that very few people get to
see,'' and can deliver a ``vicarious thrill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police are not the only municipal workers with itchy
keyboard fingers. Dennis Smith won acclaim for ``Report From Engine
Co. 82,'' an account of his days as a firefighter in the South
Bronx. First published in 1972, the book was reissued by Warner
Books last year.
</P>
<P>
   For those who ponder the genre, it is the muse of New York City
itself that generates the most fascination among readers. New York
resides firmly in the American consciousness, whether as Sin City,
Fun City and now, after a major drop in crime, Safe City. Who can
resist it?
</P>
<P>
   Like no other place, this cauldron of race, class, evil, money
and spectacle inspires peace officers to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a richness in New York, such a diversity of
people, of experiences,'' said Eli Silverman, a professor of police
studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ``The ordinary
experiences far outweigh what one's imagination can conceive. Each
story is more and more incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal agrees. ``You wonder why New York City cops can write
about the stuff?'' he asked. ``It's because we see the stuff.
People hacked into pieces, babies thrown into ovens, the most
bizarre human interactions you can imagine are relatively
commonplace to a police officer working in a high-crime precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Such taxpayer-financed life experience by city workers can prove
lucrative. Conlon received a reported advance of $995,000 for his
book.
</P>
<P>
   While Cop Lit is nothing new in New York, these are interesting
times for writerly members of the department, and Miller
acknowledges he is courting the possibility of official discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The department has come under sharp criticism in the past
several years for cases like the Diallo shooting, in which white
police officers killed an unarmed black man. Other such cases
include the torture of Abner Louima in a station house and the
fatal shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond by plainclothes officers.
These much-publicized incidents have formed a wedge between many
New Yorkers and the department and made rank-and-file officers and
commanders more sensitive to publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the department a place where attention-getters flourish.
Its previous commissioner, William Bratton, loved the limelight and
found himself forced out of a job by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
High-profile members, like the now-retired detective, Bo Dietl,
whose 1988 autobiography was called ``One Tough Cop,'' are not
always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Miller's current boss, Commissioner Howard
Safir, has shopped his own book about life in law enforcement.
Bratton, who wrote his own book with Peter Knobler called
``Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic,''
joined the now-faltering crime Web site APBnews.com as a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Miller said he had raised no eyebrows in the
department with his Slate columns. He said he received the standard
approval needed for an officer to work off duty and did not clear
his columns beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my commanders and supervisors I've talked to about my
writing have been solicitous about my opinions, my writing,'' he
said. But then, he concedes, few officers probably read Slate. One
of his close colleagues did not know about the column.
</P>
<P>
   Conlon, 36, who declined to be interviewed for this article,
early on chose to write under a pseudonym mainly to avoid alerting
his fellow officers that he was writing about them and thus change
the flow of his stories, said his editor, Christopher Knutsen.
Avoiding official repercussions may have been a reason, too,
Knutsen allows.

OLD STURBRIDGE BRINGS 4TH CLOSE TO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was time for the annual reading of the Declaration of
Independence. The speaker, sporting a blue morning coat and bright
red vest, soon had his audience stirred up as he outlined the evils
perpetrated against the colonies by King George III:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``He has obstructed the administration of
justice.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared in outrage.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``He has . . . sent hither swarms of officers to harass
our people.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared louder.
</P>
<P>
   (iteals)``He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt
our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared loudest of all.
</P>
<P>
   And then the speaker, a prominent citizen of Old Sturbridge
Village, reeled off the names of the signers of the Declaration and
where they were from. Hearing their states mentioned, audience
members from Maine to Virginia cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Every July 4, people from those states and others appear happy
to be at Old Sturbridge, a re-created New England village of the
1830s in Sturbridge. After all, they are celebrating Independence
Day in a unique way by returning to the time a little more than a
half-century after the Declaration was signed _ a time when the
holiday was one of the premier events of the year and meant a rare
day off from hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The day is faithfully recaptured at the 200-acre village,
beginning with fife and drum music, a flag raising, and musket and
cannon fire. In the afternoon, a parade is held. But this parade
features no drum majorettes in spangled costumes or tuba players
oom-pahing down the street. Instead, it's a straw-hatted procession
of citizens _ farmers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and others _
carrying the tools of their trades and sometimes accompanied by
beasts of burden such as oxen. The reading of the Declaration,
complete with a musket salute, follows. Throughout the day, there
are toy hot-air balloon flights, 19th-century dancing,
early-American games such as hoop rolling, and boat rides on the
Quinebaug River.
</P>
<P>
   Old Sturbridge Village will do it all again this July 4, and
hold Family Fun Days July 1-3. The fun days include demonstrations,
activities, and family entertainment, including more balloon
flights, cow milking, children's garden tours, gossip tours,
19th-century puppets, and storytelling. For more information and
prices, call 800-SEE-1830 (TTY: 508-347-5383) or visit www.osv.org.
For information about a variety of red-white-and-blue events
through July 9 that the town of Sturbridge calls the Americana
Experience, call 800-628-8379 or visit www.sturbridge.org. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Independence Day: On July 2, beautiful Belcourt
Castle in Newport, R.I., will be the scene of an old-fashioned
Fourth of July barbecue. The benefit event, from 7 p.m. to
midnight, will feature a lavish barbecue (until 10 p.m.) with items
such as seafood appetizers, black angus burgers, hot dogs, wings,
ribs, corn, beans, and a lot more. In addition, there will be
lively music by The Ravers. Tickets for the event, which is limited
to those 21 and over, are $60 before June 26 and $70 afterward.
Call 401-846-0669, ext. 2. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking some more of Independence Day: The annual Fourth of
July ``Turtle Independence Day'' celebration at Mauna Lani Resort
on Hawaii's Big Island is indeed a day of freedom for young
``honu'' (turtles), who are tagged and released into the ocean
after being nurtured in a program to protect Hawaii's dwindling
turtle population. Last year more than 1,000 gathered at water's
edge to cheer the turtles to freedom. Free and open to the public,
the event draws spectators in turtle-themed clothes, swimsuits, and
snorkeling gear, who form a human path to independence. &QL;

In a name: London's Canary Wharf is so named because it originally
handled ships full of bananas from the Canary Islands. (This
fascinating fact is from ``Kids' London'' (DK Publishing, $7.95). &QL;

Today's loopy law: In Portland, Maine, shoelaces must be tied while
walking down the street. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Money back: Biztravel.com is guaranteeing the on-time performance
of five airlines _ American, Continental, US Airways, British
Airways, and Air France _ or the Web company will give its
customers the following refunds: Any flight arriving at the gate
more than 30 minutes late, $100; more than an hour, $200; more than
two hours, a full refund. There are also refunds for flight
cancellations, seat assignments that are not honored, requested
meals that are not available, and lost baggage. For details, rules,
and information on still other refunds, visit www.biztravel.com &QL; 
 &QL; 
Event to remember: The remote outback town of Boulia in Queensland,
Australia, will host the fourth annual Boulia Desert Sands camel
races July 14-16. The feature event will be a 1.2-mile race with a
prize purse of $20,000 US. For more information on Australia, where
bookmaking is legal, visit www.australia.com or call 800-333 0262.

Worthy of honor: A small shrine in Dublin honors America's Choctaw
Indians, and for good reason. In 1847, hearing of Ireland's famine,
the tribe sent money and food. They were the only such people in
the world to do so. The Choctaws, after all, knew what starvation
was like, having experienced it on the Trail of Tears from
1829-1843. &QL;

   TOKYO _ It looks for all the world like a rerun of the video
wars of the 1980s, when Sony's clever little Betamax cassette
recorder was eventually trounced by the Matsushita camp's clunkier
but more versatile VHS machine.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Japan's two consumer-electronics giants have been
girding up over the past few months to do battle again.
</P>
<P>
   And, appropriately enough, they are butting heads over which of
their digital video disc (DVD) recorder designs will replace the
aging video-cassette recorder (VCR) that they fought over a decade
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference today is that Sony and Matsushita may have left
it too late for either to gain any real advantage in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed by wrangles with film studios and digital broadcasters
over how to prevent pirates from making pristine master copies of
their intellectual property, the two rival DVD recorders may turn
out to be obsolete even before going into mass production.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Japanese manufacturers at last agreed on the
royalties to be paid to organizations that represent the
broadcasters and film producers. A 1 percent surcharge, with an
upper limit of Yen1,000 ($9.50), is to be added to the wholesale
price of all DVD recorders and blank discs, so that copyright
holders can be compensated for the copying done by legitimate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hollywood studios have accepted a copy-protection
scheme that allows them to decide whether their copyrighted
material can be copied freely, copied just once, or not copied at
all.
</P>
<P>
   With the royalty and copy-protection issues resolved, Japanese
manufacturers at last feel confident enough to start cranking up
production of DVD recorders and discs for the huge American market.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Matsushita has the upper hand. It had delayed
launching its DVD recorder until the copy-protection scheme that it
developed with Toshiba, IBM and Intel was accepted universally.
</P>
<P>
   The new Matsushita machine goes on sale in Japan on June 30, at
a list price of Yen250,000 ($2,375). The industry expects to ship
150,000 units by the end of the year, with a third of those going
to America.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping the gun, two of Sony's allies, Pioneer and Sharp, have
already launched video recorders based on variants of a rival
technology known in Japan as DVD-RW. But because their video
recorders use a copy-protection scheme that has not been accepted
abroad, they will have to develop wholly new models for export.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pioneer is pushing hard, Sony and other members of the
DVD-RW family are expected to miss this year's pre-Christmas rush
for DVD recorders in America.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, however, the advantage could swing back to the Sony
camp, thanks to a gamble taken on how digital video recorders will
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD-RAM design adopted by Toshiba and Hitachi, as well as
Matsushita, functions as a replacement for both the VCR and the
recordable CD drive that is increasingly used in personal
computers. The advantage is that material recorded from a
television or video camera on a DVD-RAM disc can be edited on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, useful though that sounds, the DVD-RAM is not particularly
user-friendly, according to Masami Fujino, an industry watcher in
the Tokyo office of Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, a stockbroker. The
recording disc has to be stored in a special cartridge, making it
impossible to replay it on an ordinary DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 12 million DVD players in use around the
world, with a further 14 million expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the DVD-RW, developed originally by Sony in Japan
and Philips in the Netherlands, is a stand-alone product designed
solely to work as a replacement for the VCR. Besides being easy to
operate, its discs can be played back on existing DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   A DVD-RW machine can also record up to six hours' worth of
material, compared with its rival's more limited four hours.
</P>
<P>
   During the video wars of the 1980s, it was the longer recording
time of Matsushita's VHS that finally put paid to Sony's Betamax
design. But any success that the Sony/Philips offering might enjoy
is likely to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, a new recording technology will be in production that
uses a blue-green laser instead of the red one found in today's CD
players and DVD machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its much higher frequency, the blue-green laser will
cram three or four times more video on to a standard DVD disc _
enough, should it be needed, to record up to 24 hours of video at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody pondering what wondrous new gizmo should replace their
VCR had better wait. The latest episode of the video wars has
barely begun. &QL;

NEW YORK: Knutsen allows.

<P>
   For Miller, the line is tough to straddle. He says he is no
apologist or spokesman for his employer but he does not want to be
considered a critic of a force he says he loves. He says he wants
to enlighten readers, but ``obviously I'm under constraints as to
what I can write about.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he would never jeopardize an investigation, invade the
privacy of fellow officers or release sensitive information. Nor,
he says, will he air the department's dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's balancing act is seen in his Diallo piece, posted on
Feb. 26. He wrote of the sadness his fellow officers felt at the
way the system failed Diallo, their relief at the acquittal, their
identification with the officers who used their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every cop in my office today was aware that it is going to
take a long time, a lot of sweat, and probably some blood to deal
with what they have done,'' he wrote to finish the column.
</P>
<P>
   In his marijuana piece, he wrote about a home delivery of the
drug to his girlfriend's roommate while he was in the house. Some
officers favor strict enforcement of anti-drug laws when it comes
to marijuana, he said. Others are embarrassed about cracking down
on marijuana users.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are those, like myself, who see the virtue of
enforcing quality of life laws but can't help but feel bad putting
a guy in handcuffs for smoking pot,'' Detective Miller wrote. He
would not be making any arrests on that off-duty evening. ``But nor
could I sit idle while Roommate toked up,'' he said, ending the
article this way: ``I found myself hitting the redial button on
their phone pad, trying to get the number of the delivery
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 33, was born on the Upper West Side and grew up in SoHo,
where he lives now. His father taught English at Brooklyn College
and his mother is a painter. He majored in English at Wesleyan
University after being rejected from a creative writing program at
the university but was kicked out in his senior year for academic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was sworn in in 1990, rose quickly while working
undercover in narcotics and made detective in 1996. He is on the
staff of the commander of the narcotics division for the Manhattan
South command.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Slate's attention after sending an e-mail comment on
a columnist's harsh remark about the Diallo case. After an exchange
of messages, he was invited to contribute a so-called Slate diary,
in which people write about daily experiences. A Slate editor, Jodi
Kantor, suggested the column after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's humane and intelligent and funny and clearly doing his
job for the best of the best of reasons,'' Kantor said.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller sometimes seems to float between two worlds _ one
of words, the other of police work _ his heart lies firmly in his
day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to believe people are reading my stuff because I'm a
decent writer, not because it says I'm a cop,'' he said.
``Hopefully, it's both.''
</P>
<P>
   But writing, for now, cannot replace policing, he said, adding,
``It's my first and only real love as a profession.''

EVEN WITH GAS PRICE HIKES, YOU CAN SAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With gasoline prices averaging more than $1.60 a gallon for
regular nationwide, some travelers are getting cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found 48 percent of those
surveyed said rising gas prices were making them change their
vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   While no one likes what is happening at the pumps, there's
really no need to change plans although, yes, driving is going to
cost you more. Let's say you have a vehicle that averages 20 miles
a gallon. On a 600-mile roundtrip, fuel would cost $47.70 based on
a AAA average price of $1.578.
</P>
<P>
   If it were still available in those wonderful days of
$1-a-gallon prices, the same trip would have cost $30. Now, is a
$17.70 increase worth canceling your plans?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are one of the macho types who only drives the
huge sport utility vehicles, then you're going to pay more, but
still not enough really to keep you home.
</P>
<P>
   When making vacation plans the first thing to do is set
priorities. If you plan, you can find savings just about anywhere
you are traveling _ and on any aspect of the trip. For example, you
can prearrange for accommodations at your price, not at what the
traffic will bear.
</P>
<P>
   Consider joining a club. If you're not a member, check out AAA
since they do a lot more than just provide towing service and maps.
Included in the membership are excellent guides for use throughout
the country to find hotels and restaurants. Your membership card
also provides discounts at dining spots, shops, and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Look for hotel deals. The recently renovated Marriott Bay Point
Resort Village in Panama City Beach, Fla., is offering a Round Trip
Reward from now through Sept. 30, which provides vacationers
staying five days with a rebate of 32.5 cents per mile traveled to
reach the resort. The resort has everything for golf and family
vacations; the gasoline rebate makes it even more of a deal. For
information on rates and the rebate (a limit of 1,000 miles), call
800-874-7105.
</P>
<P>
   Omni Hotels is offering Phenomenal Fridays for weekend stays
with rates beginning at $69 through Sept. 3. And other chains are
offering low summer rates also to those who call ahead. Many are
also offering extras for the kids, like Comfort Inn and Comfort
Suite hotels, which give the children a free Pokemon the Movie 2000
Activity Book.
</P>
<P>
   Since you really should have the car checked before hitting the
road, why not take advantage of this? Jiffy Lube is offering travel
discounts valued at $1,000 to those having a Signature Service in
June. With the service, drivers receive a Drive America brochure
and savings card with a pin number to access the deals wherever you
go. For information, call 800-344-6933.
</P>
<P>
   Make plans for somewhere where the dollar goes far _ Canada.
With the US dollar worth up to $1.50 in Canada, a vacation up north
becomes a real bargain. The Four Seasons Hotel Toronto just did a
comparison of staying there and at The Plaza Hotel New York, both
world-class hotels. The results were amazing: A $1,498 vacation in
New York would cost just $703 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend stay included (Plaza/Four Seasons prices):
accommodations $960, $410; meal $72, $52; wine $65, $44; dessert
$20, $11; coffee $5, $5; show $260, $123; baseball game $110, $53;
and transportation $6, $5.
</P>
<P>
   Should you head to Toronto, the Four Seasons has lots of
packages beginning from $230 (800-332-3442). And if you go for
shopping, Liloo Alim, chef concierge, says locally produced
fashions, shoes, leather goods, and cigars are Americans' top
items. He'll also assist you with more entertainment tips, tax
refunds, and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing what that dollar can do with a little planning.

<P>
   The leaning tower of Pisa will reopen on July 17, 2001,
according to the Italian Tourist Office in New York. For more than
a decade work has been under way to stabilize the 12th-century
landmark. When it does open, visitors will only be able to go to
the second circle, not the top. The reopening coincides with Pisa's
celebration of its patron St. Ranieri. That evening, lighted
candles are floated down the Arno River.

</P>
<P>
   One of the best places to catch the action is at Ocean Key
resort, which overlooks the famed Sunset Pier and the action in
Mallory Square and Duval Street. The resort's Come As You Aren't
four-night package offers lots of amenities and VIP seating on
Sunset Pier. The package begins at $2,919 for up to four people.

   How would you like to stay in a hotel built of ice? Until now
the only place in the world to do so was Sweden. Now the concept is
coming to Quebec City. Planned to open in January 2001, the second
ice hotel will offer a cinema, art galleries, a chapel, sleeping
accommodations for 100, and a bar where vodka will be served on the
rocks _ naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is planned to be open for three months each year and
then rebuilt the next winter. Accommodations are expected to be
about $100 a night.

   (UNDATED) _ Why is the oil price shooting past $30 a barrel yet
again?
</P>
<P>
   When, three months ago, prices last soared so high, the
explanation was clear: demand outstripped supply by some 2 million
barrels a day. Big consuming countries such as the United States
then bullied the OPEC cartel into agreeing to boost output by about
1.5 million barrels a day at its meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   As that oil came on to the market, prices fell sharply. Yet, in
recent days, they have shot up once again.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers are due to meet again on June 21 in Vienna.
Predictably, big oil importers are pushing for another large output
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Priddle, head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a
quasi-official group representing rich countries, this week said
that ``$31 Brent is not a signal of an adequately supplied
market.'' This time around, though, the cartel seems unlikely to
increase output by much.
</P>
<P>
   One telling portent was the collapse of its ``price band''
scheme last week. After the March meeting, OPEC ministers revealed
an ambitious new scheme to keep oil inside a target band of $22-28
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of a basket of seven OPEC crudes stayed above $28
for 20 trading days, they explained, the cartel would raise its
production by a modest 500,000 barrels a day ``automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Pand traders placed their bets, confident that the cartel
would not risk the blow to credibility that would come from
breaking its promise. Surprise: the criterion was met a few days
ago, but the cartel has yet to increase output one jot.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to think that the cartel will resist pressure to
raise output is that its members believe the American economy is
showing signs of starting to cool. They do not want to repeat their
mistake on the eve of Asia's economic crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then, OPEC expanded output, sending prices steadily down to
below $10 a barrel, and nearly bankrupting many producers.
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to think that OPEC will agree to raise output by
only a modest amount, if at all, is the answer to the question
raised by the IEA's latest analysis of the oil market: ``Why $30
oil?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Priddle's views on supply, his own agency's boffins do
not argue that high prices are chiefly the result of a lack of oil.
In fact, they seem to suggest the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand for oil in the second quarter will average about
74.4 million barrels a day, the agency reckons, but global supply
last month, thanks to a huge rise in Iraq's output, was running at
about 76.9 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, crude oil stocks in rich countries are rising fast.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is an accident of timing that has caused
shortages in the American gasoline sector, the world's single
biggest guzzler of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of gas were already low in March, and they have yet to
recover. Demand is still soaring, fuelled by the economic boom and
the arrival of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardly, the government has chosen this moment to order firms
to start selling cleaner types of gasoline in a number of cities.
Teething troubles at refineries producing the cleaner fuel have
interrupted supply and made the market tighter.
</P>
<P>
   All this explains why Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's secretary-general,
insists that, even at their current levels, ``prices are not overly
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cartel members agree with this assertion, but _ as at the
previous OPEC meeting in March _ not Saudi Arabia. The cartel's
heavyweight is one of the few members with lots of spare capacity,
is anxious not to offend the United States, and has hinted that it
wants an increase of a million barrels a day or more.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Saudis get such a huge increase? Probably not as easily
as they did in March. But with this rancorous cartel, nothing is
ever wholly predictable. &QL;

&HT;     COURT RESTORES INSURANCE BENEFITS TO AIDS PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The state Supreme Court has ruled that insurers
cannot cut off benefits to people who knew they were HIV-positive
when they applied for insurance and have paid premiums for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision gives people with the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, or AIDS, a major legal victory of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Monday ruled unanimously that California law gives
insurance companies two years to screen new policy-holders for
existing medical conditions and then entitles them to coverage for
disabilities, even if they were sick when they signed up for the
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned lower-court rulings that allowed an
insurance company to deny AIDS disability benefits to a five-year
policy-holder on the grounds that his undisclosed test for the AIDS
virus (or human immunodeficiency virus) showed that the disease had
already manifested itself, making him ineligible for coverage under
the terms of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The lower-court rulings had alarmed advocates for AIDS and
cancer patients and disability-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   They feared that insurers would use the same reasoning to cut
off benefits on the grounds that undisclosed tests years ago had
shown a susceptibility to a later disease, high cholesterol or
blood sugar, for example, or genetic markers for breast or prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates warned that denying benefits in such cases would
discourage people from getting tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California Supreme Court said once you have an insurance
policy for two years in California, you have peace of mind. An
insurance company can't go back and scour your medical records to
find some excuse not to pay you,'' said Jon Davidson, supervising
attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in Los
Angeles, a lawyer for the policy-holder in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling allows people who are HIV-positive, particularly
people who are asymptomatic, to get insurance and to get those
insurance benefits paid,'' said Janis Eggleston, who represented
the Bar Association of San Francisco and the AIDS Legal Referral
Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Current state law allows insurers to ask applicants about HIV
tests, and to deny coverage if a positive antibody test has been
confirmed by a second, more accurate test. But Eggleston said such
denials, which were not at issue in Monday's case, may violate
state and federal laws banning discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer, Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., received supporting
arguments in the case from the American Council of Life Insurance,
which said requiring benefits for illnesses contracted before a
policy was in effect would encourage concealment and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance lawyers did not return telephone calls about the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved Mark Galanty, 52, a court stenographic
reporter from the San Fernando Valley, who applied for a Paul
Revere disability policy in 1989. More than a year earlier, he had
tested positive for HIV, but had been told by a lay counselor that
the results were not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   He was not asked in his application about the HIV test, an
inquiry then banned by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Galanty was diagnosed with AIDS in 1994 and presented a
disability claim. The company paid until April 1995, but started a
new investigation of his medical records and cut off benefits after
learning of the HIV test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be responsible when I accepted a sales agent's
pitch about the policy, and I was shocked when, years later, my
claims were rejected,'' Galanty said Monday in a statement issued
by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His suit seeks the withheld benefits and additional damages. A
Superior Court judge and an appellate court dismissed the suit,
citing language in the insurance policy that denied coverage for
diseases that manifest themselves before the policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to say whether the HIV test
manifested the later diagnosis of AIDS. Instead, the justices said
the policy language was trumped by the two-year limit set by state
law for an insurer to dispute an applicant's eligibility.

HAVE IT YOUR WAY ON THIS SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cruising the way you want it. That's the newest idea to hit the
seas.
</P>
<P>
   A common complaint among those who avoid vacations at sea is
that cruising is too regimented. That is, you have to dine when the
line says so, rather than when you want to. That complaint is
usually accompanied by others, such as ``You have to dress up some
nights,'' and ''Cruising is too confining.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. or Miss No Cruise, have we got news for you. Your
excuses have all been washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line is introducing ``Freestyle Cruising'' to
provide passengers with a ``more relaxed, resort-style cruise
product with complete flexibility and non-intrusive service of the
highest standard,'' said Colin Veitch, president of NCL. ``The
implementation of Freestyle Cruising marks a tremendous milestone
for NCL and a return to innovative cruise vacations.``
</P>
<P>
   Freestyle Cruising is up and running aboard the line's Norwegian
Sky in Alaska, and will be available on Caribbean cruises this
fall, and throughout the fleet by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sky passengers now have complete flexibility as to when and with
whom they want to dine. From 5:30 p.m. to midnight, passengers can
choose which of the ship's three dining rooms or alternative
restaurants they wish to dine in and when. Passengers also have the
option of choosing their dinner companions and requesting tables of
two to 10 each evening rather than being assigned to a specific
table for the length of the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Formal nights are also out on the Sky. Typically, these occur
twice on a cruise, but on the Sky, the dress code calls for
``resort casual'' attire. But should you still like to dress up,
the Sky will have one optional formal night and reserve a dining
room and lounge for those in formal wear.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping has also been simplified. Instead of passengers having
to distribute tipping envelopes to waitstaff and cabin stewards,
the line is automatically adding to each guest's onboard account
the recommended gratuity to those staff members. Passengers have
the option of leaving an additional tip for great service, and
should they feel the service did not meet their expectations, they
may remove the charge from their final bill.
</P>
<P>
   The line is also increasing staff aboard the Sky by about 100 to
bring its crew-to-guest ratioto the level found at shoreside
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   While this is good news for many who have hesitated to board a
ship, a visit with a travel agent who specializes in cruises will
reveal that features such as those mentioned can be found on other
lines. For example, Princess and Carnival have 24-hour dining
aboard some of their vessels (allowing not only dining when you
want, but also providing a way to avoid the formal night); some
lines lines have a completely casual code. Holland America has long
been known for its no-tipping-required policy. Silverseas includes
some shore excursions in its price.
</P>
<P>
   And if your no-go cruise companion still insists that cruises
are too confining, book passage aboard Royal Caribbean's Voyager of
the Seas. This 142,000-ton vessel is the largest at sea and is the
equivalent of a land-based resort with all the usual cruise
amenities plus such features as an indoor ice skating rink,
climbing wall, miniature golf course, and inline skating track.
</P>
<P>
   So now what's your excuse for not cruising? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World cruise is out &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many have dreamed of taking a world cruise, but the cost
prevented the dream from becoming reality. So it was good news when
the World Cruise Co. was formed last year to provide a of more than
100 days for around $10,000 a person _ $5,000-$10,000 less than the
lowest price of other line's world cruises. But the news was not so
good for passengers aboard the cruise ship Riviera on May 23 when
they were informed the line was shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam Blyth, president of the company, said the line was
not filing for bankruptcy and that passengers aboard that cruise
would be compensated, many had to scramble to find rooms at their
unexpected final port of call in Tahiti and pay for flights home.
Blyth blamed the shutdown on fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the passengers were more fortunate. They had booked the
cruise through Grand Circle Travel, a Boston-based firm that
specializes in travel for those 50 and older. Hearing rumors of the
shutdown, Grand Circle obtained rooms and flights home for their 56
clients, as well as full refunds at a cost to Grand Circle that
could exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson from the line's failure is the importance of having
the ``right'' travel insurance. Those booking through Grand Circle
had solid protection, those booking independently might be out
financially. According to a story in the Los Angeles Times, the
Toronto-based insurance firm that sold travel insurance to
passengers said those policies were not intended to protect
passengers if the World Cruise Co. failed. Before obtaining travel
insurance, check to see what it does and does not cover.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth, who is also president of Marine Expeditions and a new
line that will offer cruises to Cuba, said those operations are not
affected by the World Cruise shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle said the reason it booked passengers on the World
Cruise Co. was the positive experiences its clients had on Marine
Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New cruises &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seven- and 14-day cruises up the Hudson River or through the
southern New England islands and along the coast of Maine are the
newest travel opportunities from American Cruise Lines. Its brand
new American Eagle will offer Hudson River cruises beginning July
1, then on July 8 seven days of cruising from Block Island to
Nantucket, and on July 15, a grand New England cruise among the
Tall Ships. The American Eagle carries just 49 passengers and many
cruises depart from Haddam, Conn. On Oct. 7 the ship sails to
Baltimore to begin a series of Chesapeake Bay and Williamsburg
cruises. For information, call 800-814-6880 or visit
www.americancruiselines.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sail and save &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windstar Cruises is offering those who plan and book ahead
savings of up to 50 percent off holiday cruises this winter. These
luxurious sailing vessels will be sailing to Caribbean ports unseen
by those on larger vessels. For example, the 312-passenger Wind
Surf's Dec. 17 Caribbean sailing of 10 days costs $3,073, half the
brochure fare of $5,870. For information, call 800-258-7245 or

 From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant assistants talk lovingly about the hand-stitching and
les petites mains that still work above the shop. Ask them nicely
and they will show you a hidden, brocaded room where duchesses and
pop stars come to try on the latest catwalk creations from Dior's
fashion designer, John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   In such a surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag
seems, well, rather a snip. But would it on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   The question that many luxury-goods companies now face is
whether they can peddle their illusions online, where shoppers go
for low prices and convenience, not mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Next week LVMH, the luxury-goods conglomerate that runs the
House of Dior, will announce the launch of www.eluxury.com, a Web
site selling luxury goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
   The site will feature 60 brands _ 2,500 items in all,
distributed from a warehouse in Memphis, Tenn. _ including
LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton, Celine, Kors, Givenchy and TAG Heuer,
plus other big labels such as Bulgari, Ferragamo and La Perla. It
will have editorial and videos of catwalk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other luxury-goods Web sites, most have been
unable to persuade labels to supply them with anything better than
limited, out-of-date ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is fear of discounting. As luxury e-tailers have cut
their prices to survive, the labels, fearing that cheap prices mean
a cheap image, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Though LVMH competes directly with the likes of Bulgari, it has
a big advantage. It controls DFS, a global chain of 154 physical
stores, where its own brands sell happily side by side with their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, says that, because DFS
has existing relationships with these other labels, it has been
relatively easy to persuade them to set up shop in cyberspace. He
says too that he has learned caution from the failure of boo.com,
in which Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, had a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new site's launch is next week, marketing will not
begin until the autumn. Yet, however cautious the site launch, the
Internet will never create the same illusion of prestige as a
physical store or a live catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that selling luxury on the Internet will simply
destroy the image that companies such as LVMH have invested so much
to create. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A brazen car thief has been stealing unmarked
cop cars in San Francisco and the police have been slow to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, three undercover police cars have been
swiped from a city lot near the Hall of Justice. But the department
failed to realize two of the cars were missing for a week or more,
and one of them was used to commit a minor crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder that not even police are safe from crime,''
department Chief Fred Lau said Monday. ``We need to be more
mindful. We need to be careful, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a car was noticed missing the day after it was used
for official police business. But no one noticed the other two cars
had disappeared because the inspectors who were assigned to them
were on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The three stolen cars are ``white whales,'' plain white
Chevrolet Caprices from the early 1990s, popular with many police
agencies. Each comes with a siren and a flashing light that can be
placed on the dashboard. But they do not have radios or other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cops and all the crooks recognize it as a police
car,'' said Lt. Dirk Beijen.
</P>
<P>
   The cars were stolen from the same police lot a half block from
the Hall of Justice. Although the lot is surrounded by a tall
fence, topped with barbed wire, the electronic gate has been broken
for months and the door remains wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Auto theft experts note that the Caprice is one of the easiest
cars to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking steps to make these cars be more secure,'' Lau
said, adding he also would make sure the gate to the city lot is
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The chief also noted that newer cars purchased by the department
have security features that make theft more difficult.

   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant assistants talk lovingly about the hand-stitching and
les petites mains that still work above the shop. Ask them nicely
and they will show you a hidden, brocaded room where duchesses and
pop stars come to try on the latest catwalk creations from Dior's
fashion designer, John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   In such a surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag
seems, well, rather a snip. But would it on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   The question that many luxury-goods companies now face is
whether they can peddle their illusions online, where shoppers go
for low prices and convenience, not mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Next week LVMH, the luxury-goods conglomerate that runs the
House of Dior, will announce the launch of www.eluxury.com, a Web
site selling luxury goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
   The site will feature 60 brands _ 2,500 items in all,
distributed from a warehouse in Memphis, Tenn. _ including
LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton, Celine, Kors, Givenchy and TAG Heuer,
plus other big labels such as Bulgari, Ferragamo and La Perla. It
will have editorial and videos of catwalk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other luxury-goods Web sites, most have been
unable to persuade labels to supply them with anything better than
limited, out-of-date ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is fear of discounting. As luxury e-tailers have cut
their prices to survive, the labels, fearing that cheap prices mean
a cheap image, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Though LVMH competes directly with the likes of Bulgari, it has
a big advantage. It controls DFS, a global chain of 154 physical
stores, where its own brands sell happily side by side with their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, says that, because DFS
has existing relationships with these other labels, it has been
relatively easy to persuade them to set up shop in cyberspace. He
says too that he has learned caution from the failure of boo.com,
in which Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, had a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new site's launch is next week, marketing will not
begin until the autumn. Yet, however cautious the site launch, the
Internet will never create the same illusion of prestige as a
physical store or a live catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that selling luxury on the Internet will simply
destroy the image that companies such as LVMH have invested so much
to create. &QL;

NORTHERN SCENERY WITH SOUTHERN CHARM AND FRENCH CUISINE

   NORTH HATLEY, Quebec _ Two countries, languages, and cultures
meet and mingle here in the Eastern Townships. As one local
resident boasts, ``We've got French cuisine, English gardens, and
Vermont scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   This rural region about an hour southeast of Montreal parallels
the border between the Province of Quebec and the State of Vermont.
The townships have always been a place apart and distinct from
neighbors in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Politically the townships belong to Quebec but geologically the
hilly and lake-dotted landcape _ ideal for hiking, biking, and
boating in summer and downhill and cross-country skiing in winter _
is an extension of the Green Mountains of Vermont. The Eastern
Townships resemble Vermont in other ways, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Township villages, with their white clapboard houses and
churches, tidy town commons, and old covered bridges, look more
up-country Yankee than Quebecois. They are also as rewarding to
explore as those in Vermont's so-called Northeast Kingdom, just
over the border.
</P>
<P>
   The province of Quebec is proudly (and officially)
French-speaking, and the townships are also known as
Cantons-de-L'Est. But many township communities have such
unmistakably Anglo names as Sherbrooke, Knowlton, Granby, Ayer's
Cliff, and Hatley. In most cases these are the surnames of
prominent British Empire loyalists (the Tories of American history
books) from the New England states who settled the region after the
American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   North Hatley, however, owes its distinctive character to another
group of Americans who arrived after another conflict. In the years
following the Civil War, well-to-do Americans from the Deep South
no longer felt welcome in New England resorts like Bar Harbor,
Maine, and Burlington, Vt., where they once went to escape the
summer heat. So the ex-Confederates founded a colony in North
Hadley. Some of the spacious summer homes they built on the shore
of Lake Massawippi are reminiscent of the pillared plantation
houses of the Old South.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the first language of most townships residents is French,
but North Hatley (population 750) has an Anglophone majority, and
English is the language of most summer visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The village center, at the northern end of Massawippi, is a
charming resort community, with antiques shops, art galleries, and
several lakeside restaurants. One popular spot, the Pilsen
Restaurant and Pub, has a long terrace at water level that is
delightful on sunny summer days _ but liable to flood on wet ones.
Notable among the art galleries is Galerie Blais, which displays
the work of folk artists from Quebec, the United States, Eastern
Europe, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Massawippi is 10 miles long and circled by a bicycle path that
in winter is used for cross-country skiing. The path is relatively
flat and has lake views all the way, making it popular with
cyclists of all levels.
</P>
<P>
   The townships have more than 200 inns and bed and breakfasts,
but three boutique inns on Massawippi _ Auberge Hatley, Hovey
Manor, and Ripplecove Inn _ rank among the best in the province for
both accommodations and cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-room Auberge Hatley, a member of the prestigious Relais
et Chateaux association, was built in 1903 as a grand summer
estate. It still has the feel of a country home. Rooms are bright
and cheerful, furnished with antiques and decorated with paintings
by Quebec artists. The dining room overlooks the lake, and the
menu, happily, is more French than Anglo-Saxon. The wine list is
awesome, offering a choice of nearly 1,000 different wines from a
cellar that contains some 10,000 bottles.
</P>
<P>
   In American dollars (worth about a third more than Canadian)
Auberge Hatley's per-person room rates, which include breakfast and
dinner, are roughly $82 to $163 a night. Like other area inns, the
Auberge requires a minimum stay of two nights on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Hovey Manor, also in North Hatley, has 39 rooms. It was built at
the turn of the century for a Georgia industrialist who modeled his
``cottage'' after Mount Vernon, George Washington's home. The manor
is impressive but not intimidating, with homey rooms, most with
lake views. Rates, with two meals (modified American plan), are
approximately US $78-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Ripplecove Cove Inn in Ayer's Cliff, at the southern end of the
lake, was built about 50 years ago in the style of the old Lake
Massawippi homes. The common rooms are decorated accordingly. There
are 26 rooms and suites. The cuisine served in the elegant dining
room is continental with local touches (the smoked salmon served is
cured on the premises) and the wine cellar is award-winning. Per
person MAP rates are US $90-$185.
</P>
<P>
   Two other area lakes, Lake Brome and Lake Memphremagog, the
southern tip of which is in Vermont, offer a range of recreational
activities and are popular weekend getaway spots for Montrealers.
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton, on Lake Brome, is an attractive village noted for its
many antiques shops.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sights _ not to mention sounds and tastes _ of Lake
Memphremagog is St. Benoit du Lac (St. Benedict of the Lake).
Dramatically sited on a point of land thrusting out into the lake,
St. Benoit is a large Benedictine monastery known for the beautiful
chanting of its choir. It is equally famous for the well-aged
cheeses and apple wines sold in its gift shop, both popular
souvenirs of an Eastern Townships visit.

   MEXICO CITY _ Mere weeks ago, Mexico's banking system looked
sickly and unpromising. Now it has a rather different air.
Following the second of two big mergers, the industry is stronger,
more solid _ and distinctly more Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12 the board of the country's biggest bank, Bancomer,
decided to reject a purchase offer from the country's
second-biggest, Banamex, and accept one from Spain's Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of uncertainty in a battle
of bids unprecedented in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, on which Bancomer's shareholders will vote on
June 29, the Spanish bank's local subsidiary, BBV-Probursa, will
merge with Bancomer. Though BBVA's $2.5 billion offer will give it
only 32.2 percent of Bancomer's shares, it will run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Gonzalez Naranjo, a vice-president at the CNBV, the
banking regulator, thinks the deal is ``very good news.'' A
Banamex-Bancomer merger would have given him and his colleagues
headaches, since the combined bank would have had some 40 percent
of Mexican deposits and nearly 70 percent each of both mortgages
and consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had warned that such a superbank could be a
systemic risk all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The BBVA merger, on the other hand, will leave two of Mexico's
three biggest banks under Spanish control (last month BSCH, another
Spanish bank with a Mexican subsidiary, bought Serfin, Mexico's
number-three bank, which had gone into receivership last year).
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the nationalism that might once have blocked
such deals. A good thing too: the extra capital brought in by BSCH
and BBVA will clean up their new banks' balance sheets, which have
looked poorly since the economic crisis of 1994-95 sent many of
their borrowers into default.
</P>
<P>
   Banamex does not have access to bags of foreign capital, which
is one reason why Bancomer turned its offer down. Even so, after
selling some assets this year, it is expected, like the other two,
to meet new capital-adequacy rules set by the CNBV _ two years
before the new rules come into full force.
</P>
<P>
   All this, combined with the acquisition of Banpais by Banorte in
1997, has led to a more consolidated, not to say rejuvenated,
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economic crisis, banks have lent little, partly
because of a lack of capital, and partly because they have been
reluctant to lend to risky borrowers under a legal system that
makes it hard to collect debts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks two badly needed laws, a bankruptcy law and a
loan-guarantee law, were passed after months stuck in Congress.
They are untested and the judicial system is still slow and
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws should boost efforts to persuade banks to restart
lending _ though not until after the closely fought presidential
election in July has passed, the markets have calmed, and interest
rates have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish acquisitions, combined with the presence of
America's Citibank, mean that around half the banking system will
now be under foreign control, putting Mexico on a par with such
countries as Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign expertise may be good for all the banks. But not all
such investments go smoothly. Citibank is currently in a row with
the government over a $2.5 billion promissory note, acquired when
it bought Confia, another casualty of the economic crisis, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To save interest charges, the government wants to prepay the
note, but Citibank, which wants to keep the asset on its books,
says this goes against the spirit, if not the letter, of their
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish invaders will need to be sure they have read the
fine print in their contracts. &QL;

   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts.
</P>
<P>
   The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black gold''
that lies under the region's forests: oil sands.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Pond, a British explorer, ran into the local Cree
tribe in 1778, he found them caulking their canoes with the bitumen
that is common in these parts. Three decades ago, firms began
commercial exploitation of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to advances in technology and declining costs of
production, optimists now think the region's huge reserves of this
mucky material could meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up
from just a quarter five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of such a bonanza might explain the upbeat mood in
Calgary, Alberta's second city and arguably its real oil capital.
The World Petroleum Congress (WPC) met there this week, and many of
the thousands of participants came to find out about the oil sands
of northern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is trapped in a viscous tar that is found under forests
the size of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   There is reckoned to be 300 billion barrels' worth of oil here,
greater than Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves; if brought to
market, it could fetch trillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there's the snag: extracting the oil from the tar-like
bitumen (tar sands is what old lags call oil sands) is not as easy
as sticking a pipe into the Saudi desert. It takes over a ton of
bitumen to make one useful barrel of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet firms have invested some $33 billion in the area to turn oil
sands into oil. Why? One reason is that oilmen see Canada, for all
its fissiparous tendencies, as much less risky than the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   It is also close to the giant American market. What is more,
says Wayne Kubasker of Exxon Mobil, ``The oil sands are there.
There is no risk in finding them. Finding and development costs are
much less than for conventional oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Production costs of $17 a barrel have fallen to less than $13 a
barrel over the past decade. The government helps with lavish tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Syncrude, whose main partners include Exxon Mobil, Gulf and
Occidental, mines two-thirds of the sands extracted today and plans
to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All this is encouraging, but the local optimism is probably a
bit excessive. After all, a barrel of Middle Eastern oil costs less
than $5 to extract. And little over a year ago, oil fetched less
than $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Until the cost of extracting oil from the sands drops by a lot
more, Saudi Arabia's supremacy in the petroleum world is probably
not under serious threat from Alberta. &QL;

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a longtime traveler, I have always observed a few rules:
Travel alone, travel lightly _ just a knapsack, if possible _ and
never plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The last is not necessarily part of the mantra but rather
procrastination born of an irritating inability to decide where to
go to fulfill a childhood dream to visit every place on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The group tours that we know today, with package prices and
knowing guides, were never for a free spirit such as myself. I
would see the world alone and unfettered by tour buses and
timetables.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, I was converted, to a degree, after an
all-inclusive group tour of Sicily proved to me that a woman
traveling alone could have a good trip in the company of people she
had never met.
</P>
<P>
   Though my past unplanned travels gave me no reason to be
anywhere at any given time, thus relieving me of one kind of
pressure, they presented another kind of pressure: worrying about
where I would sleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   My experiences have not all been pretty.
</P>
<P>
   On more occasions than I care to remember, I have arrived in
foreign lands in the middle of the night with no hotel
reservations. One was an unscheduled visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling back to the states from South Africa, I had stopped in
Nairobi and had a wonderful trip to Mombasa on the Indian Ocean
squeezed into a speeding taxi with seven Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the airport in Nairobi, however, I was unaware that East
African Airways required passengers to claim their luggage on the
tarmac, so when I arrived in Cairo, my luggage was still in Nairobi
and I decided to wait for it to catch up with me.
</P>
<P>
   It was past midnight when my flight arrived in Cairo and hotels
near the airport were booked. I asked a taxi driver to recommend a
hotel and, though I didn't speak Arabic, nor he English, he grinned
and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   As we sped out of the central area, it bothered me that the
landscape seemed more isolated. But, true to his word, the driver
deposited me at what I can only call an Egyptian bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no lock on my room door and there were men in
flowing garments, whom I presumed were guards, sleeping sitting up
in the hallways, I slept soundly, refreshed enough the next day to
see the pyramids and ride a camel.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, while I was arriving in South Africa to work on
a newspaper in Johannesburg, my luggage was mistakenly offloaded in
Monrovia, Liberia, and took six weeks to catch up with me.
</P>
<P>
   It also took all that time for me to have a cast removed from my
leg _ a fractured ankle just before leaving home _ so I made do
with the clothes on my back. That wasn't pretty, either.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Oslo, I also arrived in the middle of the night
without room reservations. I can't recall how, but I found a nice
little room and slept for the first time under a cozy duvet after a
scrumptious 3 a.m. breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   I have, also, arrived in the middle of the night in Saigon,
Singapore, Taiwan, and Bangkok, a forlorn, jet-lagged creature
looking for a room. Perhaps for a compassionate concierge. I always
found one.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the hotels I have booked into without reservations rated
mention in guidebooks. At some, I felt compelled to barricade the
door with a bureau and sleep with my clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   Spur-of-the-moment trips used to be my cachet. I was even more
last-minute than those ``last-minute'' travel opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   One year, covering a story at Logan Airport in the afternoon, I
purchased a ticket to London for that evening. I flew away without
having a place to stay but managed to get a room at the Brown
Hotel, which, I learned only later, was one of London's best. I
don't remember that it cost very much, but that was a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, a California couple I had met in Hong Kong invited
me to join them the following year on a trip to Australia. Not
wanting to be a ``third wheel,'' and possibly ruin their vacation,
I turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, I relented, got a ticket in Boston to
Australia one day and took off the next across the international
dateline in pursuit of my California friends. I hadn't told them I
was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Though I followed exactly the itinerary they had sent, I always
arrived at their hotel, in places like Samoa, Fiji, and Sydney, the
day after they had checked out. I never did catch up with them. I
was beginning to feel abandoned until I went on to New Zealand and
met a nice couple on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   A spur-of-the moment trip from Miami to Guatemala landed me
there one Christmas eve, causing the sweet maid who came in to turn
down my bed covers to burst into tears at the sight of a single
woman alone in a hotel room on such a night.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked her for the offer to visit her home but, instead, made
plans for Christmas day to fly on what turned out to be a very
small plane on a very bumpy ride to the Mayan ruins at Tikal. I
have a photo someone took of me after I had inched my way back down
one of the ruins stretched out on the ground in exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in Mexico City on my own, I suffered a sudden
attack of stomach pains and the hotel doctor had to be called.
</P>
<P>
   I left in a hurry when my skimpy Spanish made out the words
``gall bladder'' and what seemed to be the doctor's eagerness to
operate on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in foreign countries has also begun to rattle me. Years
ago, I was always fearless about driving on strange roads with
different rules and trusted my Massachusetts license would cover
me.
</P>
<P>
   Left-side driving, or right, I could do it. Once in Dublin, I
couldn't seem to get the small rental car out of the trolley tracks
and backed up trolley traffic for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Lone travelers have more chance to meet the locals. When I
finally got out of the trolley tracks and arrived in Killarney, I
stopped at a grocery store to ask about the Ring of Kerry. A
milkman who overheard me said he was making deliveries along that
route and invited me to ride along with him and I did.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I was so determined to travel alone that I
steadfastly refused to go anywhere on a guided packaged group tour
until friends invited me to join them on one to the former Soviet
Union in 1977. At the time, it was the only way tourists could
visit the country. I signed on at the last minute and had a great
time.
</P>
<P>
   At age 18, many moons ago, I spent the summer biking around
Europe with 10 other hostelers on a American Youth Hostel trip.
Though our itinerary was planned in advance and we had a terrific
leader, I was on my own a lot of the time, miles behind the rest,
pushing my bike up the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   One hot day in France, tired from pushing, I stopped at a cafe
for water and was, instead, given a greenish substance I later
surmised was absinthe. How else to explain that I took off my dirty
socks and threw them in a brook, then pedaled like a Tour de France
rider?
</P>
<P>
   During the same trip, I got stung by an insect and had to be
left at a hospital in Marseilles overnight where I slept fully
clothed in my jeans and flannel shirt until a doctor ministered to
my wound in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   When I was released, the hospital would not take money because
it turned out to be a mercy hospital for the needy. I caught up
with the others by train on the French Riviera and we shampooed our
hair in the ladies room of the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed on several weeks more after the other members of my
group flew home, exchanging my airline ticket with a stranger I met
in Amsterdam for a trip home on a freighter. While I waited for the
ship to leave, I slept in hostels and other less-than-luxurious
emporiums for wanderers like myself. I had several proposals, not
always of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week freighter trip, I found I was a passenger on
a ship that was bringing Dutch immigrants to Canada. I had a lower
bunk in steerage but never slept because children in wooden shoes
kept clambering up and down the bunks around me. Along the way, my
knapsack and sleeping bag were lost and only my bike and I arrived
back in the States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, the opportunity has come for me to travel again.
The same questions faced me. Where to go? How to get there? Do I,
now, still want to take chances on finding a hotel room? Sleep in
airports? (Not that I didn't recently almost do that). Do I want to
drive in countries where they drive on the left side? Do I want
people to talk to and to exclaim over the sites I would see?

   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts.
</P>
<P>
   The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black gold''
that lies under the region's forests: oil sands.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Pond, a British explorer, ran into the local Cree
tribe in 1778, he found them caulking their canoes with the bitumen
that is common in these parts. Three decades ago, firms began
commercial exploitation of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to advances in technology and declining costs of
production, optimists now think the region's huge reserves of this
mucky material could meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up
from just a quarter five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of such a bonanza might explain the upbeat mood in
Calgary, Alberta's second city and arguably its real oil capital.
The World Petroleum Congress (WPC) met there this week, and many of
the thousands of participants came to find out about the oil sands
of northern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is trapped in a viscous tar that is found under forests
the size of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   There is reckoned to be 300 billion barrels' worth of oil here,
greater than Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves; if brought to
market, it could fetch trillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there's the snag: extracting the oil from the tar-like
bitumen (tar sands is what old lags call oil sands) is not as easy
as sticking a pipe into the Saudi desert. It takes over a ton of
bitumen to make one useful barrel of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet firms have invested some $33 billion in the area to turn oil
sands into oil. Why? One reason is that oilmen see Canada, for all
its fissiparous tendencies, as much less risky than the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   It is also close to the giant American market. What is more,
says Wayne Kubasker of Exxon Mobil, ``The oil sands are there.
There is no risk in finding them. Finding and development costs are
much less than for conventional oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Production costs of $17 a barrel have fallen to less than $13 a
barrel over the past decade. The government helps with lavish tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Syncrude, whose main partners include Exxon Mobil, Gulf and
Occidental, mines two-thirds of the sands extracted today and plans
to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All this is encouraging, but the local optimism is probably a
bit excessive. After all, a barrel of Middle Eastern oil costs less
than $5 to extract. And little over a year ago, oil fetched less
than $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Until the cost of extracting oil from the sands drops by a lot
more, Saudi Arabia's supremacy in the petroleum world is probably
not under serious threat from Alberta. &QL;

Hafez Assad's 30-year dictatorship is honored for giving Syria
stability after years of political chaos. But it was stability of a
kind that most countries would gladly be without. Syrians, once in
the vanguard of Arab intellectual life, deserve better. Does Bashar
Assad, the heir-apparent-son-of-dictator, belong to the twilight of
the old era, or does he usher in a more enlightened one? Can he
perhaps be helped to move from one to the other? &QL;

   So Tony Blair is mortal after all. In the past few months
Britain's prime minister has suffered the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune: His party was defeated in local elections and
humiliated in the London mayoral election. Even now he still feels
driven to dress his policies up in grand-sounding, ``deeply

``third way'' (yawn) and all that. For the first time since Blair
entered 10 Downing Street, it is imaginable that Labour could
actually lose the next election. &QL;

President Hafez Assad's death, locals took advantage of their day
off to pour into the city's most famous ice-cream parlor, Bekdash,

but there was little of the sort of personal, genuinely heartfelt

last year. &QL;

fear that caring, consensual Canada might become a clone of its

not mystique. &QL;

Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of
uncertainty in a battle of bids unprecedented in Mexico. &QL;

last year. &QL;

`MISSILE' HAS HAD A STEALTHY LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the attention was focused on the Triple Crown,
Golden Missile quietly cruised to the top of the handicap ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old son of A.P. Indy went wire to wire to win the
$750,000 Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs Saturday in an
impressive display. That followed a tally in the Pimlico Special
May 13, and when combined with a second place in the Donn Handicap
at Gulfstream Feb. 5, he has done more than Behrens, who was
clinging to the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Off at 5-2 over a sloppy track, Golden Missile sprung to the
front under Kent Desormeaux, and held Ecton Park, a noted
mud-runner and the 3-2 choice, safe at the wire to score by nearly
3 lengths. Pat Day had Ecton Park on the rail all the way but he
could not gain on the winner. The final time for the 1 1/8 miles
was 1:49 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Missile is owned by Frank Stronach and trained by Joe
Orseno, the same connections as outstanding 3-year-old Red Bullet.
Just as Red Bullet, who took the Preakness, must defeat Kentucky
Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus to rule the sophomore division,
Golden Missile must beat Behrens to become the undisputed boss of
the older horses.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens finished behind Golden Missile in the Donn, captured the
Gulfstream Park Handicap, and ran second in the $6 million Dubai
World Cup. He has not raced since March, having suffered a foot
bruise that held him out of the Massachusetts Handicap and the
Foster. Golden Missile, who has earned more than $2 million with a
career record of 20-7-6-3, had one poor race this year, a fifth in
the New Orleans Handicap at Fair Grounds March 5.
</P>
<P>
   So the title's on the line, and Orseno figures the big showdown
will come in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent knows this horse,'' said Orseno. ``When he wants to run,
you can't fight him. He's at the head of the class right now. We're
the only horse in the country that has shown up in all of these
races. He's at the head of the class, at least until he runs in the
Whitney.''

   Super Red, who led all the way while winning the Connaught Cup
at Woodbine May 27, Monday was assigned 117 pounds for the $200,000
New Hampshire Sweepstakes at Rockingham Park Saturday. He is
considered a ``possible'' starter for the 1 1/8-mile turf event,
and was given the highest weight of those who may be entered.
Others whose connections are taking the race seriously include
Where's Taylor, at 114 pounds; Brawny, 112; The Kaiser, 112; Johnny
Dollar, 111; Mi Sierra, 111, and Makeyourselfathome, 110.
Christophe Clemente, who commands a powerful stable of grass
runners in New York, also is expected to be represented. He will
choose from among four nominees: Inexplicable, at 112 pounds;
Forbidden Apple, 111; Tiger Shark, 111; and Halcyon, 110. The
official highweight, Haami, listed at 118 pounds, is not expected
for the race. The field for the Sweeps will be drawn Wednesday.

   High Yield, a son of Storm Cat who was considered trainer D.
Wayne Lukas's best 3-year-old before Commendable took the Belmont
Stakes, suffered a fractured left front sesamoid in a workout at
Santa Anita June 12 and probably will be retired. ``The owners will
make a decision, but more than likely he'll go to stud,'' said
Lukas Saturday. ``I think he'll be a popular sire.'' High Yield was
a $1,050,000 yearling, and he won the Blue Grass at Keeneland.
However, he was overmatched in the Derby (15th) and Preakness
(seventh) . . . On a brighter note for Lukas, Exchange Rate, his
third outstanding 3-year-old, captured the $100,000 Northern Dancer
Handicap at Churchill Downs Saturday. Exchange Rate, a son of
Danzig, scored in the 7-furlong test despite a rough trip, blasting
past the opposition in deep stretch. It was Exchange Rate's first
start since he finished 12th in the Derby . . . It has long been
known, but it was officially announced Friday that Belmont Park
will host the 2001 Breeders' Cup Oct. 27. The 18th running will
mark the third time the Cup has come to Belmont (previously 1990
and '95), and the fourth time to New York (Aqueduct hosted in
1985). The eight-race Breeders' Cup card is worth $13 million, and
is anchored by the $4 million Classic. It is expected that the Cup
will head to California in 2002. Which track will host is
uncertain, but Hollywood Park has the early edge.

   Silic is 1 for 1
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Silic, who had not raced since winning last year's Breeders' Cup
Mile at Gulfstream, made a successful seasonal bow by seizing the
$400,000 Shoemaker Mile at Hollywood Sunday. Ridden by Corey
Nakatani, Silic held off fast-closing stablemate Ladies Din to
prevail by a half-length in the time of 1:33 1/5 for a mile over
the lawn. The powerful entry was held at 3-5 ($3.40 to win). ``Our
trip was just great,'' said Nakatani. ``He was going nice and
relaxed, and was into the bridle. When I called on him, he was
there. I got the right trip with the right horse.'' ``This horse is
very special,'' said Julio Canani, who trains the French-bred
(career record 15-8-2-0, earnings $1.4 million). ``He's a great
horse, an unbelievable horse.'' . . . Beautiful Pleasure, last
year's champion handicap female, breezed 6 furlongs in 1:13 1/5 at
Belmont over the weekend as she prepares for Saturday's Hempstead
Handicap. Beautiful Pleasure won the Shuvee at Belmont by nearly 7
lengths May 20. ``She came out of the work just fine,'' said
trainer John Ward. ``It was more like an open gallop. She's really
on her game.''

NASDAQ JAPAN GETS OFF TO A SMOOTH START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With his casual, all-black clothes, narrow black-framed
glasses, and thick crop of black hair, you know immediately who
Shinichi Nishikubo is: the owner of a fledgling Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, he has one more credential: His stock now trades
on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   After months of hype, Nasdaq Japan finally launched, trading
just eight companies, including Nishikubo's Masternet, an Internet
mail service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Nishikubo had managed to take his fledgling company public 2 1/2
years ago, on the Japanese over-the-counter market. When some
investors urged him to be one of the trial stocks on Nasdaq Japan,
he says he jumped at the chance. ``Companies in Nasdaq tend to be
highly valued,'' Nishikubo said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite the recent downward spiral of
Nasdaq-listed stocks in the United States, to many in Japan and
Asia, the market still is equated with making money.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan wants to attract others like Masternet. The market,
half owned by the Japanese technology giant Softbank Corp. and
affiliated with the Osaka Stock Exchange, is looking to add about
10 companies a month. Executives expect it will take about three
years before the market is ``robust.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of trading was unexceptional. Most of the shares
performed moderately. The listed companies seemed pleased that the
launch went off without a hitch. ``I am relieved, that's all,''
said Seiji Yoshikawa, president of asset management systems company
XNET Corp., whose shares rose 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sugi Pharmacy Co. was the most active of the eight companies
listed on the exchange, with 651,000 shares worth $5.4 billion yen
($51 million) being traded. The drugstore chain operator rose 29
percent to 9,000 yen, from its initial price of 7,000 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Masternet didn't fare as well. Its stock fell 300,000 yen, or 15
percent, to 1.65 million _ or $15,570.44 a share. One of the
difficulties facing start-up companies in Japan is that government
regulations base stock price on a multiple of net assets, pushing
prices too high for most investors. Just 18 of Masternet's 17,000
shares changed hands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Market executives expect US companies to list on Nasdaq Japan
later this year. Ultimately, the market's goal is to create a
global 24-hour exchange, in combination with Nasdaq markets in the
United States and Europe. ``The result is that companies all over
the world will be able to raise capital outside their home country,
that investors will be able to invest in companies outside their
home country,'' predicted Nasdaq chairman Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq had never thought of Japan, with its maze of stifling
regulations, as a place to open a stock market geared toward young
companies. But during a March 1999 dinner in Tokyo between Zarb and
Softbank chief Masayoshi Son, the idea was born.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they could take advantage of the rapid changes
Japan's once hermetically sealed financial system was undergoing.
In the last few years, the country has embarked on extensive
financial deregulation, known as the Japanese version of the ``Big
Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   That finally has started to shake up Japan's entrenched
corporate system, which gave little opportunity to individual
investors, kept funding out of the hands of start-ups, and
prevented companies from going public until they been around a
decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   The last year has seen the most visible change. High-tech
entrepreneurs are flooding Japan (Tokyo has its own ``Bit Valley'')
and venture capitalists started setting up shop and writing checks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq executives think the impending arrival of their market
helped propel the venture-funding boom. Investors ``knew there
would be a market where they could cash out. Our announcement gave
them hope,'' said John DeSaix, chief market strategist for Nasdaq
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan, says Luigi Limenpani, an equities analyst at
Solomon Smith Barney in Tokyo, ``could be the first real capital
market in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets have never had quite the impact on Japan's economy
that they have in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the entire story of Japan's post-war economic
bubble without mentioning the stock market. It's been totally
irrelevant,'' said Alexander Kinmont, Japan equities strategist for
Morgan Stanley in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Many hope Nasdaq helps companies change their attitude toward
the stock markets and brings in new investors. Japanese companies
are notoriously averse to disclosing information. Catering to
shareholders has never been a top priority, since most of the
owners are financial institutions or other corporations; as a
result, Japanese stocks don't hold much interest for individual
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Masternet has started handing out a slick presentation kit, with
brightly colored charts and graphs showing revenue, profits, and
future potential. Entrepreneur Nishikubo says he designed it to
ready his company for its new Nasdaq era.
</P>
<P>
   Nishikubo is even doing something unheard of in Japan: He's
taking on a director to his board who comes from outside the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan's listing requirements for publicly traded
companies are the same as in the United States, though it will take
some time for disclosure regulations to catch up and companies to
begin filing quarterly financial statements. Compared with Japanese
companies traded on the Tokyo board and five other regional
exchanges, Nasdaq-listed firms will offer far more information on
company performance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many remain wary about Nasdaq Japan's prospects. A main
concern is its relationship with Softbank. Analysts and potential
investors are worried that the market could be used as a personal
vehicle for Softbank to take public its many group companies,
including some that may not be worthy of being listed on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real concern and they have to be very careful to
separate their interests. The risks of running into conflicts of
interest are real,'' said Limenpani.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to announce the launch, Nasdaq chairman
Zarb bristled at any criticism that Nasdaq would not be transparent
and fair. ``It's illogical, has no substance, no merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq says its listing requirements will remain firm.
Executives also say that they want in time to reduce Softbank's
share and bring in other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan is not the first market for fledgling companies to
launch in Japan. In November last year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange
launched the Mothers market. With 10 companies trading _ seven
below their IPO price _ it hasn't engendered much positive
response. Listing standards are widely considered too loose, shares
are highly illiquid, and some of the companies a bit suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Many argue that Mothers' problems are actually bad for its
competitor Nasdaq Japan, because it has made investors wary about
new markets and new companies. If any of the companies listed on
Mothers actually fail, that could create more fear about investing
in any IPOs, on any market.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe it could take months, if not years, for
Nasdaq Japan to earn the trust of Japanese as well as foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts would like to see Nasdaq Japan attempting to
attract spin-offs of large Japanese companies. Not only would that
strengthen the nascent market, it would help the Japanese economy,
they say. That's because many Japanese companies are bloated with
subsidiaries that have little to do with their core businesses.
Economists believe that such restructuring could help Japan lift
from its current malaise.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of vibrant stock markets and companies trying to
please shareholders would be good for Japan, said Morgan Stanley's
Kinmont. ``It would turn Japan into something that looks more like
a capitalist country,'' he said.

KEEPING AN EYE ON ZERO.NET, AND A HAND ON THE WALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; These are building blocks for the new economy?
</P>
<P>
   This morning's subject: the activities of a West Coast
investment firm called Zero.net, the man who appears to call the
shots there, and the collection of mostly obscure technology
companies in Massachusetts and elsewhere that make up its
Internet-focused portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, our question: What's it all really worth?
</P>
<P>
   Zero.net first appeared in this space May 17 when we questioned
the sky-high valuation of Envision Development Corp. of
Marlborough, Mass., its single most important portfolio company.
Envision's public shares have taken a fall since then, slipping
almost 40 percent from $50 to $30.25 per share Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Envision Development has turned itself into a
business-to-business Internet specialist, but just nine months ago
it went public under the name perfumania.com with a plan to sell
discount fragrances over the Web from Miami. After a series of
acquisitions, a name change, relocation, and a sale of the perfume
business, Envision Development now touts serious high-tech ventures
but none that has reported any sales to date.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent news about Zero.net has come in dribs and drabs.
Andrew Evans, notable for his checkered background and former role
as personal money manager to Bill Gates, appeared to be the
financial decision-maker at Zero.net. There was the brief
appearance, then resignation, of the chief executive of New York
marketing-advertising giant Omnicom Group on the Zero.net board.
</P>
<P>
   Evans has been a low-profile figure for years now, after he and
his wife went to prison on charges related to bank fraud, and
unrelated insider trading allegations brought against him by the
Securities and Exchange Commission were settled in the mid-1980s.
The courtroom publicity forced an apparent split between Evans and
Gates, reportedly at the urging of the mother of the world's
richest man.
</P>
<P>
   Zero.net promotes itself as an organizer and incubator of young,
emerging Internet companies, but no one would mistake its
investments for the portfolios of the likes of CMGI Inc. or
Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   Even the origins of Zero.net are unclear. The company describes
a 22-year history on its Web site, but there is no real evidence
that it even existed prior to 1999. A public securities filing
stated that the company effectively was created by stock
contributions from two other Evans-controlled investment vehicles
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Zero.net reports interests in 13 privately owned businesses and
another six publicly traded companies, all of them connected with
the Internet or high-tech communications.
</P>
<P>
   Among the six publicly traded investments, Zero.net has a small
interest in Data Return Corp., an Internet hosting company with
modest but growing revenue and a stock market value of more than
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the public portfolio also includes companies such as
TeleHubLink Corp. of Burlington, Mass., which had been in the
telemarketing business but more recently refashioned itself as ``a
leader in secure wireless encryption technology.'' Talk about a
change in directions.
</P>
<P>
   TeleHubLink has a habit of not filing financial statements on
time; the most recent information we could find dated to October,
when it had recorded sales of $1 million over nine months. The
company didn't return our call.
</P>
<P>
   TeleHubLink shares, which traded for less than $1 at their
lowest levels last year, soared to $19 in March, the day before the
company announced the closing on new financing from Zero.net and
others. Shares were worth $4 Monday, giving the company a total
value of $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was surely good news for TeleHubLink's largest investor,
Stanley A. Young of Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who owns 19 percent of the company's stock, was in the
news four months ago when he agreed to pay a $100,000 state fine
and allow Massachusetts regulators to audit any future business he
may engage in to settle charges against him. Young was accused of
developing a system to inflate the value of stocks to help
fledgling companies find investors, in exchange for consulting
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting of all Zero.net transactions took
place last month, when separate announcements suggested the company
might acquire Envision Development and another of its portfolio
businesses, b2bstores.com, a tiny venture that went public in
February and has since lost most of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's unclear what, if anything, will happen, such a
transaction with either company could provide Zero.net an
opportunity to become a public company without ever going public in
the typical IPO process. It could assume the public stock of a
company like Envision Development and find itself with tradeable
shares, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Then the value of all those Internet ventures in the Zero.net
portfolio would become a more serious question. It might not seem
like much of a proposition at the moment. But another era of
Internet infatuation, if it ever returned, might convince
adventurous investors that Andy Evans is the new David Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   Snap out of it.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, June 25,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Moving in `e' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FISCHINGER-FILMS (Undated) _ Decades before computer graphics,
before music videos, even before ``Fantasia'' (the 1940 version),
there were the abstract animated films of Oskar Fischinger
(1900-1967), master of ``absolute'' or nonobjective filmmaking.
Each film is a personal expression that reflects Fischinger's
mystical spirituality, a confluence of Hinduism and Buddhism. By
John Canemaker.
</P>
<P>
   CLOONEY-FILM (Burbank, Calif.) _ The story of George Clooney's
rocky though successful rise from television bit player to NBC's
smash hit ``E.R.,'' and, most recently, to movie stardom, reveals
an actor who can be as confrontational as he is affable, as tough
as he is thin-skinned, who often really did do it his way. By Dana
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-SUMMER-THEATER (London) _ Americans still patriotically
smarting at the number of British prizewinners in this year's Tony
Awards need only visit the British capital itself to find a salve
for sore pride. If the New York theater sometimes looks a bit like
Shaftesbury-Avenue-by-the-Hudson, there are parts of London this
summer that might be Broadway-on-the-Thames or even
Hollywood-Near-the-Atlantic. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   JITNEY-THEATER (New York) _ On the surface, the play deals with
the social and economic troubles of the time through the impending
forced closing of the car service business, which will put the
drivers out of jobs. But as with all meaningful plays, ``Jitney''
operates on deeper levels as well. In the end, it is a play about
the meaning of love. By Wilborn Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-COMIC-ALI (London) _ Clad in his bright yellow athletic
warm-up suit, Tommy Hilfiger skull cap, sunglasses and dangling
gold chains, the British cult comic character Ali G brings a new
look to the complex racial mix of London nightlife entertainment.
By Andrew Ross Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BACH-MUSIC (Undated) _ On an anniversary or in any other year,
there can be few musicological questions more pressing than that of
how Bach's music sounded when it was being performed for the first
time, week after week, under the composer's direction in St.
Thomas' Church in Leipzig. Light on this subject is now being shed
by one of the leading practitioners of early music, Andrew Parrott,
in performances, recordings and a book: ``The Essential Bach
Choir'' (University of Rochester Press). By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   GILBERTO-LATIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ What Latin America struggles to
achieve in its civic life it produces effortlessly in its musical
art. That art is carried to its delicate conclusion in the music of
Joao Gilberto. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC-NATIVE (Undated) _ For those in the cities of the
north who like country music, it is music they like, not music they
live or grew up to. And it's definitely not the country music real
Southerners listen to. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC-CONVERT (Undated) _ New York Times reporter Peter
Applebome says that when it comes to music these days, for him it's
close to all country all the time. A country music convert tries to
explain how things worked out this way. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BALLETS-RUSSES (New Orleans) _ Everyone kissed everyone else and
the kisses were wonderful to behold. People kissed on lecture
platforms, in a hotel lobby, at an art gallery, at receptions.
There were delighted cries of, ``My dear, I haven't seen you for 50
years!'' And the remark was not hyperbole. Happy tears flowed like
Champagne. Champagne also flowed. All this happened at the Ballets
Russes celebration, an extraordinary event that took place here
June 1-4. It honored the three great companies with Ballets Russes
in their names: Sergei Diaghilev's pioneering Ballets Russes and
the successor troupes of Col. W. de Basil and Sergei Denham. By
Jack Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SIDEKICK-TV (Undated) _ It is the day after his last appearance
on ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' _ a day that a more
predictable type would probably describe as ``the first day of the
rest of my life.'' Nothing so shopworn comes from Andy Richter. He
takes stock in his own way, doing a kind of ``In the Year 2000''
routine about where he is and where he is going. James Barron
examines the death of the late-night sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WILKERSON-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ John Wilkerson was 7 when he dug
up a shiny stone arrowhead at a water hole near the family's small
ranch in Elko, Nev. Collecting arrowheads remained a passion
throughout his youth, spent among the children of ranchers and
Shoshone Indians, and much later, when he returned from college to
work summers as a cowboy and do research on the economics of
raising cattle in the West. Yet he never dreamed that in finding
that arrowhead at the water hole he had taken his first step toward
becoming, 50 years later, the president of the Museum of American
Folk Art in New York. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-GLOBAL (Undated) _ The Surrealist critique remains
the most useful method we have for revealing the values at work in
environments constructed in the name of civilization: a Tahitian
village in Tunisia, a Cambodian temple in Paris, or a freeze-dried
street festival at our feet. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Coded `t')
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AGENTS-WEBSITES (Undated) _ Correspondent's report:
European airlines and hotels are taking on Web discounters, but
travel agents don't like it. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Lead item: Cities go whole hog for
animal art and a couple of famous spuds. By Joseph Siano.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AIRLINES-CONFIDENCE (Undated) _ A year ago, the airlines
vowed to ``restore public confidence.'' So, how have they done? By
David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-EXPECTATIONS (Undated) _ Air travel is safe, and cheap.
Isn't that enough? By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AIRLINE-FOOD (Undated) _ Indigestible flying objects:
Good food, like good wine, doesn't travel well. By Mark Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ All it takes to cancel a flight
is an ill wind. Understanding and dealing with flight
cancellations. By Betsy Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AIRLINES-SLEEPING (Undated) _ Crossing the Atlantic in a
bed (take your own pajamas). By Peter H. Lewis.

   VOYEUR NATION: We've become a nation of peeping Toms. We like to
watch, and we especially like to watch real people in dangerous,
pathetic, embarrassing or scandalous situations. We peep into
private homes, island campsites, studio confessionals and any other
place human nature is on display. For many people, reality _ in the

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY: Fifty years after North Korea invaded the
South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000 American soldiers
dead, the border dividing the Korean Peninsula into Communist North
and Capitalist South remains the world's last Cold War fault line,
a place where U.S., South Korean and North Korean troops face off
across the most heavily militarized border anywhere in the world.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided peninsula,
shifting, yet again, the geostrategic stakes for the United States.
The costs and the benefits of half a century of U.S. involvement in
Korea, pegged to 50th anniversary, on June 25, of the outbreak of
the Korean War.

South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000 American soldiers
dead, the border dividing the Korean Peninsula into Communist North

a place where U.S., South Korean and North Korean troops face off
across the most heavily militarized border anywhere in the world.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided peninsula,
shifting, yet again, the geostrategic stakes for the United States.

PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN INVITES CHINA TO COPY SUMMIT MEETING OF TWO
KOREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Emboldened by last week's remarkably warm
summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas, Taiwan's new
president, Chen Shui-bian, on Tuesday invited his Chinese
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, to take part in a similar peace-making
effort across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``If North and South Korea can, why can't the two sides of the
strait?'' Chen said at his first news conference since taking
office last month. ``The Koreans have made a historic stride
forward. We can also make changes and create history.''
</P>
<P>
   But China predictably rebuffed Chen's overture, as it has
several other gestures he made since being elected the first leader
of Taiwan from outside the Nationalist Party in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chinese government said: ``The one-China
principle is the basis and precondition for peaceful reunification.
On this major, black-and-white question, we won't make any
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's proposal, while shrewdly timed and boldly phrased, was
not accompanied by any concessions on the key issue that has kept
Taiwan and China apart. He reiterated that Taipei would not accept
Beijing's pre-condition for negotiations: that Taiwan acknowledge
there is only one China, of which it is a part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he challenged both sides to show ``wisdom'' and
``creativity'' in crafting a new definition of ``one China''
acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   By seizing on the Korea summit meeting, however, Chen seemed to
be trying to shift the terms of the debate over cross-strait
relations. Rather than a standoff between a sovereign China and a
renegade Taiwan province, as Beijing contends, Chen painted a
portrait of two long-lost brothers linking hands.
</P>
<P>
   The progress between the Koreas underscores the paralysis in the
relationship between Taiwan and China. Although Chen's election did
not provoke military action from China, as Beijing had repeatedly
threatened, the two countries seem to be hunkering down for a
protracted stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten stuck,'' said Yung Wei, a longtime adviser to the
Taiwan government on cross-strait relations. ``The mainland Chinese
are being rigid. And Chen is not in a position to make an offer. He
wants to leave some room for a rapprochement without yielding a
basic point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the familiar posturing on both sides, Chen seemed
genuinely inspired by the Korean meeting. He said it was a symbol
of how bitter adversaries could put aside their differences in a
historic bid for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he had put a photograph in his study of the two
leaders, Kim Jong Il of North Korea and Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea, shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely invite the leader of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, to
join hands and work to create a moment like the handshake between
North and South Korea,'' Chen said Tuesday, smiling under a
sweltering midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   He also encouraged the United States to do more to bridge the
gulf between China and Taiwan. Chen said he expected the Clinton
administration to adhere to Washington's long-standing policy of
refusing to mediate between the countries. But he praised President
Clinton for reminding Beijing that Chen could not change Taiwan's
policy without the support of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States is willing, it can play a more active
role,'' he said. ``Keeping peace between the two sides of the
strait is not just in Taiwan's interest, it is also in the United
States' interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In dwelling on Korea, political analysts said Chen has more than
symbolism in mind. Several noted that Korea offers Taiwan a far
more appealing model for reunification than Beijing's preferred
example, Hong Kong. When China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997, it guaranteed the former British colony some autonomy but
otherwise politically subsumed its separate identity.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials said such an arrangement would not satisfy
people in this country, which has developed a vibrant political
culture and, with Chen's election, marked its first democratic
transfer of power since the defeated Nationalist forces fled to
Taiwan from China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas, by contrast, recognize each other in
international organizations like the United Nations. When Kim
Dae-jung traveled to Pyongyang, he was greeted by Kim Jung Il as a
head of state. Beijing does not use Chen's name in official
statements, let alone recognize his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan always used to talk about the German model for
reunification,'' said Antonio Chiang, editor and publisher of the
Taipei Times, an English-language newspaper. ``Perhaps now we're
going to start talking about the Korean model, which involves two
countries on a equal footing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like North and South Korea, Taiwan and China share a common
language and cultural heritage. But Chiang noted that the
Taiwan-China relationship differs in one respect. While Korea was
divided by war, Taiwan was ruled by the Japanese prior to the
arrival of the Nationalists. This colonial heritage makes people
here suspicious of foreign rulers, even if they are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   And while there has been little contact between the two Koreas,
China and Taiwan have not needed formal ties to develop a bustling
trade in goods and people. Relatives visit each other, fishing
boats from Taiwan moor in Chinese ports and 40,000 Taiwanese
companies operate on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Wei said the breakthrough in Korea carried risks for Chen. If
North and South Korea can ease the tension in their corner of Asia,
he said, other countries might press Taiwan and China for a similar
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Korean summit is going to have a major impact on
Taiwan,'' Wei said. ``The more the Koreans interact, the more
pressure it will put on Taiwan to agree to a framework with
China.''

SYSTEM OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DEEPLY FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for
commentary on the U.S. Constitution His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   The country is finally beginning to experience a backlash
against the blood lust of state executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, this nation has
executed 646 men and women in state prisons _ with the rate of
state-sanctioned killing increasing dramatically each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 98 inmates were executed in the United States _ a few
were mentally retarded or mentally ill and a number had committed
their capital crimes when they were juveniles. In 1995, there were
56 inmates executed; by 1997, the number of executions had climbed
to 74.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with criminal investigations and prosecutions of murder
suspects in Illinois have led to the release of more death row
inmates than have been executed since capital punishment was
reinstated in the state in 1977. Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who
supports the death penalty, is so disturbed by the flaws in the
system that he declared a moratorium on executions until the
problems are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, on the other hand, claims he has no
problem with the way capital punishment is meted out in his state.
Texas has executed 221 inmates, more than one-third of all those
executed in the entire country since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may not have a problem with the 131 executions that
occurred during his tenure as governor, but several in-depth
investigations of the death penalty system in Texas reveal deep
flaws that point to the probability that many of those executed by
the state have been innocent of the crime for which they were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has already executed 22 inmates this year, nearly half the
total number of inmates executed in the nation during the same
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative two-part series of news stories by the Chicago
Tribune, published earlier this month, showed serious flaws in the
trials that led inmates to death row. The Tribune reporters
examined trial transcripts, legal briefs, appellate rulings, lawyer
disciplinary records and interviewed witnesses, lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Tribune, in one-third of the capital crime
cases that were tried during the Bush administration, the
''defendant was represented at trial or on initial appeal by an
attorney who had been or was later disbarred, suspended or
otherwise sanctioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a significant number of Texas cases, the prosecution
presented damaging testimony from a psychiatrist who predicted that
the defendant would commit future violence _ without ever
interviewing or examining the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune stories report that in many of the capital cases
during the Bush administration, trial outcomes were influenced by
experts whose credentials were worse than suspect: A forensic
scientist, who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward, in
order to give testimony damaging to the defense; a psychiatrist,
who was nicknamed ``Dr. Death,'' and expelled from the American
Psychiatric Association; and a pathologist who has admitted faking
autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources have pointed to Texas lawyers who slept during
murder trials or who had been drinking, who had no trial experience
when appointed to defend a murder suspect, who never met with their
clients before trial, or who called no witnesses in defense of
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so bad in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court,
not known for coddling criminals or those on death row, vacated the
death sentence of Argentine national Victor H. Saldano because a
court-appointed psychologist had given racially prejudiced
testimony during the sentencing hearing. The psychologist testified
that Saldano was ``a continuing threat to society'' because
Hispanics are more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who argues that murder suspects in Texas get a fair trial
is either blind or ignorant of the facts. And Texas is the
execution capital of the nation _ it plans to execute 14 more
prisoners by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published nine-year study conducted by Columbia Law
School Professor James S. Liebman of death penalty cases between
1973 and 1995 concludes that death penalty cases in the states
``are persistently and systematically fraught with serious error.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that ``during the 23-year study period, the
overall rate of prejudicial error in the American capital
punishment system was 68 percent.'' Those were errors that were
caught. Not all errors are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much error, and the time needed to cure it,'' the report
states, ``renders unattainable the finality, retribution and
deterrence that are the reasons usually given for having a death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the new questions raised by prosecutorial
misconduct or trial error in regard to death penalty cases,
Congress has initiated the ``Innocence Protection Act'' in both the
House (H.R. 4167) and in the Senate (S. 2690).
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would allow inmates on death row to
request DNA testing on evidence from their case that is in the
government's possession. Many states put restrictions on DNA
testing. This bill would force states to keep biological evidence
and make DNA testing ``available to any person convicted in State
court.'' According to findings made by Congress, at least eight
individuals on death row have been exonerated by DNA testing, some
within days of being executed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a mechanism to ensure competent legal
representation in capital cases in all the states. And the bill
would require that judges inform juries that life imprisonment
without the possibility of release is an option to the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial system that metes out death cannot be so flawed that
innocent people can and inevitably will be executed. That isn't
justice. It's retribution gone mad.

SHAS QUITS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, THREATENING BARAK'S COALITION

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Throwing Israeli politics into an even greater
frenzy than usual, the linchpin Shas political party on Tuesday
quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas' resignation does not take effect for 48 hours, which
leaves plenty of time for political bargaining before Barak loses
his parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the strictly religious Shas party does leave, it will not
only reduce Barak to a minority government but also jeopardize his
plans for making peace with the Palestinians. The prime minister
would need the support of Shas to get a peace deal approved
smoothly by a sizeable majority of the parliament and by Israelis
in a popular referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials said that after a week of intensive,
sometimes round-the-clock negotiations, Shas and the prime minister
had worked out the major part of an agreement. And Shas politicians
made clear that if an effort was made to address their remaining
concerns, their resignations could well be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely an escalation,'' Eli Suissa, one of four
Shas members in Cabinet, said after submitting his resignation as
infrastructure minister Tuesday. ``But the ball is now in the prime
minister's court.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercising their raw power at a time when Barak considers a
peace agreement to be his singular goal, Shas' leaders are playing
a very public game of hardball in their quest to be treated with
respect and compensated for their indispensable support. They have
chiefly been demanding debt relief and tax forgiveness for their
religious school system as well as the legalization of their pirate
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But their gambit could backfire. Barak's associates said Tuesday
that the prime minister was fed up and contemplating the advantages
of reshaping his government without Shas. While such statements are
meant to pressure Shas, they probably do reflect Barak's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' latest political maneuver comes at a sensitive time in the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship, when both sides are maneuvering
toward what would be the endgame of their seven years of peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have viewed the chaos in the Israeli government
partly with suspicion and partly with concern. On the one hand,
they suspect that Barak is using his political problems as an
excuse to delay meeting their demands. On the other, they worry
that they no longer have a partner strong enough to make a good
deal and sell it to his public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they have displayed a willingness to step back. Senior
Palestinian officials said Tuesday that they would not press the
Israelis to stick to a June 23 deadline for their next withdrawal
from the West Bank. In the midst of Barak's political troubles, the
implementation of the transfer of land this week would have proven
all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said their leader, Yasser Arafat, was acceding
to a request that President Clinton presented in Washington last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to postpone the implementation for two weeks to
examine the possibility of reaching a final agreement,'' Ahmed
Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian legislature and the senior
Palestinian negotiator, told Voice of Palestine Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to push things forward speedily, the Israeli government is
putting on its own full court press to convince the Americans to
convene a retreat-style, Israeli-Palestinian peace summit meeting
in the United States in early July.

 &HT;    REPORTS SAY SMALL SCHOOLS WITHIN SCHOOLS WORK WELL
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dividing a big public school into smaller schools _
sometimes in the same building _ improves the performance of
students and teachers, according to a set of five reports released
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The results from a two-year study of small schools in Chicago by
outside researchers should help strengthen support for smaller
schools in several other big cities, said the main report's chief
researcher, Patricia A. Wasley, dean of the graduate school at Bank
Street College of Education in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Los Angeles have
small school initiatives under way,'' she said as she prepared to
brief advisors to members of Congress and presidential candidates.
``Oakland is preparing to move in that direction as well.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who obtained $45 million for small school
programs last year, has asked Congress to approve $120 million to
encourage the creation of smaller schools within 700 big schools in
low-income, low-performing districts next year. Final budget
negotiations this fall will decide the fate of his request.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 high schools (grades 9-12) and 33 elementary schools
(kindergarten through 8th grade) studied in Chicago each had no
more than 400 students and had been formed between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A handful are freestanding, but most keep down expenses by being
located within the same building as other small schools or a larger
``host'' school. They may or may not have fewer students per class.
</P>
<P>
   The small schools had roughly the same mix of students as other
Chicago schools that are neither magnet schools nor disciplinary
schools. ``Children in the schools are mostly from poor and working
class families and are predominantly young people of color,'' said
Linda C. Powell of Columbia University's Teachers College.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared the small schools' performance between
1997 and 1999 with that of their host schools and other Chicago
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that the smaller schools had:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer students who failed the promotion tests given in Chicago
in 3rd, 6th and 8th grade; more students who got high grades from
their teachers, and more students who improved their high school
scores in reading (though not in math).
</P>
<P>
   _ Lower dropout rates and higher attendance rates in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Passing rates in required high school courses that matched the
city average and were much higher than those in their host schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers who were less likely to use race or ethnicity in
generalizing about their students' performance, and who reported
greater job satisfaction, safer student behavior, more
collaboration with colleagues, and more efforts to improve the
curriculum and their own skills.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the small schools' average scores on annual
standardized tests didn't improve as much as the scores in other
Chicago schools. The researchers said smaller schools might have
lagged because their weaker students were less likely to drop out,
skip school on test day or be diagnosed as special education
students exempt from the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been at this long enough to know there are no silver
bullets in education policy,'' said August Souza Kappner, president
of Bank Street College, which published ``Small Schools: Great
Strides'' and its four supplemental studies.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``School size does not necessarily lead to good instruction,''
the researchers cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the size of the school to have an impact on
student learning, it has to influence and facilitate greater
instructional variation, class size, the quality of the task, and
the clarity of the skills and knowledge teachers wish to
inculcate,'' they concluded, after visiting several schools several
times. ``The work that students do needs to be rigorous and
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies of school size over the last decade have shown
that in most cases, ``smaller is better'' for low-income children,
but ``bigger is better'' for children from high-income families.
Bigger public schools can be cheaper per pupil, but nearly as
expensive per graduate, since the big schools usually have more
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   But those studies were based on the traditional model of one
school per building or campus, and cannot be compared directly with
the new study, which concentrated on smaller schools that shared a
principal, building or campus with other schools.

GEWURZTRAMINER: GIVE LOVE A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that people either love
gewurztraminer or hate it. I disagree. Most people have no idea
whether they love it or hate it, because they've never tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe people are scared off by the daunting name (pronounced
guh-VERTS-trah-meen-er), or the wine's reputation for exotic
flavors: gewurztraminer is usually described as tasting like
litchis, rose petals and grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to love this extravagantly fragrant white wine, but in
small doses, because I find many gewurztraminers to be not very
flexible with food. Their potent flavor tends to overpower most
foods, although they are a fine accompaniment to choucroute garni,
the Alsatian sauerkraut and pork extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the food issue is paradoxical. Gewurztraminers
range from dry and fairly simple to unctuously powerful, complex
and sweet. Not surprisingly, the complex wines are more expensive,
costing $50 or $60 a bottle, and generally do very well in wine
ratings. But the simpler bottles, which balance the more exotic
elements with a breezy dryness and citrus flavors, are better with
food.
</P>
<P>
   Gewurztraminer is mostly identified with Alsace, where it
flourishes in the region's cool climate, but it also does well in
parts of Germany, particularly the Pfalz, and in some cooler areas
of California, like the Anderson Valley in Mendocino County.
Another dose of conventional wisdom has it that California can't
produce good gewurztraminers, but examples from both Navarro
Vineyards and Handley Cellars are just the sort of dry
gewurztraminers that work with food.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to deride the richer examples. They are by all
means great wines, and can be enjoyed as aperitifs or for dessert.
But with dinner, stick with simplicity.

TAKE A FUN, FAST-PACED RIDE IN `HOT SIX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Evanovich's hilarious sixth mystery again features the
very likable, yet inept, New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Cross,
who amazingly always gets her man, in ``Hot Six'' (St. Martin's
Press, $24.95, 294 pages).
</P>
<P>
   After talking her friend Carol out of jumping off a bridge,
Stephanie heads for the office of her Uncle Vinnie, a bail
bondsman, hoping he has some wayward bondees who need picking up.
Right now Stephanie's bank account is as nonexistent as her love
life. And does Vinnie have a job for her. Ranger _ a really good
bounty hunter, a former soldier of fortune with a strong stock
portfolio and Stephanie's mentor and sometimes lover _ has failed
to appear on charges of carrying a concealed weapon. And now,
Ranger is considered a prime suspect in the murder of the son of
Alexander Ramos, an international black-market arms dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Stephanie refuses to take the case. So Vinnie gives
her three lowlife AWOLS to detain: Morris Munson, who ran over his
wife, ``beat her with a tire iron, raped her and tried to set her
on fire''; Walter ``Moon Man'' Dunphy, wanted for drunk and
disorderly conduct; and Lenny Dale, charged with domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Another old lover, Trenton Vice Cop Joe Morelli, asks Stephanie
to let him know if she hears from Ranger. Saying yes to Morelli,
Stephanie heads off for the home of Dale, who is having a big fight
with his wife. Before Stephanie can cuff him, Dale dies of a
massive heart attack. Next she stops at Moon Man's place; he
invites her in for lunch so he can watch the end of a ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she has a lunch date with her mom, Stephanie says she'll
come and get him later. As soon as she gets out the door, two thugs
in a black Lincoln pull over and tell her to get in. No way is
Stephanie going to get into a ``mob staff car with two strange men,
one of whom is a Pakistani with a .38 tucked into his Sans-A-Belt
pants, partially hidden by the soft roll of his belly, and the
other is a guy who looks like Hulk Hogan with a buzz cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Habib, the Pakistani, and Mitchell, the buzz cut, are after
Ranger and tell her they are going to tail her because they figure
Ranger will eventually contact her.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, she picks up Moon Man and takes him to the Trenton
Police Station to get him a new bond. She leaves him with the
docket lieutenant and heads upstairs to check in with Brian Simon,
who arrested Carol. He agrees to drop the charges, but tells
Stephanie she owes him big time. When she gets back downstairs,
Vinnie is there, but not Moon Man. He is out in the parking lot
watching Stephanie's car burn _ seems he dropped a lighted reefer
and the car caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie thought the day couldn't get any worse until her
grandmother shows up at the door with a suitcase and says she is
moving in until she finds her own apartment.
</P>
<P>
   We're at page 36 in this wildly funny and amazingly fast-paced
look at the wacky life of a dysfunctional bounty hunter, whose
trials and tribulations have only just begun. Crisp and sassy
writing fuels the funny world of Stephanie Cross, which is peppered
with characters who would fit in nicely in Quentin Tarentino's
``Pulp Fiction.'' As always, Evanovich has a sure-fire summer hit.

   ``Controlled Insanity.'' By Randy Cruts. Black Forest Press.
$14.95. 418 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cruts' second thriller featuring Navy SEAL Lt. Nick Cutter
is a fast-paced joy ride into the world of international terrorism
and drug-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Cutter heads a covert counter-terrorism team that is sent to
Bosnia to assassinate two of its leaders. After a very difficult
high-altitude jump, Cutter's team lands in Bosnia and heads for a
hunting lodge where the two Bosnians are scheduled to meet.
However, before they can accomplish their assignment, another
assassin kills not only the two Bosnian leaders, but also their
entire entourages.
</P>
<P>
   Airlifted out, the team returns to base and is immediately sent
to the Caribbean to kill the computer whiz of a giant drug cartel.
The target, Shane Kearny, tells them that he no longer works for
the Mauricio Moncada drug cartel because the cartel is funding the
Islamic Ibn Allah terrorist group. Cutter decides to spare Kearny's
life and take him back to the United States for a debriefing.
</P>
<P>
   Cutter, his team and his girlfriend become targets of the
cartel. It's a fight of good vs. evil as the action mounts. Cruts
gets carried away with technical jargon in some sections, but cut
that out and you have a perfect book to take to the beach or keep
you occupied on your next plane ride.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Deep South.'' By Nevada Barr. G.P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95. 340
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep South'' finds National Park Service Ranger Anna Pigeon
moving from her beloved Colorado mountains to Mississippi to become
district ranger for the Port Gibson District of the Natchez Trace
Parkway. After 22 hours of driving, she sees a sign that says
``REPENT,'' then a bullet-riddled sign with the words ``REPENT.
FINAL WARNING.'' Next thing she knows, she skids and the car and
U-haul are off the road. Some local fisherman help her get the car
and U-haul back on the road and in the right direction. Turns out
one of the rangers she'll be supervising gave her wrong directions.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the beginning of the problems she will encounter on
her new assignment. On her first night, she is awakened in the
middle of the night by a camper complaining of some joy-riding
kids. Pigeon trails them to a nearby church and cemetery. The boys
flee but before returning to her house near Rocky Springs
Campground, Pigeon hears crying and discovers a drunken teenage
girl in the cemetery. Pigeon takes the teen back to her place and
puts her to bed. After the girl's parents pick her up the next
morning, Sheriff Paul Davidson stops by to say a teen is missing.
Pigeon says Heather is safe, but Davidson says he is looking for
Danielle.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeon returns to the cemetery and begins to search the area and
eventually finds Danielle's body with a sheet over her head and
noose around her neck. As Pigeon begins her investigation, she
encounters resentment from her co-workers and eventually becomes a
victim of some very dangerous practical jokes. ``Deep South'' has a
well-crafted plot, strong characters and realistic dialogue.

AMARILLO BUSINESSMAN SEES PROFIT POTENTIAL IN A LIQUID, AND IT'S
NOT OIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Edna Ferber's ``Giant'' were updated to reflect the New Age
wildcatters of Texas, the epic drama could have a decidedly
different look.
</P>
<P>
   James Dean's character, Jett Rink, would not stand on the porch
of the Benedict family mansion, dripping oil from all over his
body. In the new version, Rink would drip, but he would be clean as
a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Water might soon be the state's newest liquid gold. Oil
continues to lubricate the wheels of commerce in West Texas, but
with a growing population sucking up the state's groundwater, new
pipelines are needed to move crystal-clear, life-giving H2O across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   It seems inconceivable at the moment. With city streets still
damp from recent rains, water doesn't appear such a valuable
commodity. In a state that just weeks ago was crying about a
suffocating drought, the most recent headlines bemoan record
downpours.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, this year's rainfall is 6 inches above normal. The
Concho Valley, in the San Angelo area, saw flash floods this
weekend. Lubbock has the highest June rainfall total ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the drought will return; it always has. And entrepreneurs
are stationing themselves to reap the benefits of waterless cities
and barren fields.
</P>
<P>
   Amarillo oilman T. Boone Pickens has been buying up water rights
in the Texas Panhandle, and he intends to pipe the water to needy
cities such as San Antonio, El Paso and perhaps Abilene, Dallas and
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetwater has used its right of eminent domain to condemn 705
acres southwest of the city to develop wells that could deliver a
million gallons of water per day to the community.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted a lawsuit involving a Fort Worth company. Duer
Wagner and Co., a petroleum producer, owned the property, and when
Sweetwater took possession, the company tried to negotiate a
selling price with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Duer Wagner recognized that the city was buying the land not for
its surface but for its underground resources. In Texas, water will
continue to be a valuable resource, and that's what Sweetwater was
after.
</P>
<P>
   The company asked more than $6,500 an acre. The city offered
$300 an acre, the land's appraisal value.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to court, and the city won. But that was only the
first round. An appeal is pending, and all of West Texas, along
with a bunch of ``water wildcatters,'' is watching.
</P>
<P>
   It seems improbable that parched, cactus-filled West Texas land
could go for thousands of dollars an acre or that a network of
pipelines will spill out of the high plains to supply cities far to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   But even the lawyers who won the initial Sweetwater case
understand that the issue is far from closed. They admit that there
is little or no precedent for this kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   And cities such as San Antonio that have seen their own water
sources dwindle to alarmingly low levels have shown interest in
Pickens' Panhandle pipelines. Pickens says he has bought up 100,000
acres of water rights and is looking for another 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The hotter the summer, the higher the interest.

EXCEEDING THE CLOTHING-CARE INSTRUCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICAN FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in elementary school, my father took me to see the
Jackson 5. Michael Jackson was my age then; now, for some reason,
he's younger than I am.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there were four of us at the concert: me, my dad, my
friend Cynthia and her father. It was my first concert, and I was
so excited. As I recall, it was held at the Tarrant County
Convention Center and we had floor seats.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't too alarmed when the Jacksons came out and everyone
stood up to cheer. However, imagine my dismay when it became
apparent that those evil, tall people in front of me were not going
to sit down. I couldn't have been much over 4 feet tall, so even
when I stood on my chair, I could only make out the several
bouncing, black mushrooms, which I assume were the tops of their
Afros.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing my consternation, my father gallantly hoisted me to his
shoulders and there I remained until the end of the concert. Now I
could see Michael and those other guys. (I was so in love with
Michael!!!)
</P>
<P>
   But even better, Michael could see me in my white dress with the
red patent leather vest stitched onto the front of it. I loved that
dress almost as much as I loved Michael. It was my favorite piece
of clothing. I would still have it if my mother hadn't thrown it
out when I moved away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh, sigh.
</P>
<P>
   When we bought that dress, it fell below my knees, but by the
time I was banned from wearing it, it was a mini.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, I do understand that people have their favorite
attire. However, I do not understand why my boys love certain
clothes so much that they wear them until they fade while other
things remain in the drawer undisturbed until they're too small.
Don't they want a little variety? How many times can you wear a
shirt that says, ``Here's a dollar. Buy yourself some game.''?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, your friends would notice after a while.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son will bypass clean clothes and try to dig that
awful shirt out of the dirty laundry if he's going somewhere
special. Why does he think that I won't notice? Even if his friends
don't care, I care.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a lot of clothes, because he's growing so fast,
but he does have enough T-shirts to get through the week. I'm not
even going to go into his one pair of size 16 athletic shoes that
we have to special order.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, baby brother has a potpourri of clothes. He
gets hand-me-downs and new stuff so there is no reason for him to
keep wearing that same pair of too-big shorts that hang off his
little, narrow hips. I am sick of those shorts. Last week, he
plucked that single pair of shorts out of his overflowing bag of
dirty laundry and washed them. He wasted all that water on one pair
of shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mom, I didn't want to wear those other clothes,'' he
explained, when I admonished him. ``Look at my brother. He's
wearing that dirty T-shirt again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's a girl to do? When my youngest got ready to go to camp,
he was practically in tears because he didn't have enough cool
clothes to take with him. I dug through the faded items at the top
of his drawer and found two brand new T-shirts buried underneath.
My sister bought him those for Christmas but every time he washes,
he puts the favorites back on top of everything else in the drawer
and then he wears the same clothes again.
</P>
<P>
   When I gave him the shirts, he said, ``Oh yeah, I forgot about
those. Where were they?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's all I have to say about that because it's obvious
they aren't going to change any more than I did when I was their
age. However, did you know that I was a major influence on Michael
Jackson's wardrobe? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   When we went to that concert, I was wearing white socks with my
white patent leather shoes. A few years later, guess who started
wearing white socks everywhere he went?
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? I think not.

</P>
<P>
   When I gave him the shirts, he said, ``Oh yeah, I forgot about
those. Where were they?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's all I have to say about that because it's obvious
they aren't going to change any more than I did when I was their
age. However, did you know that I was a major influence on Michael
Jackson's wardrobe? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   When we went to that concert, I was wearing white socks with my
white patent leather shoes. A few years later, guess who started
wearing white socks everywhere he went?
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? I think not.

SANCERRE, THE ULTIMATE SUMMER WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has one great white wine, chardonnay. There are, of
course, a host of runners-up: sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, pinot
blanc, pinot gris, viognier, riesling and a few hardly worth
mentioning, like trebbiano.
</P>
<P>
   France, on the other hand, has an abundance of great white
wines. They start with Burgundy and its superstars like
Batard-Montrachet and Corton-Charlemagne. A few miles up the road
toward Paris is Chablis, whose steely, green-gold wines have never
met a crustacean they couldn't ennoble. Alsace offers its elegant
rieslings. To some connoisseurs, wines like Trimbach's Clos
Ste.-Hune and Zind-Humbrecht's Clos St.-Urbain are the finest of
all white wines.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Sancerre. Is it equal to the others in breed
and finesse? Perhaps not, but it is beloved in France and in much
of Europe as the ultimate summer wine, a wine for picnics (dejeuner
sur l'herbe, as they say over there) and for parties. It may be
France's friendliest white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Sancerre is a place, not a grape. It's in the beautiful Loire
Valley about 120 miles south of Paris. The grape is the sauvignon
blanc, which shows up in many Loire Valley wines, including Quincy,
which almost rhymes with ``can't see'' and is the name of another
town, and Pouilly-Fume, which is named for Pouilly-sur-Loire,
across the Loire River and a few miles south of the village of
Sancerre. The wine has lots of acidity and a pronounced herbaceous
taste. At its best, Sancerre is fresh and lively and should be
drunk young.
</P>
<P>
   (Don't confuse Pouilly-Fume and Pouilly Fuisse. Pouilly Fuisse
comes from southern Burgundy and is made from the chardonnay
grape.)
</P>
<P>
   The name Sancerre comes from castrum sancti satyri, which is
Latin for ``stronghold of the holy satyrs.'' The name also lingers
in a neighboring village called St.-Satur. What went on in those
parts in Roman times is anyone's guess, but today it is wine
country.
</P>
<P>
   For almost half a century, Sancerre has been the white wine of
choice in Paris bistros. In the 1950s, production amounted to about
50,000 cases a year. Today, it's close to a million.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Friedrich, in her book ``A Wine and Food Guide to the
Loire'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co., 1996), traces Sancerre's popularity back
to 1946, when Edward Alphonse Mellot, a Sancerre producer, opened a
wine bar on the Avenue Rapp in Paris. Its name? Le Sancerre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists, writers and gastronomes _ from Jean Cocteau to Jean
Marais to Curnonsky _ regarded Sancerre as the little white they
drank with shellfish platters,'' she wrote. ``Then Chablis prices
skyrocketed after a killer frost in 1956. And autoroutes took
Parisians past Sancerre on their way to the ocean. Its success has
not yet peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   The best Sancerre doesn't come from Sancerre. It is to be found
in neighboring towns like Bue, Chavignol and Verdigny. The best
wines are sold under the names of locations within those towns like
La Perriere in Verdigny and La Poussie in Bue. Some of the best
producers include the Domaines Alphonse Mellot and Roger Neveu,
Cotat Freres, and Pascal Joliver.
</P>
<P>
   The Mellots, who are led, according to Friedrich, by the 18th
Alphonse, are one of the best known families in the region because
their wines are good and because they run a highly visible
restaurant, Mellot, in the village of Sancerre, along with a
tasting room and wine shop. Their best wine, Cuvee Edmond, is made
from vines up to 60 years old and is partly vinified in oak
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The most talked-about wine in the Sancerre region at the moment
is made across the river in the village of St.-Andelain, near
Pouilly; it is Didier Dagueneau's Pouilly-Fume. Dagueneau is a
highly vocal champion of low yields in the vineyards, and like many
crusaders he does not hesitate to denounce competitors who he
contends make thin, characterless wines.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his most sought-after wines are Pur Sang _ thoroughbred _
and Silex. Most Sancerres and Pouilly-Fumes sell in the $15 to $20
range. These two can sell for $50 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my favorite wines from this region come from Quincy,
about 25 miles west of Sancerre. The wines occasionally lack the
raciness of the best Sancerres, but the best of them can be sharp
and refreshing. Quincy is an appellation that nearly died out in
the 1960s and 1970s but has been growing and improving since then,
thanks to the big demand for white sauvignon wines in Paris and
across northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Reuilly, a few miles from Quincy, has much the same history, and
some observers, Friedrich among them, believe that eventually it
will emerge as a closer competitor to Sancerre.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Sancerre rouge _ red Sancerre _ became popular as
the wine to go with nouvelle cuisine. Most Loire reds are made from
the cabernet franc grape. Sancerre rouge is made from pinot noir
grapes. But any resemblance to the pinot noirs of Burgundy or
America's West Coast are accidental. Their popularity has declined
with that of nouvelle cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   A few producers take their reds seriously, and the result is a
full-bodied wine worth sampling as a curiosity. But the best place
to drink Sancerre rouge is in the restaurants around Sancerre when
the wines are fresh and young. There is also a pleasant rose. Come
to think of it, aren't all roses pleasant?

IMPOSING ORDER ON CLUELESS YOUTH IS NOT A BAD IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When I was bad, my parents threatened me with
military school, which usually shut me up.
</P>
<P>
   I took them seriously. I had no idea of the huge cost of what I
was sure would be a private penal colony. In fact, they were no
more likely to send me to military school than to Ft. Lauderdale on
spring break.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I spent many morose hours curled up with the New
York Times Magazine scanning its inky, small-type ads for military
schools. Then and now they've been upbeat. In a recent issue:
``Positive peer pressure and brotherhood within a structured
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   But I've never been fooled.
</P>
<P>
   What they're really all about is whipping into shape fat, thin
or otherwise aberrant youth by getting them away from their junk
food and their funky friends _ and putting them under the thumb of
some Nazi masquerading as an educator.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I was sure I wouldn't fit in. In retrospect, I
probably would have done fine. There are ways to be an obnoxious,
know-it-all in uniform if you are creative and hard-headed. I like
to think I would have found those ways.
</P>
<P>
   The difference would have been that I'd have been out of the
house, but not out of chances. Military school might have been an
improvement. The structure would have helped.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? My teacher might have been someone like Robin
Williams in ``Dead Poets' Society,'' instead of Hermann Goering Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad idea to impose order on clueless youth. That's
what the opponents of Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown's plan for a
National Guard-run charter school fail to understand.
</P>
<P>
   They believe the aging Mayor Moonbeam is being mean when he
talks about a new school _ serving an eventual 1,000 students, many
of them minority and low income _ at the old Oakland Army Base.
</P>
<P>
   They hear ``military'' and think Vietnam and the California
Youth Authority. They hear ``charter school'' and think Brown is
abandoning public education.
</P>
<P>
   But military schools aren't necessarily the same thing as the
military or juvenile hall. They are simply a different approach to
education and to the delicate years of early and late adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is structure necessarily a ball and chain. For someone
wandering in the wilderness, it can be a road map. How often have
you heard tales of the children of hippies and political radicals
from the '60s going to the Air Force Academy or West Point? I have
_ often enough to detect a trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding stodgy and illiberal, may I suggest that
being educated in a challenging setting and taught self-discipline
might be more of a growth experience than dealing drugs, hanging
around the 'hood or even traveling aimlessly around the world
because you can't hack college?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a college preparatory program run in a military style. We
don't train anyone to go into the military,'' project director
Ralph Marinaro, a brigadier general in the California National
Guard, has said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are reasonable people who have doubts about the
idea, which has been rejected by the Oakland school board and some
leading clergymen. They say the money, which could amount to more
than $1 million, would be better spent improving the conventional
public schools in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Dan Siegel, who first supported Brown, then
opposed him, says the mayor's idea ``is a model that, at most, will
only benefit a small number of students.''
</P>
<P>
   A weak criticism, I think. There always have been specialty
schools benefiting a small number of students. Those schools
attract a large number of students over time and serve as examples
to other schools from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Brown _ who was educated by the Jesuits, as militant a clerical
order as you'll find _ predicts parents and kids will be fighting
to get into his charter school. I'll bet he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Oakland students and parents, their mayor, who
has been committed to upgrading the city's awful educational system
since taking office two years ago, won't back down. He's looking to
neighboring educational systems for support. There's nothing to
stop him from getting funds from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is at public schools in Oakland now,
they have armed policemen with loaded revolvers, with Mace, with
handcuffs and nightsticks patrolling the yards. I mean, it's
crazy,'' Brown told CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   I love it when Mayor Moonbeam talks dirty like that. But
seriously: It isn't ``dirty'' at all. It's straight talk _
something you rarely hear anymore.

AMUSEMENT PARK PRICES ON UPSWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN WOOD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The average cost of going to a U.S. theme
park shot up this year after a year of falling prices, according to
an annual survey taken by Amusement Business.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost for a family of four to spend the day at a
theme park increased more than 7 percent, or $10.12, to $151.44,
compared with the previous year. That's a record high, according to
Amusement Business, an industry publication that surveys prices at
25 parks representing a variety of geographic areas, facility sizes
and price ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost for a family of four to go to Six Flags Over
Texas increased 13.97 percent, or $22.50, to $183.50, thanks
largely to an increase in the cost of a souvenir T-shirt. A child's
souvenir T-shirt costs $14 this year, compared with $5 last year,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Six Flags Over Texas and Premier Parks did not
return telephone calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices at Six Flags fell 75 cents for adults and 25 cents
for children compared with prices in last year's survey. Six Flags
was the only one of the nine parks on the survey owned by Premier
Parks, which owns 35 parks, that didn't increase ticket prices this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Premier Parks, based in Oklahoma City, led the
decrease in Amusement Business' family-price index by setting
children's ticket prices at half of adult prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a decrease last year,'' said Gloria Radeff, an
analyst covering Premier Parks for Lehman Brothers in New York. ``I
guess last year it was a big year in terms of them getting more
traffic through the parks in terms of pricing. I think they're
still working on driving attendance with season passes, group sales
and combination tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that higher ticket prices at most Premier parks
surveyed could be an incentive for guests to opt for season passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Premier parks with the largest increases in ticket prices
also had some of the biggest changes and capital improvements
during the off-season. They include Six Flags New England _
Riverside Park until last year _ which got eight new rides. Adult
admission there went up $7. At Six Flags Magic Mountain in
Valencia, Calif., which added a new roller coaster, adult admission
went up $4.
</P>
<P>
   This year's average increase, $10.12, is the largest in the
history of the survey, according to the magazine. Last year's
figure, a $1.58 decrease, was the first drop ever. In 1998,
Amusement Business' survey found an average increase of $9.32; in
1997, the average increased $8.88.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is based on admission prices for two adults and two
children, parking for one car and purchase of two hot dogs, two
hamburgers, four orders of fries, four small soft drinks and two
children's T-shirts. The survey does not take into account
discounted admissions, which most consumers use.

 BALTIMORE: prime time.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To accomplish that, he spent much of his three years ``stomping,
kicking and being a despot,'' he recalled. Then he moved on to
movies, everything from ``Cry, the Beloved Country'' and ``Alien
3'' to ``Cookie's Fortune'' and Spike Lee's ``Get on the Bus.'' And
he became an outspoken critic of racism in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a single black person in Hollywood with any
power,'' he said last fall. ``This isn't paranoia. Because if I
stood in a room with every major black star, just talking, then I
would hear the same things out of their mouths that are coming out
of mine. Multimillionaires. The main thing you'll hear is,
`Whenever I take a project, I can't get it done unless I have a
white partner.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, if Denzel Washington, Danny Glover, Morgan
Freeman, Wesley Snipes, Laurence Fishburne, if they went to a
studio and said, `I want to do the movie of Hannibal.' They'll say,
`Yeah, well, we have to call in Al Pacino or the latest young
Italian actor to play Scipio,' the guy who defeated Hannibal many
years after all his conquests. And, damn it, that's who the story
will center around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world beyond Hollywood, Dutton, who is 49, was widely
admired. A striking figure with a stocky build, shaved head and
eloquent face, he often traveled the country, speaking at small
black colleges and in prisons. He was respected by working-class
and upper-middle-class blacks alike, and by many whites.
</P>
<P>
   HBO sent the scripts to Dutton and no one else.
</P>
<P>
   At first he said no. He had directed just one movie, an HBO film
called ``First-Time Felon.'' But he was not interested in another
urban drama, especially one about drugs. ``I had a certain
bitterness and anger with family members who allowed themselves to
be destroyed that way,'' he recalled. ``I had to ask myself, do I
want to take this emotional journey through this world?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scripts intrigued him. What he admired about the story
was that it was told from the addicts' perspective, not some
glamorized dealer's. It made clear what he had long seen as the
hypocrisy of the war on drugs. And it could serve, he said, as a
raw reminder of an element of society that Americans chose to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   HBO offered him two episodes. Then four. Then all six. The
shooting schedule would be a killer, but doing all six might give
him a degree of control that television directors rarely had. He
would take a bath financially, he said later, because he made his
real money as an actor. But he wanted to prove he had the stamina
and the concentration to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   In what he would later call a momentary lapse of sanity, he said
yes. He had come to respect Simon and Mills, he said shortly after
accepting the job. But, as he also said, there would not be one
moment when he would forget that ``it's a white writer and a white
producer and it's HBO and a black director.''
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how many supportive black people HBO would line
up, the job of defending the miniseries would fall to him. ``I'm
going to have to be the person saying, `Hey, y'all, it's cool,'''
he once said, chuckling at his impersonation of himself. `` `Ain't
no sense in gettin' upset. This is a  &UR; goooood &LR;  movie. Go watch it.
Order HBO!'''
</P>
<P>
   THE CREW IS TOO WHITE
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, 1999, Dutton laid eyes on his crew for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   They were gathered at the intersection of Montford Avenue and
Oliver Street, a broken-down place with a bar, a corner store, a
boarded-up deli and little else. Three weeks before they were to
start shooting, the heads of the various departments, newly hired
by the producers, had come with the producers and several HBO
executives to scout their principal location.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton arrived separately. He slid out of his car and focused on
the stream of men and women emerging from a couple of vans.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't all white. But almost.
</P>
<P>
   It was not as if the producers hadn't known that he wanted a
racially mixed crew. He had brought up the subject with the unit
production manager, Nina Kostroff Noble, on his first day in
Baltimore: I'm not going into the ghettos of Baltimore city for a
whole damn summer with an all-white crew, he would remember saying.
And if you guys were smart, you wouldn't either.
</P>
<P>
   What makes you think it's going to be all white? she had
responded.
</P>
<P>
   It was always the same, Dutton said later. The business was
``full of nepotism and cliquism.'' Italians hired Italians, Asians
hired Asians. ``So why is it a problem when it's a black project?
Every black project that I've worked on, with the exception of the
Spike Lee movies, you've got to go through this every time. You've
got to say, `Why can't we have some more black folks on the
crew?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dutton wanted an all-black crew. Having healthy black
representation was a matter of pride and fairness, but he also
believed it was more fun when a crew was truly diverse. For a
series about black addicts, filmed in East Baltimore, he thought
the right percentage of African-Americans was their percentage in
the city, roughly 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Affecting an earnest white voice, he mocked the response he got
in Hollywood whenever he complained: Are you saying the studios are
 &UR; deliberately &LR;  not hiring black people? No, he said, they didn't go
into a room and say: ``You know, we ain't hiring no damn black
people. Everyone agreed? And here's the story if we get questioned
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It just came naturally, without thinking. And if you confronted
them, they would say: ``Hey, my next-door neighbor is black. My
best friend is black.'' You could throw racism two inches in front
of white peoples' faces and they still wouldn't see it, Dutton
said. Or they'd deny it and say you were the one causing the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a black actor in Hollywood, on the star level or
the lowest level, who doesn't in private vehemently rail against
the industry,'' he said. ``The biggest stars. The hugest stars.
Because somewhere along the line they are still reminded, `You know
something? You're a big star but you're just another nigger.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And so either you succumb to it and you roll over and you grin
and you bear it and you shuck and you jive and you laugh when it
ain't funny and you scratch when it ain't itching. And you go about
being a good little boy and you're patted on the head and they give
you the next little movie. And you look around and there ain't no
black folks on that one, either.''

 BALTIMORE: one, either.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He paused, then added: ``But those that do that will probably
rot in hell somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At Montford and Oliver, he could hear the first assistant
director starting to introduce him: ``This is the director, Charles
Dutton.'' Instead of walking over and shaking hands, he turned his
back on them all and crossed the street.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been phony, he said later, to shake hands and grin
and act as if everything were all right. So, flanked by his black
bodyguard and his black driver, he went to work studying the
location. He figured everybody got the message: I'm not doing this
with a white crew. Sorry. Nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Noble, the unit production manager, was upset. She
recognized the problem immediately. But Dutton was not behaving
like the captain of the ship, she said later. Some of the black
crew members felt like tokens; some whites felt slapped in the
face, she said. They told her so.
</P>
<P>
   Noble was white, but she prided herself on being colorblind in
her work. In the case of ``The Corner,'' she had intended to go
farther than usual to hire a racially mixed crew. She and Simon and
the other producers had discussed it at length. None of them wanted
anyone in the community, cast or crew feeling exploited or
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   But there were not many black technicians in the business,
especially in Baltimore, Noble said later. And it was expensive to
bring them in from other cities and house them. When she had asked
one of the unions if it had a minority roster, she had been warned
against trying to violate seniority rules.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the crew she had begun putting together already
included a number of African-Americans. Unfortunately, some of them
were not there that day, because they were not department heads.
And one of those who were there might have been mistaken for white.
``OK,'' Noble said later. ``It's not enough that we have people who
are black. We have to hire people with dark skin.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been hoping that Dutton, after several weeks on the job,
had begun to deal with everyone on what she called ``more a
personal level and less on a racial level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was wrong about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Dutton spoke with one of the visiting HBO
executives, who then spoke with Noble and Robert F. Colesberry, the
third executive producer. Along with Simon, they all agreed they
had to try even harder to hire more African-Americans onto the
crew.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, they hired a black script supervisor,
hairdresser, director's assistant and production assistant, all of
them from out of town. The Teamsters came up with three black
drivers. By the end of production, the shooting crew consisted of
41 white people and 33 black people, by Noble's count.
</P>
<P>
   Many crew members said it was the most racially mixed crew they
had ever seen. It was a source of satisfaction for many people,
including Simon, who believed that the white people had learned
from the experience. He said later: ``If Charles wanted us to be 65
percent, and if inertia would have made us 10 or 15 percent,
somewhere in between is where we ended up. And I don't know what
perfect is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton thought he did. And where they had ended up was not
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That day would remain a defining moment for him. ``I didn't see
anything but white people, white people, white people,'' he said
later. `` `Hey, we're making a movie about these black people and
 &UR; we're &LR;  the experts.' Absolutely, I felt like, well, hold it. The
way to impress me with your liberalism or your humanity or your
honesty or your integrity where the black community is concerned is
to share the damn pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Something lingered after that day, Simon remarked many months
later. A few people told him they felt that whiteness was a
liability on the set, he said. If they got their feelings hurt, it
could be a hard shoot. But he believed the wrong move at that
moment was to get offended. It solved nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are white people for whom that moment of having somebody
be standoffish or curt or unpleasant, or even the veiled suggestion
that race is a barrier, that ends it,'' Simon said. If there was
one thing that being a white reporter in a mostly black city had
taught him, it was what could be gained by not walking away.
</P>
<P>
   A LONG WAY FROM SILVER SPRING
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 39, grew up in a mostly white world, the youngest of
three children in a liberal Democratic household in Silver Spring,
Md., in which books and newspapers were revered and argument was
sport. He went to suburban public schools that were heavily white.
He recalls as a child having heard a racial epithet used only
twice, but having known enough to be indignant.
</P>
<P>
   Race was rarely discussed at home, but equality was a given.
Simon's father was the director of public relations and a
speechwriter for B'nai B'rith. His mother worked for several years
for a group called the Negro Student Fund, which helped
underachieving public school students move to independent schools.
</P>
<P>
   Simon learned about race in Baltimore. The Sun hired him out of
the University of Maryland in 1983. Race was out in the open in
Baltimore in a way he had never seen before. It was no big deal, he
said, to walk into a bar in Highlandtown and hear white people
talking about black folks, or to meet a black person and be told
everything that was wrong with white people, no offense.
</P>
<P>
   Race seemed to permeate everything in Baltimore: housing,
education, politics, criminal justice. It was as if the city had
swallowed whole every other trend but had choked on race, he said.
The biggest crime story was drugs, and intravenous drug use in
Baltimore occurred predominantly among African-Americans. To be a
decent reporter, he had to learn to listen to black people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Simon spent a year with the Baltimore Police
Department's homicide unit, doing the reporting for what became his
1991 book, ``Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets.'' Waiting
around at crime scenes and in people's houses, he ended up shooting
the breeze for hours upon hours with people the police encountered
on cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then the trick becomes: can I just be patient enough not to
ask every question at once, to laugh only at the jokes that they
tell when they're funny, and not to laugh at the ones that, if you
laugh at them, they know you're full up with it, and to venture
your own joke about something,'' Simon recalled.

 BALTIMORE: Simon recalled.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At The Sun, he made a specialty of turning obscure murders into
full-blown dramatic narratives. Gregarious, voluble and funny, he
believed he could talk to anybody. And every time someone rendered
himself or herself human, he said, ``it was an argument against
whatever racial simplicities you've constructed in your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he took a leave of absence and went to work on ``The
Corner'' with a former police detective named Edward Burns, also
white, who believed that the drug war had led the police badly
astray, and who shared with Simon the impulse to demonstrate to the
credit-card-carrying world that the people the drug war had
demonized had lives and sensibilities and deserved understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Burns picked the intersection of Fayette and Monroe
Streets, one of a hundred open-air drug markets in a city said to
have the highest rate of heroin use of any in the country. They
went every day. They talked, joked, hung around, listened,
eventually winning the confidence of dozens of people whose stories
would become the soul of the book.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Corner'' came out in 1997, the Rev. Frank Reid, a
fifth-generation African Methodist Episcopal minister and pastor of
the largest African-American church in Baltimore, based sermons on
it. He held a party to celebrate it, and 500 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Simon had leapt a chasm few white people cross, Mills, his
friend and writing partner, believed. He had written about black
addicts not through a microscope but by sitting next to them. He
had learned the language, sensibility and sense of humor of the
ghetto, a sensibility Mills knew from his childhood. And he had
gotten more intimately involved with his subjects than Mills could
imagine doing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's newspaper articles, meanwhile, looked less and less like
what normally turns up in a newspaper. They began with paragraphs
like `` `You don't look so good,' says the cop, smiling. `You look
like death.''' Then an editor at the Sun accused him of ennobling
criminals. Disgusted, he left in 1995. He went to work as a writer
and producer on ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   That the subjects of his journalism were often black was not
what drew Simon to them, he insisted earlier this year. Race had
simply made the territory seem less accessible, so their voices had
not been heard. There were things he missed because he was white,
he said. But there were other things a black writer from that world
might have missed because he or she was too close.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he found himself accused of exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing patience with the idea of it being exploitive,'' he
said. ``Except to acknowledge that in one sense all journalism is
exploitive. Janet Malcolm was right. We're all selling used cars.
And any journalist who tries to say we're not is lying through his
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ethic that I can find that you can hang your hat on
says: Now that I have the material, how do I treat my subjects? Do
I accord them all the humanity they deserve, or do I write a crude
and simplistic expose?''
</P>
<P>
   FACES FROM THE OLD DAYS
</P>
<P>
   The shooting schedule in Baltimore was relentless: 12- and
13-hour days, five days a week, no end in sight. By early October,
Dutton had not slept eight hours straight since August. The
production was on time and under budget. But at times the film was
being written, cast, shot and edited almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   It was emotionally grueling, too. Day in and day out, they were
shooting in the depths of the world they were depicting, in the
decaying row house neighborhoods that in Baltimore seem to stagger
on forever, with the drug corners, tumbledown bars, boarded-up
windows, rumble of demolition trucks, shriek of sirens. Everywhere,
there were children.
</P>
<P>
   Every day people would turn up to watch, a shifting collection
of neighborhood residents, acquaintances of Dutton, survivors from
his prison drama group, aspiring actors and hangers-on _ more than
a few of whom found their way into small parts in the series,
blurring the boundary between the film and the street.
</P>
<P>
   For Dutton, being back in the old neighborhood was not
necessarily fun _ the handshaking, embracing, hearing sob stories,
shelling out money, seeing people he had once idolized who had gone
nowhere. He kept waiting for someone, he said, just someone, to
arrive by car, not on foot, and get out with kids and a wife and
everyone looking healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Simon was around, too, along with many of the people from his
book. Of those who had not died, some were clean and turning their
lives around. Simon had remained close to them. Now he found joy in
helping them get small roles, for which those in speaking parts
could rake in the princely Screen Actors Guild rate of $596 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mills visited the set rarely. What he loved was the solitary
process of writing, so he passed his days in the office, writing
and fine-tuning scripts. Simon let him try anything, and relied on
him. But there was a well-defined hierarchy, Mills observed without
resentment. ``The Corner'' was Simon's project; he was there to
serve Simon's vision.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few weeks, Simon was on the set every day, often
in the background, watching or talking with Colesberry and Noble,
and occasionally Dutton. Then, after a few weeks, he began coming
less often. At the time, he said he had pulled back because he was
confident that the production was in good hands. But later, he said
he had also begun to sense that Dutton responded better to
Colesberry than to him. Dutton seemed distant, more curt. Simon
said he figured Dutton was feeling the pressure, like everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dutton had come to distrust Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as some of this material is, I'm wondering where his
real heart is in this,'' he said in October. ``Is this really and
truly an effort to do something about this?'' No matter how sincere
Simon was, he was ``taking somebody else's misery and making a
dollar off of it. Which can't be denied, whether he's the most
sincere goddamn white man in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the distrust had started, Dutton could not say for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he had gotten the impression through HBO that Simon
and Mills had doubts about having him direct all six episodes.
Then, the initial encounter with the crew had badly soured his
enthusiasm. He blamed Simon, in part; if his niche was going to be
writing about black people in Baltimore, then he should have made
sure there were more behind the camera.

 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Prayers were offered and hymns were sung.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of fellowship as mothers, fathers, children and
couples filled the pews of Rainbow Cathedral on a recent Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved, God truly does love you,'' the Rev. John Nicholas,
pastor of the 200-member church, told his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The service was like many throughout San Antonio on any given
Sunday. There was one big difference: the majority of those in the
pews were gay or lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Being gay while being faithful is something that, when noticed
in other churches, has caused controversy and consternation. Entire
denominations that regard homosexual inclinations or behavior as a
sin are arguing over what role, if any, openly gay churchgoers can
have in religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stotts, president emeritus of the Austin Presbyterian
Theological Seminary, said Christianity has grappled with the
homosexual question since its earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has struggled over the centuries to develop
perspectives on pressing issues,'' Stotts said. ``Racial equality
was one issue. Women being ordained or serving in leadership
positions is another. People take different positions. It's the
same way with the homosexual question.''
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian theology does not prohibit people from being
members or holding office because of their sexual orientation,
Stotts said, but gay Presbyterians are required to remain celibate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual orientation itself is not a sin. But the behavior that
comes with it is,'' Stotts said.
</P>
<P>
   Few pastors in mainstream denominations in San Antonio or Austin
perform same-sex marriages, but one who does said his congregation
has been enriched by not only accepting but embracing as equals
gays and lesbians who enter a committed relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Art Severance, pastor of First Unitarian Universalist
Church in San Antonio, said he has performed about two dozen union
ceremonies for lesbians and two for gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religiously, it's a wedding,'' Severance said. ``Legally, it's
not _ yet. I liken it to the civil rights era when a white would
never marry a black or a minister would be divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   Such unions, and the ordination of gay clergy, have become
topics of open debate at leadership gatherings of Protestant
denominations, and Stotts said it would be foolish to assume gays
and lesbians are not already part of most Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't flaunt it. They're not out of the closet, so
to speak,'' Stotts said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, the openly gay pastor of the Rainbow Cathedral, an
affiliate of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches, said that is precisely why the fellowship of churches was
established in Los Angeles in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is welcome at our church, including heterosexuals,''
said Nicholas, a Navy veteran and pastor of one of a half-dozen
congregations in San Antonio that openly accept gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with an emerging gay and lesbian movement in the
1960s, the establishment of the Metropolitan Community Churches
offered church services for those whose sexual orientation made
them unwelcome, or made them feel that way, in the denominations
they grew up in.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a network called Dignity/USA was formed
to provide Masses for gay Catholics. The Catholic Church has never
officially sanctioned the group, but even in conservative South
Texas, a handful of sympathetic priests celebrate Mass each Sunday.
One of the priests, the Rev. Eddie Bernal, said it's considered an
``outreach ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians have been told a lot of lies and have been
made to feel horrible about themselves,'' Bernal said. ``Many times
people in religion have scapegoated on gays and lesbians, pointing
their finger at them and causing them to suffer from unnecessary
low self esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Dignity they find solidarity, support and love. They find
what every Christian church should offer them: love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jim Cottone, a retired professor of infectious diseases at
the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, being
forced to give up either his sexuality or his religion is out of
the question. He has been attending Dignity services since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity completes me,'' Cottone said. ``It makes me realize
that my upbringing as a Catholic is still part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignity congregants are reluctant to reveal where they hold
services. Nickie Valdez, who has been a member of the group since
1983, remembers a Sunday in 1987 when members got in their vehicles
after Mass and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get far. The lug nuts on their wheels had been
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a message,'' Valdez said. ``Luckily no one
was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Episcopal
Church will debate sanctioning same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, United Methodist Church leaders voted to uphold
their doctrine that homosexual behavior is incompatible with
Christian teaching. It also adopted a policy requiring clergy to be
faithful in heterosexual marriage or celibate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, messengers at the Southern Baptist Convention in
Orlando, Fla., voted to revise the Baptist Faith and Message
Statement to oppose homosexuality, along with what they called
``all manner of deviant and pagan sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although each Baptist congregation is autonomous, the statement
is viewed as the closest thing the denomination has to an official
creed.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which
represents 1,800 Reform rabbis serving more than 1.5 million Reform
Jews, approved a measure allowing them to perform same-sex
commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Lasalle R. Vaughn, pastor of New Life Christian
Center, a nondenominational Christian church in San Antonio, said
the growing lesbian and gay movement and increasing public
acceptance of same-sex unions is blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the Bible says homosexuality is a perverted
lifestyle,'' Vaughn said. ``Just like all of those having sex
outside of marriage. That's perversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he is offended by the notion that those opposed to
the gay lifestyle are bigots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm African-American and being homosexual does not make you a
minority,'' Vaughn said. ``We're not going to accept it in this
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Giles, who attends services at Rainbow Cathedral, said
anti-gay sermons from fundamentalist pulpits breed hatred and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about hell and damnation, fire and brimstone,
especially if you're gay,'' said Giles, a volunteer coordinator for
the San Antonio Gay and Lesbian Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I run across that hate, my response is John 3:16. Jesus
Christ died for all of us.''

OBJECTIONS TO `41 SHOTS' ADD UP TO VERY LITTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazing what one song can do.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the flap raised the past several days over ``American
Skin (41 Shots),'' the new, unrecorded and unreleased Bruce
Springsteen song that the Boss first performed last week in
Atlanta. He sang it again on Monday during the first of 10 sold-out
shows he's doing at Madison Square Garden to cap a long reunion
tour with the E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin'' is a pointed reference to the fatal shooting of Amadou
Diallo on Feb. 4, 1999, by four New York City police officers as
the unarmed 22-year-old West African immigrant stood in the
vestibule of his apartment building. Forty-one shots were fired; 19
hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your
life/It ain't no secret/It ain't no secret/Ain't no secret my
friend: You can get killed just for living in your American skin''
is the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   For having the temerity to sing this song, Springsteen has been
vilified by the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
PBA President Pat Lynch accused Bruce of ``trying to fatten his
wallet'' with the song and urged cops working security at the
Garden to boycott the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bob Lucente, president of the New York state chapter of the
Fraternal Order of Police weighed in, calling Springsteen a
``dirtbag'' and worse.
</P>
<P>
   I won't descend to their level of name-calling in responding.
</P>
<P>
   First, a reminder: There's a crazy little thing we call freedom
of speech in this country, which does, in fact, extend to rock 'n'
roll singers who write and perform a song about a brutal and
controversial shooting, even though a racially mixed jury acquitted
the four plainclothes cops on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the part about Bruce trying to fatten his wallet,
which is patently ridiculous. He's been a multimillionaire for
years, the song isn't officially available for purchase, and the
shows were sold out many weeks ago. So that record won't spin,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the knee-slapper from Lynch about ``Skin'' coming
at a time when the ``police officers and community members are in a
healing period.''
</P>
<P>
   This is politically correct nonsense-speak we can translate as:
Some of our cops shot an unarmed black man ``NINETEEN TIMES'' and
got the world's attention, and we would very much like everyone to
just go away and act like it never happened. Because it was
embarrassing for us.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Diallo's mom and dad, Kadiatou and Saikou Diallo,
support Springsteen and met with him backstage before Monday's
show. So does Police Lt. Eric Adams of 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement Who Care. And so does the Rev. Al Sharpton, who invited
Springsteen to march in Washington against police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   So which ``community'' is ``Skin'' stopping from healing, Pat?
</P>
<P>
   ``American Skin'' does not vilify all police officers. It does
not say all police officers are bad people. It does not say all
police officers are prone to shooting an unarmed black man 19
times.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the second verse, a mother gets her son Charlie
ready for school and reminds him that if he's stopped by a police
officer, to be polite, not run away ``and promise mama you'll keep
your hands in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we really think that black mothers haven't said this or
something very similar to their children (especially their young
men) in the days and weeks after the Diallo shooting?
</P>
<P>
   I would wager they have, hundreds of times, and still do,
because the song is the truth: Here in the United States you still
can die for being black and in the wrong place at the wrong time.
And no amount of name-calling by a couple of cops can change that.

 BALTIMORE: the camera.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the first days of the shoot, Dutton said, Simon was getting
on his nerves. Dutton was not accustomed to having a writer on set,
and he was not interested in hearing how Simon had envisioned
particular scenes. There always seemed to be people, like Simon and
Noble, whispering in corners, Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   He hated to say he felt unappreciated. But he did feel
monitored, judged and second-guessed. The only reason he had not
cussed somebody out was because he had to get through the shoot. If
he had gotten angry, it would have been intimidating and
disruptive. To keep the peace, he let things go.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspicious of white writers, he said at the time. Every
aspect of black life had been distorted by white people, he said,
and the series was about an element of society that he knew white
people detested. He would have felt more comfortable, he said, if
the writer had been black. As for Mills, Dutton felt he knew little
about him; when they had first met, he had not even realized that
the light-skinned Mills was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that David Simon can visit and sit with as many black
folks in this city as he wants to,'' Dutton said one day in late
September, standing on a crumbling stretch of sidewalk in the rain.
``They can pay the families to get the stories. They can listen and
walk around with dope fiends. They can write about murders, and
they still won't know a damn thing about black people. Not this,
you know. Not this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I know the pulse of  &UR; this &LR; . I know what people think
the minute they walk out them doors. I know what mothers feel when
their sons and daughters walk out of the house to go to school. I
know what it feels like to kill somebody. I know what it feels like
to get shot. I know what it feels like that people be looking to
kill me. I don't have to show up as a crime journalist after the
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A PAINFUL SCENE
</P>
<P>
   The scene on the schedule for Columbus Day was especially
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Simon had watched firsthand the event it was based on, back in
1993. Two addicts he had been following had emerged from a
courtroom, accompanied by their mothers. Suddenly, one of the
mothers had exploded at the other, raving and hurling obscenities
at her in the crowded courthouse corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Simon had considered leaving the scene out of the script; it had
been painful to witness and painful for the mother on the receiving
end. But it had seemed essential to the story, showing the way the
corner world kept intruding on people's attempts to lead ordinary
lives. Simon and Mills had ended up including it, but toned down
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The performance could not be cartoonish, the producers had
agreed; it could not be an eye-popping, head-rolling, sitcom
stereotype. But the actors who had auditioned for the part had
leaned in that direction. So the producers had gone to the expense
of importing a New York actor to play the part of the angry mother.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Dutton found the scene embarrassing. ``There was
something about it that was so ghetto, so stereotypical ghetto,''
he said later. Not that he doubted that it had happened. But there
would be black viewers who would ask, Why did you have to show
that? And there would be white people who would think, Oh, yeah,
that is just how they are.
</P>
<P>
   When HBO had first approached him about the job, he had had
reservations about exposing the world of the corner. Not just those
aspects that were embarrassing but those that felt intimate and
precious, he said later. Now, he said, he sometimes felt that he
was giving Simon more than he could have imagined. He felt he was
giving away secrets.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered a performance of ``The Piano Lesson'' on Broadway.
Dionne Warwick had been in the audience and had walked out during
the second act. Months later, she told him why. ``She said she
couldn't take it anymore,'' Dutton remembered. ``Because we were
letting white folks in on all of our sacred little things. It was
almost like that's all we had, or have.''
</P>
<P>
   On Columbus Day Simon was on set, a courthouse in East
Baltimore. He was standing in an alcove off the corridor where
Dutton, intense and absorbed, was having the actors repeatedly
rehearse the scene. The corridor was crowded with extras hired for
the day to mill around in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Simon was watching the extras. They kept failing to react to the
commotion between the mothers. A couple of women looked so
oblivious and white-bread, it was funny. A man playing one of the
bailiffs kept going to great lengths to make sure he would be in
the shot. Simon, who knew him, would remember later that he had
shared a laugh with the man about that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the actor playing the raving mother was dead on. It
was the moment Simon had witnessed in another courthouse corridor
six years earlier, reinvented by a television production crew,
transformed by artifice. He was elated. He laughed again.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the corner of his eye, at one point, Dutton caught sight
of Simon laughing. It made him furious.
</P>
<P>
   He shot Simon an angry look. Simon seemed to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he had misinterpreted that laugh, Dutton said later. But
he didn't think so. One of the actors had noticed it, too. ``Why
has he got to be laughing at  &UR; this &LR;  scene?'' Dutton would remember
the actor asking.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton never mentioned the moment to Simon. But he said
privately that a black writer would never have laughed. Not even a
snicker. ``Because they would have even felt a little bit of shame
in it. It boils down to nobody wants to look in the mirror and see
ugliness. Nobody wants to look in the mirror and see ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Simon would remember an angry look. He said he had
assumed Dutton thought he was meddling, because he had asked one of
the assistant directors to get the extras in the background to
react.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should have been more sensitive, he said. But how could
he have been? The moment between the mothers had been painful to
witness, but its power was attenuated six years later. If it had
not been that moment, it could have been 10 others. He had laughed
at 10 other things that were not funny in reality but were funny in
the process of representing them.

 BALTIMORE: representing them.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I know what I wasn't laughing at,'' Simon said earlier this
spring. ``I wasn't laughing at somebody who was black and poor and
uncouth making a spectacle of themself in a hallway. That's the one
thing that wouldn't have been funny to me, and wasn't when it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing Simon and Dutton could talk about, it was
Baltimore street lore. Simon loved the crime history of Baltimore
the way other writers loved stories about the mob. Baltimore's
organized crime was its black drug trade. The most enjoyable
conversations Simon and Dutton had were about that world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Simon had believed there was a great story to be told
about the period in the early 1960s in Baltimore when men who had
made their money as hustlers and gamblers moved into drugs. It was
a moment of reckoning, he thought. That story, perhaps married to
the War of the Roses, as represented in Shakespeare's history
plays, had the makings of a classic black gangster film.
</P>
<P>
   At its center might be the character of Melvin Williams, who was
said to have risen from the pool halls of Pennsylvania Avenue in
Baltimore to lay the groundwork for the heroin industry that then
engulfed the city. Simon had written a five-part series about
Williams' drug empire for The Sun in 1987. Dutton, it turned out,
had known Williams since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Dutton would marvel that Simon had first mentioned
the idea to him not long after they met. And it had come up again
and again in the following months. Just in passing, Simon said. But
Dutton believed he knew what Simon was getting at. In late October,
he mentioned to Simon that he liked the idea of the project, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, four days before the end of the ``Corner'' shoot, Simon made
his way over to Dutton during a break. He gave him a copy of the
newspaper series and laid out his idea in detail. On the sidewalk
outside the fast-food restaurant where they were shooting, they
fell deep into conversation, then continued inside, squashed side
by side in undersized plastic chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Simon believed he would have a hard time selling the idea to a
studio without Dutton, he said later, and an easier time persuading
Williams to cooperate if Dutton's name were attached. Dutton knew
that world, had the draw to get the project made and would even be
great in the role of a police lieutenant colonel who was a key
figure in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dutton believed that Simon would have the
screenwriting reputation needed to win over a studio, he said
later. Simon had the passion needed to get the project off the
ground. He would have access to older members of the police
department. And, Dutton said, he might be the only person Williams
and others would open up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the first one to admit, the idea is very,
very, very clever,'' he said later, referring to Simon's choice of
the War of the Roses as a frame for the story. ``If more writers
would think of those kinds of clever devices, a lot of those
so-called black films in that genre would be a lot more
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   By early November, the editors had pieced together the first
episodes of ``The Corner.'' Seeing those rough assemblages, Dutton
thought he and Simon and Mills were on the same page about many
things after all. He was struck by how distinct and memorable each
character was. Watching a scene in which an addict was stabbed to
death, he had found himself weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he had not given Simon enough credit, he had begun to
think. ``All the credit from the literary point of it, but from the
humanity point of it, I was a little guarded,'' he said. On the
other hand, it was a two-way street, he insisted; he remained
convinced that Simon had had doubts about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of shooting, Dutton said, he took a step back
and watched Simon with some of the ``real people'' from the book.
Dutton was impressed by the emotional bond between them, and by
Simon's commitment to remain involved. ``If he has the patience for
it,'' Dutton said, ``I envy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon was truly fascinated by the world of the corner, Dutton
believed. ``There are times when he's been around the real people
in this, I would look at him from afar and he'd be totally
enraptured,'' he observed one day. And Dutton would be sure that
the person Simon was listening to was full of it. Without hearing a
word, he said, he could tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, in that regard, I have a soft spot for David,'' he said,
adding: ``Sometimes I shake my head and I say, `Poor boy, if he's
going for that.' But then other times I'm wary. Because, wait a
minute, is this guy as nonchalant as he seems?''
</P>
<P>
   EDITING BY COMMITTEE
</P>
<P>
   When the shoot ended, Simon, Mills and Colesberry moved to New
York and set up shop in an editing studio in the Tribeca section of
lower Manhattan to work on their cuts. Dutton kept his distance,
often working on his own cuts in a midtown hotel. His creative
juices flowed better there, he said. But it also felt awkward in
Tribeca, ``those guys tiptoeing around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of television, the producers had the power to
overrule Dutton on cutting the series. He submitted his director's
cut of each episode, then they took it and made theirs. Dutton
disliked many of the flashbacks that had been shot: ``I'd say 3
percent work. The other 97 percent don't,'' he said one day. He
took some out _ and the producers put some back.
</P>
<P>
   He also chose particular takes of certain scenes, only to have
the producers replace them with selections of their own. They were
eviscerating one of the characters, Dutton complained privately. He
hated their musical choices, too. Using blues music for the title
theme was, to him, ``the typical white-boy idea of what black life
is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he kept his complaints to himself. The producers had the
right to do what they were doing. So why bother objecting?

 BALTIMORE: bother objecting?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By late December he was not sure he would be showing up in
Pasadena in mid-January to help promote the series at a semiannual
meeting of television critics. ``I could say, `I wish you guys
well, but I'm unavailable,''' he said. ``I could be shooting a
picture in London.'' Or, he said, he could be on his farm in
Maryland, shoveling manure.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 19, there he was in Pasadena. Minutes before the
preview was to begin, he stalked into the room at the Ritz Carlton
where the HBO contingent was waiting. He seemed barely able to
bring himself to say hello to Simon, Colesberry and Mills. ``I
didn't know why Charles was so mad,'' Simon said later. ``I thought
it was the cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon resolved not to let the day end without inviting Dutton to
have a drink and talk things over. Dutton had plans but took
Simon's cell phone number, just in case. It felt as though the ice
was cracking, Simon said later. Then Dutton never called. When they
bumped into each other the next morning, Dutton explained
cheerfully that he had been out late.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the East Coast, HBO asked Dutton at the last minute to
film a personal preamble to the series, describing his reasons for
making it. The idea worried Simon and Mills; they did not want HBO
apologizing for the series in advance. They shipped a draft script
to Dutton. But he sent back a message saying he would write the
preamble himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two days before he was to shoot it in Baltimore, an HBO
executive informed Simon, Mills and Colesberry that Dutton did not
want them there. They were stung by the request but complied. So,
on a cold Saturday in early March, Dutton returned one more time to
Montford and Oliver and filmed his 90-second introduction, alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need two cents from anybody,'' Dutton said later. ``I
didn't want five opinions on how we should shoot it or any genius
ideas for rewriting. I don't even know why anybody wanted to be
there. If they wanted to be there because they were worried about
what Charles Dutton was going to do, then that's indicative of the
entire shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK, AND AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corner'' had its premiere at 10 p.m. on Sunday, April 16,
2000. Apart from a few lukewarm notices, including one in The New
York Times, the reviews were unanimous in their admiration:
``ferociously written,'' ``superbly directed,'' ``spectacularly
acted,'' ``unblinkingly honest.'' In The Washington Post, Tom
Shales called the series ``an act of enlightenment, raw and
shattering and strangely, inexplicably, beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, the ratings were unusually high for HBO in that
time slot, especially in African-American households. There was
none of the black backlash everyone had feared. Sales of Simon and
Burns' book surged. People seemed stunned by the series' realism.
Watching it at home, Dutton found himself struck again by the
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the writing is absolutely brilliant,'' he said,
looking back on what Simon had accomplished. ``Without a doubt, he
captured the hell out of those lives. Whatever painstaking efforts
he had to go through, to sit and live for a year on those corners,
it is totally a credit to him to have put it down on paper in the
noncompromising way that he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes the piece as beautiful and strong as it is.
That he didn't take any weak shortcuts to appease a certain element
of society, that he presented it just as it was told to him and
just the way he observed it and just the way he analyzed it. In a
nutshell, it's absolutely remarkable what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   With distance, Dutton believed he had let the strains of the
production cloud his judgment. He had failed to see that Simon had
been as nervous about the project as anyone, maybe more so, he
said. Simon was probably worried about career, life, limb,
everything, if it had come out badly.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, meanwhile, continued to raise the Pennsylvania Avenue
idea with Dutton when they saw each other. He had been rereading
Shakespeare's history plays and had begun trying to contact Melvin
Williams in prison. He was planning to write an outline and send it
to Dutton. It had begun to seem possible that they might eventually
work together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't express to you how minimal whatever problems Charles
and I had were compared to how I felt when I went onto that corner
in 1993,'' Simon said. ``People were a lot more direct about not
wanting us there on that corner than Charles was when I was on set.
The trick was coming back every day. Most people's opinions
changed. To an extent, I had 60 days with Charles. I think by the
60th day his impressions might have been different. If not, I would
suggest 60 more might help. Or 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, racially, in this country, you don't usually get that
kind of prolonged experience. Either people bend over backwards to
get along or they don't and they steer clear. But I've sort of been
trained _ and you could call it crassly manipulative, because I
want the book or I want the movie to be better _ to stay put.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks I was a bastard to work with, I don't think he
was so easy to work with, either,'' he said a couple of days later.
``But I would still do it a second time, based on the quality of
the work that occurred. I know this: This time directing for him,
he has directed something that's better because I wrote it, and
I've written something that's better because he directed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come out of it the second time and we've managed not to
acquire some degree of understanding of our own foibles and
insensitivities and misunderstandings, if we wind up in this exact
same moment, then we're idiots. We ought to be able to learn.''

HEY, POPS, HAVE YOU GOT A LIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm having my father's old cigarette lighter repaired. It needs
a new flint. The wick is shot. And I've managed to lose the little
screw normally visible at the bottom when you slide the insert out
of the metal case.
</P>
<P>
   I don't smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter is a Zippo manufactured in 1950. I checked the
patent number on the case through a computer Web site maintained by
people who collect Zippo lighters. I don't collect Zippo lighters.
</P>
<P>
   I have this one lighter. The silver patina is worn at the top
and around the edges. It has a few dents in it. The phrase ``safety
pays'' is engraved where the top flips open, and the words ``J&AMP;L
STEEL'' are in a box on the lower right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   It probably was given to my dad the year it was made, a gift
from the steel mill he'd returned to after the war. He was about 30
years old then, still running on the war's adrenaline. Happy,
strong.
</P>
<P>
   He first let me hold the lighter when its 2- by 1{-inch body was
too large for me to pinch between my middle finger and thumb, the
way he did, twirling it round and round with his index finger.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't allowed to open it or to light it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when he was adding fluid, he'd let me hold the can as
it dripped into the container.
</P>
<P>
   My father quit smoking about 35 years ago, and I doubt the
lighter has had fluid added to it since. But even now, if you hold
it close to your nose, you can smell it. And the oily scent lingers
on your fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   He used to hold the lighter sometimes just to open it and close
it, oblivious to the metallic click-clop, click-clop, click-clop,
until my mother would ask him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Something in him required that his life have a rhythm to it. A
beat. This was it.
</P>
<P>
   The real skill, though, was in lighting a cigarette. With one
hand, my father could open the lighter, roll his thumb over the
flint wheel, light a cigarette and close the lighter in half the
time it took you to read this sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when he worked the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, sleeping
during the day, I'd sneak into my parents' bedroom and take the
lighter from the nightstand next to where my father slept.
</P>
<P>
   Already, my friends and I were lifting Luckys and Camels from
our parents' cigarette packs and lighting up under the Plan 12
bridge, trying to act tough.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking didn't interest me much, though. It was that slick move
with the lighter I wanted to perfect, that open-light-close
happening so fast you might not notice the flame. I never mastered
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough practice, I guess. Or not enough of the post-World
War II optimism that ran like lighter fluid through my father's
veins.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette lighter sat in a junk drawer in my parents' house
for decades, unwanted, unnoticed, unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   It's necessary now.
</P>
<P>
   After my mother and father died, the lighter was moved from
their junk drawer to a shelf in my house, to my desk at work, to my
pocket, to my hand. I was happy for a while just to carry it
around.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm having it repaired. The Zippo company does such work
for free. And though I'll never develop my old man's speed and
grace, I want to be able to strike a flame. I don't smoke
cigarettes. There's nothing I need to light. Except, occasionally,
my way. &QL;

BRITAIN STOCKS UP ON MAINSTREAM ORGANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving
the Americans in the dust. After sputtering along for years, sales
there are expected to be five times as much this year as in 1996,
compared with a less than threefold increase in this country over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Organics are mainstream in Britain, in some part because of the
introduction of genetically modified ingredients from America to
which there has been widespread opposition. Anger and fear over GM
products reached a peak last summer and has since died down, but
interest in organics is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ads for organic food are found in newspapers and in supermarket
magazines, particularly those of Waitrose and Sainsbury, the two
chains leading the organic charge. Overhead signs in their stores
direct customers to the organic sections, and the products
themselves are clearly marked. That these organic products are free
of genetically modified ingredients is occasionally emblazoned on
the packages as well.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the United States, where the bulk of organic sales
are in natural food stores, 70 percent to 80 percent of the sales
in England are in conventional supermarkets. Sainsbury has about
440 stores, and Waitrose has more than 120. Other supermarket
chains are also making a point of stocking organic ingredients, but
not with quite the same fervor.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors account for the differences between the two
countries. The simple answer is a series of food scares there that
have made consumers uneasy. ``We have lived in a culture of food
scares,'' said Alan Wilson, an agronomist and organic food
consultant for Waitrose, citing organophosphates in carrots,
salmonella in eggs and BSE in cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The latter refers to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, which destroys the brain. For several years, the
British government insisted that it could not be passed from cattle
to humans. Then, in 1997, the government acknowledged that BSE
could be transmitted. The admission was followed by the appearance
of genetically modified foods, and for Britons that apparently was
the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the furor last year over genetically modified foods
occurred because ``it threatened to take away choice from British
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Any science that comes to market has to benefit
consumers, and the presentation of GM foods here was very, very
poor. So GM was just another gift to the organic movement,''
helping to speed up its popularity. As in the United States,
organic means free of genetically modified ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite food scares in the United States _ salmonella in
chickens and eggs, listeria in ready-to-eat meats and E. coli
O157:H7 in a number of products _ Americans appear to trust
government food safety agencies more than the British.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sams, an American who is founder and president of Whole
Earth Foods in England and lives there but travels often to the
United States, said there were three fundamental differences
between attitudes here and there: regulations, the press and the
English connectedness to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   He could have added vegetarianism. For generations, meatless
diets have had a much higher profile in England than in this
country, where few even knew what vegetarians were until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no national organic standards, Sams said,
which ``undermines the market and deters big companies from going
in.'' When the European Union's organic rules took effect in 1993,
it improved credibility, he said, ``because everyone knew what
organic meant.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, the press has been very supportive of organics, Sams
said. Food writers there are continually exposed to information
from the Soil Association, which is a nationwide organic certifier
and has as much clout as all of this country's organic institutions
combined.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, Sams believes that the British are more connected
to their environment. ``The English love to go for long rambling
walks in the countryside,'' he said. ``You don't do that in the
States, so you don't have the same sense of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade
Association in Greenfield, Mass., the country's largest organic
organization, agreed with Sams' assessment. In addition, she said,
supermarkets have not been around as long as they have in the
United States, and so the ``British still feel the loss of
neighborhood green grocer, the butcher, the baker,'' DiMatteo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how people would be very emotional about their
food supply, and organic seems to answer these kinds of emotional
concerns and issues,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The deep involvement of Prince Charles in organics and genetic
engineering issues has also not been lost on his subjects, she
said, and he has developed a line of organic foods under the Duchy
label.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because of Britain's size, trends spread more rapidly
there. ``Even if you wanted to buy organic in many parts of this
country,'' DiMatteo said, ``you wouldn't be able to except on the
West and East Coasts, the upper Midwest and the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   On my visit to London in May, I was coming out of the
underground when I was confronted by a front-page headline in The
Daily Mail. It warned, ``Organic Mushrooms Were Contaminated With
Deadly Bacteria.'' Not until the fifth paragraph did the reader
learn that the headline was false, that the E. coli found in the
mushrooms was not E. coli 0157:H7, which is deadly, but the generic
variety, which is not. No sources were cited for the findings. Only
one of Britain's many newspapers repeated any part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   These weren't the first false charges. Last year, according to
The Guardian, the ``agri-industrial food establishment'' mounted
``an ill-informed and unjustified smear campaign'' that tried to
link organic food to the hazardous form of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   The thriving organic movement in Britain must have agribusiness
and biotech industry worried.

VICHYSSOISE BESTIRRED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I could never decide whether vichyssoise was subtle or simply
boring.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this cold potato-leek soup has potential. Developed at
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York in 1917 and named for a French
spa, it's a variation on the hot, creamy staple of many French
households, a simple soup made of pureed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional cooks, though, never limited their purees to just
two mild white vegetables like leeks and potatoes unless they had
to. They added other vegetables for flavor and color.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for vichyssoise, unfortunately, appears to have been
written in stone. It calls for potatoes, leeks, water or stock,
salt, pepper, butter and cream. What little complexity the soup has
comes from lightly browning the vegetables in the butter and using
lots of salt and pepper, good stock and, of course, the cream.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better way to make vichyssoise, however, that is not
only easier and more interesting but also lower in fat: add extra
vegetables, just as a French home cook would with soupe bonne
femme, the inspiration for vichyssoise.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious addition is garlic, and the young, green garlic
found in farmers' markets and some supermarkets at this time of
year is a wonderful choice, adding distinctive but mellow flavor,
as well as color. Use the bulb and some of the green tops. Regular
garlic, the cloves left whole, works as well. Carrots contribute a
beautiful color and a haunting sweetness to the soup. And you can
nudge vichyssoise over toward gazpacho territory by adding a ripe
tomato, along with some fresh basil.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to be flexible and go with what is available. In any
case, the technique is perfectly simple: cook the vegetables in
water or stock; then cool, puree and chill them. Browning the
vegetables in butter first makes a pleasant but not highly
significant difference, so I skip it. Adding cream or half-and-half
at the end is nice, but few things are ``creamier'' than pureed
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the choice between stock and water, if you have good
stock _ homemade stock _ by all means use it; it will add a great
deal of complexity. But if the option is canned stock or water,
this is a place to save your money: use water.
</P>
<P>
   Vichyssoise is usually served as a first course, but you can
make it more of a meal by adding some cold grilled shrimp or just a
few croutons. And while the traditional garnish is chives, parsley
or chervil adds a little more of a twist.
</P>
<P>
   VICHYSSOISE WITH GREEN GARLIC
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes, plus time to chill
</P>
<P>
   1 pound leeks or onions, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 quart water or stock, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 pound russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into
slices or chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head green garlic, plus its stem, chopped, or 3 cloves
garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { to 1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley or chervil for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash leeks or peel onions. Slice or chop.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the water or stock, potatoes, leeks or onions,
garlic, salt and pepper in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat so the mixture simmers steadily. Cook until the
potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool or chill. Then season
to taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Puree in a blender, in batches if necessary, and chill
completely. Stir in the cream or half-and-half. Taste, adjust
seasoning and serve, garnished with parsley or chervil.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Tomato and Basil Variation: Core 2 medium tomatoes by cutting a
cone-shape wedge out of the stem ends. Cut them in half
horizontally. Squeeze and shake out the seeds. Cut flesh into
chunks. Substitute the tomatoes for the garlic and proceed as above
but omit the cream. Add about 20 washed and dried basil leaves when
pureeing. To serve, garnish with chopped basil.
</P>
<P>
   Carrot Variation: Add 4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped, to
the pot along with the potatoes and leeks. (Garlic is optional but
still good.) Add 1 cup more liquid and proceed as above.

A BRINY BEAN WITH PLENTY OF SNAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They go by so many names they would seem to be as
common as corn: sea beans, sea asparagus, samphire, salicornia,
pousse-pied, glasswort. Until recently, though, these salty little
vegetables were just an oddity turning up once a year or so between
the pea shoots and the cipolline onions in high-end produce
markets. Now, thanks to new farming techniques, fresh sea beans are
becoming more abundant and available.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than a novelty. These little stalks of crunchy sea
vegetation _ actually a fleshy flowering plant _ have a subtly
salty flavor and a fascinating crispness that suits them to salads
and other dishes. They can even be deep-fried to make the
equivalent of French fries of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The sea bean (Salicornia europaea), a member of the beet family,
has long been considered a delicacy in France and Great Britain.
The beans grow wild there along the shores of salt marshes and are
gathered by hand when still young and tender, usually from mid-May
through June.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, sea beans are traditionally pickled and served with
roasted meats, while in France they are often blanched and coated
with butter or hollandaise or tossed raw into salads.
</P>
<P>
   Sea beans also grow in rocky coastal areas in the United States,
particularly in Oregon and Maine, but have never been in much
demand here. Now they are being cultivated, mainly in Mexico; these
beans are more consistently tender than wild beans, which can be
fibrous and woody at maturity. They are planted in sandy estuaries
and harvested every six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are taking to sea beans, and several markets carry them.
At Balducci's, 155A West 66th Street and 424 Avenue of the Americas
(Ninth Street), they are $14.99 a pound, and at Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560
Broadway (Prince Street), $12 a pound. Three 12-ounce packages are
$30 at Melissa's Gourmet, (800) 588-0151.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Pasternack, the chef of Esca in the theater district, was
introduced to sea beans more than a decade ago by a French chef.
``They've got an intense, briny taste that couples really well with
fish and seafood,'' he said, adding that the less you do to them,
the better. Blanching took away all the flavor, he said, ``so I
either use them raw, pickle them in vinegar or give them a quick
stir-fry.''
</P>
<P>
   With guaranteed supplies, sea beans have become a fixture on the
Esca menu, served over translucent slivers of raw fluke sprinkled
with herbs and olive oil. In one special, Pasternack mixes sea
beans with the thinnest of green beans in a crunchy salad as a bed
for a square of wild salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Mina Newman, the chef at Dylan Prime in TriBeCa, heard about sea
beans from a supplier and was taken with the saltiness. ``They
reminded me of capers, so I paired them with steak tartare,'' she
said. The effect is similar to that of capers, but cleaner and
fresher, without the vinegary tang.
</P>
<P>
   Most chefs capitalize on the beans' affinity for seafood. Rick
Moonen of Oceana in Midtown adds them to a lobster salad; at Jack's
Fifth in Midtown, the co-chefs, Matthew Herzog and Marc Van Steyn,
match them with roasted tautog, a meaty, white-fleshed fish, and
smoked trout. At Thalia in the theater district, Michael Otsuka
pickles them to serve beneath baby monkfish tails.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Rodriguez at Chicama in the Flatiron district takes a
slightly different tack: instead of serving sea beans with seafood,
he uses them instead of it in his seaweed ceviche. Although the
citrus-marinated seaweeds served in the martini glass are
delicious, the real standout is the garnish: nutty, deep-fried sea
beans.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy carefully, sea beans require much preparation. Choose
the greenest, firmest beans for the best crunch and flavor. Discard
any that are discolored or shriveled. A short soak should dislodge
any sand, and they're ready to eat or cook.
</P>

   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei) _ Emboldened by last week's summit meeting
between the leaders of North and South Korea, Taiwan's new

   CONGRESS-TRADE (Washington) _ Four weeks after the House
approved a decisive trade bill with China, a vote in the Senate
remains weeks away, and President Clinton summoned a bipartisan
group of Senate reporters to the White House Tuesday to pressure
Republican leaders to set a date for the vote in the Senate. Unlike
in the House, where supporters hustled for votes right up to the
last minute, backers in the Senate have between 70 to 75 votes in
favor or the measure, enough to win handily and easily defeat a
filibuster. By Eric Schmitt.

   CONGRESS-TRAVEL (Washington) _ The common wisdom about Congress,
repeated in news reports and accepted as truth in foreign embassies
in Washington, is that few lawmakers travel abroad, only half hold
a passport, most do not speak a foreign language and a majority are
uninterested in worlds beyond their next election. This portrait of
Congress, especially the House, as an inward-looking institution
grew largely out of the Republican revolution of 1994 led by Newt
Gingrich. The House Republican Class of '94 proudly adopted the
defiant slogan, ``America first.'' But a New York Times survey
challenges each and every one of these common wisdoms. By Eric
Schmitt and Elizabeth Becker.

   CONGRESS-HATE-CRIMES (Washington) _ The Senate is expected to

protection of gays or lesbians on a rollcall vote that would have

   MICROSOFT (Washington) _ The trial judge in the Microsoft
antitrust case Tuesday stayed all the restrictions he had imposed
on the company until the Supreme Court decides whether or not to
hear the appeal. Although he had been expected to ask the high
court to consider a direct review, the stay was unexpected. It
apparently reflected his previously stated view that he felt
uncomfortable imposing remedies in the case without a quick review
by a higher court. The move may buy Microsoft several months at
least, since the Supreme Court may not decide whether to take the
case until fall. By Joel Brinkley.

state, the high bench protected religious minorities from the
public promotion of a specific religion. Gov. George W. Bush,
pandering to the religious right, was disingenuous to claim the
ruling means students cannot pray. Of course they can, but they
can't impose their prayer on others. By MARIANNE MEANS.

RIGHTS GROUP SEEKS SAFEGUARDS FOR YOUNG FARM WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GUTIERREZ-MIER  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ An international human rights organization charged
Tuesday that U.S. labor laws are doing little to safeguard young
farm workers, many of whom are Hispanics, and should be revised and
better enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group that monitors human
rights in about 70 countries, found children often work 12 to 14
hours a day on U.S. farms and are exposed to dangerous pesticides.
Only about 55 percent graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope to do is make the U.S. government aware of the
fact that kids who work in agriculture usually get less pay, are
exposed to pesticides and work long hours,'' said Lois Whitman,
director of the children's division of the New York-based
organization, which released a report on farm labor Tuesday. ``We'd
also like to see an increase in enforcement by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection
Agency when it comes to safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is calling on Congress to amend the Fair Labor
Standards Act. The act, passed in 1938, sets the minimum wage and
the length of the standard workweek for most employees in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The law, however, exempts young farm workers from minimum age
and maximum hour requirements that protect other children.
</P>
<P>
   In other occupations it prohibits the hiring of children under
14 and limits those under 16 to three hours of work a day when
school is in session.
</P>
<P>
   The act also allows 16- and 17-year-olds to work under hazardous
conditions in agriculture. The minimum age for all other
occupations is 18.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Valdez-Cox, director of the United Farmworkers Union in
San Juan in the Rio Grande valley, applauded the report and said it
was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farm work is only second to mining when it comes to dangerous
work for adults,'' she said. ``One can only imagine how dangerous
it is when it comes to children.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said if the law is changed, it may present a hardship
for many migrant families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason they're taking their children out there to
work is because they're not making enough money,'' Valdez-Cox said.
``Over the years, it seems like we've gotten a lot of paper
victories, but they're just that. If the law is changed, Congress
has to make sure enough money goes to OSHA and the EPA. And they,
of course, have to follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Pringle, legislative director for the Texas Farm Bureau
in Waco, questioned the validity of the report and stressed that
the original law was designed for rural families and should not be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural children are used to working on the farm from the ages
of about 12 and 13,'' said Pringle, whose organization represents
farmers in Texas. ``It's not uncommon for children as young as 12
to be driving a tractor to haul hay. For those reasons, we support
the current exemptions and would fight any changes proposed in
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Human Rights Watch report, titled ``Fingers to
the Bone: United States Failure to Protect Child Farmworkers,''
young farm workers often earn less than minimum wage. They also
account for 8 percent of all working minors, but account for 40
percent of work-related fatalities among children.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch also is proposing that every state raise or
set its minimum age for farm work at 14.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ David Simon was white but he knew he could write
black people. Maybe not all black people but the ones he had known
in Baltimore, where he had been a crime reporter for 14 years. He
had spent a year on a Baltimore drug corner and written a book that
had done something almost unheard of: It had shown black inner-city
drug addicts as complex and startlingly human.
</P>
<P>
   So Simon was not thinking much about his whiteness when he
walked into the Los Angeles offices of HBO in January 1998 and set
about trying to interest three white programming executives in the
improbable idea of making the book into a television series.
</P>
<P>
   No one talked about race at that meeting. At least, not
directly. No one remarked upon the fact that Simon was white and
that nearly everyone in his book was black. Nor did anyone mention
that HBO was not about to make a series about black drug addicts
created by, as one HBO executive put it later, ``a bunch of white
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the executives asked Simon a lot of questions. How did
black people in Baltimore react when his book, ``The Corner: A Year
in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood,'' came out? What did the
mayor, who was black, say? What would happen if HBO were to make
the series, and shoot it in Baltimore, and protests broke out?
</P>
<P>
   Then they asked him to suggest a writing partner.
</P>
<P>
   He offered two names. One was James Yoshimura, an Asian-American
playwright and television writer he had worked with on ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' the NBC series based on Simon's first book.
The other was David Mills, an African-American writer and friend of
Simon's since college, who had recently been nominated for two
Emmys for episodes of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon suggested Yoshimura and Mills for the same reason, he said
later: He liked working with them. He did not feel he needed a
black writer to help him tell a black story. He had spent his
career as a white reporter in a mostly black town. He had a good
ear and had paid attention in a way he knew most white people did
not.
</P>
<P>
   He was not unaware, however, that Mills might have special
appeal for HBO. It was apparent from the line of questioning that a
black writer was high on HBO's priority list. And, as Simon put it,
as soon as the bait was dangled in the water, the fish leapt onto
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   At the mention of Mills, a look shot between two of the
executives, Kary Antholis and Anne Thomopoulos. Antholis had been
following Mills' career. He had even mentioned him to Thomopoulos _
as a smart writer who had worked at the highest levels of
television, and who also happened to be black.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know David Mills? one of them asked Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Could you get him to work on this project?
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Simon had a deal, HBO had a miniseries and Mills
had a new job as Simon's writing partner and fellow executive
producer.
</P>
<P>
   THE RISK AND THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   A miniseries about drug addicts was risky television. But it
appealed to Chris Albrecht, the president for original programming
at HBO, because HBO defined itself by doing what broadcast networks
would not. That approach had earned HBO the admiration of critics,
lots of Emmys and an expanding audience of subscribers, a fifth to
a quarter of them black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corner'' would not need a mass audience on HBO, because
HBO did not make its money off commercials. What HBO wanted was
attention and buzz. If the series could be shot quickly in the
summer and fall of 1999 and put on the air the following April, it
would be in Emmy voters' minds when they voted in June.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how good ``The Corner'' might be, Albrecht said
later, there would be black people who would want to know why HBO
was doing it at all. They would forget ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' ``Laurel Avenue,'' ``The Tuskegee Airmen,'' ``Miss
Evers' Boys.'' The question would be, Why are you portraying black
people that way?
</P>
<P>
   HBO needed African-Americans involved for two reasons, Albrecht
said: for creative reasons and for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really still wanted to find somebody who would be my ...''
Albrecht recalled later in his office in New York, choosing his
words, ``who would be an additional, uh. ...'' He paused, then used
a vulgar expression for a person capable of detecting pretentious
nonsense. ``You know?''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted Charles S. Dutton to direct ``The Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knew Baltimore's corners, it was Dutton. He had grown
up in the city and spent his early years on its streets, where rock
fighting _ snowball fighting, except with rocks _ earned him the
lifelong nickname Roc. His only sister was a recovering cocaine
addict. His only brother, who died of AIDS in 1993 at age 44, had
been a heroin addict for nearly 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   What had saved Charles Dutton was prison. He dropped out of
school at 12 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter at 17, after
stabbing a black man who had pulled a knife on him in a fight. He
served two years. Then he was sent back for weapons possession,
fought with a white guard, and ended up serving another seven and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of his redemption is well known. One day, on his way to
solitary confinement, he grabbed an anthology of plays by black
playwrights. By the light under the cell door, he read ``Day of
Absence,'' a social satire by Douglas Turner Ward. He was so taken
with it, he organized a production, starred in it and discovered
what he had been put on earth to do.
</P>
<P>
   He formed a prison drama group that performed Shakespeare and
Arthur Miller. He got his high school equivalency certificate and a
junior college degree in prison, went to Towson State University in
Maryland and Yale Drama School while on parole, and won his first
Tony nomination for his performance in the August Wilson play ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom'' on Broadway in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   After a performance of ``The Piano Lesson'' by Wilson in 1990,
Albrecht introduced himself to Dutton. He then lured him to Los
Angeles to star in his own television program, ``Roc.'' The sitcom,
in which Dutton played a garbage man, Roc Emerson, appeared on Fox
for three tumultuous seasons starting in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton was not overjoyed with Hollywood. On stage he had felt he
could change the world, he said earlier this year. He had found the
closest thing he knew to a utopian, race-neutral place. But he
arrived in Hollywood suspicious of half-hour television and
determined, as he put it, that no one would make a monkey out of
him in prime time.

 &HT;    SAFETY GROUP SLAMS PROPOSED NEW TRUCK RULES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Highway safety activists charged Tuesday that a
Clinton Administration proposal would put more tired truck drivers
on the road and increase risks to other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ``is proposing
to degrade safety by increasing the amount of time that truck
drivers can remain behind the wheel from 10 to 12 hours a day,''
said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Izer, whose 17-year-old son, Jeff, and three of his
friends were killed in Maine in a 1993 collision with a driver who
had fallen asleep at the wheel of a big rig, said she is
``stunned'' at the plan announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Administration's attempt to justify more driving hours is
unfounded,'' she said. ``No load of toilet paper or Wheaties is
worth your life or that of your loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   An arm of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration was created by Congress last year to
improve highway safety and reduce fatalities involving trucks and
buses. This spring, the agency proposed new work rules for
commercial truck drivers. One regulation would lengthen the maximum
hours of consecutive driving from 10 to 12, but then increase the
mandatory rest time from 8 to 12 hours for long-haul drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The current rule requires that drivers take at least 8 hours of
rest after a maximum of 10 hours driving and thus could permit
driving 16 hours of a 24-hour day. Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said the proposed rules are based on scientific studies of
sleep cycles and would limit driving to no more than 12 hours
within a 24-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes in the ``hours of service'' had already
been attacked by the motor carriers for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal could mean a 50 percent increase in the number
of refrigerated and dry van trucks on our already crowded
highways,'' said Walter McCormick, president of the American
Trucking Association. ``DOT's proposal would force today's
sophisticated e-commerce, point-and-click, just-in-time delivery
system back into old economy inefficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Now highway safety advocates have added their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driver fatigue is a major factor in up to 40 percent of all
heavy truck crashes,'' said Claybrook. ``We strongly urge the
government not to tack two more long hours onto truckers' already
lengthy days.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Claybrook conceded that her movement is in a
``complicated position'' because it doesn't want to thwart needed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The safety advocates support DOT proposals for the additional
rest periods and to require on-board electronic recorders that
would ensure that long-haul drivers are abiding by the hours of
service rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-board recorders to replace the manual logbooks or 'comic
books' as they are referred to by everyone are long overdue,'' said
Izer, founder of a safety group called ``Parents Against Tired
Truckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, R-Ga., was among 14 senators who wrote to
Slater expressing concern about the proposed changes in driving
hours. Cleland spoke Tuesday at a press conference held by the
safety advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that we have a problem,'' he said. ``Georgia is
one of the top five states in terms of truck traffic.'' The danger
is increased around Atlanta because ``commuter traffic is mixed
with truck traffic on The Perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving in the wrong direction'' in proposing longer
hours that truckers can spend on the road,'' said Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Ca.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Senate voted 99-0 in favor of an
appropriations bill that denies funds for implementing the new
rules for at least a year. The House bill did not contain this
restriction, however, so the issue will go before a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Slater said he would extend the public comment period
on the proposed changes for 90 days, with the new conclusion set
for Oct. 30.

A SECRET FROM HAWAII: PINEAPPLE WITH TOMATO, PINEAPPLE WITH
RHUBARB 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHEL RICHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago when I was working in Los Angeles, I complained
to a friend about flavorless tomatoes. My friend, who happened to
be a chef from Hawaii, told me that he adds a julienne of pineapple
to tasteless tomatoes to make up for the missing acidity and
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the idea, and so I tried adding a pineapple puree to a
vinaigrette that I was serving over a tomato salad. It worked: the
bland tomatoes suddenly seemed to have a lot of flavor. I served
that salad for years, but never told anyone about the pineapple; I
was cooking real French food, after all, and that combination
sounded oddly Polynesian.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when I returned to cook in Washington, I
thought of using the tomato-pineapple combination in a dessert. I
reasoned that both are botanically fruits, and I already knew that
they go very well together. My cold ``fruit'' soup flavored with
maple syrup and lime and topped with a basil creme anglaise was a
big hit _ until people learned tomatoes were in it. So I tried
using rhubarb instead _ it has the acidity of a tomato, and I liked
its crunchy texture. Rhubarb and pineapple seemed to need each
other the way strawberries and rhubarb do, but made a much more
unexpected combination.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is more like a compote than a soup, but unlike most
compotes, the fruit is cooked as little as possible so the flavors
and textures remain distinct. In fact, it's so much like a bowl of
fresh fruit, I call it a salad. At the restaurant, I top it with
the basil creme anglaise; I like adding an herbal touch to fruit
desserts, and since I love Provencal flavors, I reached for basil.
At home, though, I just whirl some vanilla ice cream in a blender,
add some blanched basil and chill it again. The differences are
very slight, because the basil is what's important here _ all it
needs is a creamy cold base.
</P>
<P>
   As surprising as the flavors are, the dessert couldn't be easier
to make. But there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The
rhubarb must be cut very small to retain some crunch but cook all
the way through. Don't be tempted to cook the pineapple at all; the
dessert would lose its fresh flavor if you did. And when you are
blanching the basil, if you have the ice cream ready in the blender
you can skip chilling the basil in ice water: just put it directly
into the blender.
</P>
<P>
   PINEAPPLE-RHUBARB `SALAD' WITH BASIL CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes, plus additional time for freezing, if
necessary
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups finely diced (\ inch) peeled rhubarb (about 3 stalks, 10
inches long)
</P>
<P>
   1 rounded cup finely diced (\ inch) ripe fresh pineapple
</P>
<P>
   20 large basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   About } cup good quality vanilla ice cream, slightly softened.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a medium saute pan over high heat. Melt sugar, and add
rhubarb. Saute rhubarb for about 30 seconds, then reduce heat to
low. Cover, and cook until rhubarb is softened but still firm, 2 to
3 more minutes. Transfer rhubarb to a mixing bowl, and add
pineapple. Set aside, or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours;
bring to room temperature before serving.
</P>
<P>
   2. Set aside a bowl of ice water. Bring a small pan of water to
a boil, and add basil leaves. Blanch leaves for 30 seconds, then
transfer leaves to ice water to stop the cooking. In a blender,
combine ice cream and basil leaves. Puree until mixture is smoothly
blended. If necessary, freeze until mixture is thick but can still
be poured from a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   3. To serve, divide fruit mixture equally among four {-cup
serving dishes. Top each with a spoonful of basil-ice cream
mixture, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox Quesada, the leading contender to
dethrone the party that has ruled Mexico for seven decades, is
running an aggressive, irreverent campaign that would be right at
home north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the presidential candidate for the center-right National
Action Party, or PAN, has become the John McCain of Mexican
politics, a sweet-and-sour powder keg of indignation, good cheer
and shocking bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox, a rancher and former president of the Coca-Cola Co. for
Mexico and Central America, is running neck and neck or better with
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox calls the PRI ``a party dictatorship'' that has wrought
corruption and fraud for most of the 20th century. Only a political
change, he says, can bring Mexico out of its economic and social
inequity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result at the end of the century is deplorable,'' he said
recently. ``A country with 40 million poor people can't be called a
successful country. ... Mexico could have a place in the top 10 or
15 nations in the world, and only democracy, an alternative in
power, will guarantee us that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox refers to his PRI opponent, a reserved economist and veteran
public servant, as ``this little man,'' or ``shorty'' or the
``wimp,'' and to the PRI as the ``PRI-tanic,'' as in the sinking
Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Such irreverence has not always gone over well with the public,
but the boastful Fox has fired up the imagination of many Mexicans
with his strong rhetoric, deep voice and 6-foot-5 frame made even
taller by his trademark black cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   He will be 58 on July 2, the day Mexicans will vote in what
pollsters are calling the closest presidential race in Mexico's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is running even with Labastida, who is backed by a powerful
party machine that can reach into all corners of Mexico with its
social programs and party favors.
</P>
<P>
   In Levi jeans _ 34 inches at the waist, 38 along the seam, held
up by a silver buckle emblazoned with ``Fox'' _ the former governor
of Guanajuato cuts a striking figure.
</P>
<P>
   A divorced father of four children, Fox is literally at home on
the range, in the saddle and wearing a cowboy hat, a rugged, modern
vaquero who appeals to the Mexican image of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his appearance and his rugged demeanor, he has been
described _ sometimes derisively by the media _ as the ``Marlboro
Man,'' a Mexican John Wayne with a Jesuit education, a Harvard
degree and a passion for politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a businessman, but I am also a human being. I learned at
the ranch from living with the poor. They are my friends, but they
are still poor,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jesuit philosophy tells you that a person finds happiness
helping others. It is the antithesis of egoism.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but ego does get in the way at times, as it did in
May when Fox refused to abide by the strict rules of a televised
debate with Labastida and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate for
the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   The media called it Fox's ``Black Tuesday,'' after he first said
he didn't want to debate and then changed his mind, shouting on
national television he wanted to debate ``Today! Today! Today!''
</P>
<P>
   The ``today'' exclamation became a campaign slogan for both Fox,
who used it as in ``change parties today,'' and Labastida, who used
it to make Fox look like a lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell him to take some transcendental meditation
courses. I would tell him to listen to a little Mozart ... to count
to 10 until opening his mouth,'' Reforma newspaper columnist
Guadalupe Loaeza wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of five children, Fox embodies an immigrant family who came
to Mexico and made a life and money in cattle and agriculture in
much the same way European migrants thronged to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was born in Spain, and his Irish grandfather landed
in Ohio, finally settling in Mexico in 1913 at the height of the
Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a man of the country, as all my family has been for four
generations,'' he wrote in an autobiographical campaign book, ``Fox
to Los Pinos,'' as the official presidential residence is called.
</P>
<P>
   ``My origins are like that of many families in Mexico, product
of a union of cultures and different ways of thinking, but rooted
in this land,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at the private Lux Institute and attended the elite
Universidad Iberoamericana, where Fox said he was the only one to
wear jeans and where he played on the soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, short of finishing a thesis for a business
administration degree (which he finally completed in 1999), Fox
became a Coca-Cola salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Coke sent him to Harvard, where he received a degree in
management. From 1974 until 1979, he was president of Coca-Cola for
Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am accused of wanting to run the country as if it was
Coca-Cola,'' he wrote. ``It's not about that, but about rescuing
principles and philosophies that work well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, in politics there is more than management and
production; you have to put a human face to the economy,'' he
added. ``The ultimate result in politics ... has to be having happy
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   An ardent believer of free trade, Fox foresees a time when the
United States, Mexico and Canada will have no borders, when goods
and people can travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   He also envisions a North American common market, and wants to
link the ``four great economic machines of Latin America _ Mexico,
Brazil, Chile and Argentina _ to detonate an era of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Labastida, who wants to maintain Mexico's 5 percent
annual growth, Fox thinks it's possible to have a 7 percent growth
rate and 1.3 million new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He's landed in political hot water several times, once telling a
reporter he wanted to privatize Pemex, the oil monopoly
nationalized in 1938 and one of the country's sacred cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to privatize Pemex, because I want to be
president,'' Fox told foreign correspondents recently, indicating
the sale could not be a political reality.
</P>
<P>
   He also was ridiculed for quipping that he could solve in ``15
minutes'' a lingering 1994 standoff in Chiapas, where Zapatista
rebels are demanding greater economic and political independence
for the southeastern state's indigenous population and where the
armed forces remain on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Fox later said he would withdraw the army presence and abide by
accords with the Zapatistas that never have gone into effect.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he owes his political awakening to mentor Manuel J.
Clouthier, the PAN presidential candidate and party founder killed
before the 1988 national election in a car accident many Mexicans
still call suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was elected to the national congress, and became governor of
Guanajuato in 1995, four years after fraud allegedly robbed him of
the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only bachelor in the presidential race. Divorced from
his wife, Lillian, they have four adopted children and remain good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I started my struggle to get (elected), people always
ask me what I am going to do about a first lady, and they even
invent romances,'' he wrote. ``But I am completely committed to my
four children and to politics. ... What I vehemently reject is that
you have to be married to be president.''

CAPCOM KEEPS CASHING IN ON SUCCESS OF `STREET FIGHTER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's two reasons why Capcom's ``Street Fighter'' series has
done so well: Kids dig it 'cuz of the cool animation, and parents
dig it because there's no blood.
</P>
<P>
   And year after year, Capcom keeps cashing in on ``Street
Fighter's'' success, releasing sequel after sequel. Some of these
are completely worthless, others build on the ``SF'' genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Fighter Alpha 3'' (Capcom for Sega Dreamcast) falls
into the latter category. The first ``SF'' game for the Dreamcast,
``Alpha 3'' is loaded with new enhancements and features that
aren't even in the arcade version. That's one cool thing you can
say about the hit-and-miss Sega: They always throw in stuff you're
not gonna get elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Here, that would include the skill-building World Tour Mode and
three-player battle, both of which are very cool pluses to an
already great game.
</P>
<P>
   In now-typical ``Street Fighter'' fashion, the animated graphics
are superb, beautifully colored and textured. They look like they
were torn from the pages of a comic book, they're so well-detailed.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 fighters from the ``Street Fighter'' gang
to choose from _ and, supposedly, a few hidden ones. I can't
unearth them, though, 'cuz I keep getting beat by the really big
guy with the beard and mohawk, the dude who looks like Mr. T.
You're on your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Channel 5'' (Sega for Dreamcast) is sort of a cross
between the local newspaper and Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Players take on the role of Ulala, a Space Age reporter who,
when she's not trying to scoop a story and save the universe
(because, of course, that is the same thing, you know), dances and
grooves to techno music. Yeah, it's pretty stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to teach aliens how to dance and stop
the world from blowing up. Oh, I get it: If the aliens learn how to
dance, they'll befriend Spacey Spice and help her save whatever it
is she's supposed to be saving. Man, Sega, what a fine idea! I'm
thinking game of the year!
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The latest old game to be dug out of its grave is ``1942''
(Capcom for Game Boy), an airplane shooter that was a popular
arcade game back when I was a kid, you know, just a coupla years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This thing is still way cool: It's an overhead-view game in
which you control a plane that _ whoa, this is ``so'' hard _ blasts
away at other planes. Sometimes the simplest games are the coolest.

NEW CLOTHING LINES FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS EMERGE AS SOPHISTICATED,
STREAMLINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   Move over, mumus.
</P>
<P>
   The days when moms-to-be were relegated to bow-covered tents
masquerading as fashion are officially over. Going, going, thank
goodness they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a convergence of forces _ among them, perhaps,
Hollywood starlets with swelling bellies, Madonna with child No.
two, La Nina, and Alan Greenspan's ever-expanding economy _
pregnancy is trendy. It's cool. And as it tends to do, form has
followed function once again. And fashion has followed burgeoning
forms.
</P>
<P>
   With approximately 4 million American women giving birth each
year, it was only a matter of time until savvy manufacturers and
designers would capitalize on the booming market, moving beyond
selective (and often high-priced) maternity boutiques _ where
fashion first showed a hint of its lovely face about 10 years ago _
into hip, casual, very wearable clothes for the style-conscious
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The surest sign that maternity has made it into the mainstream
collective fashion conscience is Gap.com's new line of basics,
still in its infancy after a March debut.
</P>
<P>
   Why the decision to give birth to the new line? Brooke Baldwin,
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Gap, says it was simple.
``We found out customers would be trying to make our regular line
of clothes into maternity clothes. So why not give them what they
are looking for and have it actually fit?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The retailers's 16-item maternity line gives Gap-aholics
their favorite basics with a twist. Separates include a classic
cotton cardigan, sleeveless cotton shell, cotton/spandex stretch
capris and supersoft T-shirts, at price points between $24 and $84.
The items are only available online at gap.com, but they may be
returned at branch stores.
</P>
<P>
   Other mass market stores such as Macy's, Lord &AMP; Taylor and
Target are following suit, delivering new, expanded maternity
sections due to large demands. Target stores now house nine
clothing racks of maternity wear compared with about half that just
10 years ago. Target's maternity line offers what their regular
line offers _ a mix of classic and trendy styles at affordable
prices, with a focus on solid-colored coordinates and shorts sets.
This summer, Target will offer its line of maternity items online.
</P>
<P>
   Designers such as Nicole Miller, Anna Sui and Vivienne Tam have
jumped on the maternity bandwagon in the last few years, creating
versions of their popular lines for A Pea in the Pod stores
nationwide. For the ultimate in pregnancy chic, Barneys New York
opened maternity departments last December in its flagship New York
store and its Beverly Hills and Chicago outposts. The store sells
items under its own label _ Barneys New York Procreation _ as well
as offerings from Tocca and other designers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's thoroughly modern maternity clothes are making their
mark in clingy, form-fitting fabrics like Lycra. The most
fashion-forward of the new maternity lines includes that of former
``Vogue'' editor Liz Lange, whose bold and often outright sexy
designs include halter tops, tube tops and short, stretchy skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Lange, who has been publicly credited with almost
single-handedly bringing fashion firmly to maternity wear when her
line came out about two years ago, says pregnant women should
expect her clothing to offer the latest fashions without
sacrificing comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that my friends and myself just wanted to wear the same
things everyone was wearing,'' she says. ``With some exceptions, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first son, Lange, who is now 33, was surprised
at the lack of variety in maternity clothes. Most shirts were
shapeless and baggy, while pants had uncomfortable (and
unfashionable) maternity panels. Lange's line includes high-end
treats such as a $500 dupione evening gown and a $110 pair of
stretch cotton sateen shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maternity clothes didn't seem to follow the same fashion
sensibility as nonmaternity, and I thought, `that's crazy,' '' she
says. ``You're pregnant for nine months _ anything you feel like
wearing on a given fall or given spring, (when) not pregnant should
be available (when) pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   For 4 million women, the good news is, now, it is.

FOR THE CUBS AND SOSA, THE SEASON BECOMES A TRADE SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10th inning of a tie game with the Arizona Diamondbacks
this month, two Chicago Cubs outfielders brushed against each other
while trying to catch a fly ball with two outs. The ball fell to
the ground and the Diamondbacks went on to score two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The official scorer charged center fielder Damon Buford with an
error but later changed the ruling and assigned the error to the
right fielder: Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, after the Cubs had rallied for three runs and a
4-3 victory, the right fielder asked a member of the Cubs'
front-office staff to talk to Manager Don Baylor about the ruling.
If Baylor felt it was Buford's error, Sosa thought, maybe he could
get the official scorer to change his call back to Buford. The
manager, though, believed the right ruling had been made because
Buford had called for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sosa, in effect, declared war on Baylor, telling
reporters that the manager had not treated him ``the way I'm
supposed to be treated.'' Baylor, he added, ``has got no class.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not tell the reporters how he had wanted Baylor to get
involved in the error call. His unusually sharp comments were
attributed to statements Baylor had previously made about Sosa's
deteriorating defense, among other facets of his game, that Baylor
saw as coming up short.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the schism between the new manager and his
superstar had been created and would add fuel to the Sosa situation
that has exploded on the North Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The betting around baseball is that Sosa's name will be added to
the list of glamour players who have been traded since the end of
last season, a group that includes Ken Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez
and Shawn Green. If so, it will be one of the more intriguing
developments of recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is the No. 1 player in a city where he wants to stay,
certainly one of the most popular in Chicago's checkered baseball
history. He is a premier slugger, having hit 129 home runs the
previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors are at work, and not just Sosa's clash with
Baylor. The Cubs' real star anyway is Wrigley Field, a baseball
anomaly that the team may feel will fill up even without Sosa.
Also, the Tribune Co., the team's owner, would not want to pay
upward of $15 million a year to keep Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Sosa will join a growing list of superstars who are
being traded before they can become free agents. In the other
instances, the players were traded a year before they could become
free agents because their teams concluded that they could not sign
them or did not want to pay what it would cost to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey went from Seattle to Cincinnati, Gonzalez from Texas to
Detroit, Green from Toronto to Los Angeles. Mike Hampton went from
Houston to the Mets, Carl Everett from Houston to Boston and Jim
Edmonds from Anaheim to St. Louis. These players, in effect, were
premature free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who because of his scintillating home run race with Mark
McGwire in 1998 has grown perhaps even bigger than Griffey in
stature, would be in that position this winter, but he may be even
more premature than last winter's group.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his trade value is probably at its highest now, so is
his ability to get a monster of a contract. The combination of
value to the Cubs and value to Sosa is the reason this entire
situation has blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there are three different things that could
happen,'' Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said the other day.
``Reach agreement on a contract extension. Trade him. Not do
anything since we're fortunate to have the player signed through
2001. I can't assign a probability to any one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   No one outside the Cubs has expressed the opinion that they will
sign Sosa to a contract extension. The Tribune Co. is one of the
most hard-line owners in Major League Baseball, ranks 13th among
the 30 clubs with a $60.5 million payroll this season and has shown
no inclination to spend in the lofty stratosphere where salaries of
elite players is headed, $15 million to $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there is the sense in and out of Chicago that the
Cubs don't have to spend top dollar to try to win because the
Wrigley Field experience attracts fans, win or lose. The Cubs, who
have not won a World Series since 1908 or played in one since 1945,
have long been known as the most lovable losers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view among baseball officials is that the Cubs
will trade Sosa sometime before the July 31 deadline for making
trades without needing waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't let it go this far if you're not going to make a
deal,'' one veteran official said. ``They've let it go on too long.
Their responses have been vague. If you're going to keep a guy, you
don't do this. I think Sammy wants out. I didn't think so a week
ago; I think that today. Their leverage is the greatest right now,
the next week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet MacPhail and General Manager Ed Lynch have not acknowledged
their intentions to trade Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't make that assumption,'' MacPhail said. ``It's not
something you can generate a lot of excitement from the chair I'm
sitting in. But you have a responsibility that if something is
going to make you better, you have to review it. But it's not a
foregone conclusion from my point of view.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   This is Sosa's ninth season with the Cubs. As he himself has
said, he has become an icon in Chicago. Because he loves the city
and its people and the whole Wrigley experience, he would prefer to
be with the Cubs the rest of his career. Not, however, without an
appropriate contract.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Katz, who with Tom Reich represents Sosa, has met with
MacPhail but said that he made no demands and that he doesn't know
what the Cubs will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed our desire to have them decide what they want
to do,'' Katz said. ``We all agree it's time to decide. If they
want to sign Sammy and keep him, then my bet is they could pull
that off quickly. If they want to trade him, we'll be cooperative.
My desire is to be collaborative and cooperative. I don't want to
press them. I think it's still possible for both sides to get what
they want. Whether that's together or apart, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the Cubs will trade Sosa has become the
premier story of the season. Newspapers and radio and television
air time in Chicago, New York and Boston have been filled with Sosa
stories. Will he or won't he, and where?
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have fueled the speculation by sending scouts to
scrutinize major and minor league players of the teams they think
are most seriously interested. The Yankees and the Red Sox are the
two clubs with the hottest interest, officials of other clubs said.
The Mets' interest, some say, has been overrated. The Diamondbacks,
they also say, have some interest, though not as much at this point
as the Yankees and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees expect to hear from the Cubs by the end of this week
on what players the Cubs would want for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   From Sosa's standpoint, he has the collective bargaining right
to veto a trade, which means the team that makes a trade with the
Cubs has to be prepared to sign Sosa to a new contract or face his
veto. Under baseball rules, the Cubs would make a contingency trade
with a team, then give that team 72 hours in which to negotiate
with Sosa's agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever he approves a trade to,'' Reich said, ``he's going to
be inclined to want to finish his career there rather than bounce
around through free agency or go through this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides a torrent of speculative news media reports, the Sosa
situation has generated a rush of analyses and columns urging the
Yankees not to trade for the outfielder on the grounds that he
wouldn't fit in with the low-key, star-free environment that is
their clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   One criticism of Sosa has been that he has fallen in love with
his image as a megastar and has changed in the last two years. Katz
said the assessment is nonsense, but others point to specific
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's entourage, for one. After emerging from the 1998 season
as a world-class hero, Sosa gathered a group of about 10 to 12
people around him who were steady visitors to the clubhouse last
season. Baylor has curtailed the entourage this season, perhaps
another reason Sosa has soured on him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the visiting parking list at Pacific Bell Park
when the Cubs played in San Francisco last month. Baylor, as
manager, was on the list with one other member of the team: Sosa.
MacPhail, the club's president, was on the trip but not on the
parking list.
</P>
<P>
   But it is disclosure of stories like these along with the
suggestion that Sosa has become a one-dimensional player that
prompts the Sosa camp to believe the Cubs have orchestrated a
campaign to reduce the player in stature in the eyes of the fans.
If the Wrigley regulars come to think less of Sosa, the thinking
goes, they will be less bothered if and when he is traded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fans and a handful of eager teams wait to find
out if he will be traded.

THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO RUFFLE FEATHERS

<P>
   When Aardman animators Nick Park and Peter Lord met DreamWorks
executive Jeffrey Katzenberg for dinner to pitch their idea about a
prisoner-of-war movie with chickens, they weren't sure how it would
go over _ particularly after Katzenberg told them about the
specialty of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Everything's good here, but you must order the roast
chicken,''' Lord says. ``So we did as we were told and, in between
bites, we told him about our heroic chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg swallowed the idea whole, not a surprise since he had
been chasing Aardman _ the British company responsible for the
wildly popular, Oscar-winning claymation man-dog duo of ``Wallace &AMP;
Gromit'' _ for a decade, dating back to his tenure at Disney. The
result, four-plus years in the making, is ``Chicken Run,'' a
delightful claymation retelling of ``The Great Escape'' from a
bird's-eye view.
</P>
<P>
   Lord co-founded Aardman in 1972; Park joined the company in 1985
and has won three Oscars for his animated short films (two for
``Wallace &AMP; Gromit,'' one for ``Creature Comforts''). The two men
are about as low-key as they come, unfailingly polite Englishmen
who cherish tea, creative control and sitting in the afternoon
California sun.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they talk about hatching ``Chicken Run,'' why they ran
away from Disney and the future of ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why chickens?
</P>
<P>
   Lord: We often asked that question ourselves. They're great
subjects to make a movie around, but not great subjects for
animated figures. We had to work really hard. They're not like
conventional cartoon characters, but they're always funny, and that
was the joy of it. Whether they're standing around looking rather
dippy ...
</P>
<P>
   Park: And they're very good at that ...
</P>
<P>
   Lord: Or flying into a panic and running and screaming, they're
funny just because they're chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Park: We got the idea from a drawing I did of a chicken digging
a hole with a spoon. And that evolved into this prisoner-of-war
film with chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Lord: We spent nine months developing the idea and we came up
with this absurdly elaborate story full of action and events and
set pieces based on way too many things that I'm sure would have
run for four hours had we ever made it. And it probably would have
taken five years to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And that's because of the phenomenal amount of time it takes
to create an Aardman movie. With 24 frames per second of film time,
you can have 24 different poses for your characters for just one
second of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Park: Nick and I were directing on 15 sets each every day. We
had 30 animators working at once. And a good day would produce 10
seconds of film.
</P>
<P>
   Lord: It's more work than we ever anticipated. We always thought
it would be two or three times a short film in terms of work, but
it's so much more complicated because it's a much bigger world.
</P>
<P>
   Park: We often said that it was 20 to 30 times the amount of
work just in terms of mental effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it hard to create so many different chicken
personalities?
</P>
<P>
   Lord: The supporting characters, the broad types like the ditsy
Babs or the gruff Fowler were easy.
</P>
<P>
   Park: It was the romantic leads that were difficult. In animated
movies, they are often the most boring characters. We wanted our
romantic leads to be interesting. I mean, we couldn't make them
good-looking as chickens, but we wanted them to have presence since
this is the first time chickens have ever been stars. So that was a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did having Mel Gibson do the voice of the rooster help a
little?
</P>
<P>
   Lord: His improv was terrific. He'd always come up with these
terrible, terrible word puns, just tossing out every kind of wing
and drumstick gag you can imagine, accompanied by a very good Sean
Connery impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Park: To be honest, we weren't quite sure why he was doing our
movie. When he turned up on the first day of recording, I was
thinking, ``He must have better offers this year than playing a
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The screenwriter, Karey Kirkpatrick, says you beat every
ounce of sentimentality out of his script.
</P>
<P>
   Lord: We did. I think it is quite British not to say your
message very emphatically. I think the British way is to
communicate your message, but you don't need to actually SAY it to
communicate it. You can act it, you can imply it, you can show it
without directly saying it. And that's where a lot of our
discussions came from.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Katzenberg had a deal with you back when he was with Disney,
but you never signed on the dotted line. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Lord: We were afraid that Disney would swallow our company both
economically and also culturally.
</P>
<P>
   Park: Several studios threw ideas at us, but I think we would
have always felt that we were making a movie for them and not for
us. It was important to have an idea of our own that we believed
in. And with this we had something to take to Jeffrey. And he knew
by then that we were interested in creative freedom above all and
he seemed to respect that an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But Katzenberg is a famous meddler. How much did he talk to
you?
</P>
<P>
   Park: Jeffrey is very verbal and upfront. But you can disagree
with him and he likes that.
</P>
<P>
   Lord: We also have the advantage of having the Atlantic between
us. (Laughs)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nick, have you given any thought to ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit''
lately?
</P>
<P>
   Park: I think about them all the time. Every time I'm on the
phone, I'm doodling pictures of them. That's the next movie I'm
going to start work on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think people love those characters so much?
</P>
<P>
   Park: It's really hard to know why, but you put it right. The
love element is so high with them. And you can't plan that or
design something with that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lord: I think they are honest as creations. And getting back to
that sentimentality stuff, I think they are unsentimental
creations. But at the same time, they're fundamentally good-hearted
so the films leave you feeling good about life. No one has preached
you a lesson like they do in so many movies, and yet you've learned
something.
</P>
<P>
   And the nice thing about Wallace is that he's such a terrible
fellow in so many ways. He's so insensitive to Gromit's feelings.
But if we changed his character and all of a sudden he became all
soppy and caring, it would lose its charm. He feels like a real
person; that's how people's relationships are. They make mistakes,
but they still love each other.
</P>
<P>
   Park: I'm just concerned about keeping the freshness and not get
too wise really in terms of Hollywood. We can't be influenced by
any marketing-think. But ``Wallace &AMP; Gromit'' is an institution in
Britain. It's not something anyone can change. They have their own
life and they'll write their own story and it will be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After making this movie, can you look at a chicken sandwich
the same way?
</P>
<P>
   Lord: If anything, I relish eating chicken even more. We became
a little desensitized after spending four years of our lives with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Park: But somehow I think we're doing something for
chicken-kind. We're making them stars. They've never really been
stars before, apart from Foghorn Leghorn. You know, they've always
been extras, flapping out of the way of vehicles. So I think we've
advanced their cause a great deal with this movie. &QL;

 &HT;    `Survivor' crew goes from rats to rain
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our national security forces can't keep atomic secrets on a Los
Alamos computer hard drive, but the one mystery that millions want
to know has yet to leak: Who will be the last ``Survivor,'' the one
to win $1 million?
</P>
<P>
   In an age of saturation media, there has been much speculation
as to the winner of CBS' summertime hit, but not a single nugget of
hard fact. The 16 participants, who videotaped the show in March
and have been back in the United States for several weeks, have
kept mum.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because all 16 signed extensive contracts that
Executive Producer Mark Burnett says are as thick as ``War and
Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Although CBS hasn't publicized it, every ``Survivor''
participant will get some money. Sonja Christopher, the first to be
exiled by her peers, will get $2,500, and the payments go up from
there, with the second-place finisher getting $100,000. But no one
will be paid until after the series concludes Aug. 23 _ and the
castaways' silence has held up, Burnett says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the contracts call for financial penalties against
the participants if they divulge information. Burnett confirms the
penalty clause but will not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less about the contract and more about loyalty,'' Burnett
says. ``There's been some serious bonding within themselves and
with me. People don't screw over their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But will that bond hold if the tabloids or others start offering
serious money to loosen some lips? Maybe not, but at least one tab
editor says his organization isn't pursuing the winner's name that
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it but we're not doing anything with it,'' says
Charlie Montgomery, senior editor of the National Enquirer. ``I
don't know if people want to know. You get sucked into watching it,
and it's a good guessing game.''
</P>
<P>
   And has America ever been sucked into it. The nation is
wallowing in CBS' quasi-reality show the way the castaways
themselves frolicked in a tropical mud hole last week.
</P>
<P>
   No one at CBS, or even Burnett, thought ``Survivor'' would take
off the way it has. It premiered May 31 with a strong audience of
almost 16 million, beat ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
head to head in its second week and, by last week's third episode,
had more than 23 million viewers, up 49 percent from Day One.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's episode was the third-most-watched program in the
nation (behind the Tuesday and Sunday editions of ``Millionaire'')
and the top show among advertiser-coveted viewers ages 18 through
49. CBS' Web site crashed repeatedly as millions of people tried to
find out more (www.cbs.com and follow the prompts).
</P>
<P>
   On tonight's fourth episode, it will be rain, rain, go away.
Viewers saw the start of the monsoon at the end of last week's
show. The downpour, which lasted several days during filming, was
so intense that the makeshift shelters leaked badly and the
island's rats were driven inside with the cranky campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor''
</P>

   8 tonight on CBS

 c.2000 The Boston Globe Magazine  
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Sebastian Junger (pronounced ``younger'') was
hanging from a tree on a hot summer day, looking at the bloody tear
he had just ripped down the back of his leg with his chain saw,
when the idea for his book blossomed. Cutting trees, he mused, was
difficult work, like firefighting, logging or commercial fishing.
Why not a book about those jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, three storm systems collided off the coast of
New England, creating a meteorological debacle so disastrous, and
so improbable, that a weatherman dubbed it a ``perfect storm,'' or
a storm that could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the maelstrom of 100-mph winds and 90-foot waves, a
72-foot swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, Mass., called the
Andrea Gail went down with her crew of six. Junger, then living in
Gloucester, clipped a newspaper article about the missing vessel,
which was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Sebastian Junger, 38, a Belmont, Mass., native, became
chronicler of that 1991 fishing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, what started out as a chapter on fishing had
turned into a whole book, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Suddenly, Junger
was the Sexiest Author in America, and the book was a publishing
marvel being aggressively optioned by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As publishing leaders see it, it was Junger's own willingness to
stump for the book, coupled with his publisher's savvy marketing
strategy, that led to the book's singular success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it didn't hurt that he was very good-looking,'' says
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly. ``These days,
when a publisher looks at an author, obviously, they consider the
manuscript, but they're also looking at the kind of publicity the
author can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher W.W. Norton says it wasn't because of Junger's
appearance or manner. It was because of his obsession with his
subject. Norton is a prestigious publishing house known for
literary quality and a traditional interest in nautical topics.
When Junger approached Norton, he was an unknown. He had never
written a book. He had written only a handful of pieces for such
magazines as Men's Journal and American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And his book proposal had been turned down by a dozen publishers
who did not see how a book could be written about a storm. But
Starling Lawrence, Norton's editor-in-chief, sat down with Junger
in his Manhattan office and liked him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obsessional quality to his interest in the
material that I liked,'' says Lawrence, who gave Junger a $35,000
advance. ``Obsession is always an interesting, maybe essential,
quality in a writer. I personally am not interested in books that
don't have to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Junger's obsession was his nature. He tends to fixate.
But part of it was that he had once had a near-drowning experience
himself while surfing on Cape Cod, and the sensation of water
pressing against his lungs had been seared into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is a combination of reportage and deduction: He
tells a compelling and factual human story of the fishermen's lives
leading up to the departure of the boat, as well as that of others
who survived the fateful storm. But he also plunges deep into
imagination to narrate what might have happened in the Andrea
Gail's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is chock-full of information about such
things as how human beings drown, and waves form, and boats are
built, and hurricanes crest. One of the most riveting sections of
the book describes in unflinching detail the fishermen's probable
final moments as their boat sank, after Capt. Billy Tyne's final
radio transmission: ``She's comin' on boys, and she's comin' on
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's best guess as to what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew of the Andrea Gail either have laryngospasms or
completely inundated lungs. They are suspended, open-eyed and
unconscious, in the flooded enclosures of the boat. The darkness is
absolute and the boat may already be on her way to the bottom. At
this point only a massive amount of oxygen could save these men.
They have suffered, at most, a minute or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this book is so good is we know so much more about
the weather _ all this scientific information. The weather is a
principal character in this book,'' says Peter Davison, former
editor at Houghton Mifflin and currently poetry editor for The
Atlantic Monthly. Junger ``is also willing to go the final mile and
tell how people die. Most people end with a cry _ and the mate was
washed off to starboard and never seen again _ and that kind of
crap. Junger really deals with this. It is a brave book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm,'' published in May, 1997, has sold just
over 2.5 million copies. (It has since been made into a movie, of
the same title, that is due out in July, and features heartthrobs
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post ran glowing reviews,
as did many others. National Public Radio alone did five interviews
with him, and People magazine did three stories, the last of which
dubbed him one of the Sexiest Men Alive (author division). He was
on ``Good Morning America'' twice, CNN three times, and made
appearances on Charlie Rose, ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' Tom Snyder,
CSPAN and Fox News. And then Oprah waved him into a chair along
with several other of People's Sexiest Men Alive. One writer dubbed
the show ``Hunk Writers With Less Substance Than Their Books.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger balked. He did not want to do it. He did not have a suit.
His chain saw needed oiling. People would think he was using the
book, he says, ``to catapult myself into some weird, glamorous fame
world.'' But Norton editor Starling Lawrence presented Oprah to
Junger in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence said, `Look. The amount of book sales we're going to
get from this, the amount of money we're going to get from this, is
huge. And you may not feel like you need the money' _ and I did
feel that way _ `but we're a business, and the more money, the
better for us.' He said, `You know, it will allow us to publish a
lot of guys like you, what we thought you were. And that struck
home. I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Junger had done 134 interviews, most with
the national media, four of them online. He had participated in 46
book events and traveled to 40 locations on tour. And reporters
loved him. ``He's affable and enthusiastic, articulate, charming,
frank, modest but not overmodest, romantic but not hopelessly so.
God, isn't there anything wrong with this guy?'' gushed Britain's
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brave. He's built. He's literate,'' exclaimed New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, love letters and marriage proposals poured into
Norton's office by the fistful. And now the former tree-cutter and
would-be journalist who could barely get his stories published, was
transformed into The Perfect Author.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that Junger did not have a girlfriend in
high school. Now, Junger's life could easily be divided into Before
the Book and After the Book. And not having a girlfriend seemed to
symbolize many of the things he felt he could not have before the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, in fact, started out with a healthy portion of the
conventional ``good things.'' Although he has been lionized in the
media as a kind of wrangler writer, Schwarzenegger with a laptop,
Junger was raised in the prosperous suburb of Belmont, the son of
an artist and a physicist. He attended tony area schools before
graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984 with a degree in
cultural anthropology and, at last, a girlfriend. His book is
dedicated to his father, ``who first introduced me to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the very tameness and predictability of his
suburban youth that drove him to build a lean-to in the woods _ ``I
didn't want to kill things, but I wanted to know that I could if I
wanted to'' _ and to scale 100-foot trees with his chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Junger wandered for several years, trying to launch a writing
career without success. Newspapers turned him down. He wrote some
stories for an alternative paper in Washington, D.C., and for The
Boston Phoenix. He waited tables at the old Casablanca restaurant
in Cambridge, Mass., to pay the bills, then wandered down to New
Orleans and tried his hand at fiction. But after six years, ``the
writing thing was going nowhere. And I wanted it so bad. It was
like trying to get a girlfriend in high school. I was like, `What
is wrong? Why won't this connect?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day in 1989, he sat down at a bar next to a guy
who offered him a job cutting down trees. And things began to
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it immediately,'' says Junger. ``I felt, here I have
something which is exhausting, which makes you incredibly dirty,
and you're doing something very scary and that can kill you. And at
the end of the day, you've won. The tree is a stump. A huge dead
oak over this person's house is a stump. Through a mix of machinery
and brute strength and athletic ability and engineering, you have
brought this thing down. It is a tremendous feeling. I fell in love
with it immediately and actually had a hard time giving it up as I
got more into writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't, altogether. There is the chain saw, after all,
right there on the bare wooden floor of his two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan's East Village. (Junger moved to New York from Cape
Cod midway through writing the book, because, he says, he needed a
change.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of him pressing the saw into a 90-foot tree.
It is tacked to the wall, right next to the picture of Ethel
Shatford, bartender at the Crow's Nest, the Gloucester bar that
anchors ``The Perfect Storm,'' and the mother of one of the men who
died on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Junger became close to Ethel Shatford during the countless hours
he spent talking to fishermen in the Nest. In writing the book, he
wrestled with whether to include details of the men's drowning,
thinking largely of its impact on Ethel. In the end, he did
describe their deaths, and Junger later wrote her a letter
explaining why. ``I didn't want her blindsided,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book came out, he started a fund to help the
children of commercial fishermen, called ``The Perfect Storm''
Foundation, and he remains closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Junger sold the paperback rights to his book for $1.2 million
and made another $500,000 on film rights, although he will not say
how much more he has made on the book.
</P>
<P>
   His third-floor apartment, at a $2,500 monthly rent, counts as
one of the handful of things his new wealth has allowed him. He
bought a sailboat for $4,000. And an 1820s farmhouse in Truro,
Mass. He is also planning on opening a bar in Manhattan in June,
with some friends, that will have a ``journalistic'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Junger's first book has also garnered a host of
writing assignments he could not have dreamed of before. He's
written several pieces for Vanity Fair, one about the forensics
being practiced at the mass graves in Kosovo, another about the
mysterious death of a Greek shipping magnate's son, called
``Addicted to Danger.'' He wrote ``The Lure of Danger: Confessions
of an Adrenaline Junkie'' for Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, he will drive from Brussels to Sierra Leone to
deliver a school van and will write about it for The New Yorker. He
is currently working on a piece for Vanity Fair about Albert
DeSalvo, the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler and who,
once upon a time, did some carpentry for Junger's parents. He has
an idea for a new book but says only that ``it will surprise people
that I did it, but they will understand by the time they are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and fortune that have come his way, however,
many who know him say that he has been little changed by his new
status.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, they say, remains a rogue adventurer who far prefers his
worn jeans and tattered black T-shirt to the pressed shirts he
grudgingly dons for public appearances.

CONSUMERS SEE UAL-USAIR MERGER IN A HARSH LIGHT

<P>
   James E. Goodwin, the chief executive of the UAL Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, describes his proposed $4.3 billion
purchase of US Airways as a ``win-win for consumers'' that will
usher in a glorious new era of global air service.
</P>
<P>
   But many passengers see the proposed merger rather differently.
For them, air travel is already a grim reality of high fares,
interminable check-in lines, overcrowded planes, endless delays and
in-flight meals that are stingy when they are offered at all. ``I
look at fares now, especially for business trips, and they are
outrageous,'' said Linda Kurz, an executive assistant in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Those two visions are on a collision course in Washington, where
Goodwin and Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, have
already faced a hostile Congress at three separate hearings. At
issue is whether the airline industry, a generation after the 1978
deregulation law prompted a wave of industry consolidation, will
best serve consumers if it is allowed to become even more
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The United-US Airways deal, if approved by regulators, would
create a winged giant that would carry one quarter of the nation's
air traffic. The proposal has sparked a frenzy of merger talks that
many are convinced could reduce the country's six largest carriers
to three mega-airlines. That prospect alarms consumer advocates and
lawmakers who already complain that there is too little
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no loss of competition if this merger goes
through,'' Rep. Leonard L. Boswell, D-Iowa, said with more than a
touch of irony, ``because there is no competition now.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., was even more disturbed. ``I think the
flying public is in for some real, real horror stories, worse than
they have ever experienced,'' he said, adding that Congress does
not have the power to stop the merger.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will decide whether the combination
hinders competition. But opponents and backers of the deal agree
that it may rise and fall on public opinion and election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers have written to the Justice Department urging
it to look at the effect of the merger on the structure of the
industry. A group of senators led by Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked the
Department of Transportation's inspector general to investigate the
degree to which airline mergers adversely affect customer service.
And attorneys general from 20 states have joined forces to oppose
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, UAL, already the nation's largest airline, has
enlisted a small army of lobbyists to make its case. Goodwin is now
devoting nearly all his time to talking to anyone in Washington who
will listen.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, this is a terrible moment to propose an airline
merger. The major carriers have faced a growing chorus of critics
and government challenges over the last six years. As business
fares rose to record highs in the mid-1990's, many cities and
states came to resent the way large airlines dominated major
metropolitan airports.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that fares are much higher at such hubs than at
airports with more carriers. In Minneapolis, for example, where
Northwest Airlines is the biggest airline by far, fares on average
were 49 percent higher than at comparable airports with greater
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines were also accused of preying on new, low-fare
competitors. The Justice Department sued American Airlines in May
1999, accusing it of illegally driving a small competitor out of
its Dallas-Ft. Worth hub and then raising prices. American denies
any wrongdoing and is fighting the government in court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Justice filed suit in 1998 to force Northwest to sell
its controlling stake in Continental Airlines. It charged that the
deal would lead to higher ticket prices and diminished service for
millions of passengers. That case is scheduled to go to trial later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about airlines rose to such a crescendo last year
that Congress came close to passing legislation mandating specific
levels of service. The industry headed that off by submitting a
voluntary set of standards, promising, among other things, to
respond to complaints within 60 days and to allow consumers to hold
reservations for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, complaints are at an all-time high, rising over
130 percent in the 12 months ending in April.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both United and US Airways score at or near the bottom in
industry measures of service compiled by the Department of
Transportation. United was ranked seventh and US Airways eighth in
on-time arrivals for the 12 months ending in April, according to
the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they could come forward with this deal in an environment
like this leaves you scratching your head,'' said Kevin P.
Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which
represents corporate airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that airline executives live in a world of
statistics while passengers tend to remember individual flights.
United flew 89 million passengers last year so it is not surprising
to Goodwin that some had problems. He acknowledged in an interview
that United needs to improve its service but he said that according
to data compiled by the industry for internal use, United ranks at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin and other airline executives point out that passengers
nearly tripled to 635 million last year from 240 million in 1977,
before the industry was deregulated, but average fares, adjusted
for inflation, declined 40 percent over the same period. Still, the
complex way the industry sets fares, which seem to change by the
minute, has fueled broad resentment among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the airline industry,'' said Leo F. Mullin,
the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, ``is that it gets killed by
anecdotes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most airline executives and industry analysts on Wall Street
believe that consolidation is inevitable. Industry profit margins,
even in the best years, are about 5 percent compared with an
average at least twice that for the companies included in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   United argues that combining with US Airways will give it a
strong presence along the East Coast, where it is weak. That will
be a boon for consumers, the airline said, because the new United
would be able to offer service on 560 city-to-city routes, like
Sacramento to Erie, Penn., and Fargo, N.D., to Panama City, Fla.,
that neither it nor US Airways currently serve. Together with its
international partners, United said it would also be able to offer
``seamless'' service to numerous destinations in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the deal will only force United's rivals to get
bigger, too. Within days of United's announcement, the AMR Corp.,
the parent of American Airlines, the country's second-largest
airline, entered into merger discussions with both Northwest and
Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that AMR will ultimately seek to merge
with No. 4 Northwest, while No. 3 Delta will attempt to combine
with No. 5 Continental Airlines. That would create three giants
carrying 80 percent of all passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline executives argue that having three truly national
carriers competing head to head in every city would be an
improvement on the situation today in which the six airlines have
hegemony over so-called fortress hubs at major metropolitan
airports.
</P>
<P>
   But Samuel Buttrick, a airline analyst with Paine Webber in New
York, called the notion that three big carriers would offer more
competition than six independent airlines ``borderline lunacy.'' He
said that ``more competitors means more supply, means more choice
at better prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers agree. ``Right now all the airlines have to
compete for the same dollar,'' said Wally Thompson, a salesman in
Manhattan. ``Once they don't have to compete, prices will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   To mute criticism, United has pledged not to lay off any of US
Airways' 40,000 employees and has also vowed not to increase fares
for two years after the deal is consummated. In addition, because a
combined United-US Airways would dominate air travel in the
Washington D.C. area, US Airways has agreed to sell most of its
operations at Ronald Reagan National Airport to Robert L. Johnson,
the founder of Black Entertainment Television and a US Airways
director.
</P>
<P>
   But many executives and analysts believe the fare freeze is
meaningless because United has said it reserves the right to raise
prices in response to inflation and fuel costs. Executives at rival
airlines also said that United will ultimately be forced to abandon
some of US Airways' hub airports to justify the expense of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   DC Air, Johnson's new airline, has also been heavily criticized
as a ploy to keep valuable assets at National Airport out of the
hands of United's strongest competitors. There are also concerns
that DC Air, which will depend on United for all its services from
ticketing to maintenance, will not be a truly independent
competitor. And even if it is, United would still be the clearly
dominant airline in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And bigger is not necessarily better for frequent flyers,
including some in Congress. ``I'm a 2 million mile customer of
United,'' Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., told Goodwin. ``I want a
reasonable price and I want better service. I am not so concerned
about the seamlessness of my international and national travel.
That's what travel agents are for.''

A CULINARY SPRINT TO THE FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: A recipe for Quick Peking Duck appears at end of
story.)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tackling the recipes in ``Ainsley Harriott's Meals in Minutes''
(Dorling Kindersley, $19.95) calls for energy, concentration and
dexterity. It often means doing two, three or even four things at
the same time. I am highly organized in the kitchen, but this book
put me to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Harriott, who has one television program in Britain and another
filmed in New York and shown in the United States, is a chef in
high gear, enlisting audience and celebrity assistants to work on
salads, whip up a marinade, sear chicken and somehow assemble a
dish while keeping up a steady, energetic patter. The big surprise
is that this culinary sprint is mostly worth it. Occasionally, a
recipe like spicy Indian ground lamb skewers takes 10 to 15 minutes
longer than Harriott's ETA. On the other hand, I made his pan-fried
pizza in 30 minutes, not 40, as the recipe stated.
</P>
<P>
   That pizza is made with a simple dough of flour, water and
baking powder, which is rolled out in a circle and put in a big
oiled skillet over medium heat. While the underside browns, the
toppings are arranged on it. The whole thing is then run under the
broiler. I've never made a pizza like that, and it was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Spicy wine-steamed mussels, fish in a Thai curry sauce, broiled
cod on couscous and even an oddly appealing onion ``tarte Tatin''
to cut in wedges all worked. Chicken in a spicy cream and yogurt
sauce needed more chicken or less sauce, but it was tasty and easy.
</P>
<P>
   Noodle dishes, quick casseroles and stir-fries, some of which
would be good with leftovers, dominate. Aside from some worthwhile
crumbles and an apricot rice pudding, the dessert chapter is weak.
What I found admirable is how seldom Harriott uses canned or
packaged convenience foods. The purist could go further, as I did
for the pizza, using a tablespoon of tomato paste from a tube
instead of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking Harriott's English tastes: ``mash,'' as
mashed potatoes are called, reigns; so does cod. There are also
clever Asian, Mexican and Cajun touches. He gives a good tip:
freeze chunks of peeled ginger for easy grating.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-minute Peking duck was that fast and excellent. But there
was no crispy skin, so I fried strips of duck skin to tuck into the
pancakes. It added less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>

A PASSION FOR ANTIQUES THAT BEGAN AT THE WATER HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ L. John Wilkerson was 7 when he dug up a shiny stone
arrowhead at a water hole near the family's small ranch in Elko,
Nev. Collecting arrowheads remained a passion throughout his youth,
spent among the children of ranchers and Shoshone Indians, and much
later, when he returned from college to work summers as a cowboy
and do research on the economics of raising cattle in the West. Yet
he never dreamed that in finding that arrowhead at the water hole
he had taken his first step toward becoming, 50 years later, the
president of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wilkerson is a venture capitalist specializing in medical
technology at Galen Associates, a New York firm of which he was a
founding partner in 1995. (He had just sold the Wilkerson Group, a
consulting firm on medical industry technology that he had started
20 years earlier, to IBM.) But he still owns the 60 stone
arrowheads he amassed decades ago. ``The real jewels _ maybe 10 _
are long and skinny, shaped to travel the farthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he and his wife, Barbara, are avid collectors with
broader interests. Color-splashed barber poles, carousel carvings
and apothecary chests enliven his office in Rockefeller Center.
Boldly patterned aboriginal spirit paintings add graphic intensity
to the interiors of their country home in Pennsylvania.
Late-20th-century abstract sculpture fills the gardens of their
home in New Jersey, while American folk art reigns supreme indoors.
</P>
<P>
   As the Wilkersons acquired folk art, they met other collectors
at, among other places, the Museum of American Folk Art. Wilkerson
became a trustee in 1994, became treasurer in 1996 and late last
year was elected board president, replacing Ralph Esmerian, a
pre-eminent collector of American folk art, who had been president
since 1979. (He remains as board chairman.) Esmerian had helped
Robert Bishop, then the director, guide the institution through
turbulent times. Under their leadership, it grew from a one-room
museum with a collection of 184 objects, and deeply in debt, to a
formidable institution with many masterpieces among its 4,000
objects. It organizes exhibitions that travel throughout the world,
and, under its current director, Gerard C. Wertkin, it is building
a $22 million museum on West 53rd Street, due to open late next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson hopes to build on the success of his predecessors,
placing even more emphasis on the business aspects of the museum.
``For the last 20 years, the leadership at the museum had focused
75 percent on its collections and curatorial activities and 25
percent on its business management,'' he said. ``Today with
everything we have on our plate _ the building going up and an
endowment being planned for major acquisitions _ it is a more
balanced equation, 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkersons are already involved in the museum in other ways,
lending pieces for exhibitions. Their 9-foot-long ``Angel Gabriel''
weathervane was hard to miss in the museum's show marking the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Their other weathervanes _ in the shape of horses, cows, angels
and American Indians _ hang floor to ceiling in the entrance hall
of their home. Pennsylvania German cabbage cutters, embellished
with cutouts of hearts and hands, cover a wall in the kitchen.
Painted furniture, shop signs, trade figures and watercolors are
spread throughout the rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In this crowded environment, you have to look closely to see the
complexity in the haunted Munchlike expression in a woman's face in
a gouache by Bill Traylor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilkerson had a head start on her husband as a folk-art
collector: she bought her first piece _ an 1880s cherry end table _
when she was 14. But he proved a fast learner, succumbing quickly
to the easy charm, optimism and diversity of folk art. They began
collecting after they were married 33 years ago, and furnished
their first home on a tight budget with painted chests, tables and
a desk, paying less than $100 for most pieces. By the 1970s, they
were buying decorative objects and weathervanes.
</P>
<P>
   The first vane they bought was by J. Howard &AMP; Co. of West
Bridgewater, Mass. ``We knew he was our guy; his vanes were the
most striking,'' Wilkerson said. ``In the 1980s, we decided that we
would develop the most comprehensive collection of weathervanes by
Howard. We've probably done just that _ nobody else would be so
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 57 vanes they own, 27 are by Howard, a competitor in the
1860s of the better-known manufacturers A.W. Jewell of Waltham,
Mass., and J.W. Fiske of New York. Howard specialized in using zinc
and copper to achieve a better balance in his vanes. He made
stepping horses of exceptional grace, while Jewell strove for more
dynamic movement in his all-copper horses. This characteristic is
seen in a Wilkerson treasure, a patinated flying horse by Jewell,
its tail and mane borne high by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilkersons also realize that their involvement in the museum
is having an impact on their collecting: they are trying to upgrade
what they buy and to better document the pieces that they own.
Their biggest problem as collectors, they say, is that they have
never sold or given away anything from their collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't seem to say goodbye,'' he said. ``We have a lot to
learn from the curators at the museum on how to fashion and
continuously refine a collection.''

THE CONSTITUTION PREVAILS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court isn't perfect, but once again it
has demonstrated its indispensability as the guardian of last
resort of our constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   By ruling that school-sanctioned prayer at football games
violates the principle of separation of church and state, the high
bench protected religious diversity from yet another political
demand for conformity in organized worship.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was 6-3, as thumping a majority as is ever likely
on this deeply ideologically divided court. Writing for the
majority, Justice John Paul Stevens ruled that a prayer delivered
by a student at a school-controlled sports event ``has the improper
effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of
religious worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens ruled that a football game is not a public forum for
free expression. ``These invocations are authorized by a government
policy and take place on government property at a
government-sponsored school related event,'' he wrote, adding that
the circumstances mean the audience would view the student prayer
as stamped with the school's ``seal of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a strangely irrational
dissent, fumed that the majority opinion ``bristles with hostility
to all things religious in public life.'' Actually, it did nothing
of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion did not encompass ``all things religious,'' and it
specifically noted that public school children are free to pray
voluntarily by themselves any time before, after or during the
school day or at extra-curricular Bible classes.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising, however, if the majority felt
unfriendly toward the Santa Fe, Texas, Independent School
District's sneaky attempt to make an end-run around the court's
well-known position that school prayer violates the First
Amendment's establishment clause.
</P>
<P>
   The justices declined to be conned by the transparent device of
electing a student to deliver the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that school officials controlled the stadium
loudspeaker, supervised the vote on picking the student to hold
prayers, sponsored the game itself and generally did not have the
``hands-off'' approach it claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The school policy, Stevens wrote, ``involves both perceived and
actual endorsement of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like Texas Gov. George W. Bush who pander to the
religious right predictably attacked the decision as picking on
devout pupils who merely wish to openly express their piety.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who as governor filed a brief supporting pre-game prayers,
said the opinion was ``disappointing.'' In case the Christian right
felt that he was insufficiently outraged, he also backed the right
of all students ``to express their faith freely and participate in
voluntary, student-led prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate was pulling a typical
political stunt, creating a straw-man to knock down. He did not
address what the high court opinion said at all. Bush was being
disingenuous at best and dangerously incendiary at worst.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was not whether students are free to pray or talk
about their religious faith. Private acts of devotion are
protected. The issue was whether students had the right to impose
their views on others at a big social event, abetted and sponsored
by a state taxpayer-funded school authority orchestrating one set
of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The school district had defended its policy by claiming it to be
``content-neutral,'' a slender legal reed that Rehnquist grasped.
He argued that the policy had a secular rather than religious
purpose: ``to solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship
and student safety and to establish the appropriate environment for
the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure. How does prayer do anything but provide a religious
tone for what is essentially a power struggle between two teams of
bulky boys assigned to maul one another over possession of a ball?
The purpose is to win, and as a practical matter the Lord does not
take sides.
</P>
<P>
   If an `appropriate'' environment is a bowed head instead of
cheering and rooting for the home team, that's a religious rather
than secular notion. If the rowdy game of football needs to be
``solemnized,'' that's a religious rather than secular goal.
Otherwise, cops could be sent in to keep order. And as for
sportsmanship, that's up to the coach more than to heavenly
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Church groups and their political allies who have a majority in
many localities continually press to insert their own biblical
interpretations into the public schools despite competing minority
religious interests. But the Founding Fathers erected a
constitutional wall between church and state to prevent people of
one religion from establishing control over those of different
views. This issue is particularly sensitive in the public schools,
where impressionable youngsters are vulnerable to adult doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   The wall has worked well. But some public school officials still
ignore the message. For nearly four decades bullies on the
religious right have tried various dodges to get around the Supreme
Court's 1962 ruling that organized prayer is unconstitutional in
public schools. One by one, the high bench has struck them down.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest test. It will not be the end of the
struggle between the religious zealots and the Constitution. The
next president _ Bush or Gore _ may get to pick at least two
justices who could make the difference in the diligence with which
the court has protected this constitutional right. Think about it
when you vote.

 DREAMwORKS HATCHES A WINNER IN `CHICKEN RUN'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: A-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up to now, DreamWorks studio's much-ballyhooed challenge to the
Disney animation monopoly has amounted to a trio of duds _
``Antz,'' ``Prince of Egypt'' and ``Road to El Dorado'' _ while
Disney has cranked out four of its all-time greatest hits: ``A
Bug's Life,'' ``Tarzan,'' ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just as Hollywood has all but given up on DreamWorks
animation and its guru, (ex-Disney honcho) Jeffrey Katzenberg, the
studio has come up with what could be one of the big movies of the
summer of '00: ``Chicken Run'' _ the first feature film from
England's Oscar-winning ``Claymation'' studio, Aardman Animation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will catch on with an audience large enough to give
it blockbuster status is by no means assured _ Claymation remains a
cult attraction and barnyard chickens will be a harder sell to kids
than dinosaurs and cute humanoid toys. But the film is clever,
funny and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   It's set in the postwar '50s on a chicken farm in the Yorkshire
countryside that's run like a German POW camp by a tyrannical and
ax-happy matriarch (voice of Miranda Richardson) and her cowering
husband (Tony Haygarth) _ complete with watchtowers, guard dogs and
barbed-wire fences.
</P>
<P>
   Life is so hard and precarious that the colorful flock of
overweight chickens longs to escape. Their situation becomes even
more dire when the nasty owner tires of her low-profit egg
business, and decides to bring in a ton of automated machinery and
turn the place into an ultrastreamlined chicken pot-pie factory.
</P>
<P>
   But hope comes for the doomed chickens in the form of a runaway
circus rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson), who seems to have mastered
the unchickenlike art of flying and is convinced by Ginger (Julia
Sawalha), the primary chicken protagonist and henhouse ringleader,
to stick around and teach the others how to fly the coop.
</P>
<P>
   The big joke, of course, is that the film plays off World War II
POW movies in general and John Sturges' 1963 classic, ``The Great
Escape,'' in particular. It apes several of that film's plot
points, its music mimics Elmer Bernstein's famous score, and
there's even a character who methodically bounces a baseball
against a wall Steve McQueen-style.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, however, co-directors Peter Lord and Nick Park do not
belabor this premise, and use it mostly as an extended gag off
which they play their cast of delightfully surreal puppet creations
_ a gaggle of cowardly chickens, a pair of mercenary rats, one
horrific human villainess _ in a string of hilariously Aardmanesque
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Aardman's cult of fans should especially enjoy the movie. Even
with its G rating, it retains the characteristic Aardman hard edge,
it never seems to compromise itself to appeal to a mass audience,
and it constantly works into its rich visual fabric the various
eccentric motifs and devices of the studio's short films _ so it
almost becomes a tribute to Aardman's past.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Chicken Run'' also should work for an audience that has no
identification with the studio's Claymation masterpieces. The story
is compelling, the characters are endearing and the atmosphere is
magical. Above all, it represents something refreshingly different
from the hand-drawn and computer-generated Disney-style animation
that currently rules the multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Run. Directed by Peter Lord &AMP; Nick Park. Screenplay by
Karey Kirkpatrick. Voices: Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda
Richardson, Jane Horrocks, Benjamin Whitrow. DreamWorks. 85
minutes. Rated G, suitable for all audiences.

Jackson asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to accept the Microsoft

disagreed with him in the past. Jackson also stayed some of the

   WORCESTER, England _ The sun has set on the British Empire, but
not on a handful of products that followed the Union Jack overseas.
Colman's mustard, Gilbey's gin and Lipton's tea remain familiar in
English-speaking countries and many others, and Lea &AMP; Perrins
Worcestershire Sauce is as ubiquitous as taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lea &AMP; Perrins bottles, with their characteristic long necks,
designed to make it easy to Shake Well Before Using, have turned up
in shipwrecks, encrusted with barnacles; in the forbidden city of
Lhasa, Tibet; and in the excavations at Te Wairo, New Zealand,
which was buried by a volcanic eruption in 1886. I came across one
during the Vietnam War in a semi-defunct colonial hotel in Dalat
and another in a bar in Samarkand in what was then Soviet Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Very few food products have been made to the same formula for so
long. Lea &AMP; Perrins Worcestershire was first formulated in 1835.
Its name was registered as a trademark in 1892, and it has been
manufactured since 1897 in a handsome red-brick Victorian factory
on Midland Road in Worcester, a mile from the city's fine medieval
cathedral and 125 miles northwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1848, a batch of old letters in the company archives
show, crates of the sauce were dispatched to Gibraltar, Malta,
Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand, Mauritius, South
Africa, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Canada, Jamaica and, in the United
States, to New Orleans and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 25 million bottles a year are produced here and shipped
around the world. Sauce concentrate is shipped to other countries,
to be diluted and bottled there, and the stuff is made from scratch
in Fair Lawn, N.J., in a plant where 10 employees won brief fame in
1996 by hitting the lottery for $14.3 million. The formula is the
same everywhere, unlike that for Coca-Cola, which adapts its recipe
to suit local variations in taste.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Lea &AMP; Perrins Worcestershire is sold in 140 countries.
Not even the tribulations of wartime have interrupted the cascade
of condiments. A bombing raid during World War II resulted in the
temporary disappearance of the familiar orange-and-brown labels,
but not of the bottles; they continued to roll off the line, in the
standard 5- and 10-ounce sizes, bearing utilitarian,
black-and-white labels that announced, ``Messrs. Lea &AMP; Perrins are
compelled to issue this label owing to the destruction of their
printer's establishment by enemy action.'' What stiff upper lips!
</P>
<P>
   There are other manufacturers of Worcestershire sauce, of
course. It is one of Heinz's many varieties. But as Dave Clements,
the good-humored, 35-year-old factory general manager for Lea &AMP;
Perrins, asked me when I visited the plant, ``If Heinz does it
better than we do, why isn't it called Pennsylvania sauce?''
Besides, a British high court ruled in 1906 that while anyone could
call a sauce Worcestershire, no matter where it was made, only Lea
&AMP; Perrins could use the words ``original and genuine'' to describe
its product.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to escape the conviction that early on, before the
invention of refrigeration, Worcestershire sauce was used to
compensate for culinary ineptitude and ingredients that had passed
their prime. Raymond Postgate, the founder of the ``Good Food
Guide,'' said of Worcestershire and its bottled brethren, ``They
were provided on the justified assumption that you would want to
hide completely the taste of what you would be offered to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is all but indestructible, whether by heat, cold or
time, which made it a welcome companion on long sea voyages. But
its flavor _ it is piquant, salty, vinegary, slightly fishy and
perhaps vaguely fruity _ also had a broad appeal that has never
waned.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, it is perhaps best known as an indispensable
ingredient in the Bloody Mary, a cocktail perfected in the 1920s at
Harry's New York Bar in Paris by Fernand Petiot, the head
bartender. Worcestershire sauce is also a popular seasoning for
steaks and a must in Welsh rarebit, the classic end-of-meal savory.
</P>
<P>
   The United States uses more Worcestershire sauce than any other
country. Other strokes for other folks: In Japan, it is widely used
as a soy substitute, with sushi and other dishes. In New Zealand,
the largest consumer of Worcestershire sauce per capita, it for
many years relieved the monotony of a diet overladen with lamb. El
Salvador, for reasons that make officials here scratch their heads,
consumes 450 tons of sauce every year _ 2.5 ounces for every man,
woman and child in that little Central American nation _ and has
spawned counterfeit labels seeking to mimic Lea &AMP; Perrins.
</P>
<P>
   A few epicures may turn up their noses, and Worcestershire sauce
gets no entry in the ``Larousse Gastronomique.'' But it has plenty
of defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a valuable flavoring when used with skill and
moderation,'' writes Tom Stobart in ``Herbs, Spices and
Flavorings'' (Overlook Press, $16.95). ``Cooks do better to steer
clear of made-up flavorings, but an item which has been popular and
unchanged for over a century, and is used by chefs in so many
countries, must be an exception. One could almost say that it has
graduated as a basic natural ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   The sap of the wonderful Worcestershire tree, you might suppose.
No, not really. So what actually goes into the sauce? How is it
made? In keeping with long-standing tradition, Clements was willing
to explain just so much and no more. The ingredients are stated on
the label: vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, tamarinds,
onions, garlic, spices and ``flavoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last three words hide more than they reveal; I was able to
pry nothing more specific from Clements than the fact that there
are chilies and cloves in the mix and one ``secret ingredient'' as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told you what it was,'' he said, putting on his best
mock-MI5 cloak, ``I would have to shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Ginger, perhaps? Sassafras? Elixir of bus driver's glove?
Something as mundane as soy? Another tropical fruit to complement
the tamarind?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Worcestershire sauce is an advertisement for free trade, in its
manufacture as well as its distribution. The anchovies come from
Spain, Italy or sometimes Morocco. The cloves come from Southeast
Asia or Zanzibar, the garlic and chilies from China and the
tamarinds _ dark brown pods containing a juice widely used as a
souring agent _ from northeastern India.
</P>
<P>
   Each major ingredient is treated separately. The anchovies are
preserved in salt, for example, and aged for three to five years,
in a process similar to that which produces nam pla fish sauce in
Thailand, while the vegetables are pickled in vinegar. All are
stored in small blue barrels, which are labeled with the name of
the ingredient and the date. One that I spotted said ``Pickles,
1997 season, shallots, 100 kilograms, malt vinegar, 100
kilograms.''
</P>
<P>
   At the appropriate moment, the aged and unaged ingredients are
combined in huge fiberglass maturing tanks, holding up to 30,000
liters each (more than 7,000 gallons). These have replaced more
romantic but less manageable oak casks. The mixture is never cooked
(though it is heated just before bottling to pasteurize it). It
just sits there, perfuming the air with an acrid smell. A stroll
through a cellar filled with wine vats evokes a smile; here in
Worcester, a walk through the mixing room is more likely to produce
a cough or sneeze.
</P>
<P>
   After several months _ Lea &AMP; Perrins has never divulged the
exact length of time _ the solids are filtered from the brew, and
it is bottled.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy has always been big at Lea &AMP; Perrins. Once, when a
foreign government demanded a list of ingredients for all imported
food products, the firm laid plans to supply it with a fraudulent
formula, which excluded the ``secret ingredient'' and included
spurious ones. At one time, the ingredients had code names, known
to a few, beginning with the letter B _ Bulimay, Buggy, Bugbear,
Bugler, Building, Bulldog, Buglehorn, Bullcalf, Bullace and
Bulletin, but no Birdseed.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence of decades of caution is that no one knows how
the sauce originated. Legend, handed from generation to generation,
has it that a Lord Sandys (presumably an ancestor of the Duncan
Sandys who married one of Winston Churchill's daughters) came home
from service as governor of Bengal, in India, with a recipe that he
presented one spring day in 1835 to the proprietors of the Lea &AMP;
Perrins shop in Broad Street, Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it up,'' he said, and they did. But when they tasted it,
it was revolting, so they consigned it, in a stone crock, to the
basement. There it languished, only to be rediscovered and retasted
many months later. This time it bowled the partners over, and for
years they presented their sauce as the product of a ``recipe of a
nobleman in the county'' (Worcestershire).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, from the perspective of the spinner of stories, a
former Lea &AMP; Perrins employee, Brian Keogh, found otherwise in the
course of his research for ``The Secret Sauce,'' a history of the
firm that was published privately in 1997 to mark the 100th
anniversary of the Midland Road plant. ``No Lord Sandys,'' he
wrote, ``was ever a governor of Bengal or, as far as available
records show, ever in India.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements winced when asked about the sauce's origins. Since
Keogh's discoveries, he said, ``We have had to say that the saga of
Lord Sandys may not be God's own truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 people work at the factory here, and only four or five
know the formula. Each batch of sauce is made by one of two ``head
makers'' _ either Malcolm Taylor or Joseph Neary, both longtime
employees. Head maker, Clements said, is ``a position of enormous
trust,'' because an unscrupulous individual privy to the firm's
secrets could sell them to a rival. Until the late 1960s, head
makers automatically became head magistrates of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins, the firm's founders,
and their descendants ranked among the city's leading figures,
along with the composer Edward Elgar. Leas and Perrinses served as
mayors of Worcester, and a Perrins rescued the Royal Worcester
porcelain factory from ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Like the man who formulated Coca-Cola, John Stith Pemberton of
Atlanta, Messrs. Lea and Perrins were chemists, or pharmacists.
Their shop offered all manner of things, from surgeons' tools and
leeches to Locock's Lotion for the Hair. Like Pemberton, Lea &AMP;
Perrins first touted the health-giving qualities of its tonic.
Worcestershire sauce, an 1851 newspaper ad claimed, ``enables the
stomach to perfectly digest the food,'' and thus ``the daily use of
this aromatic and delicious sauce is the best safeguard to
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's claims are more modest. ``Adds instant richness,'' the
label on the Lea &AMP; Perrins sauce asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Leas and Perrinses no longer run things. Lea &AMP; Perrins was sold
in 1930 to HP Foods Ltd., a company built around HP sauce, more
famous in Britain than in the United States, which resembles A-1
Sauce. After reorganizations, HP Foods passed into the hands of the
French Danone Group, which also makes Evian water, Dannon yogurt
and Kronenbourg beer.
</P>
<P>
   But no Frenchman, people here whisper, has learned The Formula. &QL;

 &HT;    RELIEF GROUPS STEP UP PLEAS FOR INCREASED FUNDING FROM U.S. TO
FIGHT AIDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the epidemic spread of AIDS devastates the
populations of sub-Saharan African countries, international relief
groups Tuesday escalated their pleas for an additional $275 million
in U.S. aid to fight the dreaded disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hear about all the debates on Capitol Hill wanting to
reduce . . . assistance, most of us working in the field don't
comprehend what is going on,'' said Elizabeth Lule, with Pathfinder
International aid group. ``And we would like to request that as
demand is increasing, and since you invested in increasing that
demand, don't stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pathfinder, and the other groups _ 126 in all _ have thrown
their considerable weight behind New York Democrat Joseph Crowley's
Global Health Act of 2000, which seeks to double the current $1
billion the United States spends on worldwide health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease knows no boundaries,'' said Crowley, taking a cue from
President Clinton's statement last month that HIV-AIDS has become a
threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley's bill boasts several Democratic co-sponsors, including:
Texas Reps. Martin Frost, Sheila Jackson Lee, Charles Gonzalez,
Nick Lampson and Ruben Hinojosa; Ohio Reps. Tony Hall, Stephanie
Tubbs Jones and Sherrod Brown; Florida Reps. Carrie Meek and Robert
Wexler; and Georgia Rep. Cynthia McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the bill, which is currently in the House Foreign
Operations subcommittee, is expected on the House floor in the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility as the richest nation in the world to
do what we can to help,'' Crowley said Tuesday during a forum
addressing the HIV-AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He said HIV-AIDS epidemic, which has resulted in more than 16
million people dying since the 1980s, has ``reached catastrophic
dimensions in developing nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that sub-Saharan African countries _ now struggling
with millions of children orphaned by parents killed by HIV-AIDS _
are hit the hardest. In Zimbabwe, there are as many as 800,000 AIDS
orphans. In one rural school, 24 percent of its 946 students have
lost their parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts and relief officials at Tuesday's forum discussed
the benefits of family planning in preventing HIV-AIDS and appealed
for continued funding from the United States, stating that American
dollars save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the urgency of their request, South Africa on
Monday announced its five-year $291 million strategy to combat all
diseases, including HIV-AIDS. But despite an 80 percent discount
from multinational drug firms, limited resources forced the country
to exclude funding for anti-retroviral drugs, such as AZT, which
help prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during
pregnancy, according to South African health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility as the richest nation in the world to
do what we can to help,'' Crowley said, who in April, traveled to
Malawi to observe the effects of HIV-AIDS and work being done by
international relief organizations.

   ELIAN _ ATLANTA _ The federal government and the father of Elian
Gonzalez are urging a federal appeals court in Atlanta to allow the
boy to go home to Cuba. The two parties filed responses this
morning to Elian's Miami relatives. Earlier this month a
three-judge appeal panel upheld the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision not to allow Elian to file for asylum in the
United States. The Miami relatives appealed that decision. Today's
filing by the boy's father says the full appeals court should
``immediately'' reject the Miami relatives' appeal and let Elian go
home. The federal government agrees in its filing. There is no word
on when the full appeals court might decide whether to hear the
Miami relatives' appeal. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

Government co-counsel Michael Bradford told jurors that Davidians

   HEARTLAND-PA _ Before we begin, will Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge
be Gov. George W. Bush's running mate? If the answer is yes, and it
might be, then move Pennsylvania into the GOP column and go on to
the next topic. Even Democrats in the Keystone State concede that
putting the popular governor on the ticket would guarantee Bush a
victory. ``I think he's a solid leader with a great, sparkling
resume,'' a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly
said. ``Now, if Ridge is on the ticket it would make things more
difficult for me....''Perhaps more than any other state,
Pennsylvania is a vexing jumble of political identities. Anchored
by major urban centers Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on opposing
corners, vast miles of the state are rural farm and hunting land.
Last week the state mourned the death of a beloved former
Democratic governor who gained national fame as a rare opponent of
abortion in his party. Ridge, the popular Republican of today,
favors abortion rights. The winner in Pennsylvania will have to
avoid offending Catholics, who outnumber all other regligious
groups in the state, appease one of the largest retiree populations
in America, deal with pockets of deep union support, and thread the
needle on gun control between rural gun advocates and suburban
voters hypersensitive to the dangers of firearms and children.

   HEARTLAND-PABAR _ From most any downtown angle, the renaissance

tattoo parlor. On successive blocks off this road, called Hamilton
Mall, worn row houses still project the image of a working class in
decay. The Allentown of the Billy Joel song back in 1982. A place
still best defined by the absence of something, which in this case
would be the absence of Big Steel.But what a few dismal vistas fail
to reveal is that a sense of optimism now beams through Allentown
and neighboring Bethlehem, twin anchors in a two-county region
known as the Lehigh Valley. This cradle of industrial innovation
and might, where plans were drawn and steel was forged to build the
Golden Gate Bridge and large chunks of the New York skyline, is in
the midst of a rebirth. The Lehigh Valley of the 21st Century is
pulling itself up with bootstraps sewn not from leather, but from
fiber optic cable. In a state where political identity feels
transitory, few places are more in transition than the Lehigh
Valley. The fate of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee
for president, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee, seems likely to rest here on the direction to which
cross-party voters flow. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily News). 20.

   AFRICA-AIDS _ WASHINGTON _ Congressman Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.,

INTELLECTUAL DISPUTE STIRRED BY AWARD TO HISTORIAN WHO JUSTIFIED
HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The award of one of Germany's most prestigious literary
prizes to a historian who has sought to justify the Holocaust has
ignited a fierce dispute here at a time of conservative and
reactionary intellectual stirrings in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The historian, Ernst Nolte, has argued that Hitler's
anti-Semitism had a ``rational core'' and that Nazism was in
essence a riposte to Bolshevism. He received the Konrad Adenauer
Prize for literature this month, causing an uproar that has filled
newspapers with invective and divided one of the country's leading
historical institutes.
</P>
<P>
   The prize, whose past recipients include former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, is given for works that ``contribute to a better
future'' by the Munich-based Deutschland Foundation. The
organization is conservative and close to the right wing of the
Christian Democratic Party but had not been considered reactionary
or revisionist.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the prize, Nolte said, ``We should leave behind the
view that the opposite of National Socialist goals is always good
and right.'' He added that because Nazism was the ``strongest of
all counterforces'' to Bolshevism, a movement with wide Jewish
support, Hitler may have had ``rational'' reasons for attacking the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the prize was particularly delicate because this
is a period of some intellectual ferment in Europe. The success of
the Austrian rightist Joerg Haider in steering his Freedom Party
into government has emboldened the right.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany and France, a conservative reaction is evident
against what the French call ``the angelic left,'' which is accused
of imposing a stifling political correctness on debate and of
backing a multicultural tide that will sweep away the European
nation state.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Nolte has emerged as an iconoclast with
apparently growing conservative appeal. A few days after receiving
the prize, he was widely applauded at a conference in Paris where
he again explored his thesis about Hitler and the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The award of the prize to Nolte was a clear political
statement intended to promote the view that there is no particular
stigma to Nazism in the light of what some Germans now call the
`Red Holocaust' in the Soviet Union,'' said Charles Maier, a
Harvard historian. ``It's exculpatory in the German context. It's
also really scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   The unease and anger in Germany over the prize has been
accentuated by the fact that another prominent historian, Horst
Moller, the director of the distinguished Institute for
Contemporary History, chose to make the speech honoring Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   The institute was established after the war in Munich with a
clear educative mission directed largely toward researching Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Moller said he did not agree with all of Nolte's
views, but went on to praise a ``life's work of high rank'' and to
make a vigorous attack on the ``hate-filled and defamatory''
attempts to stop open debate in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was overwhelming. Newspapers have been filled with
letters from other historians at the institute calling on Moller to
resign. In an open letter to Die Zeit, Heinrich A. Winkler, a
professor of history at Berlin's Humboldt University, said, ``Mr.
Moller allowed himself to become party to an intellectual political
offensive aimed at integrating rightist and revisionist positions
in the conservative mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Moller's secretary said he was traveling and not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   With Haiderism thriving in neighboring Austria, the ground has
become fertile in Germany for a nationalist and right-wing
intellectual awakening. It is fed by weariness, even anger, at what
is seen as Germany's eternal victimization for the Holocaust and by
irritation at the multi-cultural message from a Red-Green
government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nolte took up these themes in his speech. He attacked those who
argue for ``an unstoppable transition toward world civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   He bitterly denounced the ``collective accusation'' continuously
levelled at Germany since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The historian, the author of books including ``Three Faces of
Fascism'' and ``The European Civil War,'' has been well known for
his arguments about Hitler and Stalin since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But never before has a center-right institution like the
Deutschland Foundation moved to embrace him in such a formal way,
intimating that at least the right of the Christian Democratic
party may be ready to countenance the view that the crimes of the
Nazis were not unique and have been unfairly singled out.
</P>
<P>
   A similar intellectual restiveness is evident in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hour of doubt, the hour of the critical mind, that is to
say the time of the Enlightenment is over,'' Elisabeth Levy, a
journalist, wrote recently in Le Monde after her articles
questioning Serbian crimes in Kosovo became the object of a torrent
of abuse. ``This is an illness of the crazed Left.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has made a lot of headway in Austria precisely by
questioning the ``intellectual tyranny'' of the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one assumes that right-wingers are being pushed to the
fringes everywhere, one must say that a wind from the right is a
very healthy thing,'' Nolte has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-wing nationalism is purely defensive in today's world.''

LOW-TECH FOOTBALL GAME ELECTRIFIES NEW GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The years pass. The images fade. But there will
always be that distinctive electric sound.
</P>
<P>
   Bzzzzzzzzt.
</P>
<P>
   Like an razor racing over the top of a young boy's head or a
broken vacuum tube television, it is the sound of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bzzzzzzzt. Childhood afternoons spent in grudge match
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Bzzzzzzzt. Rainy days and seldom-used toys.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sound of Electric Football _ yes, that football game
with the board and the little men _ a decidedly low-tech throwback
to another era.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this year of computer viruses and billion dollar sports
broadcast deals, the game of Every Kid is buzzing, shaking and
vibrating its way back into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, there is the Alamo City Electronic Football
League, which played its championship game last Saturday. In the
final game, Jerry McGhee's Dallas Cowboys routed Barry Stephenson's
Chicago Bears 34-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was picking him apart (with the passing game) like the U.S.
Air Force in Desert Storm,'' McGhee said.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of Electronic Football leagues, comprised
primarily of adults, in the nation. A Web site, which plays the
game's signature ``buzz'' when it is called up, links the faithful
around the world. And a national convention, including its own
Super Bowl, draws thousands yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Here in South Texas, league play takes place in after-hours
elementary school classrooms or in dens and carports. Competitors,
such as McGhee and Hilton Chretien, pony up $25 to compete in a
10-game seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Miggle Toys of Chicago says the game is more
popular now, in the high-tech, Pentium III, full-motion video game
world of 2000, than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in America grew up playing this game, before there
was the Internet and video games,'' said Miggle President Michael
Landsman. ``Those games have proven to be anti-social. You sit in
the corner and you play by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, these kids don't have imagination because it's shown to
them,'' he said. ``When you play this, you can see plays unfold.
They strategize our plays like a chess game. You play an opponent.
You see it. You imagine it.''
</P>
<P>
   For league coaches, it's both hobby and obsession.
</P>
<P>
   They spend their off-hours painting their diminutive plastic
warriors, faithfully recreating their favorite pro or college
teams. They get to know the tiny, green plastic bases that each
player stands on. They juice their players' performance with a bag
full of performance-enhancing tricks.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in after-hours classrooms or the still air of
carports, they go to war. Coach on coach. Play after play.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent practice game in Jerry McGhee's carport.
</P>
<P>
   McGhee, 34, Alamo City league commissioner and his nephew Ryan
McGhee, 16, were supposedly scrimmaging to demonstrate how the game
is played.
</P>
<P>
   There were hand-painted, inch-tall players. It was a
custom-built field. There were talking clocks to keep track of the
time between plays. On one end, the elder McGhee had put a boom box
to play music loudly, in hopes of distracting his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was hit, the field buzzed, and players took off in
all directions like scattering roaches.
</P>
<P>
   While others vibrated and danced higgledy-piggledy, Ryan's
defensive end broke through the line and bumped up against Jerry's
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sack. But Jerry went on with the demonstration, using
the tiny quarterback's bendable arm to accurately drill the
pea-sized felt football to the open receiver located 13 scale yards
away. Had this been a game, it would've been a first down.

<P>
   Not so fast, Ryan reminded him. The quarterback had already been
sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Jerry explained, it was just a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ryan said, it was still a sack.
</P>
<P>
   That, McGhee says, shows the competitive nature of the game.
Others say they got into and learned about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those who looked far beyond the simple toy and I
saw it was a learning tool,'' says Reginald Rutledge, who runs the
Dallas-Fort Worth area league. ``It really helped me to understand
strategy. I'd spent long hours working on players to understand
them and all and that kind of stuff. With that understanding, it
actually helped me as an athlete as I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I put Electric Football in the category of playing checkers
and chess,'' Chretien said. ``It takes a lot of thought and
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of electric football, Landsman said, goes back to
1947 when Norman Sas, founder of Tudor Metal Products, stumbled
upon an electric horse-racing game while on a trip to Europe.
Movement was provided by a small electric motor, attached to the
bottom of the board, that made the whole thing vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sas) said, 'If I can adapt that to other things, such as
football, it might be a good idea,''' Landsman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the very first electric football game _
complete with metal men playing on a 35-inch-by-19-inch sheet
playing field _ hit American toy store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge success. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
game's heyday, it was a million-seller, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   But it died in the 1980s, unable to compete with technology,
Landsman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handheld computer games came out and everyone wanted to have
the newest and latest,'' Landsman said. ``All of the other games _
Monopoly, Clue, ours _ stopped selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Electric Football games soon disappeared from shelves. The
company stopped production in the late 1980s. And in 1988, Tudor
Toys was sold to Miggle.
</P>
<P>
   Electric Football, it seemed, vanished from the American scene,
going the way of trading stamps, full-service gas stations and
8-track tape players.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. In the dens and playrooms of Middle America, there
was an underground scene of guys who never stopped playing the
game.
</P>
<P>
   A league in Toledo, Ohio, had been going strong with weekly
contests since 1975, but didn't know that anyone else played the
game, Landsman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Miggle re-introduced the game in the early 1990s, the
company held a tournament at Michael Jordan's Chicago restaurant,
expecting a little bit of publicity, which Landsman hoped would
boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 300 people show up,'' Landsman said, laughing.
``Everybody looked at everybody else and said 'You play this
too?'''
</P>
<P>
   That began a Renaissance of interest in the game. More leagues
began forming. A semi-annual newsletter was created. The game had
rebounded.

WOODS' EYE IS ON THE BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rest assured, the eye of the Tiger already has turned to bigger
and better things.
</P>
<P>
   What's bigger than the U.S. Open championship, you ask? What's
better than a 15-shot blowout on perhaps the most beautiful of the
Open venues, Pebble Beach?
</P>
<P>
   Try a career Grand Slam at age 24 _ and achieved at the most
famous golf course in the world, St. Andrews, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has a month to get ready for a quest that got his
attention even as he gazed adoringly at his new trinket, the U.S.
Open championship cup, after his remarkable victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that I would love to have happen, and there's
no better site to have it occur than at the home of golf,'' Woods
said. ``That's where it all started. If I could somehow be
fortunate enough to play well and at the right time, and get that
Claret Jug, it would be a good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came close in '98 (finishing third behind his friend Mark
O'Meara). And if I made a few putts on the weekend last year
(seventh place, four shots behind Paul Lawrie) it may have been a
different story. I have to put myself in a position to win and
hopefully I can get that jug.''
</P>
<P>
   With the British Open July 20-23, Woods between now and then is
expected to play only in the Western Open, July 6-9. He usually
takes off for a couple of weeks after a major, and two or three
weeks before one.
</P>
<P>
   Woods played his first British Open at St. Andrews as an amateur
in 1995, and came out tied for 68th place. He's been back to the
Old Course once since then for the Dunhill Cup in 1998, firing 66,
66, 68 and then 72 in his final match, a loss to Santiago Luna.
</P>
<P>
   That is a score total that is 10 shots better than the 282 that
won for John Daly in 1995. And Woods will be practicing away,
trying to get even better as he tries to add the 2000 British to
the three major victories he already has, the Masters in a 1997
runaway, the PGA Championship in a 1999 dogfight, and now the U.S.
Open in a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a 9-, 10-shot lead every time, every single time,''
Woods said. ``Now I realize why most of the golfers out here are
balding and gray.''
</P>
<P>
   They are probably balding and gray trying to keep up with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to work on my game quite a lot, just to get close to
him nowadays,'' said Ernie Els, who tied Miguel Angel Jimenez for
Sunday's B flight championship. ``And, who knows, I'm looking
forward to the British Open. I know St. Andrews pretty well, like
Tiger knows (Pebble Beach). But I have to play out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' worldwide competitors are already out of their minds
contemplating his five official victories in 11 events this season,
and the way he left them in the rye grass from the first day of
this U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing about it all is that they have already raised
their games to try to compete. Players are hitting the ball farther
and scoring lower, all with shrinking waistlines and broader
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody worked out harder this offseason,
practiced harder and came out more determined,'' said Lee Janzen.
``But he's on a level that nobody can catch.''

 &HT;    HOSPITAL STROKE CENTERS SEEN SAVING LIVES
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although more than 700,000 Americans will suffer
``brain attacks'' _ or strokes _ this year, most will be taken to
hospitals that have not implemented relatively inexpensive
procedures and facilities that could save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To correct that, all hospitals should establish stroke centers
to quickly evaluate and treat stroke victims, a committee of
experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although strokes are often painless and seldom as dramatic as
heart attacks, they can result in devastating or fatal brain
damage. An estimated 160,000 Americans die of stroke each year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deadliest aspects is the fact that a victim's
associates often don't realize what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   But a committee of the national Brain Attack Coalition said
Tuesday the story does not end there. Even when stroke victims
reach a hospital, the dire circumstances surrounding their
condition may not be fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that as many as two-thirds of all American
hospitals do not have established procedures for dealing with
stroke victims and as many as 82 percent do not have the ability to
rapidly identify patients experiencing a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary stroke centers'' could be organized around the trauma
center model and operated in community and even rural hospitals at
costs ranging from as little as $8,000 to as much as $250,000 a
year, the committee says in an article being published Wednesday in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended centers would include an acute stroke team led
by a physician experienced in diagnosing stroke, a set of written
treatment protocols, special training for ambulance and emergency
room staff and an established procedure for getting the patient to
a brain surgeon within two hours if necessary. Brain imaging
facilities such as CT scans should be available 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Some primary stroke centers would include stroke units, somewhat
like intensive care units, for the continued care of victims. The
committee said smaller hospitals could choose to have an
established procedure for transferring victims to larger centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendations are similar to those guiding trauma
centers _ getting patients to facilities where the specialists and
infrastructure are in place to evaluate them and treat them
quickly,'' said Mark J. Alberts, director of stroke care at Duke
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Alberts suggested that the ``stroke belt'' _ Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Washington,
D.C. _ would be ``an ideal area'' to start establishing the primary
stroke centers. The region has significantly more strokes than any
other part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the recommendations Tuesday, Alberts and other
authors of the article avoided estimating the number of lives that
could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But they noted that the chances that a stroke victim who is
treated in a stroke unit will not die or be permanently disabled
are 25 percent better than those of a victim treated in a general
hospital ward.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 83 percent of all strokes are characterized as
``ischemic'' events, meaning a clot or other obstruction has
blocked blood flow to an area of the brain. Because of the brain's
voracious appetite for substances carried by the blood _ primarily
oxygen and glucose _ permanent damage can occur if the blood flow
is not re-established.
</P>
<P>
   If given soon enough, a new family of ``clot-busting'' drugs can
reopen obstructed blood vessels and prevent the damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, the remaining 17 percent of stroke victims suffer what
is known as ``hemorrhagic'' strokes, meaning a blood vessel has
burst and is bleeding into the brain. If a clot-dissolving drug is
given to the victim of this kind of stroke, the bleeding will
worsen.
</P>
<P>
   A primary stroke center would have the ability and established
procedures for determining whether clot-dissolving drugs are
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc R. Mayberg, a neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic,
said a recent survey in the Cleveland area showed that only 1.8
percent of victims of ischemic stroke received clot-dissolving
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   And in half of those cases, physicians administering the drug
departed from accepted protocols for using it, he said. One-fifth
of the patients had brain hemorrhages after receiving the drug, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brain Attack Coalition is a group of professional, volunteer
and government organizations concerned with stroke treatment and
prevention.

IN THE NAME OF PEACE AT THE OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one at the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental
law firm in San Francisco, expected December 1998 to be the
cruelest month. The holiday season is supposed to be about peace,
not tribal warfare. But war is what broke out, over Yuletide
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas began when Christian employees decided to celebrate
and the manager told them to decorate the office however they saw
fit. But the firm's non-Christian employees, including Jews,
Buddhists and Muslims, felt slighted, so the boss told them all to
decorate their personal areas rather than one centralized location.
That did not fly, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``People went all out, and it became almost obscene with the
excess,'' said Tracy Salkowitz, the executive director of the
Northern Pacific region for the American Jewish Congress in San
Francisco, who was brought in along with an outside lawyer to help
negotiate a truce. ``They were angry and bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a half-day workshop that about 30 employees attended, the two
arbitrators explained the law on religion in the workplace. Then
Salkowitz asked people to describe what the holiday season meant to
them. ``They said December was a dreary month; they wanted to keep
it festive and celebrate the earth,'' Salkowitz recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that employees created a festival committee in
charge of seasonal decor, dressed up the lobby and other common
spaces with greenery and tributes to the earth, organized a food
drive and abolished the company party in favor of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Earth Justice's brush with religious discord is hardly a
workplace anomaly. With the nation undergoing something of a
spiritual revival, more companies are seeking to accommodate
employees' religious needs by initiatives like letting people swap
religious holidays, organizing prayer breakfasts or spiritual
retreats, setting aside prayer rooms and even hiring on-site
corporate chaplains. The Fellowship of Companies for Christ
International, a Christian group, estimates that 10,000 Bible-study
and prayer groups meet in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to an employer's benefit to accommodate employees'
religious needs,'' said the Rev. Diana Dale, the executive director
of the National Institute of Business and Industrial Chaplains, in
Houston. ``It's a core part of people's grounding, and it makes
them more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that means simply letting people take prayer breaks.
At mondus.com, a shopping site for businesses in Manhattan, Farid
Senzai, 30, a Muslim who is the company's director of business
development, unrolls his prayer rug every afternoon and becomes
unavailable for meetings.
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers, who include Christians, Jews and even a believer
in the Hindu religion Jain, ``are understanding,'' Senzai said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't bother me if my door is shut, and they'll go out of
their way not to eat food in front of me during Ramadan,'' the
Muslim month of fasting.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of American capitalism, the New York Stock
Exchange, has also become a bit of a religious center lately. Jay
Knopf, senior vice president of the brokerage firm Spear, Leeds &AMP;
Kellog, has organized a mincha minyan, or afternoon prayer of
Orthodox Jews, in a computer room at the exchange for four days a
week. (Agudath Israel, a Jewish advocacy group, says there are 99
workplace minyans in Manhattan alone.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't cost the company a penny,'' Knopf said, ``and the
employee has better job satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prayer at the exchange is not just for Jews, either. On Friday
mornings, a Christian group gathers in a corner room.
</P>
<P>
   Such activities reflect the norms of a deeply religious society.
In a recent Gallup poll, 95 percent of those surveyed said they
believed in God, and 48 percent reported talking about their
religious faith at work that day.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have taken note. The Society for Human Resource
Management in Alexandria, Va., says 68 percent of 743
human-resource professionals at American corporations who were
polled in 1997 said they offered flexible schedules for religious
observances and 15 percent said they provided space or time for
religious observances.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing God and the office is not to everyone's liking, of
course, and it can be legally tricky. Complaints to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission about religious discrimination
rose to 1,811 in 1999 from 1,584 three years earlier, though they
still paled in comparison with 24,454 accusations of sexual
discrimination in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires ``reasonable accommodation'' of religious
practice in the workplace. Guidelines issued by the Clinton
administration in 1997 say employees have the right to express
their beliefs, for example by keeping copies of the Bible or the
Koran on their desks, so long as they do not interfere with the
rights of others.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that ``employers don't know what their
obligations and rights are,'' said Marc Stern, a lawyer with the
American Jewish Congress in New York, who helped draft the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the employer is a devout Christian and he's running prayer
breakfast, can he make everyone come?'' Stern asked. ``Are
Christmas trees offensive to others in the same way a nude pinup is
offensive to someone? Many firms have been operating under the bad
advice to treat religion the way you treat sex, which is to ban it
from the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the issue at Sandia National Laboratories, the federal
nuclear research center in New Mexico. The lab allowed an employee
gay-rights group to meet on its property but turned down a
Christian group's request for company recognition. The Christian
group sued in May of last year, and its lawyer denounced Sandia's
policy as ``an insult not only to believers in God, but to
believers in freedom everywhere.'' Sandia declined to comment on
that accusation. But John German, a spokesman for the lab, said the
two sides reached an agreement in principle last Friday to allow
the Christian group to meet on its premises.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions may not have satisfactory answers. Which holds
precedence, Stern asked, a man's right to follow a religious
stricture against working with women or a woman's right to equal
employment opportunities? ``The secular-religion divide is too
great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people want to build bridges. Salkowitz, the
American Jewish Congress official in San Francisco, started a
project this month aimed at getting people to air their religious
differences openly. ``You'd be amazed at the problems that arise,''
Salkowtiz said. ``But it's in a company's best interest to work it
through. They did it at Earth Justice. You wouldn't even recognize
them.''

`CHICKEN RUN' MAKERS PRAY CLAYMATION FILM DOESN'T LAY AN EGG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a mere $50 million price tag, DreamWorks' first stop-motion
animated feature, ``Chicken Run,'' would seem to be _ by current
industry standards _ a relatively low-budget offering. But
Wednesday's midweek unveiling of the film is still being widely
regarded as Hollywood's biggest dice roll of the summer, because:
</P>
<P>
   _Despite huge investment costs, neither of the two previous
major stop-motion animated films of the past decade, ``Nightmare
Before Christmas'' and ``James and the Giant Peach,'' was a
blockbuster hit, and their producer _ Disney _ has since abandoned
the process.
</P>
<P>
   _Claymation is the most stylized and esoteric form of
stop-motion animation, and every previous attempt at a Claymation
feature _ such as Will Vinton's 1985 ``Adventures of Mark Twain'' _
has failed miserably with critics and audiences alike.
</P>
<P>
   _The filmmakers at Aardman Animation have a following and have
won three Oscars for their animated shorts, but their popularity is
still very much a cult phenomenon, and the film pointedly does not
feature their most recognizable characters, Wallace and Gromit.
</P>
<P>
   _The film's stars _ chickens _ do not evoke the same kind of
instant affection that other, more cuddly animals do, yet
DreamWorks is going all out with chicken toy merchandising, and a
tie-in with a fast-food chain that sells chicken sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   _Even though the film has a slightly hard edge and is geared to
play to adults as well as children, Aardman and DreamWorks have
gone for a G rating, which is regarded as a handicap in today's
movie market because it tends to chase away the core teen audience.
</P>
<P>
   So, not surprisingly, when the film's two British directors,
Peter Lord and Nick Park, rolled into Seattle last week midway
though a grueling nationwide press tour, they seemed more than a
little apprehensive about how well their film _ the product of many
years of work _ will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Lord admitted, ``we're nervous. This is all new to us,
and the process of a large (make-or-break) opening is totally
nerve-racking. The truth is that we haven't even seen the film with
an audience yet. ... The only thing that keeps us sane is that
people who have seen it seem to be crazy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two directing partners make a bit of an odd couple. Lord,
the older of the pair, has long, graying hair, a quick wit and a
confident, almost professorial manner. Park is much more shy, and
has a natural sweetness and slight awkwardness that makes him often
seem like one of his gentler Claymation creations.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said he first ``discovered'' clay animation as a high
school student and began to make short films for BBC television
programs while still in his teens. He founded Aardman (the name
comes from a superhero character of one of their early shorts) in
1972, and moved to the company's Bristol studio in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Park began making films in his parents' attic at age 13, sold
his first 8 mm short to the BBC in 1975 and joined Lord _ his
``boyhood hero'' _ in 1985. In 1990, he turned out both the
Oscar-nominated ``A Grand Day Out,'' introducing Wallace &AMP; Gromit,
and ``Creature Comforts'' _ the first of his three Oscar-winning
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company has turned out a succession of
shorts, commercials and music videos with an ironic tone and
distinctive visual style that critics have called ``Aardmanesque.''
Despite limited exposure in the States, Lord said the size of their
following here ``constantly surprises us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, when we decided to go for an international
superstar for the voice of Rocky (the film's lead character), we
sent it to Mel Gibson and discovered both he and his children were
huge fans of Wallace &AMP; Gromit. Far from being resistant, he
literally jumped at the chance to become involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord said the idea of a feature has been in the back of their
minds from the earliest days, and Hollywood _ including Disney _
had been courting them since their first Oscar. ``People would keep
coming to us with their ideas, but somehow we never seemed to like
them. We just seem to work better with our own story ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, they got more serious about the idea and allied
themselves with noted producer Jake Eberts (``The Killing Fields'')
who, after several years of shopping, eventually made a
coproduction deal for them with DreamWorks and French company
Pathe. ``Chicken Run'' was announced in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Why chickens? With a bemused smile, Lord said he finds them
``stupid and ridiculous.'' Park _ who worked in a chicken-packing
plant for two summers as a student _ said, ``Since I was a child,
I've always liked to draw birds. I like the way they behave and
I've always found chickens to be particularly funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I came across a sketch I'd made earlier of a chicken
trying to dig its way under a fence, and the idea suddenly occurred
to me, `Why not make a World War II-style prisoner-of-war movie
like ``The Great Escape'' with chickens as the prisoner
characters.' And everyone seemed to just love the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the pair have hardly been ``up for air.'' Park said,
``We discovered that making a feature film is many times harder in
every way than making even a 30-minute short. If we knew what we
were getting into, I'm sure we would have turned back. But, of
course, it was too late by the time we realized this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Aardman's Bristol studio was transformed from a
small, familylike company into a state-of-the-art animation
facility that now employs more than 400 people. ``It's sad in a
way,'' Lord said, ``because now we don't even know the names of
many of our employees. But you can't stand still or you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord said their relationship with DreamWorks ``could not be
better.'' ``They were quite happy to have us remain in our Bristol
digs _ out of sight _ and (top executive Jeffrey) Katzenberg said
from the beginning we only had to answer to him, promising there'd
be no Hollywood bureaucracy to frustrate us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his word on that score, and was otherwise enormously
helpful all along the line. And far from being (a compromising
influence), he always urged us to be more daring. When we thought
the scene where (a character) has his head chopped off might be too
much for kids, Jeffrey said, `Think of Bambi's mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Park said Aardman hopes to continue making features. The company
has a deal for five more films with DreamWorks, and it already is
working on its second feature, ``The Tortoise and the Hare.''
``Yes,'' Park smiled, ``I realize it violates our rule of working
only with our own stories. What can I say? We just like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the DreamWorks deal is dependent on the success of ``Chicken
Run'' and, if it stiffs at the box office, what then? ``Then,''
Lord said, ``we can always go back to making shorts, commercials
and music videos. In fact, if we had any sense, that's where we
should have stayed in the first place _ because the money is so
much better and the risk is almost non-existent.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Throwing Israeli politics into an even greater
frenzy than usual, the linchpin Shas political party on Tuesday
quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas' resignation does not take effect for 48 hours, which
leaves plenty of time for political bargaining before Barak loses
his parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the strictly religious Shas party does leave, it will not
only reduce Barak to a minority government but also jeopardize his
plans for making peace with the Palestinians. The prime minister
would need the support of Shas to get a peace deal approved
smoothly by a sizeable majority of the parliament and by Israelis
in a popular referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak said Tuesday night that after a week of intensive,
sometimes round-the-clock negotiations, he and Shas had worked out
the major part of an agreement. And Shas politicians made clear
that if an effort was made to address their remaining concerns,
their resignations could well be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely an escalation,'' Eli Suissa, one of four
Shas members in Cabinet, said after submitting his resignation as
infrastructure minister Tuesday. ``But the ball is now in the prime
minister's court.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercising their raw power at a time when Barak considers a
peace agreement to be his singular goal, Shas' leaders are playing
a very public game of hardball in their quest to be treated with
respect and compensated for their indispensable support. They have
chiefly been demanding debt relief and tax forgiveness for their
religious school system as well as the legalization of their pirate
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But their gambit could backfire. Barak's associates said Tuesday
that the prime minister was fed up and contemplating the advantages
of reshaping his government without Shas. While such statements are
meant to pressure Shas, they probably do reflect Barak's thinking,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Tuesday evening, Barak called the
situation a ``crisis that tests the norms of government and Israeli
democracy.'' It also, he suggested, tested his patience, but he
repeated his commitment to a broad government including Shas, which
he called an ``important party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My associates and I made a paramount effort to keep Shas in
the coalition,'' Barak said. ``Ninety percent of the problems have
been solved. We would like to see Shas stay, but we will respect
its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas' latest political maneuver comes at a sensitive time in the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship, when both sides are maneuvering
toward what would be the endgame of their seven years of peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have viewed the chaos in the Israeli government
partly with suspicion and partly with concern. On the one hand,
they suspect that Barak is using his political problems as an
excuse to delay meeting their demands. On the other, they worry
that they no longer have a partner strong enough to make a good
deal and sell it to his public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they have displayed a willingness to step back. Senior
Palestinian officials said Tuesday that they would not press the
Israelis to stick to a June 23 deadline for their next withdrawal
from the West Bank. In the midst of Barak's political troubles, the
implementation of the transfer of land this week would have proven
all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said their leader, Yasser Arafat, was acceding
to a request that President Clinton presented in Washington last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to postpone the implementation for two weeks to
examine the possibility of reaching a final agreement,'' Ahmed
Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian legislature and the senior
Palestinian negotiator, told Voice of Palestine Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to push things forward speedily, the Israeli government is
putting on its own full court press to convince the Americans to
convene a retreat-style, Israeli-Palestinian peace summit meeting
in the United States in early July. They have proposed July 5, in
fact. U.S. officials said it is unlikely a decision would be made
before Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returns to the region
next week.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the political crisis is likely to have been
resolved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It has been an intense week of bartering. Barak and his
political negotiators have largely met Shas' demands for money.
They have also promised that the recovery plan for its school
system would be overseen directly by the prime minister's office
and not by the leftist education minister, Yossi Sarid, who is the
Shas party's nemesis. Sarid has volunteered to resign his post, if
need be, but remain in the government to support the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nissim Dahan, a Shas lawmaker and the deputy finance minister,
complained that in return for what Barak was offering, he was
demanding Shas support in advance for every future peacemaking move
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extorting us in the diplomatic, political sphere,''
he said. ``Even if he wants to transfer Tel Aviv to the
Palestinians, we would have to vote yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas' leaders have been upset that they have been portrayed as
extortionists and that so many political analysts have predicted
that Shas would never be able to give up the perquisites of power.
Eli Yishai, the leader of Shas, suggested on Tuesday that the
resignation letters were meant to prove wrong those who doubted
their resolve. ``Our reasons are not personal ones,'' he said.
``Everyone always said give them money, they're incapable of
leaving the coalition, they're bound to the money, to the power, to
the Volvo,'' the car that every minister gets.
</P>
<P>
   An ultra-Orthodox party that doubles as a kind of ethnic pride
movement for Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent, Shas
is by self-definition an anti-establishment outsiders' party. Even
it were to remain inside the government, it would likely continue
to be a difficult partner.
</P>
<P>
   In building a broad coalition government last year, Barak
considered Shas a critical, if temperamental, partner for his
peacemaking plans.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' rabbinical leaders are believed to be more dovish than
their party's working-class constituents, supposedly making them
critical allies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shas has shown a reluctance to support Barak's peace moves,
and in citing its incentives for quitting the government last week,
it referred to plans to ``forsake'' the West Bank.

   The site _ www.vpc.org _ which belongs to the Violence Policy

and crossbones, profanity, and links to three other Web sites,
including one for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The hacked site states, ``If you take my guns, I still have my
computer. VPC just got shot in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of the hacked page reads: ``This propaganda page
had(cq) been interrupted by Domain Hijax.'' The page also says:
``Gone are the lies, the false statistics, the propaganda
bull----.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was still viewable Tuesday evening. VPC officials said
the hacker had gained control of the site's officially registered
domain name, and that it might take several days to restore the
original material.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy
Center, said the hacking ``is the latest example of the extremism
of the pro-gun fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun lobby promises us that their supporters are
law-abiding citizens. This act of Internet terrorism proves that
such claims are hollow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group has reported the vandalism to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Computer hacking of Web sites is a federal crime,
punishable by up to five years in jail and hefty fines.
</P>
<P>
   NRA spokesperson Bill Powers said Tuesday that the organization
had nothing to do with the hacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a comment. It didn't have anything to do with
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker _ a person who illegally gains access to and
sometimes tampers with information in a computer system _ erased
every one of the 925 pages of the Violence Policy Institute's
elaborate Web site, which included 300 graphic files.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the hacker provided a link to another page which
parodies the site of Handgun Control Inc., the leading group
pushing for gun control. The parody Web site, which supports gun
rights, features a Handgun Control logo followed by: ``25 years of
persecuting gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time someone has tried to disrupt the
Violence Policy Center through the Internet. In February, the
center's e-mail system was bombarded with about 4,500 messages that
read ``hackers against gun control'' in an effort to shut down the
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sugarmann said, hate e-mail to the center has
tripled in the last year.

SCALLOPS, THE SWEETEST OF FEASTS, OUT OF THE DEEP

   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ In the mid-19th century, this was one of
the most prosperous cities in the country. Merchants and ladies
with parasols strolled its elm-lined avenues, successful ship
captains vied to build the most magnificent Greek Revival-style
homes and from the all-important Customs Tower whaling ships could
be seen sailing in and out of the harbor, one of the most beautiful
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in all America,'' Herman Melville wrote in ``Moby
Dick,'' ``will you find more patrician-like houses, parks and
gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford.''
</P>
<P>
   That era of prosperity reached its height in 1857, when the New
Bedford whaling fleet, employing some 10,000 sailors, outranked the
fleets of all other whaling ports in the world combined. But
shortly, as petroleum supplanted whale oil as a fuel, New Bedford
went into an economic decline that has plagued it ever since. Even
its scallop industry, once the city's lifeblood, withered.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1990s were particularly difficult, as limits on fishing
were imposed by government regulators, but now things seem to be
looking up. Before the end of June, an abundance of sweet,
extra-plump sea scallops should be flowing out of this port city to
markets and restaurants all over the country. The reopening of
6,000 square miles, or about 30 percent, of Georges Bank, home to
the world's greatest scallop beds, in mid-June just about
guarantees it. Scallops are perhaps the most ethereal of all
seafoods _ delicately translucent, creamy, tender, with a nutty,
sweet flavor _ and the ones arriving in the summer of 2000 should
be some of the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   The New Bedford scallop industry centers on sea scallops, the
large variety gathered year round from the ocean floor off New
England. Their much smaller cousins, bay scallops, are harvested
from the shallow waters between Cape Cod and Long Island in a
season that lasts only four months, November through February. Not
surprisingly, the bay scallops are much more expensive. The
industry is estimating that in 2000, sea scallops will cost 15 to
20 percent less than they did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The sea scallop revival started in 1999, with about 20 million
pounds of scallops landed, as against 12 million in 1998. But the
quantity was not the only amazing change. We were served some
incredibly sweet, tender sea scallops in Hawaii in October 1999 and
found they had come from New Bedford. Clearly, the quality was
improving as well.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the mood is so optimistic lately at the Whaler, a dark
fishermen's bar on Herman Melville Boulevard a few blocks from the
waterfront here. After hearing reports that the 2000 haul would be
even more bounteous, we found ourselves having coffee there in late
spring with Jay Blanchard, a former scallop-boat captain who is now
owner of Palmer's Island Seafood, a distributor of scallops in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These areas are so heavy with scallops now that it's like
taking candy from a baby,'' Blanchard said. ``There's no way that
anybody can avoid getting a good haul out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1998, it looked as if New Bedford's scallop
industry was doomed. Having closed huge areas of Georges Bank in
1994 because of overfishing, federal regulators were recommending a
further 10-year hiatus in hopes that the scallop stocks would
recover.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 closing was only the latest attempt to combat
overfishing. Previously, the government had imposed a program to
try to reduce the number of boats in the fleet, regulations cutting
the total number of days scallopers could spend at sea each year
and a mandatory reduction of the maximum crew on each boat,
traditionally about 13, to 7.
</P>
<P>
   Scallopers were hit hard, because they are specialists. Their
work requires equipment made specifically for scalloping, and most
had only one or two boats. They couldn't simply switch to another
catch. When their boats were idle, so were they. Even in the best
of times, sea scalloping is a bruising trade.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full day to reach the scalloping grounds on Georges
Bank, about 180 miles out, so scallopers typically go for 9 to 12
days at a stretch. Some go out for as long as three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the boat has arrived at the beds, two 13-foot dredges,
basically bags fashioned from heavy metal rings fastened to a
reinforced metal frame, are lowered to the ocean floor by winches
amidships, then dragged along until full.
</P>
<P>
   When hauled up, the dredges resemble nothing so much as dump
trucks full of rocks. But as soon as they are poured out on deck,
the riches are obvious. Working by hand, the crew quickly separate
the scallops from the stones and other debris, shell and clean
them, and put them on ice in the hold. Because the shells never
entirely close, scallops are particularly perishable, and are
usually processed almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-hour shift, a good shucker can cut about 80 pounds of
scallops; everyone takes a hand, as a result of the mandatory
reduction in crew size.
</P>
<P>
   But 80 pounds is just a tiny part of the catch. When they leave
the harbor and pass under the drawbridge on their way out to sea,
scalloping boats are loaded with thirty to forty tons of ice; when
they return, they are carrying about sixteen tons of shucked
scallops.
</P>
<P>
   The scallops come off the boats in bags of 40 to 50 pounds and
are sold to local processors. The best _ ultrafresh scallops caught
the last day out _ are sold to top restaurants and seafood
purveyors. These are sometimes designated as ``day boat scallops,''
but this term, which has gained great popularity on restaurant
menus, technically refers to scallops harvested from shoal areas
off the Maine coast by scallopers who go out and back the same day.
</P>
<P>
   They share a certain elan with ``diver scallops,'' very
expensive scallops harvested one at a time from ocean shelves off
Maine by divers. Some people consider diver scallops slightly
tenderer and sweeter, but judging by the 1999 catch, sea scallops
are their equal.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the catch is shipped on ice, just as it was
stored on the boat. The rest are frozen, either in five-pound
blocks for sale to supermarkets and big institutions, or
individually for restaurants or specialty markets. Fortunately,
scallops freeze well.
</P>
<P>
   The scallopers are paid about half what the dealers get for sea
scallops. From the beginning, scallopers considered the government
regulations an unnecessary burden. Around the end of 1998, many
began protesting, saying that the scallop population had rebounded
and that the regulations should be eased. Regulatory agencies
disagreed and were moving ahead with plans for the 10-year closing.
</P>
<P>
   But then some New Bedford scallopers took the unusual step of
turning to academia. They asked Brian Rothschild and his associates
at the nearby Center for Marine and Science Technology at the
University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth to help them document
their observations.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and his associate Kevin Stokesbury got permission
from the government to do exploratory dredging in one area of
Georges Bank. As the scallopers suspected, the findings indicated a
relative abundance of scallops. In fact, what they found was enough
to persuade the New England Fishery Management Council, which
regulates fishing in the region, to open one of the three closed
areas of Georges Bank to scallopers for six months as a trial. The
catch was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional methods of estimating scallop abundance are
subject to second-guessing and debate, and federal officials
disagreed with the scientists' projections on the scallop
population. Then Stokesbury decided to mount an underwater camera
on an oversize tripod to drop onto the ocean floor. He photographed
portions of Georges Bank, counted the number of scallops, and
extrapolated the results.
</P>
<P>
   The findings amazed everyone but the scallopers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulators were saying that there was a high mortality
rate among the scallops, and it was true,'' said Michael Travers of
the Economic Development Council of New Bedford. ``But the reason
was that there were so many of them that they were literally
suffocating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, sea scallops are very prolific. Like other mollusks
they are hermaphroditic and shed eggs and sperm, which unite in the
water to become embryos. During the first month or so after
fertilization, the incipient scallops go through three stages while
still moving around in the water. They then settle on the bottom,
begin to form their shells, and in three to four years reach the
adult stage. What is eaten is the adductor, the large muscle that
opens and closes the shell.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by the photographs, the regulatory agency agreed to
open two of the three closed areas. Patricia Fiorelli, a fishery
analyst at the agency, said, ``You're going to see huge, plump,
mature scallops that we haven't seen for years, because previously
they were caught before they got to this size.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seafood connoisseurs might consider this a disadvantage,
since size has traditionally been seen as something of a detriment
in scallops. Sea scallops have been considered less desirable, for
example, than the smaller bay scallops, which are thought to be
more tender.
</P>
<P>
   But only sea scallops are large enough to roast, for example,
since bays tend to overcook in the oven. Larger scallops also get a
good, hard sear on the outside when sauteing or grilling, while the
inside stays perfectly tender.
</P>
<P>
   Whether large or small, the best scallops are those known as
``dry'' scallops, which have not been chemically treated in any
way. ``Wet'' scallops have been soaked in phosphates at the
processing plants in New Bedford, preserving them about four days
longer. Unfortunately, the process also adds weight by plumping up
the scallops with water. When cooked, these scallops exude quite a
bit of liquid, which can play havoc with recipe proportions and
make it difficult to brown them properly.
</P>
<P>
   Dry scallops tend to be ivory, pinkish gray, tan, light coral or
even grayish, usually a mixture of several colors in the same
package. They are sticky and rather flabby. Wet scallops, by
contrast, are uniformly bright white with a slippery feeling and
often sit in a telltale pool of milky liquid. But it is admittedly
difficult for most shoppers to tell whether scallops are dry or
wet.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless ways to cook scallops, although one of the
most common is simply breaded and baked or broiled. There are
countless ways to garnish them, with everything from bacon to
cilantro. But every New Bedford scalloper we spoke with had the
same idea: deep-fry them. The large scallops of summer 2000, plump
and succulent, can be sliced in half to form medallions for quick
frying, in the grand tradition of sailing ships and elegant dining
rooms in New England since whaling days.

   1 large tomato, diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   \ cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup roughly chopped fresh oregano (or substitute parsley)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cracked coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 pound large sea scallops.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium bowl, combine tomato, cucumber, olive oil,
vinegar, oregano, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste.
Mix well and set aside.
</P>

   2. In a small bowl, combine coriander seeds, mustard seeds, salt
and pepper, and mix well. Rub scallops generously with this
mixture, and thread them onto skewers through their equators.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the scallops on a grill over a medium-hot fire. (It's
medium hot if you can stand to hold your hand 5 inches above the
grill surface for only about 2 seconds.) Cook until the scallops
are brown and slightly crisp outside, 2 to 3 minutes a side. To
check for doneness, cut into a scallop; it should be just opaque
all the way through. Be careful not to overcook the scallops, or
they will become tough.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove scallops from heat, slide them off skewers and serve,
accompanied by relish.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will return to portions of the East on
Wednesday as a jet stream disturbance crosses the Great Lakes.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will develop from New
York to northern Maryland while farther east, sunshine fades behind
thickening clouds across New England.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of potent storms will erupt late Wednesday
afternoon from Lake Erie to Kentucky as sultry air is lifted by an
approaching cold front. A few of the storms will be severe, with
hail and damaging winds. Heavy showers and thunderstorms will bring
flooding to northeast Texas and Arkansas where the cold front slows
its southward progress.
</P>
<P>
   Partial sunshine will cover the Southeast. As the potent summer
sun heats the humid air, ascending currents of air will cause
clouds and spotty thunderstorms. Elsewhere, the West will stay
mainly dry, with ample sun, though isolated storms will form near
the Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THUNDERSTRUCK
</P>
<P>
   Many long-time residents of Barrow, Alaska, paused in
astonishment on Monday when the weather did something they had not
seen before. The first thunderstorm in the recorded history of the
nation's northernmost weather station added unfamiliar illumination
to the land of the midnight sun. Although very rare, thunderstorms
have occurred in the past over extreme northern Alaska, but never
at the official reporting site. Weather records at Barrow began in
1901.

   CONGRESS-HATE-CRIMES (Washington) _ Senate approves by a vote of
57-42 a bill that makes hate attacks on homosexuals a federal
offense. While the Senate passed a similar measure last year by
unanimous consent, Tuesday's vote was the first time either House
of Congress backed protection of gays or lesbians on a rollcall
vote that would have political consequences. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT (Washington) _ The trial judge in the Microsoft
antitrust case Tuesday stayed all the restrictions he had imposed
on the company until the Supreme Court decides whether or not to
hear the appeal. Although he had been expected to ask the high
court to consider a direct review, the stay was unexpected. It
apparently reflected his previously stated view that he felt
uncomfortable imposing remedies in the case without a quick review
by a higher court. The move may buy Microsoft several months at
least, since the Supreme Court may not decide whether to take the
case until fall. By Joel Brinkley.

   GORE-COLLEGE (Cambridge, Mass.) _ An in-depth look at Al Gore's
years at Harvard, which were far more politically volatile than
those of George W. Bush's at Yale. By Melissa Henneberger.

   TEXAS-PARDON-BOARD (San Antonio, Texas) _ The Texas board of
pardons and parole will vote this week on whether or not to give a
reprieve to convicted killer Gary Graham. Sara Rimer profiles the
board, which is unlike any other body in the country. They are all
appointees of Gov. George W. Bush and receive $80,000 a year. They
never meet in person but only talk on the phone. They are perhaps
the governor's biggest imprint on executions in Texas. By Sara
Rimer.

   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Emboldened by last week's summit
meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, Taiwan's new
president, Chen Shui-bian, on Tuesday invited his Chinese
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, to take part in a similar peace-making
effort. China immediately rejected the overture. By Mark Landler.

   LUNG-CANCER-SCREENING (Undated) _ When word got out recently
that two radiology centers in Portland, Ore., were offering a new
screening test for the early detection of lung cancer, the response
was overwhelming. Smokers and former smokers jammed the centers'
phones, demanding the simple, painless test that can find lung
cancers so tiny that they can be snipped out and, doctors hope, the
patients cured. It is a scene that is being repeated throughout the
country as more and more radiologists begin advertising that they
can carry out the lung cancer screening test. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PARENTS (Undated) _ In the world of Internet startups,
where a typical chief executive is 30 and a labor shortage
continues even as some dot-coms fail, dot-commers in more than a
few cases are recruiting their own parents. These thirtysomethings
belong to a generation that came of age comfortable with both
technology and the risks that come with entrepreneurship. Most of
their parents are still in the work force, many of them still years
from retirement. By Katie Hafner.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge who ordered Microsoft Corp. to be broken
up Tuesday sent the company's appeal of his historic antitrust
ruling directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest tribunal, nearing the end of current term,
can now either accept the landmark case or else turn it back to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for further review.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson acted under a rarely
invoked law that allows the Supreme Court to decide antitrust cases
of major national importance without a prior review by a federal
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Jackson brushed aside Microsoft's legal objections
and upheld the view of the Justice Department and 19 states that
short-circuiting the normal appellate process ensures ``the most
prompt and efficient resolution'' of the widely watched case.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 120-word order, Jackson granted Microsoft a reprieve
by freezing, while the appeals process moves forward, the strict
curbs he had imposed on the way the software giant can do business.
</P>
<P>
   Those so-called conduct-based remedies, which were due to go
into effect Sept. 9, would ban Microsoft from punishing computer
makers who support rival products and force the company to license
its popular Windows operating systems on non-discriminatory terms.
They also would allow the manufacturers to modify Windows before
shipping their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Concurring with government briefs that cited the vital role
technology
</P>
<P>
   has come to play in the U.S. economy, Jackson said a direct
review of his sweeping June 7 ruling by the full Supreme Court was
of ``general public importance in the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   While, at one point or another, the nine-member high tribunal is
virtually certain to accept an antitrust case of such paramount
importance, it first must decide whether to do so on the fast track
laid down Tuesday or on the regular track that requires an initial
decision by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   That intermediate body, which sits in same courthouse as
Jackson, has shown its clear interest in taking case by declaring
that all seven eligible members, rather than the customary
three-judge panel, would weigh the appeal if it were to first come
before them.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could decide on its course of action before
the conclusion of its current term, only days or weeks from winding
up, or it could wait until the start of its next term, which begins
in the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars believed Jackson had stayed his conduct remedies
to leave the Supreme Court the option to set its own timetable
without being overrun by his own. His decision also waives the
possibility that the Court of Appeals, were it to win jurisdiction,
would have stayed these remedies pending the outcome of a full
appeal _ a decision which would have handed Microsoft a tactical
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the justices expedite their handling of the case,
Microsoft will have until Aug. 12 to file an appeal of Jackson's
fast-track ruling. The government then would have 30 days to
respond and explain why they think the case should not be initially
heard by the appellate judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department immediately hailed Jackson's move, while
noting that his stay of the temporary steps he imposed made it all
the more important for the Supreme Court to hear the appeal
directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the court's decision to place the
appeal directly in the Supreme Court,'' the department said in a
statement. ``This decision affirms the department's position that a
quick and effective remedy is necessary to resolve this significant
case.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Microsoft. The company is
counting on the justices to shun the daunting prospect of reviewing
the entire 13,466-page trial transcript and as well as some 2,700
trial exhibits in favor of reading the appellate summaries.

 &HT;    SENATE REJECTS CUBA COMMISSION
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate rejected a proposal Tuesday to create a
commission designed to improve U.S. relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to me that we can have a normal
relationship with China and Vietnam, and lift sanctions on North
Korea, but it is not possible to even form a commission to just
look into the Cuba issue,'' said. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
the amendment's author shortly before the 59-41 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., called the proposal a ``pointless
political exercise that attempts to set foreign policy through a
partisan commission, rather than the normal conduct of foreign
policy by the president and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big differences between China and Cuba,'' Mack said.
``China began policy changes and economic reforms as early as 1978,
and today they continue to open their economy, while Cuba does not
permit trade independent from the state, or freedom in economic
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the bill comes at the wrong time
because of the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy in Cuba shouldn't be decided by a commission appointed
by a lame-duck administration,'' Graham said. ``It should be
decided by the American people in the next election for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would have created a commission to Cuba made up of
twelve members. Six of the members would have been appointed by the
President, and six by Congress _ of the latter, two would be
Republicans and one a Democrat from both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said that was arrangement was blatantly political because
eight of the members would be Democrats and four would be
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said that he hoped the commission would help establish a
better relationship with Cuba, and especially lay the groundwork
for the future relations in the post-Castro era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a step backwards in foreign policy,'' Dodd said. ``I
am stunned that my colleagues are willing to squander a
relationship with a post-Castro Cuba.''

 &HT;    FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER TO OBSERVE MEXICO ELECTION
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will be in
Mexico on July 2 to observe this country's highly competitive
presidential election, an elections monitoring groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to Carter came during an exploratory visit last
week by representatives of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based
non-profit group concerned with democracy and that has observed
elections in more than a dozen countries in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are a watershed for Mexico,'' Carter said in a
statement. ``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of
the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and
activities the confidence of the international community in the
Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory University professor Robert Pastor, principle advisor to
the delegation, said during the center's exploratory visit in
Mexico allegations of vote-buying, coercion and other pre-election
irregularities were raised by parties trying to unseat Mexico's
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate concerns we are looking at,'' Pastor
said. But, he added, ``it's not enough to have anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has gone through sweeping electoral reforms since its
last presidential election in 1994. Polls are showing that the two
top candidates in the race are Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox
Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential election looks to be a very close race,''
Pastor said. ``While we were impressed by the trust that all
parties had in the Federal Elections Institute (which conducts the
balloting), we were persuaded of the need for a delegation by the
leaders of all three
</P>
<P>
   parties, some of whom shared their deep concerns about the
potential for serious irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties hope that Carter's presence might ``deter
irregularities and give people the confidence to vote their
conscience,'' Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ambassador to the United States Jesus F. Reyes-Heroles
sent a letter telling Carter his presence would be of ``remarkable
importance'' to the election.

 &HT;    JUDGE SHUNTS MICROSOFT CASE TO SUPREME COURT
 &HT;    420&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge who ordered Microsoft Corp. to be broken
up Tuesday sent the company's appeal of his historic antitrust
ruling directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest tribunal, nearing the end of current term,
can now either accept the landmark case or else turn it back to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for further review.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson acted under a rarely
invoked law that allows the Supreme Court to decide antitrust cases
of major national importance without a prior review by a federal
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Jackson brushed aside Microsoft's legal objections
and upheld the view of the Justice Department and 19 states that
short-circuiting the normal appellate process ensures ``the most
prompt and efficient resolution'' of the widely watched case.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 120-word order, Jackson granted Microsoft a reprieve
by freezing, while the appeals process moves forward, the strict
curbs he had imposed on the way the software giant can do business.
</P>
<P>
   Those so-called conduct-based remedies, which were due to go
into effect Sept. 9, would ban Microsoft from punishing computer
makers who support rival products and force the company to license
its popular Windows operating systems on non-discriminatory terms.
They also would allow the manufacturers to modify Windows before
shipping their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Concurring with government briefs that cited the vital role
technology
</P>
<P>
   has come to play in the U.S. economy, Jackson said a direct
review of his sweeping June 7 ruling by the full Supreme Court was
of ``general public importance in the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   While, at one point or another, the nine-member high tribunal is
virtually certain to accept an antitrust case of such paramount
importance, it first must decide whether to do so on the fast track
laid down Tuesday or on the regular track that requires an initial
decision by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   That intermediate body, which sits in same courthouse as

PENTAGON REDEFINES SUCCESS OF MISSILE DEFENSE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's top weapons
official, signaled Tuesday that the Defense Department is allowing
itself more wiggle-room on the question of whether a proposed
missile defense system will work.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said that even if a crucial July 7 test flight is a
failure, Pentagon officials might still urge Defense Secretary
William Cohen to recommend to President Clinton that he approve the
construction of the complicated network of interceptors, computers,
satellites and sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Pentagon officials said they wouldn't recommend that
Cohen give the go-ahead until the missile defense system had scored
two successful test intercepts. The officials had said they would
require two successful tests in order to be assured that the
technical hurdles associated with knocking a speeding
intercontinental ballistic missile out of the sky with another
missile can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The system scored a direct hit last October but missed in a
January test. The July 7 test was then scheduled to allow the
Pentagon another chance to achieve its second successful test in
time to meet a deadline for Cohen to make a recommendation to
Clinton by August.
</P>
<P>
   The target is a modified Minuteman II missile that will be
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The
interceptor rocket _ fired from Kwajalein Island in the Pacific _
will be directed near the target by radar and then commanded to
deploy a 130-pound ``kill vehicle'' designed to ram into the
warhead some 100 miles above the ocean at 4.6 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about possible outcomes of the July 7 test,
Gansler indicated to reporters Tuesday that the definition of
``success'' had some elastic in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon the types of failures, we may still be able to
say it's technically feasible,'' Gansler, the undersecretary of
defense for acquisition, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said that if ``everything (on the intercepting missile)
worked fine but the target didn't work or something,'' the test
still might be classified as a success even if the interceptor
rocket didn't hit the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a high-risk overall program,'' Gansler said.
``And it's not a high probability of being able to precisely get
everything to work on this flight'' in July.
</P>
<P>
   A successful test on July 7 had been considered essential in
order to meet a deadline of fielding the weapon by 2005, the date
when U.S. intelligence officials believe North Korea might possess
a missile capable of striking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The program is on a tight deadline. By August, Cohen is
scheduled to make a recommendation to Clinton about whether the
weapon is ready to be transitioned from the laboratory to the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in turn must give his approval no later than November or
December if the Pentagon is to meet the 2005 deployment deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is compounded by the need to build a new radar on a
remote Alaskan island in the Aleutians. Contracts must be signed in
November so that the radar can be completed to meet the 2005 date.
If contracts are not signed in time, it will delay the program for
a year, said Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, who manages National
Missile Defense for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, the $36 billion-plus
program will be constructed in several phases, if Clinton gives the
green light. At first the anti-missile system will use 20
interceptors based in Alaska. But by 2007, the Pentagon plans to
begin adding another 80 interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already approved the plan, if it can be proven
technically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   National Missile Defense is being designed to provide protection
for U.S. cities against a ballistic missile attack from so-called
``rogue'' countries such as North Korea or Iran, which are
developing long-range weapons. The system also is being designed to
provide protection against an accidental nuclear missile launch in
Russia, sparked by decaying Soviet-era equipment or a weapon that
falls into the hands of a terrorist.

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Penninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Penninsula,
shifting, yet again, the

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more
than 1,500 Kosovar Albanians still held in Serb prisons without
being charged. Many of them were rounded up by Serb paramilitaries
during last spring's ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbs call them
prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along
and bear witness to one of these exchanges at the Kosovo-Serbia
border to tell the story of these families being reunited. (Coker,

   HOWARD-FINSTER _ SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev.
Howard Finster, the godfather of saving souls, the hardest working
man in the folk art business, had been seriously sick. So the
faithful flocked to Paradise Garden, his wild 3-acre folk version
of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.
And, some feared, it might be the final opportunity to visit

 &HT;    Keystone State seen as key to victory in November
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYN MAWR, Pa. _ Pennsylvania's Route 30 runs west out of
Philadelphia as fast as it can, crossing out of neediness and into
affluence, changing its name to the Main Line and leaving behind
the dull grays of the city for the bright greens of the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Line is the name for a short stretch of Pennsylvania 30
where it runs through Montgomery County, Pa. Just a few miles where
Jaguar and Range Rover have dealerships, where Democrats give way
to Republicans and where a presidential hopeful for the GOP must
stem the predictably Democratic tide of inner-city ballots and
start winning precincts if he wants Pennsylvania's 23 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are streets just like it coming out of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is one of four industrial states across the
heartland where the election will be won or lost. Like Ohio,
Illinois and Michigan, Pennsylvania is a swing state populated by
voters unafraid to cross party lines to cast their ballots and with
a knack for choosing a winner. The last time Pennsylvania supported
a losing candidate was 1968: Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The race for president in Pennsylvania can be seen as a simple
mathematical equation in which the heavy concentrations of
Democratic votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh _ still dominated
by minorities and labor unions _ weigh against the increasingly
conservative voters found farther from those cities.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the colorful political strategist who gained
fame helping President Clinton get elected, cut his teeth on major
campaigns in Pennsylvania and summarized the state this way: You've
got Pittsburgh on one end, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in
between.
</P>
<P>
   That means many issues of significance in the state split
geographically. The cities still vote along liberal lines on social
issues, and the outlaying parts of the state vote bedrock
conservative, even if their voter registration card says Democrat.
But the state's unusually high number of retirees _ who stay put
after their careers because of the state's generous benefits to
seniors _ means some issues, such as Social Security, split
generationally.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Main Line remains predominantly Republican, but
Clinton won these suburbs in 1992 and 1996, and political
strategists in Pennsylvania say the statewide winner in 2000 is
going to have to win them, too.
</P>
<P>
   But winning the suburbs can be costly elsewhere in the state. Go
too conservative and you risk firing up the inner-city Democrats in
Philly and Pittsburgh who, with a hefty turnout, still can sink a
statewide candidate. Go too liberal and, plain and simple, the
suburbs won't vote for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennsylvania right now is more of a Republican state than a
Democratic state,'' said Terry Madonna, who teaches political
science at Millersville University in the Lancaster region of the
state. ``(But) In the suburbs are voters that the Democrats have
been able to woo away in elections.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Main Line Starbucks, a pair of 30-something mothers
police the wreckage where the coffee cake met the toddlers. One is
a Republican, the other a Democrat. They are educated and
interested and listening to Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But so far neither one loves what she's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel 100 percent, or even 70 percent for either one,''
said Laura Harrington, the Republican, a mother of two. ``I'm
having a hard time. I liked McCain but now I don't know what I'm
going to do. They're both doing so much hedging.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician Dr. Allison Oler, the Democrat, is favoring Gore, but
if Bush proposed funding for medical research through the National
Institutes of Health, which has been cut in recent years, he'd have
a good shot at winning her vote. She also might be swayed by
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond elementary and high school, it's also about the
affordability of college,'' said Oler, a mother of two. ``I hope
(one of the candidates) seizes on education as a whole and proposes
something comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington still winces at the thought that Oler voted for
Clinton twice (``I don't care about his personal life, he's done
well by us''), but they are unified in their belief that abortion
should remain legal, and that tougher gun control laws only make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A waiting period?'' Harrington said. ``Why would that be a
problem for anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Pennsylvania is its size and political
diversity. Harrington and Oler want gun control _ even if Oler
wants more than Harrington does _ and that would be warmly received
in the cities. But much beyond the reputable suburbs that branch
north and south of the Main Line and Pennsylvania turns into
hunting country, dotted with towns that close local schools for the
first day of deer season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who has ever run a gun-control campaign in
Pennsylvania has lost,'' said William J. Green, a public relations
executive in Pittsburgh who worked on the staff of former
Republican governor Richard Thornburgh.
</P>
<P>
   This also is where abortion plays a role. Pennsylvania was the
first state to pass a law requiring parental notification and a
24-hour counseling period before abortions are performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a pro-life vote here that has made a difference in
campaigns,'' said Neil Oxman, a Democratic Party consultant in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the anti-abortion vote, Pennsylvania has twice
elected an abortion rights Republican for governor. Tom Ridge, who
like 40 percent of the state's voters is Catholic, was attacked on
the abortion issue in his first race in 1994 when an independent
anti-abortion candidate managed to draw 13 percent of the vote.
Ridge won the governorship with 45 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Ridge hasn't been seriously challenged and won
re-election in 1998 with 57 percent, even as the bishop in his home
diocese in Erie announced that Ridge is not welcome at church
events.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ridge, who won a Bronze star during combat in Vietnam, is
an oft-mentioned possibility to join Bush on the GOP ticket as the
candidate for vice president. Even Democrats in Pennsylvania say
the move would hobble Gore's chances of winning the Keystone State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush rat.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Democrats are so enthusiastic about Ridge, and not
all of them are ready to concede the state to Republicans if Ridge
joins Bush. The die-hards, in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, say
Ridge hasn't cracked the inner-city Democratic base, even if he has
done OK with union voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Ridge lost Philadelphia both times he ran, this is a city
with a deep Democratic heritage,'' said Ken Snyder, a Democratic
consultant in the city. ``There's a Democratic Party infrastructure
that still counts.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Pittsburgh, the president of the Allegheny County Council
that represents the bulk of the city, still believes that Ridge or
no Ridge, Gore is well positioned win there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore is going to carry Allegheny County,'' said
John DeFazio, a Democrat who also is the district director for the
United Steel Workers. ``You look at all the good things that have
happened, it's pretty tough to go with the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore faces serious questions about the loyalty of union
voters in places such as Michigan, some in Pennsylvania say he
doesn't face the same challenge here. Pennsylvania's blue-collar
unions haven't been thrilled with Gore's position in favor of
opening trade with China and other countries _ a stance he shares
with Bush _ but as industrial trade groups they've benefited from
the increase in construction in the good economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore didn't go my way on a few things,'' DeFazio said. ``But
the proof is in the pudding. Things are pretty decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania has participated in the economic boom of the last
several years, but not to the same extent as other states. Steel
and coal continue to contribute heavily to the state's economy, and
although pockets of the state have economies with surging high-tech
markets, Pennsylvania is not a growth state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't produce jobs the way we should. We're a net exporter
of college students and we're migrating people,'' said Madonna of
Millersville University, which conducts that state's widely cited
Keystone Poll on politics. ``Should the economy catch a cold, we'll
get pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The `decent' state of things is a mixed bag, both for Gore and
for Bush. Union members argue that if the economy continues to grow
through November, it will improve Gore's chances of winning the
state. But Republicans counter that Gore isn't likely to get much
credit for the recent prosperity, which they say is as much the
result of a Republican congress as a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   And, they argue, Gore is more likely to suffer the consequences
of having a more contented, less energized political base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has kept a lot of people working,'' agreed Pat
Meehan, a district attorney in suburban Philadelphia who previously
worked on statewide campaigns for both of Pennsylvania's Republican
senators. ``For the first time, issues like schools and education
and taxes can come first. But those kinds of things tend not to
generate turnout the way unemployment and economic uncertainty
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Main Line, Nelson Azeff's issues are health care and
Social Security. At 61 he's a retired executive whose life long
membership in the Republican Party may be in jeopardy now that he's
considering voting Democrat for president for the third time in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   A back injury forced Azeff into early retirement so now he
spends his days reading up on politics, and wiling away afternoons
in the cigar shop owned by a friend. With a library of $6 and $7
cigars rising up behind him, Azeff said he's not been impressed
with Bush, though he has questions about Gore, too.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Pennsylvania's large retiree population, Azeff
and others like him could be a decisive force in the election if
they move en masse on an issue. Pennsylvania offers senior citizens
a variety of benefits, from rebates on local telephone to free bus
passes, depending on their income level, which has enticed many
retirees to stay put rather than move south.
</P>
<P>
   But Pennsylvania's retirees come from a cross section of its
wider population. Some are blue-collar, some are white-collar. Some
are Catholic or Protestant, Irish, Italian and on and on. Statewide
strategists say the retirees in Pennsylvania may just vote as
members of those groups rather than as seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they sense a threat to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Azeff does. He opposes Bush's plan to let people invest portions
of their own Social Security benefit in individual accounts. The
issue may not be decisive, but it's helping him lean toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should touch that money. I think the
government has to control Social Security,'' he said. ``There are
some things that our government has to be involved in, right up to
the neck.''

BRAZIL BANS GUN SALES AFTER PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER CRIME WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Faced with growing public alarm over a
wave of crime, the Brazilian government decreed an immediate ban
Tuesday on the sale of firearms. The move came as as part of a
broader $1.7 billion national security plan intended to reduce
urban violence and reform the police over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons restrictions will remain in effect until the end of
this year, Justice Minister Jose Gregori announced at a news
conference in Brasilia. By then, the government hopes to have won
congressional approval of a more restrictive bill that would
virtually ban the possession of firearms by any Brazilian citizen
who is not a member of the armed forces, a police officer or an
employee of a private security company.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that Brazilians now own more than 8
million guns, about three-quarters of which are unregistered, and
that guns are used in nearly 90 percent of the killings committed
in this country, a much higher figure than in the United States.
Under the proposed legislation, gun owners would have one year to
turn in their weapons to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The security package, which President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
announced in a nationally televised speech Tuesday, also includes
$185 million to be spent this year alone on improved training and
equipment for state and city police. Local police forces throughout
this country of 175 million are widely viewed as trigger-happy,
corrupt and incompetent, with many officers barely literate and
earning salaries of $300 a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first plan in the history of Brazil to attack the
issue of public security in a comprehensive way,'' Gregori said.
</P>
<P>
   With the public clamoring for more security in advance of
municipal elections scheduled for October, the government has been
under mounting pressure to act to curb rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso rejected, however, a much-discussed plan that would have
used the military in crime-fighting activities.
</P>
<P>
   That step had been urged on him by some of the parties making up
his governing coalition, but is highly controversial in a country
that retains bitter memories of a 21-year military dictatorship
that ended in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The new security measures were announced a week after a gunman
who appeared to be under the influence of drugs hijacked a city bus
here and held six passengers hostage for four and a half hours. The
episode, which was broadcast live on national television and has
dominated news coverage ever since, ended when the hijacker, using
one of his captives as a shield, stepped off the bus and was
immediately fired upon by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage, a 20-year-old schoolteacher, was struck by a police
bullet and died in the ensuing exchange of gunfire. The hijacker
survived, but the police who accompanied him in an ambulance
strangled him on the way to the hospital and, according to official
accounts, threatened violence against the doctors who insisted on
listing asphyxiation as the cause of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a sharp outburst of anger and disgust, both
with rising crime rates and the brutality and ineptness of the
police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cardoso has led the attacks, saying the way the police handled
the hijacking was ``totally unacceptable.'' The governor of the
state of Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, fired the commander of
the military police and ordered that the policemen involved in the
strangulation be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The case took on added symbolism and importance when it emerged
that the hijacker of the bus, Sandro do Nascimento, 21, was a
survivor of the notorious ``Candelaria massacre'' here, a 1993
incident in which military policemen sprayed gunfire at 72
abandoned street children who were sleeping on the sidewalk in
front of the city's most famous church.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of concerns about public safety were demonstrated by
a poll published Sunday in the newspaper O Globo, indicating that
81 percent of families here have at least one member who has been
the victim of a crime. But 72 percent of those surveyed also said
they have no confidence in the police as an institution, and 59
percent described the performance of the police as ``bad or
dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the government plan announced Tuesday also calls
for the hiring of 2,000 new federal police officers. That step is
necessary, Cardoso said in his speech, because ``society is
demanding a quicker response from all of us'' to combat crime.

 &HT;    Votes up for grabs in the optimistic Lehigh Valley
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. _ On successive blocks off Hamilton Mall Road,
worn row houses still project the image of a working class
neighborhood in decay. The Allentown of the Billy Joel song back in
1982. A place still best defined by the absence of something, which
in this case would be the absence of Big Steel.
</P>
<P>
   But what a few dismal vistas fail to reveal is that a sense of
optimism now beams through Allentown and neighboring Bethlehem,
twin anchors in a two-county region northwest of Philadelphia known
as the Lehigh Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In Lehigh and Northampton counties, unemployment is baseboard
low, and job growth is ahead of the state average. Incomes have
risen. Education levels are climbing. This cradle of industrial
innovation and might, where steel was forged to build the Golden
Gate Bridge and great chunks of the New York skyline, is in the
midst of a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely seeing the glass as half full now,''
said John G. Englesson, a Bethlehem businessman. ``Our best times
are ahead of us, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But presidential politics in the new prosperity lack that kind
of barging certainty. Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush will vie for voters here, but no one is sure who'll win.
Gore the Democrat may or may not get credit for the rosy economy
that has propelled the Lehigh Valley's revival, and Bush the
Republican may or may not benefit from the political weakening of
labor unions whose industrial jobs have waned.
</P>
<P>
   In a state composed of so many potent political fragments, the
Lehigh Valley, particularly in its current state of economic
transition, represents the obstacle course of Keystone State
politics as well as any region possibly could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lehigh Valley isn't significantly influenced by any one
thing, it's a real swing area,'' said Pat Meehan a district
attorney in a Philadelphia suburb who worked on statewide campaigns
for both Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Arlen Spector.
``Everything we have in Pennsylvania, you'll find in the Lehigh
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   What you find today, first and foremost, is the sense that life
here is good. And getting better. After decades of watching its
industrial economy shrink, the Lehigh Valley of the 21st Century is
pulling itself up with bootstraps sewn not from leather, but from
fiber optic cable. The result is a work force shifting from
blue-collar to white, changing local views on things, such as free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when votes for NAFTA and normal trade
relations with China might not have gone well for you here,'' said
Pennsylvania State Sen. Charles W. Dent, ``but today there's no
substantial penalty for that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, too, when Bethlehem Steel Corp., was a primary
employer. Today, the leading manufacturer in the region is
high-tech giant Lucent Technologies, Inc., whose 5,300 workers in
Allentown produce electronic communication devices and circuits.
Lucent, and the many smaller high-tech start-ups in the Valley,
don't fret over export quotas, they thirst for overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sandy McNamara, 47, whose husband recently was laid off
from his job as a warehouse manager, feels confident he won't be
out of work long. That wasn't the case five years ago, when the
McNamaras and their two teen-age daughters moved to nearby
Coopersburg following a layoff in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different from where we were,'' she said. ``Homes are
being built on every piece of flat land they can find around here.
And sometimes, the not flat land. We're hopeful for work because
there's just so much here.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNamara is undecided in the presidential race, which she
hasn't spent much time thinking about yet. If there's an issue on
her mind, it's guns. She worries about the safety of her school-age
children, who now are required to use see-through book bags. But
new gun laws aren't the answer for McNamara. She'd rather see a
change in social climate that helps children understand human
values, she just doesn't know which candidate is best suited to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote today,'' she said, ``I really don't know what
I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   As is true in Pennsylvania as a whole, Democrats outnumber
Republicans in the Lehigh Valley. But crossover voting is common
and, often, decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's up for grabs here. Times are good in our
valley,'' said Frank Colon, a professor of political science at
Lehigh University. ``Lehigh Valley has put its emphasis on becoming
another Silicon Valley and it's moving in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Today in the Lehigh Valley, a significant part of labor's
sustaining force resides in its retirees. With Pennsylvania's
generous senior citizen benefits, which are funded through the
state lottery and include free public transportation and subsidized
telephone service, many blue-collar workers have stayed long after
their jobs disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steelworkers and the truck drivers just stayed here, they
didn't go to Florida,'' Colon said. ``They create a force, but in a
way they're kind of a single-issue force.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue has little to do with the color of the collar.
Retirees in the Lehigh Valley are focused primarily on the
condition and the future of Social Security, Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what worries Gil Robertson, who at 70 is retired from a
career with a utility company where he worked as a mechanical
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't settled on what they're going to do with Social
Security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and his wife, Agnes, have lived in the Lehigh Valley
for 24 years. Both are Republicans. But Gil Robertson is the type
of Republican who thinks ``the rich are rich enough,'' Bush should
forget about allowing people to invest their own Social Security
funds and the budget surplus should be used to pay off the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Robertsons don't know where that leaves them in the
choice between Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult because I don't see myself voting for
Gore,'' Mrs. Robertson said, ``but on the other hand Bush hasn't
impressed me too much.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1965 so sure of
himself and his place in the world that he hadn't even bothered
applying anywhere else. ``I had the idea it was the best,'' he said
simply, in one of several interviews about his college years. ``I
knew President Kennedy had gone there.''
</P>
<P>
   By his second day on campus, the 17-year-old Gore was out
knocking on doors, starting a successful campaign to become
president of the freshman council. In those days, coats and ties
were required at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all of this genteel tradition, and much of what Gore had in
mind when he signed up for Jack Kennedy's Harvard, was on the way
out even then. Vietnam was not a world away any more; American
involvement in the war was escalating constantly.
</P>
<P>
   In Al Gore's sophomore year, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara
visited the university to give a speech and was mobbed by screaming
students who climbed atop his car and rocked it while he sat
inside. During Gore's junior year, protesters organized by the
Students for a Democratic Society held a recruiter for Dow, the
maker of napalm, in a classroom for five hours. And in his last
semester, demonstrators took over the school's main administration
building, University Hall, only to be forced out at dawn the next
day by local and state police swinging clubs and wearing riot
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly four years after he had first arrived, the recently
graduated, recently enlisted Private Gore returned to campus in
short hair and an Army uniform _ an inherently provocative act in
militantly anti-military Cambridge in September 1969. Students in
Harvard Yard jeered at the sight of him.
</P>
<P>
   That moment, the moment he truly left Harvard behind, remains
alive for the vice president across the decades: ``It was an
amazing experience, a Ralph Ellison experience in that I was the
same person inside but my physical appearance conveyed a message
that completely overwhelmed the message of my humanity. It was just
an emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing
glances that shot arrows of what certainly felt like real hatred,
and I was astonished. I mean, it was no big deal in the sense that
I didn't suffer as a result of it at all, but it was really
educational. Really educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, both the snapshot of that kid in uniform, looking
more surprised than he probably should have been, and the vice
president's take on it, more than 30 years later, explain a few
things about Al Gore. There he was, going off to fight in a war he
hated and didn't believe in, after a solid year of agonizing, which
everyone who knew him then believes could only have ended exactly
as it did.
</P>
<P>
   He had said a lot of conflicting, conflicted things to his
friends, as 21-year-olds do. Sometimes, he muttered about Canada
and how different things might be if his father were not a U.S.
senator. But the conclusion, obvious to others long before he
reconciled himself to going to the war, was that he could never
seem to stop thinking about the boys his age back in Tennessee,
where he was registered for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The kids he had spent summers with did not have the options that
he and his Harvard friends had. The guys who had worked alongside
him cutting tobacco on the family farm weren't thinking, Hmm, body
bag or divinity school? And he kept coming back to that. ``He said
that if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have
to go in his place,'' remembered his college pal, the actor Tommy
Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   This rings especially true in light of Gore's rigorous
upbringing, a childhood in which adult notions of responsibility
were constantly reinforced by his hard-working parents. It seems
unlikely that their ultra-dependable only son, who carried their
hopes and was made so responsible for their happiness, would ever
have let someone else go to war in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it in him to disappoint his parents, who apparently
expected him to serve despite their own anti-war feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's senior thesis adviser at Harvard, the presidential
scholar Richard Neustadt, is pretty sure he told young Al that
serving would preserve the possibility of a career in politics.
That's certainly the career both his mother and father wanted for
him.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore told friends then that it was, perversely, in going to
war that he could probably best support the anti-war movement _ by
helping his father, Sen. Albert Gore, of Tennessee, get re-elected.
The senator's stand against the war was wildly unpopular in the
Volunteer State, and if his son had stayed home, he would have
handed a campaign issue to his father's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Gore seems to have believed all along that his
father would lose in 1970 - and he did lose. Nonetheless, the young
man felt obligated to do whatever he could to help, and as he
marched off to join the service seemed to feel he was sacrificing
himself to two lost causes, in Vietnam and in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the final decision appears to have hinged more on Gore's
sense of himself as a Tennesseean _ and as the moral man his
parents had constantly prodded him to be. In the end, he was one of
only about a dozen of his classmates who served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember so clearly him saying he was going to have to do it
the way his fathers' constituents did it, as an enlisted man,''
said Neustadt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd spent enough time in Tennessee to understand morality as
it applied locally, and it was a moral, not a political judgment
that if the regular folk have to enlist, I do, too. Certainly no
other Harvard kid I knew who thought he might want to get into
politics did that. All the ones that talked to me came to the
conclusion that they had to serve, but they were quite happy to
serve as officers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Gore returned to campus in his uniform, to say good-bye to
some professors, he never dreamed that others would fail to see
this, and would somehow miss that he was really one of them in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't'' see the negative reaction coming, he said in
a recent interview. ``That did not occur to me. It's one of those
things that's hard to see from the inside. It was just, `I am
myself and here I come. I know this place well.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there is much that is instantly recognizable in that picture
of Al Gore at the end of his college days. He is a man who in the
end probably chose the harder of two hard roads. But someone who
also seems to have made that road harder than it had to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones put it, ``It wasn't any fun to have the war in Vietnam
weighing heavily on one's mind, but fun was possible, and it's fun
to be 21 if you've got any brains at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Gore put the earnest student government work of
planning mixers and lodging official protests about room cleaning
behind him. He and the friends he made in Mower B, his dorm in the
North Yard, pooled their record collections and listened to a lot
of Dylan, Motown, the Beatles, Buffalo Springfield. He played
poker, house football, and took up handball because his group
considered squash ``too Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   He mostly warmed the bench for Harvard's basketball team that
year, too, averaging just under 3 points a game. And he was forever
challenging friends to all kinds of other competitions _ push-ups,
swimming the Charles River, beer chugging. Both Gore and Jones, who
grew up in Texas and lives there still, recall nearly killing an
elm tree near where they lived in a monthlong knife-throwing
contest, ``testing our ability in that backwoods skill,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his father was a senator was not a big deal on
campus. ``One thing about that university is almost everybody has a
father'' of prominence or power, said Neustadt. ``They recede into
the distance. At another university it might have made more of a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   While others might have been running from their roots, Gore was
busy living through his, wearing bib overalls and subscribing to
the Carthage Courier, the paper from the small town in Tennessee
where his family had their farm.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped it might provide inspiration for the novel he was
trying to write, set back there, and populated with folks he had
known. ``It meandered like the Caney Fork River,'' Gore said
recently, spoofing his former literary aspirations. He spent hours
at the typewriter, not always productively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the day push-button phones came to Harvard,'' Jones
recalled. ``There he sat in his bib overalls and a gold ball cap _
Golden Acre Seeds, Carthage. There sat Li'l Abner. And what he'd
done is taught himself to play Dixie on the phone. Of course we
took it right away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of their freshman year, Gore, Jones and a couple of
other friends got together a musical revue that they actually took
on the road _ for one performance, at a Wellesley coffeehouse. ``It
was kind of like the Little Rascals: `Let's put on a show!''' said
Michael Kapetan, now a sculptor at the University of Michigan, who
remembers writing the handbill for the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here at last, no longer coming soon,'' it said, ``the Old-Time
Country Panorama, featuring those old-time country musicians of
note, Tommy Lee Jones and the Ben Hill County Boys.''''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the stand-up comic,'' Gore said, ``if you can believe
that.'' And sure enough, there he is, billed as ``the highly
respected professor of animal husbandry and the curative sciences,
Doctor Albert A. Gore'' who ``has promised to favor us with
readings from the society pages of the Carthage Courier, including
news on Wilber Gridley's recent trip to Bristol.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not remember the show as an unqualified success: ``The
women of Wellesley were in between puzzled and amused,'' he said.
``Not quite the reaction we were shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   He rode a motorcycle back to school from Washington in the rain
that same year, and gave friends high-speed rides around Boston.
``I didn't like to ride on his bike,'' said one of his friends,
John Tyson, now an international business consultant in Washington.
``He'd try to scare you, popping gears, going 65, 70 and
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   One time, Gore, his future wife Tipper Aitcheson, Kapetan and
Kapetan's date were all riding on the motorcycle. Gore described it
as ``a modern day version of how many people can you fit in the
phone booth, ``with Tipper mainly on the handlebars and Michael
mainly on the tailpipe.'' When they noticed a police car behind
them, they sped into an alley, ditched the bike, and as Gore
remembers it, ``walked around with innocent looks on our faces.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world knows, he also smoked pot on occasion. But the only
time he has drawn the line at any question during a number of
interviews about his life was when prodded to tell an anecdote
about getting high. ``I hate to make light of it, I don't want to
encourage it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends do remember that he liked ``magic brownies'' and crashed
a few times on a couch in the basement of Dunster House, where a
group of his friends moved after their freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   He started out as an English major _ until, he says, Chaucer
nearly killed him _ and along with his novel, which he never
finished, he enjoyed writing poetry.
</P>
<P>
   He was always a reader, and Harvard nurtured the part of him
that is in love with the world of ideas _ promiscuously taken, in
fact, with scientific theories, mathematical concepts, great and
maybe not so great literature. Buckminster Fuller and Marshall
McLuhan turned his head in college. Later, he was enchanted by
chaos theory. These days, it's the debate about whether we're part
of a multiverse _ one of many universes competing in a Darwinian
struggle to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Also in college, he became a fan of ``Star Trek,'' adored the
movie ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' and showed great enthusiasm for
astronomy, as he still does. ``It's one of the things he loves
about living at the Observatory,'' said his oldest daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, referring to Gore's official residence at the
U.S. Naval Observatory. ``At dinner parties, there's always a march
to the telescope, and it always seems like he's having the most
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His studies did not really engage Gore until his junior year at
Harvard, when he took Neustadt's course about presidential decision
making. When the class re-enacted President Kennedy's decisions
during the Cuban missile crisis, he took the lead role. He got his
first A's that year, after a string of C's - and even a D in
biology as a sophomore, which prompted one friend to joke that
having failed evolution, he was all set for a career in Tennessee
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But when energized, Gore did have quite a ride academically.
After taking Neustadt's course, he switched his major to government
and nagged his professor into giving him a private reading course,
as well as into overseeing his senior thesis on how TV was changing
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From what he saw in class, Neustadt said, Gore ``is not afraid
of decisions, but not precipitous about it, either, like the early
Harry Truman saying, `How many decisions did I make today?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the originality of his mind, I would probably have
called him a good group two student, not a group one student.'' But
Neustadt made clear that he was not one of the easiest graders on
campus: ``The brightest people I've seen in the White House were in
different ways Kennedy and Johnson, and neither of them was group
one, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as a throwaway, he added that ``as intelligences go''
among U.S. presidents of the last century, only ``Teddy Roosevelt
might have stood higher'' than Gore _ who, by the way, received an
A-minus in Neustadt's Government 154.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the challenge for George W. Bush is to prove his smarts,
Gore's is precisely the opposite _ to show that he is a regular guy
despite a perceived surplus of gravitas _ which at least some
Americans seem to find intimidating, boring, or, as he himself
worries, just weird.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks America wants an intellectual for a
president, Gore said, ``I don't think book smarts are necessarily
the highest qualification to lead so much as good values, good
judgment, and a willingness to fight for the right thing. These
things are all cartoon images anyway _ Truman was extremely
well-read, for example. But if you give people the impression
you're a smarty pants, that's no good for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He is keenly sensitive, though, to just such impressions, and he
really does not like to talk about some of his more obscure
preoccupations.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in a conversation about some of the ``big think''
questions that intrigue him, he began to moan, ``I can't say this,
it's going to sound so weird.'' He went on that way for a minute,
as if he were about to admit to something really twisted, before he
finally revealed the big secret: ``Oh OK! I find the ideas in the
fractals, both as a body of knowledge and as a metaphor, an
incredibly important way of looking at the world.'' (Fractal
geometry, as everyone knows, examines the irregular patterns that
repeat and are similar at all size scales. In nature, an example is
a mountain range.)
</P>
<P>
   His appreciation of science really exploded in his senior year,
when Gore also got to know Roger Revelle, the oceanographer who did
much of the pioneering work on the greenhouse effect and global
warming _ a major focus of Gore's 1992 environmental tome, ``Earth
in the Balance.'' When Revelle shared his ongoing research with the
students, Gore was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like such a privilege to be able to hear about the
readouts from some of those measurements in a group of no more than
a dozen undergraduates,'' Gore said. ``Here was this teacher
presenting something not years old but fresh out of the lab, with
profound implications for our future!''
</P>
<P>
   He also took ``The Human Life Cycle,'' a course on the stages of
human development taught by the psychologist Erik Erikson, who
coined the phrase ``identity crisis'' and believed that identity,
rather than being fixed in childhood, depends in part on how well a
person deals with each stage of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just as influential as any of the others, but more in
personal terms,'' Gore said. For the course, Gore prepared a
``psychobiography'' of his father and learned, for example, that
his dad's older brother Reginald, who had been disabled in World
War I, had been the one expected to succeed. ``I gained a sense of
perspective on him that I'd needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he had already found an important friend in Marty Peretz,
who had him in a seminar his freshman year, ``Problems of
Post-Industrial Society.'' Along with an introduction to Marx and
Freud, Gore got a booster who later bought The New Republic and has
tirelessly plugged his former pupil's presidential prospects
through the years. They bonded his senior year, as well, at a time
when Peretz, like Gore, was increasingly disenchanted with the
tactics of the left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore himself says that everything he learned in the
classroom at Harvard from his quartet of famous mentors was dwarfed
by the education he got from Tipper Aitcheson in those first years
after they met at his senior prom at St. Albans in Washington. A
year younger than Gore, she joined him in Boston his sophomore
year, studying at Garland Junior College and then Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks of his wife today, it is with awe, gratitude and
an explicit acknowledgment that even his parents had a less
formative influence on him: ``It's clearly the most important
relationship I've ever had with anyone, bar none,'' he said
recently. ``Even at a young age she helped me understand things I
NEVER would have been able to understand otherwise. She has a way
of understanding people and the world that I, well, I would be a
completely and totally different person in every way except for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, an interviewer mentioned having met with her earlier
the same day, and he beamed with pride: ``Isn't she cool?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he knew almost right away, even at the age of 17, that
he wanted to spend the rest of his life with this woman. That was
one thing, at least, that he knew when he arrived freshman year and
was even more sure of on graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So much else, though, seemed up for grabs. In his junior year,
says Tyson, who roomed with Gore that year, ``came the
rev-o-lu-tion. The war came into our living room with the body bag
count every day. Every day, religiously, our gurus were Walter
Cronkite and Eric Sevareid.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who is black, and quit the football team because he no
longer wanted to be a ``hired gladiator'' for white alumni, said he
and Gore talked themselves to sleep in their bunk beds many nights
that year, endlessly discussing race and the war. Gore read ``Soul
on Ice'' and ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' and they discussed
the books, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot during their spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving with Tipper from Boston to Washington and it
happened when we were on the road,'' Gore remembered. ``It was
devastating. When we arrived, my mother was downtown at an auction
house and needed a ride home because the rioting had started. I
don't think I ever saw her scared, but as I drove up, stores on
either side were having glass fronts crushed in and there was
looting. She walked rather calmly but quickly as I drove up.''
</P>
<P>
   The first night the roommates were together again, Tyson said,
he and Gore both cried for their country and stayed up until 4 a.m.
talking. ``He was so upset because it had happened in Tennessee. I
just wanted to curse,'' Tyson said. ``It was very, very sad and we
were sick from watching our nation burn up. You didn't want to
believe what you were seeing and what had happened. How were we
going to stay together as a people?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very analytical and was saying in times of great cultural
change there is great chaos. But I also remember him saying,
`Jesus, we've got to understand who we are as a people and we
don't, and we haven't formed that e pluribus unum.' We both felt
that things had gotten so out of hand that his could happen in our
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent some of that tense summer in Memphis, where the
shooting had occurred, while taking a course in Tennessee history
at Memphis State _ probably on some level in preparation for a
career in politics, though at the time he felt completely
disillusioned. Unsure what he wanted to do, he was thinking about
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, too, Gore helped his father write a short speech
for the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, where he stayed with
his parents while other kids his age were fighting with police in
Grant Park. Inside the hall, both Gores shared the demonstrators'
bitterness over the war: ``Four years ago our party and the nominee
of our party promised the people that American boys would not be
sent to fight in a land war in Asia,'' Senator Gore told the
convention, to huge applause from supporters of Eugene McCarthy,
the anti-war candidate, who had been denied the nomination in favor
of Vice President Hubert Humphrey. ``They voted for our
distinguished leader, President Lyndon B. Johnson, but they got the
policies of Senator Goldwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, back at school in the fall, Gore and most of his friends
continued to shy away from various protest groups. ``We weren't
demonstrators,'' Tyson said. ``We distrusted these movements a lot
because a lot of this stuff was very emotional and not well thought
out. We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil
rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social
revolution to some extent but not buying into something we
considered detrimental to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself recalls that while he agreed with their anti-war
sentiments, he found students who were protesting the presence of
ROTC on campus wrong-headed and even kind of juvenile. He thought
taking anger about the war out on the university was plain
illogical. ``It seemed silly to me to target the administration of
a private university,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Though in a letter home he railed against the ``national
madness'' of anti-communism, he mostly disagreed with both the
tactics and rhetoric of the Students for a Democratic Society.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing he has in common with his opponent, Bush, who
experienced the '60s very differently, is that he was never
seriously tempted by anti-establishment politics. Both stuck close
to their father's view of the war, though those views were of
course quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only did not hate the establishment, but revered it. He
had been raised by a New Dealer who believed in nothing so much as
the power of government to change people's lives for the better,
and when the government disappointed him _ ``when America
uncharacteristically lost its way,'' as he puts it now _ he felt
deeply hurt, and declared that he wanted nothing to do with his
father's line of work.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, when police moved in and beat a number of
the students occupying University Hall, Jones remembers Gore's
reaction as ``the same reaction all Harvard people had, that
suddenly all this talk about the fascist threat was real. On that
day, we joined the ranks of paranoids who have people after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody stayed away from the SDS'' entirely, Jones said. ``Jean
Paul Sartre's metaphor of words as bullets comes to mind, and
bullets were flying everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Cambridge in the late '60s, a refusal to fully join in
the revolution was itself a kind of rebellion. Peretz remembers
that Gore ``called attention to himself by the moderation of his
views. It took a kind of defiance to say, `Let's not get carried
away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Peretz's principal memory of his former student on June 12,
1969, the day Gore graduated, with honors, was that he seemed quite
embarrassed by his father's bragging about him. As part of a
planned protest, a number of Gore's classmates raised their fists
and walked out half-way through the ceremonies. Gore stayed in his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Gore did end up staging a one-man protest of sorts
when he showed up in his uniform in Harvard Yard a few months
later. That day, he was angry at the self-righteousness of kids who
thought all decisions about the war were easy. And finally, in
spite of himself, Al Gore was demonstrating after all.

FOR PRINCE WILLIAM, A REGAL BUT GUARDED COMING OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Windsor Journal) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, England _ Five royal birthdays are to be feted at a
gala given by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on Wednesday
night, but the celebrator who is the hope for continuing
generations of the beleaguered British monarchy will be marking his
18 years less ceremoniously.
</P>
<P>
   Final exam studies will keep Prince William in his Eton
dormitory room, a 10-minute walk from the largest joint royal
birthday party in memory. But his absence will hardly keep him and
his official passing into adulthood from being the center of
royal-watching attention.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when opinion surveys show enthusiasm for the reigning
Windsors at an all-time low, the handsome 6-foot-2-inch prince with
the shock of blond hair, cobalt blue eyes and downward-looking
smile so reminiscent of his mother, Diana, is coming onto the scene
as the family's best face forward.
</P>
<P>
   The black-tie event in the banquet hall beneath the crenelated
towers of the hilltop castle formally celebrates the birthdays of
the Queen Mother, 100 on Aug. 4; Princess Margaret, 70 on Aug. 21;
Princess Anne, 50 on Aug. 15; Prince Andrew, 40 last Feb. 19; and
William, 18 on Wednesday. The queen's 74th birthday also figured in
this festive week, since the sovereign's official birthday was
changed a century ago to a June date in hope of getting better
weather for the commemorative trooping of the color in Horse Guards
Parade in London _ with more than 1,200 marching soldiers in
scarlet tunics, the biggest ceremonial display on the royal
calendar. It took place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But aware that all interest centers on the coming of age of the
winsome young prince destined to become king of England _ after his
father, Prince Charles _ and eager to ensure that his privacy not
be trespassed on, the press office of his father arranged the
release of 14 photos, a short television film and an anodyne
interview with Britain's domestic news agency, The Press
Association. Though he has long shied away from self-promotion,
William finds himself in the position of being the best marketing
opportunity now available to the family that calls itself The Firm.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio, shot over six weeks last winter and personally
approved by William, shows him dribbling a soccer ball on the
famous playing fields of Eton, strolling moodily through the
school's chapel cloisters, bobbing out of a pool in a water polo
match, adjusting the flame under a skillet in a cookery class,
surfing the Internet in a classmate's room, looking boy-band cute
in a black turtleneck sweater, and checking the attendance of an
arriving lower form boy as a member of the exclusive senior class
prefect society known as Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, there are no pictures of him pursuing his interest in
hunting, shooting and military matters, no shots of him in the
uniform of the Combined Cadet Force, which he took part in for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The television film, shown over the weekend, contains the first
recorded utterance of the second-in-line for the British throne
when he is asked an offstage question about what he is cooking.
Historians note. The words are, ``Paella with chicken, rice, garlic
and beans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the question-and-answer interview, he discloses his
irritation with overweening show business agents who try to draw
attention to their clients by fantasizing romances with William.
``There's been a lot of nonsense put about by PR companies,'' he
says. ``I don't like being exploited in this way, but, as I get
older, it's increasingly hard to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   William, a B-plus student with a busy extracurricular life, says
throughout the interview that he has liked his five years at Eton,
a marked departure from the experience of his father, who once
called Gordonstoun, his spartan Scottish school, ``Colditz in
kilts.''
</P>
<P>
   William intends to have his own party in 10 days at a local
bistro, but Charles had to limit his 18th birthday celebration to
inviting seven friends in for cakes and buns.
</P>
<P>
   On turning 18, William would normally be called His Royal
Highness, be addressed as sir and be greeted with bows and
curtsies, but the queen and his father have agreed to a request
from him that those practices be postponed until he is finished
with college.
</P>
<P>
   William is to take a traditional British ``gap year'' off for
as-yet-unannounced world travels before going to college, where he
intends to major in history of art. The schools that interest him
do not include Oxford or Cambridge, his father's alma mater. He is
expected to choose between two Scottish universities, Edinburgh and
St. Andrews, and three English ones, Bristol, Durham and East
Anglia.
</P>
<P>
   William's carefully managed emergence this week will be
short-lived. Prince Charles has asked the press to continue to
abide by the rules it adopted after the death of Diana in August
1997, under which William and his brother, Harry, 15, can be
photographed only at arranged occasions, usually with their father.

   SUDAN-U.N. (United Nations) _ Sudan wants to join a growing list
of pariah nations trying to create new international images for
themselves by engaging more positively with the world, the Sudanese
ambassador to the United Nations said Tuesday. Sudan's immediate
goals are ambitious. It is seeking African support for a regional
seat on the Security Council beginning next year. It is also lining
up international backing for a lifting of sanctions imposed four

Dyer, owner of Unit 1 and president of the Lodge homeowners
association, who splits the year between here and Denver. But not
all is as peaceful and serene as it appears outside the back
windows of Ms. Dyer's stylish 3-bedroom, 3-bath condominium. The
Lodge, which was built in 1978, is smack in the middle of a
proposed major development project that town officials argue is
critical for Vail's on-going economic stability. By Michael

   SAATCHI-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ Six years after Maurice Saatchi
left Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, there's a new Maurice in charge, only this
time the name is pronounced the French way rather than the British.
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, the London agency company founded by Maurice
Saatchi and his brother, Charles, agreed Tuesday to be acquired by
a Paris-based rival, Publicis SA, for about $1.9 billion in stock.
Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, who is
proving to be almost as acquisitive as the Saatchis, will head a
merged entity, the Publicis Groupe, which will oversee the agencies
now under the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and Publicis banners. Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, which has seesawed from successes to struggles and back
over almost three decades, will continue as an autonomous unit of
Publicis Groupe rather than as an independent company. By Stuart

WHOSE HEART DATA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 52 years, medicine has learned much of what it knows about
preventing heart disease and strokes from a long-term study of
10,000 Framingham residents and their descendants. More than 1,000
research works have been based on the examinations, food diaries,
X-rays, and blood samples that the study's participants contributed
for the good of science.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to new techniques of analyzing data and identifying
errant genes, it is possible to take this wealth of information to
a new level with enormous potential benefits for the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical industries _ and for all of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   However, the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute, which
has responsibility for the Framingham Heart Study, should be very
cautious in establishing ground rules for use of the study's data
and tissue samples by profit-making firms. The subject is raised by
the proposal from a new company, Framingham Genomics Medicine,
which wants to digitize raw data and correlate the DNA makeup of
blood samples with the study's abundant clinical information. Its
plan is then to sell this enhanced data to biotech and
pharmaceutical firms.
</P>
<P>
   One big hitch is the conflict of interest issue raised by FGM's
parentage. It will be one-fifth owned by Boston University, which
for three decades has been supervising the heart study under
agreements with the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the institute, Dr. Claude Lenfant, has said he
wants assurances that no BU study workers would have any financial
interest in the new company. He has also said any arrangement with
the company would specify that it would not have exclusive access
to the study data or blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   But if, for instance, a rival of FGM stepped forward to do
similar work on heart study data, would it really have equal
access? And what if a university or nonprofit research institute
asked to do such work with the intention of making all its results
publicly available, thus undercutting FGM's business plan? Any
promises that all comers would face a level playing field have to
be weighed against the fact that outside researchers already
complain about restricted access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern of Lenfant is that, until now, outside
researchers who use the heart study's data have been expected to
contribute any new findings back to the study's body of
information. This is not likely to sit well with a company seeking
to sell its results to drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important issue may be the effect of FGM's plan on
the Framingham participants in the study. It would be a terrible
squandering of a medical resource if the new venture gets in the
way of recruiting third-generation family members into the study or
causes any long-term participants to quit. Decades ago,
participants consented to help out in a publicly funded
heart-disease project that did not even envision the use of
genotyping. Now, a company wants to make commercial use of the
deepest secrets of their genetic being, for purposes that could be
as trivial as exploring perfume allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University officials say that just two study participants
have responded to a letter informing them of the new plans by
asking that their data not be included. But more needs to be done:
The company should contact all the living study participants and
relatives of the deceased for genuinely informed consent. The
inclusion of genetic information in the company's work also argues
for the most effective possible measures to maintain the anonymity
of all study participants.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, BU is already talking about setting aside some of
the new company's stock for a public-interest foundation in
Framingham to ensure that the community benefits from FGM's
profits. And BU promises the company would be willing to fund an
outside ethics advisory council to make sure all guidelines are
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the editors of The Merck Manual, a medical
reference book, compiled a list of the 10 top medical advances of
the 20th century and placed the Framingham Heart Study fourth,
behind infectious disease control, immunization, and vitamins but
ahead of molecular genetics and organ transplantation. It is the
gold standard of health studies of its kind. Nothing should be done
to jeopardize its continuing value in the understandable desire to
learn even more about diseases and their causes from the study's
rich resources.

EXPECTED OPEC INCREASE IN PRODUCTION UNLIKELY TO AFFECT U.S.
PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPEC ministers meeting Wednesday in Vienna are expected to agree
on a modest production increase, but the move is unlikely to bring
much relief to American gasoline consumers, who are paying more
than $2 a gallon in some regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If U.S. consumers are looking to the OPEC meeting as some kind
of salvation from gas prices this summer, they will be very
disappointed,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with the Petroleum
Finance Corp., a consulting group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers arriving for their meeting in Vienna on Wednesday
said they were confident they would reach an agreement quickly, and
a consensus appears to have formed around an increase of 500,000
barrels a day, or about 2 percent of current output. Such an
increase has the support not only of Saudi Arabia, the most
influential OPEC member, but also the support of Iran, which
angrily rebelled at a production increase three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministers of Algeria and Qatar said in preparing for the
Vienna meeting that there was no shortage of oil in the world,
apparently suggesting that raising output by that much is not
necessary. Oil prices, which have surged in recent weeks, rose
further on the conflicting messages.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil supply-and-demand balance, most people have focused
on the supply side ever since crude prices began climbing last
year. Understandably so, because a decision by OPEC in early 1999
to cut supply led to a sharp rebound in oil prices, driving them to
more than $30 a barrel by this spring. In March, under heavy
pressure by the United States and other industrialized countries
that import petroleum, OPEC decided to increase production by 1.7
million barrels a day or about 7 percent, to about 24.7 million
barrels a day. Crude prices initially dipped, only to surpass the
$30 mark once again in the last few weeks, despite estimates by
many analysts that OPEC already is pumping about 500,000 barrels
more than it had agreed upon three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, average U.S. gasoline prices have risen
sharply, up nearly 13 percent since late April, according to the
Department of Energy. They show no sign of easing just as summer
driving season is starting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Lakes region, where gasoline costs more than $2 a
gallon, consumer anger has led to federal inquiries into possible
price gouging by area refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Even at such levels, gasoline prices adjusted for inflation are
still lower than they were for most of the century up to 1968,
according to a recent study by industry analysts Cambridge Energy
Research Associates. ``But this is a price that people very easily
get very angry about,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge
Energy, ``partly because for the last couple of years it's been so
low.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC leaders such as the Saudis have intimated that they, like
much of the rest of the world, are uncomfortable with current high
crude prices. If prices stayed above $30 for a long time, they
could hurt the economies of affluent oil consuming countries and
even lead to a recession, which would hurt OPEC as much as anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   But any OPEC increase in output would deal only with the supply
side of the equation. Worldwide demand for oil, driven by the
robust American economy and strengthening recoveries in Asia and
Europe, continues only to grow and quickly absorbs OPEC supply
increases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, U.S. refineries that distill crude, the first step
to making gasoline, are operating at 94 percent of capacity, which
is considered high. And despite persistent complaints about
inflationary gasoline prices, Americans have yet to curtail their
driving, the American Automobile Association has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless demand for petroleum in the United States may, in
fact, be one of the main reasons why crude prices have risen.
``There's this strange dynamic of U.S. gas prices affecting world
oil prices, when it usually was the other way around,'' Yergin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago area, where gasoline has risen to $2.50 a gallon at
some stations in recent days, illustrates how prices and crude oil
production are not directly related.
</P>
<P>
   The stage for the run-up was set in late winter, when refineries
typically acquire crude to meet high gasoline demand over the
summer. A heating oil crisis compelled some U.S. refineries to keep
producing heating oil rather than shifting to gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   While crude was expensive at the time, prices in the market for
oil to be delivered in later months was decreasing. So rather than
replenishing their inventories at the higher prices, many
refineries bought crude for delivery later at the lower prices, in
something of a ``just-in-time'' basis. Consequently, inventories of
gasoline are now unusually low across the country, with stocks in
the week ending June 9 totaling 202.7 million gallons, compared
with 223.5 million last year, according to the American Petroleum
Institute, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on lower-than-usual inventories, Great Lakes refineries
now must produce a new re-formulated gasoline that burns cleaner in
adherence with the latest Environmental Protection Agency
regulations. Because of how this gasoline is made, refineries
produce less of it than they do of conventional gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline supplies in the Great Lakes fell even lower when a
pipeline that feeds the region's refineries oil from the Gulf Coast
broke down in the spring. That pipeline is still operating at only
80 percent capacity, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA contends that its requirements for re-formulated
gasoline do not contribute to higher fuel prices. But American
Automobile Association has asked the EPA to suspend reformulated
gasoline requirements for certain parts of the country, including
the Midwest, for most of the summer because the cleaner-burning
fuel costs so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Re-formulated gasoline is a premium product and tighter
requirements mean it will be more expensive,'' said George Beranek,
an expert on refining at the Petroleum Finance Corp. ``You can't
mandate improvement and expect it to be free.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Older employees don't work hard. They don't have the stamina of
their younger colleagues. They are overpaid and marking time before
they pack up for a life of golf or shuffleboard in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the misconceptions that vex people like Hank Merrill.
Two years ago, at age 58, Merrill lost his job as a sales manager
with Bank of America when the company was acquired by NationsBank.
Though he had more than enough money to retire, he wanted to keep
working. But he had no illusions about the job search that lay
ahead. ``I knew people are skeptical of hiring someone over 50,''
Merrill said. ``People assume you don't have drive and energy.''
One employer who rejected him essentially questioned his work
ethic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one executive recruiter saw gold where other people
saw gray. Joel Harrison, a managing partner with the recruiting
firm DAK Associates in Conshohocken, Pa., said he was impressed
with Merrill's business connections and with his high energy. ``I
thought that this guy would outperform people 10 and 15 years
younger than him,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Since DAK placed him as a West Coast regional vice
president at Nuveen Investments, the Chicago-based financial
services wholesaler, Merrill has become the company's top sales
representative in the country. And all his colleagues are at least
20 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank has tons of credibility,'' said his boss, Michael Forstl,
38, a managing director at Nuveen headquarters. ``If you have been
in the business that long, you develop fantastic relationships in a
world that is very small.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejuvenation of Merrill's career holds a lesson for
employers in today's tight job market: Older folks can actually be
worth the extra money you have to pay them. They bring years of
experience and connections to the table, and they often surprise
their new bosses by showing nearly as much get-up-and-go as their
younger colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they have demographics on their side. According to the
Census Bureau, the number of 20-to-34-year-olds in the United
States has declined by 6 million the last decade while the number
of people over 50 has increased by 12 million. In the next decade,
the census says, the number of people over 50 will increase by 21
million more by 2010, while the number of 20-to-34-year olds will
increase by only 4 million. ``There has simply been a shrinkage of
available young workers and an increase in older workers,'' said
Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author of ``Age Power: How the
21st Century Will Be Ruled by the New Old'' (Tarcher/Putnam, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, as Americans lead longer and healthier lives,
people are beginning to ask this fundamental question: ``What is
old?''
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of companies are adjusting to the changing
dynamics of the job market by dipping deeper into the over-50 pool
of talent. DAK, a 10-person firm that specializes in recruiting
managers for financial services companies like New York Life,
Salomon Brothers Asset Management and J&AMP;W Seligman, says the
proportion of people it places who are in that age group has soared
to 20 percent today from just 5 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robust part of our business,'' said Daniel A.
Kreuter, the president and founder of DAK. ``It expands our
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Employer interest in older employees is particularly sharp in
the financial services industry because people over 50 control
two-thirds of the money invested in the stock market and like
dealing with people in their own age group, Dychtwald said. ``The
investment business will increasingly demand people who are
experienced and responsible and have a long track record,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but that does not mean that those same people won't
have to fight stereotypes, as even their advocates acknowledge.
``There's been a mindset that wholesaling is a young person's game,
that only 25-to-35-year-olds would want to sleep in hotels four
nights a week and work 75 hours a week,'' Kreuter said. ``Then when
they burn out at 40, you get the new crop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill seems determined to debunk the stereotypes. He travels
four or five days a week, meeting with up to five clients a day. He
routinely gets up at 5:30 a.m. and usually runs five miles before
work. He competes in triathlons, has run in marathons and rides his
mountain bike about 2,500 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's ``sheer stamina'' makes him effective, according to
Forstl. ``Success in this business comes from sweat, from getting
in front of as many brokers as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers in other industries are thriving, too. Some, like
Hershel Sarbin, 75, have tried retirement and didn't like it. When
they seek to return to the world of work, they often find a welcome
mat waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Sarbin has actually retired twice, the first time in 1984 when
he was 59 and left his job as senior vice president of Ziff Corp.
in New York to dabble in teaching and consulting work. Alas, he
said: ``I felt instantly restless. I missed not being engaged in
critical business issues. I missed the phone calls. I missed the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   So, when a consulting client, Cowles Media, offered him the
position of chief executive in 1990, he grabbed it. At age 65,
Sarbin spearheaded a turnaround effort in which Cowles acquired or
started a host of magazines and newsletters and developed several
Internet properties. Within three years, the publishing company's
revenue had shot up by 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sarbin tried retirement again. Again, he did some
consulting work; again, he felt a void in his life. So, in 1998, he
signed on as senior director with another consulting client, the
Peppers &AMP; Rogers Group, a marketing consulting firm in Stamford,
Conn. The firm was looking to develop online and print publishing
properties and saw Sarbin, who had more than 30 years of media
experience, as the right candidate. Sarbin now heads a 25-person
division that produces a print and online newsletter and a
magazine. Next month, he is scheduled to start an information
service that provides verbatim extracts online of marketing-related
books and articles.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he gives up to 15 speeches a year on marketing topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often that 75-year-old men are invited to sit down
and talk with 25-year-old dot-com experts and strategize about
where the market is going,'' Sarbin said. ``I don't have to seek
them out, they come to me. Why would I ever want to retire?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If he and others can refute the old-codger image with their
energy, they might find it harder to overcome potential employers'
reticence about paying them big salaries. Older wholesalers in the
financial services trade _ essentially, the people who sell
financial products to stockbrokers and financial advisers _ can
earn as much as $500,000 a year, while sellers under 30 may earn
less than $100,000. ``Wholesalers like me with a proven track
record are too expensive,'' said Robert Meitzer, 53, who was
recruited by DAK to work at Allmerica Financial Corp. in Worcester,
Mass., where he is now a senior vice president and a top seller.
</P>
<P>
   Like Merrill and Sarbin, Meitzer has more than 30 years of
experience in his industry. Like them, he could afford to retire
but loves working. And like them, he is a case study in the value
that old-timers can give to a company. Aside from the $340 million
in business he brought Allmerica last year, Meitzer acts as a
mentor to younger sellers, a contribution that can pay large, if
hard-to-measure, dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Oliver Tutt, 30, a fellow sales representative at
Allmerica who traveled frequently with Meitzer for three years and
eagerly soaked up the older man's insights. ``You face so much
rejection in this business, from brokers mistreating you to them
just forgetting about your appointments, that it's tough to keep
your sanity,'' Tutt said. ``Bob taught me to value myself and have
self-confidence and chalk bad meetings up to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Meitzer believes the most important lesson he can teach the
younger generation _ many of whom have never gone through a
recession _ is to take the long view of markets. ``I remember the
bear market of 1971 to 1974, and learned that it's important to be
diversified across stocks,'' he said. ``I was able to see the
current market's volatility before it happened. I saw that the
bubble of the late 1990's was going to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some older people do fit the stereotypes associated
with them, and employers must evaluate job candidates carefully.
``There are certain things we look for,'' Kreuter of DAK said.
``People can get burnt out or cynical, and maybe not be open to new
strategies or ideas'' _ or to the latest Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for Merrill, the Nuveen employee who in most ways is a
star performer. He has had ``a hard time understanding our computer
system,'' said Forstl, his boss, and relies on his sales assistant
to gather information from the company's database.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill cheerfully acknowledges his shortcoming. ``We have a
system here that they like us to use, but I don't like it and don't
use it,'' he said. ``I have my own system.''
</P>
<P>
   But such drawbacks are relatively minor, Kreuter said. ``Good
people over 50 have wisdom and experience, and that's what matters
most,'' he said. ``Gray hair counts for something.''

BRITAIN LAUGHS, AND WONDERS AT WHOM IT'S REALLY LAUGHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday June 25)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Clad in his bright yellow athletic warm-up suit, Tommy
Hilfiger skull cap, sunglasses and dangling gold chains, the
British cult comic character Ali G conducted one of his trademark
hoax interviews on his hit late-night television program here with
Tony Benn, a longtime member of Parliament and ardent socialist,
completely straight-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``These unemployed _ they just chillin' innit, man?'' he quizzed
a serious-looking Benn, who appeared thrown by his seemingly black
interviewer's unusual style of questioning and choice of clothing.
``Is goin' on strike jus' like 'avin' a sickie?''
</P>
<P>
   Without a hint of laughter, Ali G probed further. ``Does welfare
not just encourage young girls to go out and get jiggy with
Biggy?''
</P>
<P>
   Benn was clearly not in on the joke, in part because he was the
punch line, and in part because the comedian who plays Ali G is not
a black product of the inner city; he is a white, Jewish graduate
of Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   But Ali G's audience ate up the segment, repeating bits from the
interview at pubs around town for weeks, making `` Biggy'' a
momentary pop-culture reference among the 20-something generation.
</P>
<P>
   The politician acknowledged after the prank interview that he
never realized he was being duped.
</P>
<P>
   Benn has not been the only one to fall for the tongue-in-cheek
antics of Ali G, who has become the television icon of the moment
here. A long line of well-known politicians and academics have been
suckered. On a trip to the United States, Ali G asked an
unsuspecting Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former secretary of
state, ``Is it true that Reagan and Thatcher was doin' it?'' He
followed up with, ``Do you t'ink it's worth nukin' Russia now,
while it's weak?''
</P>
<P>
   Played by 28-year-old Sacha Baron Cohen from North London, the
Ali G character tries to mock young, white, middle-class suburban
men who presume to act stereotypically black, as well as the way in
which an older generation reacts to them. His language is a
potpourri of American gangsta rap and the Indian and Caribbean
accents of the British working class. Cohen even created a
fictitious gang, laughingly called Staines Massive after the London
suburb of Staines, which, of course, is led by Ali G.
</P>
<P>
   The Ali G character has become a lightning rod for praise and
controversy, stirring the English to applaud Ali G, who represents
a new form of comedy that speaks to a younger generation, and at
the same time to condemn the character as another example of racism
that has sadly been accepted by a broad and impressionable
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The character was created two years ago for several segments on
a late-night comedy program called ``The 11 O'Clock Show'' on
Channel 4. The Ali G character, who duped unsuspecting public
figures into interviews under the pretense that he was the host of
a public affairs program for teen-agers, became so popular that an
entire weekly television series was built around the character
called ``Da Ali G Show'' by the same network. A home video of the
original Ali G segments has become a top seller in Britain, and
another video may be on its way.
</P>
<P>
   His shtick has hit such a nerve that Cohen is set to appear in
Madonna's next music video as Ali G and is working on a script for
the movie production company Working Title, which made ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral'' and ``Notting Hill,'' about making a movie
based on the Ali G character.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Cohen's brand of humor can attract a
broad audience beyond Britain and whether it would be accepted
without protest elsewhere. While there have been reports here that
Talkback Productions, which produces ``Da Ali G Show,'' may try to
take the program across the Atlantic, it will almost surely receive
an onslaught of criticism from a multitude of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Here in England, the Ali G character has come under attack in
some circles. Cohen has received death threats and is regularly
condemned in the press. ``The fact that he has been a success
should not be treated as an excuse to quash discussion about the
propriety of the act,'' a commentator wrote recently in the daily
newspaper The Guardian. ``If the black and white minstrels weren't
funny, then why is Ali G?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ali G's defenders say the act is less about poking fun at
minority stereotypes than mocking ignorant whites. ``He is about a
white kid pretending to be black,'' said a spokesman for Channel 4.
``He is satirizing the way white kids try to copy the black street
culture and look ridiculous. If it's offensive to anyone, it's
offensive to white people.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Thompson, co-creator and producer of ``Da Ali G Show,''
believes the Ali G character just follows the model of a long list
of comedians who have successfully inspired laughs through a bit of
racism in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Alf Garnett became a hero to bad-tempered racists in
the 1960s, and Loadsamoney inspired London football fans to wave
wads of cash at their northern counterparts in the 1980s, so Ali
has become a cultural magnet for inarticulate youth in the
2000's,'' Thompson wrote in The Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perverse but welcome accolade for one of the most
brilliant comic talents that I've ever encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen refused to be interviewed for this article. In fact, his
agent and production company were so worried that Cohen would
become recognizable in the United States because of media coverage
_ and therefore unable to successfully pull pranks on future
interview subjects _ that they refused to provide ``production''
photos of Ali G in full garb regularly handed out to British media
organizations, or allow photographs to be taken of him as Ali G.
(The picture that accompanies this article was obtained from a
photo agency.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ali G's cover may not be blown after all. In one of the
better-known segments, he is dragged away from an environmental
protest by a policeman. ``Is it because I's black?'' he says.
Without even a second glance, the officer replies, ``Not at all.''

SENATE VOTES TO BOLSTER HATE CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved landmark civil rights
legislation Tuesday that would add sexual orientation, gender and
disability to the list of federal hate crimes, sending it to the
House where it faces an uncertain fate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, which passed 57 to 42, the FBI or other federal
law enforcement officials could assist local authorities in
investigating such hate crimes, expanding the list from those
motivated by race, religion or national origin. Thirteen
Republicans joined 44 Democrats in support of the measure, with
Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia the only Democrat voting
against it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since Kennedy's legislation was introduced
in 1997 that it has not died in a committee and supporters were
optimistic that recent high-profile crimes and this year's election
would give it the momentum needed to become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Senate acting at its best with one voice,'' said
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the main sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The vote added the hate crimes measure as an amendment to a
defense bill that is being used as a vehicle for other legislative
items, including a campaign financing bill sought by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, acting in his constitutional role as
president of the Senate, stood by to cast a tie-breaking vote in
the event it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because hate crimes are an affront to all Americans, this vote
is a sign of hope for all Americans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   While current federal law deals with hate crimes that interfere
with federally protected activities, such as serving on a jury,
trying to vote or enrolling in school, Kennedy's bill would require
the Justice Department to prove only that the crimes interfered
with interstate commerce _ a broad criterion.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said he did not
expect the House to consider the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that happening,'' Armey said. ``We're for strict
law enforcement and stiff penalties for vicious crimes irrespective
of the motive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy was optimistic it will become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make Armey eat his words,'' Kennedy said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional floor debate on the bill, Kennedy called
hate crimes ``a national disgrace'' that ``attack everything that
this country stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a United States Congress must take a clear and
unequivocal stand,'' Kennedy said. ``Equal protection of the laws
ought to apply to all Americans. ... Hate crimes are rooted in
hatred and bigotry and if America is going to be America, we should
root out hatred and bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., the main Republican supporter of the
bill, said the federal government must prosecute those ``who commit
the most malignant of crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Mormon, said he used to have ``feelings of religious
reluctance'' to vote against broadening hate crimes legislation to
include homosexuals. But he said he changed his mind after the
death of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old University of Wyoming
student who was beaten to death in October 1998 because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that year, James Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was
dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also cited the biblical story in which a woman was nearly
stoned to death for committing adultery until Jesus stopped the
attack. ``Put down the stone and cast a vote based on love,'' Smith
urged his colleagues. ``Cast a vote against hatred and vote for the
Kennedy-Smith amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative amendment by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would
authorize a study of hate crimes, also passed 50 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is precious little evidence showing there is a
widespread problem with authorities prosecuting crimes against gays
or blacks or women,'' Hatch said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has said he is concerned that the Kennedy measure
infringes on state and local powers of law enforcement. Although 40
states have some sort of hate crime statutes, many are limited to
race or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said approval of the legislation
on hate crimes sends an important moral message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises the awareness of people,'' Boxer said. ``Just
because you have a certain disability or sexual orientation you
aren't any less as a human being.''

<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, a Washington-based advocacy group for homosexuals and
lesbians, was hopeful the bill would become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's amazing what the need to moderate can do in an
election year and I think the Republicans need to do just that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, called the vote historic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a recognition on the part of the Senate that gays and
lesbians ought to be treated the same way as all other Americans
are,'' she said.

GEORGE CLOONEY AND HIS STORMY CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By DANA KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Unlike some of the movie and television sets
George Clooney has worked on over the years, the six-month shoot
for his new film, ``The Perfect Storm,'' though physically
grueling, was harmonious. Clooney's only real disagreement was with
the film's dialect coach, who urged him to adopt a Boston accent
for his part as a blue-collar sea captain in the true story of six
Massachusetts fishermen lost during a terrible storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no, the Boston accent is the hardest one to do,'' said
Clooney, 39, while sitting in his office at his company, Maysville
Pictures, on the Warner Brothers lot. ``I'm a fairly famous guy,
and when you suddenly hear me with a weird accent it'll take away
from everything else. I don't want the audience spending the first
15 minutes of this movie like the RCA Victor dog, trying to figure
out what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clooney's co-stars Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane affect
Boston accents in the film, which is based on the 1997 book by
Sebastian Junger, Clooney's character, Capt. Billy Tyne, sounds, he
said, ``like a guy who could be from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Not embarrassing himself by attempting a tricky accent is just
one of many quirky and often savvy decisions Clooney has made
throughout his 18-year career in Hollywood. Lately he has become
the frequent subject of breathless magazine articles focusing on
his good looks, charm and bachelor status. (He was married in his
20s to the actress Talia Shire and has repeatedly said he does not
want to marry again or have children.) He is also a staple in the
tabloids, which chronicled the broad swath Clooney recently cut
through the Cannes Film Festival, attractive female ``journalists''
never far from his side.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his rocky though successful rise from television
bit player to NBC's smash hit ``ER,'' and, most recently, to movie
stardom, reveals an actor who can be as confrontational as he is
affable, as tough as he is thin-skinned, who often really did do it
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney worked his way up from ``a seventh banana in mediocre
TV'' to his current asking price of $12 million a film by taking
risks and vigorously standing up for himself, even if that
assertiveness alienated some powerful people in Hollywood. One of
his former directors called him a ``gigantic pain''; another simply
said he was ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Hollywood is scared and they'll totally compromise
themselves to get ahead,'' said the comedian Roseanne Barr, who
worked with Clooney during the first year of her sitcom before he
abruptly quit. ``But George is his own man. He's not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   While he admits to great ambition, Clooney has conducted himself
like the anti-Eddie Haskell in an industry fueled by sycophancy.
``I'm an actor, but I'm also a businessman and a bit of a
hothead,'' said Clooney, who in person is as charming as advertised
and entirely without airs, though his easy manner seems to mask a
very guarded nature. ``This town is run by fear, but I've always
had a line that I would not cross. It may have cost me some jobs,
but at least I can look myself in the eye in the mirror every
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney walked away from his role (as the seamy foreman) on
``Roseanne'' in 1989, when it was the No. 1 show in the country,
because he felt he wasn't good in the part, and he quit the 1991
comedy ``Baby Talk'' after a bitter fight with the executive
producer. He was fired from the sitcom ``The Facts of Life'' in
1986 by the producer after just one season and then reluctantly
rehired because he was still under contract. The battles often
occurred, he said, when he felt he or a colleague was being
mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   His on-set skirmishes didn't end after he became a film star. As
recently as 1998, during the filming of the Gulf War movie ``Three
Kings,'' Clooney said, he came to blows with the director, David O.
Russell. ``We throttled each other,'' said Clooney, who said
Russell treated many of the cast and crew badly. ``It was a really
bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell agreed. ``There were times when I felt like killing
George and he felt like killing me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the directors and producers who have felt Clooney's
wrath, many who have worked with him rhapsodize about him. During a
television press junket for ``The Perfect Storm'' last week in
Gloucester, Mass., Wahlberg and Lane said Clooney's wit and
penchant for practical jokes buoyed cast and crew alike during
three months in Gloucester and during the even tougher three months
spent filming inside wave-strewn studio tanks in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg and Clooney play two of the fishermen who were aboard
the 72-foot Andrea Gail when it ran into a killer northeaster while
returning from a swordfishing trip to the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland. The bond between the two actors, who starred in
``Three Kings'' and will reunite in the remake of ``Ocean's
Eleven,'' is typical of the friendships Clooney forms with
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest guy in the world,'' said Leslie Moonves, the
president of CBS, who signed Clooney to a contract when he was head
of the Warner Brothers studio in 1990 and helped groom him for
stardom. ``The minute he walked into my office at Warner Brothers
we clicked, and I also knew he was going to be a big star.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves has maintained a close relationship with Clooney, though
he moved to CBS in 1995. Moonves greenlighted the actor's risky,
live, black-and-white remake of ``Fail Safe,'' which was shown in
April. Clooney produced the film and agreed to act in it after
Moonves asked him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is not a vanity producer,'' Moonves said. ``Every
single piece of that project was overseen by George.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said they argued only about one of the actors Clooney
wanted in the cast. ``I was at the Super Bowl and came back to my
hotel to a 20-minute message on my answering machine,'' Moonves
recalled. ``It was George explaining why this guy was the right
actor. He even said he'd pay the guy's salary if he had to. I said,
`If you're that determined to have him, he's yours.' Of course he
never paid his salary, but there was $20 from George on my desk
when I got back.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination was slow to surface. During his youth in
Kentucky, where he grew up as the son of a newscaster and a former
model, Clooney described himself as ``without much focus and
drive.'' He dropped out of Northern Kentucky University, where he
had been majoring in broadcast journalism, and decided to move to
Hollywood to try acting after his cousin, the actor Miguel Ferrer,
came to Kentucky to shoot a movie and wangled Clooney a bit part.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who had briefly attempted an acting career without
much success, urged his son not to go. ``I just felt the odds were
stacked against it,'' said Nick Clooney, who has been a news anchor
in Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles and the host of the
American Movie Classics network. ``Of course if he'd listened to me
he'd be the No. 1 DJ in Ashland, Ky., now.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Clooney drove to Los Angeles in a beat-up old car in 1982 with
$300 he had earned working in the tobacco fields near his home that
summer. He lived briefly with his aunt, the singer Rosemary
Clooney, and then moved in with other struggling actor friends.
That first year, Clooney got parts in commercials and small roles
in forgettable television shows like ``Riptide.'' He had so little
money he bicycled around Los Angeles to auditions, carrying a
change of clothes in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he was offered a role in the soap opera ``Santa
Barbara'' for $1,400 a week but his agent said no. ``He was
convinced there was better work around the corner and there was,''
Clooney said. ``But it was hard to turn that money down when I
didn't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney joined the cast of a short-lived sitcom called,
coincidentally, ``ER'' in 1984 and then moved to ``The Facts of
Life'' in 1985. He enjoyed his first year, cheerfully calling his
performance on the show ``the worst combination of overconfidence
and bad acting you've ever seen in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was fired at the start of his second season by the show's new
producer, who accused him of sabotaging the weekly run-through of
the show in front of network executives. Clooney said the opposite
was true. He said the script had been so bad that the show's stars
had wanted to give a deliberately poor performance for the network
but he urged them against it.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney was eventually rehired on ``The Facts of Life,'' but it
was a taste of things to come. In 1991 he was cast in the comedy
``Baby Talk'' and clashed with its powerful producer, Ed
Weinberger, who had also produced ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and
``Taxi.'' Clooney remembers telling Weinberger one day that
everyone used an expletive to describe him whenever the producer
left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger, for his part, said Clooney became upset when he
fired the show's co-star and replaced her with a different actress.
Clooney became even more angry, according to Weinberger, when he
had to fire the original set of twins who played the baby of the
title. ``The audience hated those first babies,'' Weinberger said.
``We had to get cuter ones. The babies didn't know they were being
fired. But George blamed me.''
</P>
<P>
   The parting was so volatile that Clooney worried he might be
blacklisted. ``I remember him calling up and saying Weinberger
warned him he'd never work in that town again and he said, `Pop,
maybe he means it,''' Nick Clooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Clooney also has a history of standing up to his bosses and
leaving jobs in which he felt compromised. He walked away from a
contract at KNBC in Los Angeles when he felt the quality of the
news stories was deteriorating, and he clashed with Roger Ailes,
now the president of the Fox News Channel, when they both worked in
Cincinnati. ``It was very dangerous for George to quit `Baby Talk,'
but I told him it was the right thing to do,'' Nick Clooney said.
``No matter how frightening it feels to jump into the void, you
keep your integrity and eventually something even better comes
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Clooney swiftly landed a $40,000-a-week role on the
series ``Sisters.'' But his dream of becoming a film actor _ his
roles in ``Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'' (1987) and ``Horror
High'' (1988) notwithstanding _ eluded him. He was asked to read
for a one-line part in the 1994 movie ``Guarding Tess,'' but
Clooney was so insulted by the size of the role that he refused to
audition. ``I decided to stop thinking of myself as a movie actor
working temporarily in TV and just try to do better TV,'' Clooney
said. ``And at that moment, everything changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Clooney heard about a pilot for an NBC program
called ``ER'' and lobbied hard for the part of Dr. Doug Ross, even
turning down a pilot for a series in which he would have starred.
``On paper `ER' was the much smaller role in an ensemble,'' Moonves
said. ``But he read both scripts and his instinct was `ER' was
better. He's very smart about material.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``ER,'' Clooney was cast opposite Quentin
Tarantino in his first big movie, ``From Dusk Till Dawn,'' in 1996.
He called it ``the biggest break of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite high-profile roles in subsequent movies like the
critically reviled ``Batman and Robin'' and the underrated ``Out of
Sight,'' Clooney has yet to open a blockbuster. But he professes
not to care. He worked for a much smaller salary _ $1 million _ on
the upcoming Coen Brothers movie, ``O Brother Where Art Thou?'' and
he plans to produce and write as well as act in the future.
</P>
<P>
   His dream project is one that he and Moonves are developing
together about the legendary broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow
and his showdown with Sen, Joseph McCarthy. ``I want to do it for
my father,'' Clooney said. ``Murrow was a hero in our house. It'll
be all about everything he and I believe in.''

SUMMER SOLSTICE BRINGS JOY TO EARTH WORSHIPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ Midway between dawn and darkness, as a searing sun
burst through the towering oak and maple trees and the seasons
silently shifted from spring to summer, neo-pagans, Wiccans and
earth-worshipers of all varieties gathered in an ancient meadow
here Tuesday to celebrate the summer solstice.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting haunting melodies in Yoruba, in English, and in no
language at all; wearing shells and feathers and masks and robes;
invoking the elements of earth, air, fire and water and making
offerings to a stone, participants said they hoped to connect with
nature and with each other as they marked a turning point on the
calendar and, perhaps, in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The summer solstice, the day on which the sun is at its
northernmost point in the sky, is the longest day of the year and
has long been an occasion for worship by a variety of ancient
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as some Americans have left traditional Western
religions and sought to reclaim or reinvent earth-based faiths,
they have turned to occasions such as the solstice as natural
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in nature -- I feel connected to the earth and it
makes me feel peaceful and alive and it humbles me,'' said Keo
Opton, 40, a personal trainer and a witch. ``I feel a great
connection with the earth and with people. I don't feel that in a
church.''
</P>
<P>
   The rituals performed here, as in many neo-pagan and wiccan
celebrations around the country, are a mix of Native American and
pagan traditions and new forms of pageantry. The celebrants here
have been perfecting their ritual for six years, choosing to come
here to Mystery Hill because it is home to a collection of stone
walls and large shaped stones that has been called America's
Stonehenge by those who believe that the site was built by Native
Americans or early European migrants 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe it is the remains of a colonial farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of marking transitions in life -- we can see
parallels between what's happening in nature and what's happening
in our personal lives, and we can remember who we are as natural
beings,'' said Katja Esser, the organizer of Tuesday's ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, dressed as a bear wearing imitation fur robes and a
Native American-style mask, led more than 100 celebrants on a
procession through the woods, past chambers and through passageways
and tunnels, re-emerging int the light as they beat on drums and
sang, ``Mother, I feel your heart beat. Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah.
Mother, I feel you under my feet. Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Johnson wafted burning sage over the marchers, who waved
banners and flags as the ululated, skipped, strode, swayed and
stood in alternating moments of silence, song and shouting around
an altar of sticks and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Klein, 21, had a medicine wheel branded into one side of his
chest and had two Native American-style tattoos representing the
earth and healing herbs on his shoulder and on the other side of
his chest. He said he often makes personal changes around the time
of the solstice -- Wednesday, for example, he is scheduled to fly
to Germany to begin working for Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do rituals all the time -- I'm tapped in to a lot of
different cultures,'' he said. ``Today is a matter of stepping into
the main part of my purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said they see no conflict between rituals
celebrating the earth and the Western monotheistic faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Yardley, 77, who appeared to be the eldest participant
in the ritual, said she joined a coven ten years ago, but she also
considers herself an active Unitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspiring to know there are peole that are about
preserving and taking care of the earth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old psychologist who would identify herself only as
``Silent Wolf'' because, she said, she is not ``out'' as a pagan,
said she was raised in Baptist churches and discovered pagan
rituals while in college in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never connected to traditional religion, but I did begin to
connect with nature, and I connect to the goddess,'' she said. ``I
believe the goddess is everywhere. That's where the energy is.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included Michael Coyne, 35, a self-described
``spiritual state trooper'' who was attending his first such ritual
bearing an Inca-inspired drum he had just brought back from
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   Solstice is celebrated in various ways around the world, and
some wicca activists in America have called for the day to become a
national holiday. This year, for the first time in 16 years,
British officials allowed Druids to worship at Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of neo-pagan movements consider themselves earth
religions, and the solstices and equinoxes form natural holidays,''
said Philip G. Davis, chairman of the department of religious
studies at the University of Prince Edward Island and author of
``Goddess Unmasked: The Rise of Neopagan Feminist Spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical idea is that the forces of the divine are within
the universe, so a lot of people would consider these sort of
significant natural events, like the solstice, to be manifestations
of this divine force within nature, and as special moments in which
that force might be more accessible.''

US CARE INFERIOR, WORLD HEALTH GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US health care system is inferior to those of most other
industrialized nations because it is the most expensive and yet
fails to provide adequate care to the poor, according to a survey
of the world's health systems released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ranked 37th among 191 systems surveyed by the
World Health Organization, below Japan, most western European
countries, Scandanavia, Canada and several Middle Eastern nations.
France topped the list, while almost every African nation finished
in the bottom third. In addition, the survey concluded that health
care in both China and Russia deteriorated after they enacted free
market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is really three Americas. The top 10 percent here are
the healthiest in the world. The middle bulk does mediocre. But
it's the bottom five or ten percent, made up of Native Americans
living on reservations, the inner city poor, rural blacks and
Appalachia that is a third America,'' said Dr. Christopher Murray,
WHO's director of global programs on evidence for health policy.
``They have health conditions as bad as those in sub-Saharan
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The WHO study examined the quality of care in each country, how
well the care was distributed and how much it cost. The authors
conclude that countries with universally available care financed by
broad taxes have the best health care.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which spends a world-leading $3,700 per
person on health care every year, ranks lower than its
industrialized brethren because, too often, its undisputably
world-class medicine is not available to those without money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the US outspends everybody by such a degree, the
conclusion is that (the health care system) is very inefficient,''
said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom third of WHO's list is dominated by African countries
located south of the Sahara Desert, a population that has seen its
health go from bad to worse over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HIV epidemic has had an enormous hit on African countries,
taking 10 years off life expectancy,'' said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia also experienced slides. Both nations recently
enacted market reforms _ though Russia's were far more radical _
that gutted their state-run health systems, said the study's
authors. China's rural poor, who once received care as good as that
in Beijing or Shanghai, were particularly hard hit, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these reforms may have worked for the general economy,
the health economy is different,'' said Dr. Julio Frenk, WHO's
executive director in charge of evidence and information for health
policy.
</P>
<P>
   One nation that surprised researchers was Oman, a tiny Middle
Eastern country where one in every four children once died before
the age five. It recently enacted a health plan that costs $300 per
person and has improved health there dramatically enough to earn
the number 8 spot on the WHO list.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the French, who ranked number one, not only
because they live longer on average than almost any other people,
but because, according to the WHO authors, they consistently enact
safety regulations on everything from food to highway repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take into account non-traditional safety measures better
than almost anyone else,'' said Frenk.

RESIGNATIONS THREATEN STABILITY OF BARAK GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHOSHANA LONDON SAPPIR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition government
moved toward the brink of collapse Tuesday when four Cabinet
ministers from Barak's largest partner in power submitted letters
of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Barak said he made the Orthodox Shas party a final
offer aimed at keeping the party from bolting.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations take effect Thursday. If Shas follows through
and quits the government, Barak could put together an alternative
coalition, but his ability to reach a peace agreement with the
Palestinians would be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are working toward a
September target date for a framework agreement on the toughest
issues in their historic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a live broadcast on Israeli television, Barak reassured
Israelis he was still committed to peacemaking. ``In any case
Israel will have a government and it will take all the necessary
decisions on peace and society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he addressed Shas's main concern _ funding and
control of its education system. ``They know our offer and we are
waiting for their answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Months of haggling over Shas's financial demands came to a head
two weeks ago when the 17-member bloc in Israel's 120-seat
parliament cast the decisive vote for a bill to call new elections.
The threat that the party would see the bill through until it
became a law, effectively dissolving parliament, was the start of
intense negotiations with Barak's One Israel party over funding for
Shas schools and the legalization of pirate radio stations the
party runs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of One Israel said agreement had been within close reach
when Shas tightened the screws by having its four cabinet ministers
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, from Barak's party, said Shas
chose to quit beacause it did not wish to support Barak's peace
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached a solution for most of the problems,'' Shohat said.
``I conclude from that that apparently the resignation has other
reasons, which may be connected to Shas's desire not to be in the
government because of its expected political moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's political system is prone toward instability because of
separate voting for prime minister and for parliament. While Barak
was elected last year by an overwhelming majority, his party earned
only 26 seats. His ability to rule depends on coalitions with
several smaller parties that represent special interests. Shas
represents observant Jews of Middle Eastern origin. The party
excludes women as a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 elections, its generally hardline voters supported
Barak's rival, then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of Education Yossi Sarid leads the secular Meretz
party, which is the ideological opposite of Shas. The conflict
between Shas and Meretz is at the heart of the current coalition
crisis. Sarid refused to transfer the funds to Shas schools unless
they acceded to state supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Today Barak governs with a 68-52 majority. If Shass resignation
goes into effect, Barak is likely to invite the six-member,
anti-religious Shinui party to join the government. In that case he
will be ruling by a minority coalition that is likely to be
supported by the votes of seven members of Arab parties and three
members of the largely Communist Democratic Front for Peace and
Equality.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis came at a critical moment in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to
visit the Mideast next week for the second time this month, in
another attempt to nudge Barak and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat toward an agreement. The parties are attempting to tackle
four key issues: the final borders between Israel and a Palestinian
entity, control of Jerusalem, the future of Palestinian refugees
and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he would declare a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in September, whether or not a peace deal is
reached with Israel.

IBASIS CHINA DEAL HELPS STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (iBasis is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ iBasis Inc., battling to lead the market for
international telephone calls routed over the Internet, is to
announce a pact Wednesday with China's third-largest phone carrier
that will help it cement its hold on Asia's lucrative
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of iBasis have taken a pounding since February, losing
two-thirds of their peak value. But iBasis has been pouring out a
steady flow of announcements of new interconnection partnerships
with carriers around the world. They include this new deal with
Jitong Communications Co. Ltd. and Tuesday's pact with a top
Russian carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading, iBasis shares rose $3.75 to $32.50, but
they've gone into a nosedive from their $94 highs in February.
</P>
<P>
   Already, four-year-old iBasis has inbound and outbound
international calling deals with China Unicom and China Mobile, the
top wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal could help iBasis increase its share of outbound
international calls to 15 percent, president Ofer Gneezy said. Some
months, iBasis carries up to one of every 10 voice and fax calls
from the United States to China, which has 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   And iBasis already carries traffic for 11 of the 12 largest
US-based international carriers, 10 of the world's 20 largest
international carriers, and 70 international carriers in total.
</P>
<P>
   It undercuts conventional carriers' costs by routing calls from
phone to phone over the Internet, under strict monitoring,
reverting to the conventional phone network about 10 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   However, deals such as the Jitong pact only open the door for
iBasis to carry some of these carriers' international calls, with
no guaranteed minimum. iBasis is in a dogfight with ITXC and other
start-ups for Internet phone-to-phone voice traffic, and with the
computer-to-phone carriers Net2Phone and Delta III.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move on two fronts,'' Gneezy said. ``One is to get
more countries connected to our network. Another is to get more
traffic on those connections.''
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to have 160 million wireless subscribers
within five years, accounting for 1 of every 7 new cell phone
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Asia's telecommunications market represents $400
billion in sales this year, including domestic calls, according to
Australian analysts Paul Budde Communication. US researchers Frost
&AMP; Sullivan estimate Internet-based phone calls in Asia could grow
from $78 million now to $48 billion in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Chinese pacts, iBasis has carriage agreements with
Japan's NTT, the Thailand Communications Authority, Dacom in Korea,
and Telstra in Australia.

ONE PLACE WHERE AMERICAN TALENT GETS RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday June 25)  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Americans still patriotically smarting at the number of
British prizewinners in this year's Tony Awards need only visit the
British capital itself to find a salve for sore pride. If the New
York theater sometimes looks a bit like Shaftesbury
Avenue-by-the-Hudson, there are parts of London this summer that
might be Broadway-on-the-Thames or even
Hollywood-Near-the-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Revivals of David Mamet's ``Speed the Plow,'' Arthur Miller's
``All My Sons'' and Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending,'' the
British premiere of Miller's ``Peters' Connections,'' adaptations
of ``Singin' in the Rain'' and ``Baby Doll'': all are now or soon
to be found at addresses ranging from the Royal National Theater to
the Albery to the chic little Almeida. Moreover, Kathleen Turner's
Robinson is still doing a sedate striptease for her 20-ish lover in
a version of ``The Graduate'' that feels it can advertise itself as
``the hottest ticket in the country.'' And Turner is not the only
Hollywood star in London; Donald Sutherland has just moved his
lanky frame into the Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   Let me not overstate the case. As I'll be reporting in a moment,
the London theater is offering some striking non-American plays and
performances this summer. A gruff, tough Vanessa Redgrave is
aggressively pacing Shakespeare's Globe as the first female
Prospero any critic can recall. Alex Jennings is a tense, tormented
Albert Speer in an adaptation of Gitta Sereny's fine biography of
Hitler's favorite architect; Ralph Fiennes makes a chilling if
limited Coriolanus; and a pair of more or less unknown Irish actors
take 13 roles in a marvelous two-hander by a more or less unknown
Irish dramatist named Marie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an image that nicely exemplifies London's trans-Atlantic
drift embraces cascades of silver hair, an unnervingly loopy smile
and a marked North American accent. Whether he's firing a shotgun
at the journalist he has forgotten he's invited, or parading his
paranoia and narcissism in purely verbal ways, it's hard to resist
the quirky charisma that Donald Sutherland brings to the role of an
eccentric Nobel Prize winner in Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's ``Enigmatic
Variations.'' The problem is the French author's play, a succession
of surprises that momentarily raise the eyebrows but are likely to
leave a disbelieving frown on the skin above them.
</P>
<P>
   John Rubinstein's earnestly self-effacing Erik Larsen has come
to interview Sutherland's Abel Znorko on his private island off the
Norwegian coast. At first, the great man deals condescendingly with
questions about whether his new epistolary novel is based on fact _
``I'm a writer, not a Xerox machine'' _ but then he abruptly and
none too explicably reverses himself. Actually, the book consists
of the myriad love letters he continued to exchange with a woman
with whom he had long ago had a rapturous affair: ``Lightning
struck, everything exploded, night became day, and we were asleep
in each others' arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that really the way Nobel laureates speak? When Sutherland's
Znorko proceeds to muse about the ``existential alienation of
closeness,'' to bemoan the ``single unifying spasm'' that takes
lovers ``back to solitude,'' and to claim that he ``imposed
separation so our love could be eternal,'' it's almost as if Sartre
were composing a bodice-ripper. But that's far from the last of the
evening's incongruities. I had better not reveal the twists of plot
that follow, if only because the play, which has already been seen
in Los Angeles and Toronto, could yet get a New York showing. They
did, however, leave my head feeling the way my body might if an
over-ambitious osteopath tried to convince me that my knees were
for sitting and my elbows for walking: twisted way out of true.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that if Hamlet's letter to Horatio describing his
encounter with the pirates turned out to have been written by the
dead Ophelia, or if the correspondence between the sexual predators
in ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' had been penned by Cardinal
Richelieu and the Pope, it would be emotionally more revealing and
not vastly more preposterous. Still, those with the gift of
credulity will get their rewards. They won't find great depth or
density in Sutherland's performance, but they will see his
arrogantly upright Znorko become interestingly uncertain of
himself: a transition akin to the Tower of Babel turning into the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of several startling mutations to be found on
the London stage right now. Indeed, if I had to pick out a best
performance for June, I would be hard put to choose between the 13
given by Sean Campion and Conleth Hill in the Belfast-born Jones'
``Stones in His Pockets'' at the New Ambassadors. Both are Irish
extras playing tattered Victorian peasants in a period romance
being filmed in scenic Kerry. But they have only to give a nudge to
their shoulders and their voice boxes _ and lo, we have the movie's
fluting American megastar, or a go-getting assistant director from
Dublin, or a troubled priest, or a Cockney rigger high on cocaine,
or the drunken old codger famous for having played an extra in
``The Quiet Man'' and been called ``wee Mickey'' by John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is moviemaking entertainingly seen from the stance of those
crowd members whose job is to provide an anonymous background to
the glamorous doings of the hero and heroine. It is also, and more
seriously, pastoral Ireland observed by its losers. Campion's Jake
has just returned to his village after failing to make a fortune in
America, and Hill's Charlie is still reeling from the collapse of
his video business. They find it only too easy to obey the director
when he brusquely orders them to tug their forelocks or look
``dispossessed'' and ``defeated.'' But their feelings of defeat
don't match those of Campion's Sean Harkin, the poor, goofy extra
who is thrown out of his local pub on the orders of a spoiled
celebrity and, filling his pockets with stones, walks into the pond
once owned and then lost by his father.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' ant's-eye view of a Hollywood saga allows her to tackle
several subjects: rural deprivation, cultural exploitation, the gap
between the feted and the fated, and, perhaps above all, the lure
of dreams and the dream-industry. When Hill, as the priest, says
that ``imagination can be a damned curse in this country,'' he is
not only explaining a star-struck boy's suicide: he is also placing
``Stones in His Pockets'' in a tradition that extends from Synge's
``Playboy of the Western World'' through O'Casey's ``Juno and the
Paycock'' to Brian Friel's ``Translations.'' And though the reek of
self-pity sometimes rises from the stage's bare boards, Jones
banishes it in an ending that is unexpected, ironic and
refreshingly upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Talking of bravura transmogrification, what about Vanessa
Redgrave in ``The Tempest'' at Shakespeare's Globe? On she stalks
in a patched-up jacket and faded breeches, looking more like a
Balkan guerrilla than the gracious magus of theatrical tradition.
It is easier to believe that this tall, wizened, growling figure is
an exiled duke than it was to accept Mark Rylance as a frolicsome
Cleopatra at the same address last year. Equally, you have no doubt
that this Prospero has been hardened by 16 years spent warring with
the elements and his own resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Why such gender-bending in a replica of the Jacobean theater
where every role was played by a man or boy? Well, years ago Glenda
Jackson spoke for many aging actresses when she said, ``Why should
I stay in the theater to play the Nurse in `Romeo and Juliet?,'''
and became a Labor M.P. But you can't accuse Redgrave of redressing
the sexual imbalance in classic English plays just for politically
correct reasons. There are artistic gains. For instance, Redgrave
is the first Prospero I have seen who might have nurtured a
daughter from babyhood to adolescence. ``A cherubin thou wast that
did preserve me,'' she/he reassures Kananu Kirimi's worried
Miranda, and, for once, you sense the warmth and tenderness that
has sustained this unlikely duo.
</P>
<P>
   When she is cherishing Geraldine Alexander's ethereal Ariel,
too, you feel that Redgrave is bringing out what Jung would have
called the character's anima or feminine side. But this doesn't
lessen Prospero's flinty anger or Prospero's pain at renouncing
power. Only at the end does the performance soften. I really don't
think the duke's mercy should extend to doing a sort of high-five
with Jasper Britton's otherwise admirably anguished Caliban. But
this silly, sentimental touch must partly be blamed on the
director, Lenka Udovicki, who could have battled harder against one
of the Globe's built-in dangers: a tendency for actors to
ingratiate themselves with groundlings who are milling and
chortling just a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes, who is still playing a fretful, narcissistic Richard II
at the Gainsborough Studios in London's Shoreditch District,
changes and doesn't change for the ``Coriolanus'' that has just
joined the repertory the Almeida Theater Company is presenting in
the same big, bleak, ad-hoc playhouse. The eyes still have their
silvery glint. The classic profile is still in place. But something
has happened to the nose, which seems to have lifted an inch or
two, as if to put Coriolanus at a still greater distance from the
smelly mob.
</P>
<P>
   This built-in sneer, combined with an articulate disdain that
often rises to an eloquent contempt, certainly suits the unlovable
hero who is prepared to be exiled and join Rome's enemies rather
than compromise his conservative credo. The result is a bold,
charismatic Coriolanus but one who seems even more monochrome than
Shakespeare's original. After all, the mandarin monster dies
because his great foe, Linus Roache's Aufidius, calls him ``boy,''
unforgivably exposing his lifelong failure to stand up to his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Since you can imagine Barbara Jefford's majestically bellicose
Volumnia dismissing Boadicea as a bimbo and the Amazons as a bunch
of balky schoolgirls, there is every reason for Fiennes to stress
or at least suggest suppressed vulnerability. But not until he
yields to her pleas not to destroy Rome, grabbing her hand and
kneeling and sobbing, do you sense Coriolanus' inner child; and
it's insufficiently prepared for, depriving Jonathan Kent's mostly
admirable production of its one big chance of emotional complexity.
</P>
<P>
   David Edgar is a left-leaning dramatist who has made a specialty
of understanding right-wing minds, which is why his masterpiece is
probably ``Destiny,'' a 1976 play about the allure of British
nationalism. At three and a half hours, his ``Albert Speer'' makes
considerable demands on our rumps, minds and political
sensibilities, but, as Trevor Nunn directs the play in the National
Theater's Lyttelton auditorium, you will surely be impressed by its
size, gravity and willingness to ask difficult questions. How could
a man with the intelligence, sensitivity and, yes, decency that
Gitta Sereny's biography ascribes to Speer have reacted to Hitler's
Mephistopheles like some baby-faced Faust?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A moment after we have met him, Alex Jennings' pale, grim Speer
sits brooding in Spandau, the only Nazi imprisoned there to feel
the need for repentance. And then come the flashbacks, explaining
how he rose from an obscure architect to the designer of the
grandiose capital of Greater Germania and then minister of
armaments. As Speer admits, he was ambitious, excited by power and
susceptible to flattery, especially when it came from the Teutonic
Charlemagne who had raised Germany from the ashes and treated him
like the kindly father he never had. In the 1930s, how many
impressionable young men would not have shrugged off occasional
rants about ``Jewish Bolsheviks'' or ``Slav subhumans'' from an
idealistic patriot who was also solving their Oedipal problems? How
many might not do so now?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question implicitly asked in the play's first half,
and it is the more challenging for Jennings' quiet intensity and
the excellent acting of Roger Allam as Hitler, a beguilingly
affable figure who gives his true nature away only when paranoia
surfaces or when setbacks in the war turn him into a babbling,
broken savage, demanding the demolition of Germany itself. The
second half, with Speer released from Spandau and restored to the
public-speaking circuit, raises a more particular worry. Was Speer
telling the truth when he denied any knowledge of the Holocaust?
Was his moral redemption a fake, his spiritual regeneration based
on a lie?
</P>
<P>
   The problem with plays like ``Albert Speer'' is that they are
circumscribed by the facts as they are known. Fiction may lack
historical authority but it brings freedom and freedom's rewards.
If Shakespeare had based, say, ``King Lear'' on some druid's
definitive biography, he could hardly have produced the fathomless
tragedy that imagination allowed. That is maybe why neither Edgar
nor Jennings can plunge too deeply into the darker side of Speer's
raveled, ravaged psyche, but must instead show him obsessively
denying that he was present when Himmler announced the Final
Solution and repeating his mantra: ``I should have known. I could
have known. I didn't know. I turned away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this Speer is bright enough to realize that ignorance may
be willed and turning away can itself be a crime, perhaps more
heinous than acknowledging complicity and paying the penalty. And
at his play's end, Edgar does take a surely forgivable liberty,
bringing on Allam as the Hitler who still haunts his architect's
nightmares. And this Fuhrer is no paternal figure, but a sneering
fanatic who points out that he did indeed talk of the annihilation
of bolshevism and the destruction of the Jews, and asks, ``Why was
I cursed with never being taken literally?'' As Jennings' dying
Speer finally agrees, the phantom had a point _ and it's one that
implicates more people than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Whether New York will see ``Albert Speer'' or ``Stones in His
Pockets'' remains uncertain, but both Fiennes' ``Coriolanus'' and
his ``Richard II'' are headed for the Brooklyn Academy of Music in
the fall, and other British work will doubtless follow them to the
city. But then the coming months will see major revivals of
``Merrily We Roll Along'' and ``My Fair Lady'' in London, as well
as Cameron Mackintosh's mega-production of ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' a musical, derived from John Updike's novel, by two
young Americans, John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe. And who takes over
from Kathleen Turner in ``The Graduate'' at the beginning of
August? Why, Texas' very own Jerry Hall. No, the traffic across the
Atlantic is decidedly two-way.

NASDAQ CONTINUES UPSWING, BREAKING 4000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A steady, monthlong rally in technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq
Composite index above the 4000 mark Tuesday for the first time
since early April.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 23.54 points, an increase of less than 1
percentage point but enough to finish the day at 4013.37. Tech
stocks rallied for the fourth straight day, a signal, analysts
said, that high-quality companies will continue to benefit from the
country's conversion to an Internet economy, despite the rout in
many fragile dot-com companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting its recent low of 3164.55 on May 23, Nasdaq has
rebounded nearly 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, with its blue-chip lineup of
old-economy names, is another story. After rallying between
mid-March and mid-April, the 30-stock Dow has followed a jagged
downward path that continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, analysts said, seems vulnerable to the slowing that is
taking place in the overall economy and anticipated weakness in the
next round of earnings reports on the first quarter. The Dow
slumped 122.68 points, or 1.16 percent, to 10,435.16.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Engels, Tucker Anthony Inc. senior vice president and a
director of equity research, predicted the Nasdaq offers more hope
for investors in coming weeks or months than does the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech is not dead,'' Engels said. ``We've really had a sifting
and sorting, where the less quality or early-stage companies that
were perhaps too early stage for the market have truly fallen to
the bottom. The names with staying power have moved and have
corrected quite a bit, and if the economy continues to grow and
tech continues to be major theme they will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by gains in such industry stalwarts as Intel Corp., the
world's biggest chip maker, the Nasdaq has staged an impressive
rally in recent weeks. Tuesday marks the first time it has
surpassed 4000 since April 11, when the market closed at 4055.90.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous tech stocks had stellar gains, including Intel, which
rose $1.8125 a share, to $138.3125, on expectations of higher
demand for its chips. National Semiconductor Corp. rose $5.25 a
share, to $72.25, after Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. analyst Joseph Osha
predicted the stock could reach $100 a share in 12 to 18 months
because of strong demand for its wireless and network products.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Fine, who manages the Small-Cap and Aggressive Growth
funds for Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., said that while he expects the
Nasdaq to possibly return to about 4400, the index is not in the
midst of a major bull-market rally.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Nasdaq stocks, he said, is being fueled by
speculative interest, though speculation is no longer focused on
dot-com companies and has shifted to other tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money is flowing into relatively few stocks going
up,'' Fine said. ``It's basically a momentum move in the market and
it has not broadened out'' to non-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and evidence the economy's long-running
economic expansion may be slowing have dampened the Dow, which
historically has responded to economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Fine noted that financial-company stocks have been very weak
because of concerns about the quality of their loans. The New York
Stock Exchange's index of financial companies has lost about 7
percent since late May.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks also have slumped amid reports last week of steep
declines in sales to consumers. Retailers were hit after a Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst said June sales for stores open at least a year
were likely lower than expected for companies including May
Department Stores Co., Kmart Corp., J.C. Penney Co., and Federated
Department Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only at Wal-Mart, among companies polled so far, are June
sales solidly on plan,'' Strachan wrote in a report to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell International Inc. accounted for almost a third of the
Dow's decline, after the company said earnings will fall short of
estimates. Honeywell, a pioneer in the computer industry, is now
considered an ``old economy'' stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``With anecdotal evidence the economy is slowing you have to
wonder if the problem is more widespread than Honeywell,'' said
Robert Streed, manager of the Northern Select Equity fund in
Chicago. ``Investors are skittish about the other industrial
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Anthony's Engels attributed the Dow's slump to a range of
factors, from Honeywell to a weaker euro currency that is hurting
many US companies with international exposure. The upcoming
earnings announcements are another wild card for the Dow, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we can get through the earnings reporting season, the
Dow is probably going to be sluggish,'' Engels predicted.

 &HT;    Lakers celebrate, reflect on a season of excellence
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the aftermath of another title celebration.
``We Are The Champions'' blared over the loudspeakers. Purple and
gold confetti cascaded from the rafters. Phil Jackson took it all
in with remarkable calm. Or maybe it was shock. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's placid demeanor amid the celebration Monday night at
the Staples Center was symbolic of the way he elevated the
once-underachieving Lakers to the summit. Rarely did he raise his
voice in the first year at the Lakers helm. But his players often
interpreted his calm as forceful statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Phil,'' guard Kobe Bryant said, ``he didn't have to say
anything from the beginning. When he walked in for the first time,
he had our attention because of his six championships (with the
Bulls). How can you ignore that?
</P>
<P>
   ``And during a game or practice, when he's not happy, he just
gives you a look, and you know you've messed up. And you get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same Lakers who yawned when former coaches Del
Harris and Kurt Rambis sought their attention, listened and
followed Jackson _ all the way to the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Their 116-111 Game 6 victory over the Indiana Pacers in the
Staples Center Monday night was a summation of a season of
remarkable achievement for Jackson. It might have been his best
coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not score a point, but he did score points with
Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant by the way he challenged them to become
complete players.
</P>
<P>
   In his first words after becoming a champion, O'Neal said:
``First of all, I want to thank the real coach of the year, Phil
Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson, O'Neal won the all-star game MVP, the league
regular-season MVP and the NBA Finals MVP.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal punctuated his season with 41 points, 12 rebounds and
four blocks in the clincher. He scored 13 in the fourth quarter,
when the Lakers finally took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry and Rick Fox made key contribuitons in the fourth
quarter, but it was O'Neal who led the way to the title. l ``I
think we needed Phil to do it,'' said O'Neal, who cried after the
game. ``We always won 50, 60 games. When we got into certain
situations in the playoffs, we could never get over the hump. But
Phil was able to keep us poised.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's ability to understand his role was critical to the
team's development. Jackson made it clear to the talented
21-year-old that the Lakers are Shaq's team. And knowing Bryant's
desire to have the kind of impact Michael Jordan did, Jackson told
Bryant to work harder as a defender.
</P>
<P>
   Although he breached the team concept at times, Bryant's game
grew considerably. And he became a first-team all defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``All young players should play under Phil,'' Bryant said. ``I'm
very fortunate. He breaks the game down for you, helps you
understand the game, where to attack, how to attack. I feel I have
an advantage over other young players because I play under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson avoided labeling his success with this team, although as
recently as Friday he questioned whether it had the character to be
champions. But he sounded proud when he talked about the way the
team had started under him. In October, he had stopped the first
practice because he sensed that he was not receiving a committed
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You guys can't play with the kind of energy I demand
as a coach, and you have to lift that up,' `` Jackson said. ``They
found a way to do that. That was the key to whether we could win or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they could play with the kind of intensity
defensively that it takes to be a championship team,'' he said.
``From that standpoint, I'm very pleased they were able to bring
that level up to a maximum effort this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Buss said about Jackson's coaching, ``At least in my
mind, I doubt that anyone else could have done it.''

 &HT;    Landscaping crews begin laying turf in Sanford Stadium
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ University of Georgia fans can stop worrying. The
jokes can cease about the foul-smelling liquid that seeped up
through the Sanford Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   About six months and $750,000 later, the Bulldogs have their
football field back.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, landscaping crews laid the first of dozens of rolls
of a Bermuda-grass hybrid known as Tifway 4-19 on a bed of sand,
clay and gravel. The rebuilding project, the result of years-old
drainage problems underneath Sanford field, is expected to be
completed sometime today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' Sept. 2 home-opener against Georgia Southern is
just 10 weeks away and the state is in the throes of a record
drought. But Ray McEwen, the Georgia athletic association's
landscaping chief, said, ``I can guarantee you we will have a 100
percent playable field.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwen said the first seven days are critical as the sod takes
root. UGA is using a chemical in the sand beneath the sod that
congeals the water and holds the moisture. Once rooted, the grass
is semi-dormant and can protect itself from searing sun and heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the sod was down, we could play tomorrow,'' McEwen
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the Bulldog faithful, comforting words indeed.

1875 PARIS COMES TO LIFE AS OPERA HOUSE IS CLEANSED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Charles Garnier was commissioned to build a new
Paris opera house in 1861, his job was to impress, not only his
patron Napoleon III and elitist operagoers but also ordinary
Parisians who could sense the power of France through the giant
building's extravagant facade. Yet in recent decades, the Palais
Garnier, as it is known, has impressed mainly with its dark and
grimy appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, long after most Paris museums and monuments have been given
face-lifts, the Palais Garnier's turn has finally come. After a
12-month cleaning and restoration, its facade was formally reopened
Tuesday by the minister of culture, Catherine Tasca, exposing a
dozen gilded busts and statues, multicolored marble pillars,
delicate mosaics and almost shockingly white stone. It looks as
good _ or as strange _ as the day it was inaugurated in 1875.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the building has not always been universally loved.
Garnier, an unknown 35-year-old architect when he began work on the
theater, diplomatically described it as ``Napoleon III style,''
although it is unlike any other building of the era, with its
polychromatic facade showing a strong Italian influence. It was
this mixture of styles that brought criticism from some
late-19th-century purists. Debussy, for one, said it resembled a
Turkish bathhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Hitler, that infamous former Viennese art
student, is said to have considered it the world's most beautiful
building. Certainly, he made a point of touring it before dawn on
the only occasion that he visited Paris just weeks after the city
was occupied by German troops in June 1940. From there he went to
the Trocadero, where photographs show him looking at the Eiffel
Tower, but the opera house was apparently the city's main
attraction for him.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Palais Garnier has had to compete for
attention with the ultramodern and larger Bastille Opera. Indeed,
for five years after the new house opened in 1990, it presented all
opera productions, while the Palais Garnier became the home of
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Palais Garnier was remembered. Once its auditorium
was restored and its backstage modernized in 1995, it again _ like
the Bastille Opera _ combined opera and ballet. Finally $7.7
million was assigned for cleaning its exterior. The building's
facade, which still carries the letters E and N for the Emperor
Napoleon, was completed in 1867 to coincide with France's first
Universal Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the facade to be the most typical and most personal
part of the entire project,'' Garnier wrote. He and his wife,
Louise, spent months traveling around Italy studying gilding
techniques and searching for the 10 different types and colors of
marble eventually used on the facade.
</P>
<P>
   But the facade was also the only part of the building that the
Emperor would ever see. Construction was halted in 1870 when
Prussian troops occupied Paris and Napoleon III fled into exile.
The following year, even greater chaos erupted during the popular
uprising known as the Commune of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Garnier resumed work in 1873, he changed nothing of his
plans: the grandiose western entrance, now closed, remained the
imperial entrance, while the eastern entrance, also now closed,
still shows where the wealthy were supposedly to drive up in their
carriages.
</P>
<P>
   The entire building was designed for people who went principally
to the opera to be seen. Its Italian-style horseshoe auditorium,
with some 2,200 seats, was no larger than, say, La Scala or Covent
Garden. But the area between the entrance and the auditorium was
palatial, dominated by a huge marble staircase and filled with
gilded and stone statues scattered through wide corridors and
galleries. The Grand Foyer, heavy with neo-baroque statuary and
frescoes, was where people gathered in their finery: the
intermission was more important than the opera itself.
</P>
<P>
   For the building's restoration, the team of architects, headed
by Alain-Charles Perrot, chief architect of France's historic
monuments, turned the clock back to Garnier's day.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they were able to obtain marble and tesserae for
mosaics from the same places and even the same family firms that
supplied Garnier 130 or more years earlier. As significantly, they
also found French artisans who were able to work gold, bronze and
stone in the traditional manner.
</P>
<P>
   A modern sandblasting machine was used to clean the western,
northern and eastern sides of the buildings, gradually revealing
the stone busts of 24 prominent French musicians and thinkers as
well as 38 stone theater masks. But the southern facade had to be
worked by hand. Known in French as ``Renomees,'' two groups of
large statues presiding over the building and representing Harmony
and Poetry had to be entirely dismantled and repaired before they
could be regilded.
</P>
<P>
   Above the open-air terrace that looks over the Place de l'Opera,
nine busts of famous composers and librettists of the day, long
rendered invisible by pollution, are also now covered with gold
leaf. Today, Garnier's choice of who should be so honored seems a
tad strange. Mozart, Beethoven and Rossini are there, but so also
are Spontini, Meyerbeer, Halevy, Auber, Quinault and Scribe, not
exactly creators whose works are featured in the Palais Garnier
these days.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the terrace, known as the loggia, is one of the
achievements of the restoration. In 1977, it was closed for
security reasons when pieces of mosaic from its ceiling came
unstuck.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has reopened, its multicolored marble floors clean and
shiny, its mosaics restored. To re-enter the opera house from the
loggia, though, still presents something of a shock: the Grand
Foyer remains murky, its rococo design still carrying the soot of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   So the cleanup of the Palais Garnier is not over yet. If it took
Garnier 14 years to build the opera house, it will have taken 13
years to fix it up by the time the Grand Foyer, other public spaces
and numerous bronze statues at the western and eastern entrances
are restored in 2007 at a cost of $40 million more.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the authorities have pledged not to let the
house fall into disrepair. They can do little about the city's air
pollution, but at least they have concluded that maintenance is
cheaper than starting afresh a decade or two hence.

DRIVER HELD, SURVIVORS QUESTIONED IN DEATHS OF 58 CHINESE
IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British police officers investigating the deaths of 58
Chinese immigrants found crammed into the freight container of a
truck in Dover ordered the Dutch driver held on suspicion of
manslaughter Tuesday and began interviewing two men in a Canterbury
hospital who lived through the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two men are of enormous value to us simply because they
are the only survivors,'' said Detective Superintendent Dennis
McGookin, the head of the investigation. ``This is being treated as
a homicide; it is a major criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has focused attention on the lucrative international
business of smuggling desperate refugees who the British police say
will pay crime syndicates up to $30,000 each to be brought here.
Prime Minister Tony Blair, in Portugal at a European meeting, said
the case had prompted a ``huge willingness'' on the part of
continental leaders to ``tackle this problem of trade in human
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch police said they had arrested a man in Rotterdam in
connection with the grisly early Monday discovery in the English
channel port, but they gave no details. The 50-foot transport was
registered to a Rotterdam company that had been set up just five
days earlier, and the police were searching for Arie van der Spek,
24, an engineer who lived at the address listed for the company.
</P>
<P>
   McGookin, the investigator, said initial forensic findings
showed the 54 men and 4 women died of ``some form of respiratory
failure.'' The truck's refrigeration system had been turned off,
turning the space packed with the migrants and stacked high with
tomato crates into an airless oven.
</P>
<P>
   Without identifying their sources, British newspapers reported
that the two survivors said they were clawing at the inside of the
sealed back door and screaming at the driver. The moment that
customs officers opened the doors, they reportedly said, was ``as
if an angel had been sent from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers pulled the vehicle over shortly after midnight Sunday
as it left the ferry, which had made the four-and-a-half-hour
crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Belgian authorities alerted
British customs officials about their suspicions when they could
find no prior record of the company listed in the registry and when
they saw the driver pay for the journey in cash.
</P>
<P>
   McGookin said the victims were all in their 20s and came from
Fujian province in southern China. ``These people have died a
horrific death, and somewhere in China, but also maybe in this
country, are their relatives,'' he said. ``We would appeal to
anyone that knows the deceased to come forward at once''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated 150,000 Chinese living in Britain come
from Fujian, but authorities worry that they will not come forward
for fear of exposing themselves to arrest and deportation as
illegal residents. The police set up a public emergency phone
number staffed by Chinese speakers.
</P>
<P>
   McGookin said he was receiving cooperation from the Chinese
Embassy and government to identify victims and track down the gang
leaders who managed to ferry the refugees such a distance. ``To
have 60 young people in the back of a truck, there would have to
have taken some organization to get these people over from China,''
he said. ``In liaising with the Chinese police, hopefully we will
know more on this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A Home Office spokesman said that since spring about 600
immigrants have been detained in Dover each month, down from 2,000
a month from January to March.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman credited laws put into effect in April for the
reduction. Since then truck drivers have been liable to fines of
$3,000 for every stowaway found on their rigs.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said, ``This tragedy has brought home to people the sheer
scale of this problem, and it doesn't just affect Britain, it
affects every other country.''

`TRUE STORY': A COMIC WHO WRITES WHAT HE KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of
review.)  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Maher, known to those who watch late-night television as
the creator and host of the program ``Politically Incorrect,''
doesn't waste any time introducing the main characters of ``True
Story,'' a novel he wrote a decade ago that is just now being
published in hardcover. In his first paragraph he introduces the
five comedians who inhabit the rest of the book, five men of the
early 1980s variously unsuited for any of the usual bourgeois
occupations, riding the Amtrak Minuteman from New York to gigs in
Wilmington and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Maher is finished about 300 pages later, the reader
has had a thorough experience of this raucously ill-starred band of
brothers whose lives are equally devoted to career and sex. Too
thorough, actually. Maher has written a novel with many funny
passages of a kind of sandpaper humor whose chief engine is the
relentlessly adolescent urgings of the five strenuously striving
comics. Maher himself is a man of considerable restless talent,
with a special gift for earthy dialogue, more politically incorrect
in its absence of euphemism and nicety than his television program
is.
</P>
<P>
   So one enjoys ``True Story'' for its bawdy energy, its
flamethrower wit, even if it has the enduring impact of yesterday's
potato chips. There is a limit to just how long one wants to be in
intensive contact with a group of guys who remind you of the
nervously aggressive jokesters in high school, the ones who were
always cracking about masturbation and hair growing in the palm.''
</P>
<P>
   `Yeah, yeah,' Buck sighed. `The penis. It's our bane and boon,
isn't it?''' Buck is one of Maher's single-minded comedians, and
while there are many better lines of dialogue than that in this
book, that stale observation is typical of many. Maher's five main
characters range from a relative old hand to a relative neophyte in
the stand-up comic game.
</P>
<P>
   They are in their 20s and 30s, all saturated in the comic
sensibility of the early 1980s, a sort of post-Lenny Bruce mockery
of bourgeois pretense, a stripping away of the veneer of civility.
One of the enjoyable elements of Maher's book is that as a stand-up
comedian himself, he is able to write some pretty funny material
for his characters, like these lines in which Buck wishes his
audience goodbye:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to stay, but it would keep me from going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is certainly a night I will remember till I get
to my car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, you were execrable, good night!''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, as Maher says about a different passage,
that isn't all that funny, and indeed, the humor in ``True Story''
is hit or miss, as humor often is. Maher is a .300 hitter in this
sense, which is pretty good, especially when sustained over an
entire novel. Some passages are hilarious, but even so, there is
the general problem that jokes designed for a live club do not have
the same effect on the printed page. The same is true of the
constant repartee that takes place among the characters, a repartee
that varies between the stiletto and the sledgehammer forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the X factor in comedy,'' Maher writes at one point
about why jokes work sometimes and other times don't. ``One can
hone material, rehearse delivery, bone up on all the tangibles, but
in the end it comes down to something very much like what makes a
man and a woman have enduring passion _ something that no one can
ever know, because such knowledge, like that coveted by Adam and
Eve, would itself be the agent of destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, when ``True Story'' works, it works because of
Maher's energetic intelligence and his creation of characters whose
prolonged sophomorism has distinct qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The five comedians grow and change during the year or so of
``True Story's'' span, and Maher certainly captures their world as
they deal with comedy club managers, chase women, take drugs, worry
about ``zits'' and engage heroically in the risky effort to make
other people laugh on demand. They are not deep or refined
characters, and the wit is not subtle or dry, but they all have
charm, even if it comes from a rueful acknowledgment of their
fecklessness and their failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I don't know if it's the drugs,'' one of the guys
tells Buck after they take LSD in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I paid good money for them, and I'd hate to think we
could be feeling good for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher lives comfortably within the cramped spiritual dimensions
of his characters, never trying to get out of them anything more
than they would feasibly produce. When Fat, in the interests of
seducing the young woman of his desires, goes on a diet, it lasts
for two meals. When Buck falls for a certain Vera, he finds her
frequent use of the word like, ``which he formerly had excoriated
as an unpardonable lapse of verbal facility and harbinger of the
collapse of Western civilization,'' charming.
</P>
<P>
   Dick, who is the champion seducer of the group, ends up with a
woman named Jill who is so sealed into the chamber of her own
selfishness that she cannot see the wreckage she causes around her.
She is recognizable as a post-'60s type, liberated to a fault but
devoid of any sense of rebellious idealism. Also recognizable is
Dick's ability to see through to her selfish core and yet to remain
trapped within her orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Story,'' in other words, often has a satirical ring of
truth to it. You might like it, though you'll have to have a fairly
large appetite for post-``Leave It to Beaver'' artifacts if you do.

HOUSE PASSES BILL EASING REGULATION OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that would allow religious groups a
greater role in public television, the US House voted Tuesday to
abolish requirements that public broadcasters air a certain amount
of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   The religious broadcasting bill, backed by the Christian
Coalition, touched off a wave of protest among many House Democrats
and public broadcasters who fear it would fundamentally alter the
nature of taxpayer-funded TV.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat,
warned that the legislation would lead to ``the single, most
significant change in public television in history,'' blurring the
line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans saw the legislation, which passed 264-159,
as a triumph for free speech. The bill would forbid the Federal
Communications Commission from trying to regulate the content of
public radio and TV stations. It also would broaden the scope of
who qualifies for a free TV license, making religious programming
an acceptable format for public TV license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   A similar version of the bill is pending in the Senate, where
its chances are uncertain. President Clinton is expected to veto
the legislation if it reaches the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Coming the day after a Supreme Court decision banning school
prayer at high school sports events, the vote was received warmly
among House Republican leaders, many of whom have long sought to
reduce funding for public broadcasting overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court may have banned prayer yet again, but the House has
defended religion on the airwaves,'' said Representative J.C.
Watts, Republican of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, non-profit groups qualify for a public broadcasting
license if they promise their programs will be mostly one of three
things: educational, instructional, or cultural.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add a fourth category: religious.
</P>
<P>
   The debate grew out of a controversial case last year in
Pittsburgh, in which a religious group tried to obtain a
non-commercial broadcasting license. The FCC, responding to public
outrage, issued a directive clarifying existing broadcasting rules.
Instead of just promising to have ``primarily'' educational
programming _ a vague requirement that is rarely regulated _ the
FCC said licensees had to prove they were devoting half their
programming to educational, instructional or cultural shows.
</P>
<P>
   That directive prompted outrage among conservatives and
religious broadcasters, who argued that church services and Bible
study discussions should be deemed educational. The FCC withdrew
the order. But congressional Republicans, fearful that the FCC
might act on religious broadcasting again in the future, moved
ahead with the legislation that passed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have government intervention'' in religious
broadcasting, said Representative Chip Pickering, Republican of
Mississippi, who sponsored the bill. ``We will find a value for the
religious voice in the public square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, the (Federal Communications) Commission will not
try to dictate the content of religious broadcasting,'' said
Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are 181 non-commercial public television
licenses. Of those public TV broadcasters, approximately 15 have a
religious theme, or are part of a larger organization with a
religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most religious broadcasters hold commercial licenses,
which, although they are not free, allow the licensee to play
advertisements and raise money. There are approximately 245
religious TV broadcasters in the United States, according to the
FCC.
</P>
<P>
   And according to Markey, the fact that religious broadcasters
are able to buy commercial licenses is proof that their free speech
is not being stifled. When it comes to public television licenses,
however, he argued that all broadcasters should be held to a
certain standard. Other critics of the bill said that in rural
communities with limited TV access, granting a religious group the
sole public TV license could be offensive to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those television stations are meant to serve the
non-commercial educational needs for the entire community,'' Markey
said.

 &HT;    Lawyers for Elian's dad seek end to legal delays
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal appeals court in Atlanta should reject an
appeal seeking to extend the ``excrutiating delays'' of Elian
Gonzalez's return to Cuba, lawyers for the boy's father said in
court motions filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, also asked the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to dissolve an injunction keeping Elian in
the United States while his case continues.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Gonzalez accused Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro, and
other Miami relatives of abusing the litigation process to delay
Elian's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we urge the court to see through Lazaro's charade, stop
the excrutiating delays and allow this family to go home,'' said
the brief, signed by Washington lawyer Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, of course, is another day of interference with Juan
Miguel's ability to raise his child as he sees fit,'' Craig added.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, his stepmother and his half-brother have been
staying in the Washington area since late April.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and U.S. Justice Department lawyers separately filed
motions, asking the 11th Circuit to reject the Miami relatives'
request that the full 12-judge court reconsider a decision issued
earlier this month by a three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the panel said the Immigration and
Naturalization Service acted correctly in deciding only Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and not Elian's Miami relatives, could apply for asylum
on the 6-year-old boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the deadline for the parties to respond to the Miami
relatives' motion for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the relatives said the panel's decision was wrong
and in conflict with U.S. Supreme Court precedent.
</P>
<P>
   They also claimed the panel ignored the federal law allowing
``any alien'' _ including a child acting against his parent's
wishes _ to appeal for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department replied that the panel was correct in
deferring to Attorney General Janet Reno's decision, who upheld an
INS ruling rejecting Elian's asylum application. ``That is the
paradigmatic kind of administrative decision to which deference is
owed,'' the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, in his brief, added, ``The decision of the INS
transcended levels of administrative deference _ reuniting Elian
with his sole surviving parent was simply the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 11th Circuit has promised to consider Elian's case in
an expedited manner, there is no timetable for when the court must
decide whether it will rehear the issue. If the full court decides
to reconsider, it must schedule another hearing. If it rejects the
motion from Elian's Miami relatives, the relatives can then appeal
that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<P>
   Al Gore arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1965 so sure of
himself and his place in the world that he hadn't even bothered
applying anywhere else. ``I had the idea it was the best,'' he said
simply, in one of several interviews about his college years. ``I
knew President Kennedy had gone there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of what Gore had in mind when he signed up for Jack
Kennedy's Harvard was on the way out even then. Vietnam was not a
world away any more, and American involvement there was escalating
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's sophomore year, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara
visited to give a speech and was mobbed by screaming students who
rocked his car while he sat inside. During Gore's junior year,
student protesters held a recruiter for Dow, the maker of napalm,
in a classroom for five hours. And in his last semester,
demonstrators took over the school's main administration building,
only to be forced out at dawn the next day by police swinging clubs
and wearing riot helmets.
</P>
<P>
   And exactly four years later, the recently graduated, recently
enlisted Private Gore returned to campus in short hair and an Army
uniform _ an inherently provocative act in militantly anti-military
Cambridge in September 1969. Students in Harvard Yard jeered at the
sight of him.
</P>
<P>
   That moment, the moment he truly left Harvard behind, remains
alive for the vice president across the decades: ``It was an
amazing experience, a Ralph Ellison experience in that I was the
same person inside but my physical appearance conveyed a message
that completely overwhelmed the message of my humanity. It was just
an emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing
glances that shot arrows of what certainly felt like real hatred,
and I was astonished. I mean, it was no big deal in the sense that
I didn't suffer as a result of it at all, but it was really
educational. Really educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, both the snapshot of that kid in uniform, looking
more surprised than he probably should have been, and the vice
president's take on it, more than 30 years later, explain a few
things about Al Gore. There he was, going off to fight in a war he
hated and didn't believe in, after a solid year of agonizing, which
everyone who knew him then believes could only have ended exactly
as it did.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious to others that he could never seem to stop
thinking about the boys his age back in Tennessee, where he was
registered for the draft. The kids he had spent summers with did
not have the options that he and his Harvard friends had.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that if he found a fancy way of not going, someone
else would have to go in his place,'' remembered his college pal,
the actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told friends then that it was, perversely, in going to war
that he could probably best support the anti-war movement _ by
helping his father, Sen. Albert Gore, of Tennessee, get re-elected.
The senator's stand against the war was wildly unpopular in the
Volunteer State, and if his son had stayed home, he would have
handed a campaign issue to his father's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Gore seems to have believed all along that his
father would lose in 1970 - and he did. Still, the young man felt
obligated to do whatever he could to help, and as he marched off to
join the service seemed to feel he was sacrificing himself to two
lost causes, in Vietnam and in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the final decision appears to have hinged more on Gore's
sense of himself as a Tennesseean _ and as the moral man his
parents had constantly prodded him to be. In the end, he was one of
only about a dozen of his classmates who served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember so clearly him saying he was going to have to do it
the way his fathers' constituents did it, as an enlisted man,''
Gore's senior thesis adviser at Harvard, the presidential scholar
Richard Neustadt, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly no other Harvard kid I knew who thought he might
want to get into politics did that,'' Neustadt said. ``All the ones
that talked to me came to the conclusion that they had to serve,
but they were quite happy to serve as officers.''
</P>
<P>
   His studies did not really engage Gore until his junior year at
Harvard, when he took Neustadt's course about presidential decision
making. From what he saw in class, Neustadt said that ``as
intelligences go'' among presidents of the 20th Century, only
``Teddy Roosevelt might have stood higher'' than Gore _ who, by the
way, received an A-minus in Neustadt's Government 154.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the challenge for George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, is to prove his smarts, Gore's is
precisely the opposite _ to show that he is a regular guy despite a
perceived surplus of gravitas, which at least some Americans seem
to find intimidating, boring, or, as he himself worries, just
weird.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks America wants an intellectual for a
president, Gore said, ``I don't think book smarts are necessarily
the highest qualification to lead so much as good values, good
judgment, and a willingness to fight for the right thing. These
things are all cartoon images anyway _ Truman was extremely
well-read, for example. But if you give people the impression
you're a smarty pants, that's no good for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore himself says that everything he learned in the
classroom at Harvard was dwarfed by the education he got from
Tipper Aitcheson in those first years after they met at his senior
prom at St. Albans in Washington. A year younger than Gore, she
joined him in Boston his sophomore year, studying at Garland Junior
College and then Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks of his wife today, it is with awe, gratitude and
an explicit acknowledgment that even his parents had a less
formative influence on him: ``It's clearly the most important
relationship I've ever had with anyone, bar none,'' he said
recently. ``Even at a young age she helped me understand things I
 &UR; never  &LR; would have been able to understand otherwise. She has a way
of understanding people and the world that I, well, I would be a
completely and totally different person in every way except for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They were together on their spring break in 1968 when Martin
Luther King Jr. was shot in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving with Tipper from Boston to Washington and it
happened when we were on the road,'' Gore remembered. ``It was
devastating. When we arrived, my mother was downtown at an auction
house and needed a ride home because the rioting had started. I
don't think I ever saw her scared, but as I drove up, stores on
either side were having glass fronts crushed in and there was
looting. She walked rather calmly but quickly as I drove up.''
</P>
<P>
   His roommate in junior year, John Tyson, now an international
business consultant in Washington, said he and Gore both cried for
their country and stayed up until 4 a.m. one night talking. ``He
was so upset because it had happened in Tennessee,'' said Tyson,
who is black. ``It was very, very sad and we were sick from
watching our nation burn up. You didn't want to believe what you
were seeing and what had happened. How were we going to stay
together as a people?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very analytical and was saying in times of great cultural
change there is great chaos. But I also remember him saying,
`Jesus, we've got to understand who we are as a people and we
don't, and we haven't formed that e pluribus unum.' We both felt
that things had gotten so out of hand that his could happen in our
America.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer, too, Gore helped his father write a short speech
for the Democratic Convention in Chicago, where he stayed with his
parents while other youths his age were fighting with police.
Inside the convention hall, both Gores shared the demonstrators'
bitterness: ``Four years ago our party and the nominee of our party
promised the people that American boys would not be sent to fight
in a land war in Asia,'' Senator Gore told the convention, to huge
applause from supporters of Eugene McCarthy, the anti-war
candidate, who had been denied the nomination in favor of Vice
President Hubert Humphrey. ``They voted for our distinguished
leader, President Lyndon B. Johnson, but they got the policies of
Senator Goldwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, back at school in the fall, Gore and most of his friends
continued to shy away from various protest groups. ``We weren't
demonstrators,'' Tyson said. ``We distrusted these movements a lot
because a lot of this stuff was very emotional and not well thought
out. We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil
rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social
revolution to some extent but not buying into something we
considered detrimental to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore recalls that while he agreed with their anti-war
sentiments, he found students who were protesting the presence of
ROTC on campus wrong-headed and even kind of juvenile. He thought
taking anger about the war out on the university was plain
illogical. ``It seemed silly to me to target the administration of
a private university,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing he has in common with his opponent, Bush, who
experienced the '60s very differently, is that he was never
seriously tempted by anti-establishment politics. Both stuck close
to their father's view of the war, though those views were of
course quite different.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, when police moved in and beat a number of
the students occupying University Hall, Jones remembers Gore's
reaction as ``the same reaction all Harvard people had, that
suddenly all this talk about the fascist threat was real. On that
day, we joined the ranks of paranoids who have people after them.
</P>
<P>
   But in Cambridge in the late '60s, a refusal to fully join in
the revolution was itself a kind of rebellion. Martin Peretz, who
taught Gore at Harvard and later bought The New Republic, remembers
that Gore ``called attention to himself by the moderation of his
views. It took a kind of defiance to say, `Let's not get carried
away.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Gore graduated from Harvard, a number of his
classmates raised their fists and walked out half-way through the
ceremonies in a planned protest. Gore stayed in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Gore did end up staging a one-man protest of sorts
when he showed up in his uniform in Harvard Yard a few months
later. That day, he was angry at the self-righteousness of kids who
thought all decisions about the war were easy. And finally, in
spite of himself, Al Gore was demonstrating after all.

JUDGE DELAYS ALL MICROSOFT RESTRICTIONS PENDING APPELLATE REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case
unexpectedly issued an order Tuesday delaying the sweeping conduct
restrictions he had imposed on the company until a higher court
affirms them.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions were scheduled to take effect in just 11 weeks
under an order signed by the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, on
June 7. Jackson had also ordered a breakup of the company, but he
had already stayed that action until appeals were complete.
</P>
<P>
   Now none of the steps he ordered in his remedy ruling may go
into effect for a year or longer, if they are upheld at all.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was jubilant; for weeks the company had been arguing
that the conduct restrictions would cause grievous harm to the
company and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's stay order was issued as he sent the case to the
Supreme Court for direct review, an idea the Justice Department had
advocated and Microsoft had vigorously opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision of antitrust law, cases with significant
impact can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court. With
Jackson's action Tuesday, it is now up to the Supreme Court to
decide whether to take the case directly, or to let an appeal be
heard first by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lauded Jackson for referring the case to
the high court but added, ``Given the district court's decision to
stay the remedy during the appeal process, the direct appeal to the
Supreme Court is of particular importance to the national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed with Jackson earlier Tuesday, the department
had argued that ``in an industry Microsoft vigorously characterizes
as fast paced and quickly changing,'' delay ``would undermine the
ultimate value of the remedy to correct the harmful results of
Microsoft's anticompetitive actions and to restore competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not explain his decision to stay the conduct
restrictions, but he appears uncomfortable with imposing a sweeping
remedy on Microsoft before his work on the case has been reviewed
by a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this year, the judge said: ``I have been
in splendid isolation on this case long enough. I would welcome
another mind studying my work product to see if I am correct or
wrongheaded. I want to move this case upstairs as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the judge's order on Tuesday, the Supreme Court would have
been called on to rule quickly on Microsoft's request to stay the
remedy order _ or to decide that the entire case should be sent to
the appeals court. Now the Supreme Court, or the appeals court, can
review the entire appeal, and rule on it, before deciding whether
to impose Jackson's remedy, to modify it or to cancel it. The
process could take a year _ or longer if the case is sent back to
the appeals court and then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson's order, Microsoft would be broken into separate
companies, one for its Windows operating system and one for its
other computer programs and Internet businesses. The company would
also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on its
conduct lasting three years if the breakup order withstands appeal,
and 10 years if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions included uniform royalty terms for Windows
products, a ban on exclusive deals or on making the company's sales
to hardware or software makers contingent on use of other Microsoft
products, and an order not to retaliate against ``any person or
entity'' that provided evidence against it.
</P>
<P>
   Those conduct restrictions were to take effect 90 days after his
order was issued, or Sept. 5. And though the breakup itself was
stayed until appeals were complete, Microsoft was required to
prepare a detailed plan for the breakup by Oct. 5. That order is
now stayed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, Vivek Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, said:
``Obviously we are very pleased with the judge's decision to stay
the remedy order. This lets us go forward with our appeal without
any disruption to our business and our customers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The law under which direct appeals are authorized, the
Expediting Act, has been used in only one previous case, the AT&AMP;T
case, since it was revised in 1974. And so there are few precedents
for judging how the Supreme Court might decide whether to take the
case. But since the court's session ends shortly, a decision is not
likely before the new term opens in October.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that the case is inappropriate for immediate
Supreme Court review. But Richard E. Donovan, who is head of the
antitrust and trade practice at the New York law firm of Kelley
Drye &AMP; Warren, noted that when Congress revised the law in 1974,
the intent was to invoke it when the issues in question were ``the
immediate economic impact of the case rather than on the
significance of the legal issues presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has repeatedly argued that Jackson's remedy ``could
have a significant adverse impact on the nation's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan also noted that the federal government, ``through the
attorney general and the solicitor general, supports a direct
appeal,'' and ``the Supreme Court tends to accord substantial
weight to their opinions in such matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In its brief filed earlier Tuesday, the government told Jackson
that Microsoft's effort to avert a direct appeal ``misstates and
misapplies the appropriate legal standard for certification and
ignores the incontrovertible importance of prompt resolution of
this case to consumers and the national economy.'' Apparently
Jackson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tried to outmaneuver Jackson and the Justice
Department by filing a part of its appeal with the Court of Appeals
last week, before the government had a chance to file its
direct-appeal request.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court eagerly accepted the case, and even laid out
an aggressive schedule for hearing it, but also made clear that the
schedule would be suspended as soon as Jackson signed a Supreme
Court certification order.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson's certification order, the appeals court stood
down.

HOUSE PASSES BILL EASING REGULATION OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that would allow religious groups a
greater role in public television, the US House voted Tuesday to
abolish requirements that public broadcasters air a certain amount
of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   The religious broadcasting bill, backed by the Christian
Coalition, touched off a wave of protest among many House Democrats
and public broadcasters who fear it would fundamentally alter the
nature of taxpayer-funded TV.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat,
warned that the legislation would lead to ``the single, most
significant change in public television in history,'' blurring the
line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   But House Republicans saw the legislation, which passed 264-159,
as a triumph for free speech. The bill would forbid the Federal
Communications Commission from trying to regulate the content of
public radio and TV stations. It also would broaden the scope of
who qualifies for a free TV license, making religious programming
an acceptable format for public TV license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   A similar version of the bill is pending in the Senate, where
its chances are uncertain. President Clinton is expected to veto
the legislation if it reaches the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Coming the day after a Supreme Court decision banning school
prayer at high school sports events, the vote was received warmly
among House Republican leaders, many of whom have long sought to
reduce funding for public broadcasting overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court may have banned prayer yet again, but the House has
defended religion on the airwaves,'' said Representative J.C.
Watts, Republican of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, non-profit groups qualify for a public broadcasting
license if they promise their programs will be mostly one of three
things: educational, instructional, or cultural.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would add a fourth category: religious.
</P>
<P>
   The debate grew out of a controversial case last year in
Pittsburgh, in which a religious group tried to obtain a
non-commercial broadcasting license. The FCC, responding to public
outrage, issued a directive clarifying existing broadcasting rules.
Instead of just promising to have ``primarily'' educational
programming _ a vague requirement that is rarely regulated _ the
FCC said licensees had to prove they were devoting half their
programming to educational, instructional or cultural shows.
</P>
<P>
   That directive prompted outrage among conservatives and
religious broadcasters, who argued that church services and Bible
study discussions should be deemed educational. The FCC withdrew
the order. But congressional Republicans, fearful that the FCC
might act on religious broadcasting again in the future, moved
ahead with the legislation that passed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have government intervention'' in religious
broadcasting, said Representative Chip Pickering, Republican of
Mississippi, who sponsored the bill. ``We will find a value for the
religious voice in the public square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, the (Federal Communications) Commission will not
try to dictate the content of religious broadcasting,'' said
Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are 181 non-commercial public television
licenses. Of those public TV broadcasters, approximately 15 have a
religious theme, or are part of a larger organization with a
religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most religious broadcasters hold commercial licenses,
which, although they are not free, allow the licensee to play
advertisements and raise money. There are approximately 245
religious TV broadcasters in the United States, according to the
FCC.
</P>
<P>
   And according to Markey, the fact that religious broadcasters
are able to buy commercial licenses is proof that their free speech
is not being stifled. When it comes to public television licenses,
however, he argued that all broadcasters should be held to a
certain standard. Other critics of the bill said that in rural
communities with limited TV access, granting a religious group the
sole public TV license could be offensive to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those television stations are meant to serve the
non-commercial educational needs for the entire community,'' Markey
said.

   WASHINGTON _ A bruising battle for Hispanic voters heats up as
Democrats launch a national advertising campaign featuring Vice
President Al Gore speaking Spanish and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
touts his outreach efforts to reach Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive presidential nominees for the Republican and
Democratic parties are scheduled to address Hispanics at several
national conventions over the next two weeks to outline their
proposals on education, health care, taxes and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic community has emerged as a powerful voting bloc
in this year's presidential campaign and our political influence is
expected to play a decisive role in key battleground states,'' said
Rick Dovalina, national president of the League of United Latin
American Citizens (LULAC).
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are scheduled to speak during LULAC's 71st annual
National Convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also will speak to the annual conference of the
National Council of La Raza, in San Diego, over the July 4th
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made dramatic inroads into traditional Democratic
voting constituencies to post a slim lead over Gore in several
national public opinion polls. The Republican governor remains
popular among Hispanics in his home state, as well as with
GOP-leaning Cuban-Americans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is making an unprecedented effort to reach out
to Hispanics throughout America,'' said Sonia Colin, a Bush
spokeswoman. ``His compassionate conservative message ... is
resonating with the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual members of the executive board of LULAC-Florida
endorsed Bush this past weekend. Bush's brother Jeb is the
Republican governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Wilkes, LULAC executive director in Washington, clarified
that while individual members may issue support, the national group
does not endorse candidates for any elective office and will not
officially support Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never endorsed a candidate,'' Wilkes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, remains the overwhelming favorite among
Hispanic voters in California, a key state for a Democratic
presidential victory this fall and a state where he leads Bush by
double-digit margins in most public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also is rebounding among Latino voters
nationally, recovering from a 9 percentage-point deficit to a 12
percentage-point lead over Bush, according to a bipartisan
Voter.com-Battleground 2000 survey released in May.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll earlier this month showed Bush with a
slim lead nationally, but with Gore doing well with minority voters
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has made gains among independent voters and women and he
is improving among black and Hispanic voters despite the fact that
Bush has enjoyed a few very good weeks on the campaign trail,''
pollster John Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize, the Democratic National Convention launched issue
ads in Spanish, touting the party and Gore's proposals to raise
educational standards, expand children's health care, enhance
Social Security and secure Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll fight to protect Social Security and Medicare,'' Gore
says in Spanish in one of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is featured prominently in the 30-second issue ads, that
begin with a narrator who says: ``Al Gore and the Democrats, we can
count on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads began running Tuesday on television in Tampa, Orlando,
Milwaukee, Chicago and Albuquerque. The ads will run for an
indefinite period of time, said Dagoberto Vega, a DNC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign ran Spanish-language ads before the California
primary and has recruited campaign help from prominent Hispanics in
key states to win the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has run Spanish-language ads, produced by Lionel Sosa
of San Antonio. The Republican National Committee has cut its own
commercials produced by Frank Guerra, also of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   To drive the diversity point further, George P. Bush, the nephew
of the candidate and son of Jeb Bush and his Mexican-born wife
Columba, has hit the campaign trial in support of his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rice University graduate appears in several bilingual
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up 13 percent of the population, but will account
for 20 percent of the population in 2025, according to Census
Bureau projections.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos living in the United States are concentrated in nine
states: California, Texas, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona,
New Mexico and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Dovalina said LULAC members will be listening to the candidates'
vision for the future next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be listening intently to learn how they propose to
help Hispanic Americans enjoy the fullest possible range of
economic wealth, political empowerment and civil rights in our
increasingly diverse society,'' Dovalina said.

MICROSOFT JUDGE ASKS HIGH COURT TO TAKE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The massive federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. is
heading directly to the US Supreme Court, if US District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson asked the high court Tuesday to take up the case
directly, rather than allow it to wend its way through the federal
appeals process. Early this month, Jackson ordered that Microsoft
be broken up into two separate companies to halt predatory business
practices based on Microsoft's monopoly in desktop operating system
software; Microsoft plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the judge may be bad news for Microsoft, which
previously won a major victory over Jackson at the appeals level.
But Jackson also gave Microsoft a break by delaying a set of
interim sanctions against the company that were supposed to go into
effect prior to the breakup. As a result, Microsoft can continue
doing business as usual until the case is finally resolved. And
there's no guarantee the Supreme Court will accede to Jackson's
request and take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray praised Jackson's decision to
hold off on sanctions. ``It will allow the appeal to go forward
promptly,'' Murray said, ``but it'll prevent unnecessary disruption
to consumers and the industry and Microsoft while the appeal goes
forward.'' Murray shrugged off Jackson's expedited appeal, saying
that the move was expected.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department, which along with 19 state attorneys
general filed the antitrust suit against Microsoft, issued a
statement praising Jackson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision affirms the Department's position that a quick
and effective remedy is necessary to resolve this significant
case...'' the statement said. ``The sooner a meaningful remedy is
in place, the better it will be for consumers and the marketplace
by providing increased innovation, more choices and better
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Justice Department added that Jackson's decision to
stay his interim sanctions against Microsoft further demonstrated
the need to resolve the case as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson invoked the 1974 Antitrust Expediting Act, a law that
permits the appeal of certain cases from the district court level
to the Supreme Court if they involve issues of national importance.
The law has only been used twice before, and both instances
involved the long-runninc case that resulted in the 1984 breakup of
the AT&AMP;T telephone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, which favors a breakup of Microsoft, said it was
impossible to predict whether the Supreme Court would agree to hear
the case. But he said that the court might be impressed by the
importance of the matter, and by the fact that the Expediting Act
is so rarely invoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use it sparingly, and the court is inclined to give some
weight to the fact that it's only done occasionally,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Rule, who headed the US Justice Department's
antitrust division in the 1980s and works as a Microsoft
consultant, said the high court might be put off by the complexity
of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally every substantive antitrust issue that the court
addressed in its conclusions of law will be challenged,'' said
Rule. And given the thousands of pages of testimony and exhibits
involved, the Supreme Court might prefer to let the appeals court
do the heavy lifting, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials have said they expect to win the case on
appeal, and their confidence has some basis in history. In June
1998, the DC Court of Appeals overturned an injunction from Jackson
that barred Microsoft from including an Internet browser in every
copy of its Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had concluded that the inclusion of the browser was a
tactic intended to crush rival browser maker Netscape
Communications Corp., which has since been acquired by America
Online Inc. But the appeals court held that Microsoft had a right
to add new features to its software, even if the company harmed a
rival in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is hoping it will get an equally sympathetic response
from the appeals court this time. But company spokesman Mark Murray
said the company expects to win no matter where the appeal is
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said throughout this case that we're confident that
the facts and the law are on our side,'' he said, ``regardless of
whether the case is heard in the appeals court or the Supreme Court
or both.''

LIVE ON MOSCOW TV: QUIZ A TYCOON ABOUT HIS ARREST
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The owner of Russia's largest independent media
conglomerate appeared on his NTV network today in a live call-in
show and charged that he was arrested and jailed last week at the
behest of President Vladimir V. Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that Putin knew,'' said the media owner, Vladimir
Gusinsky. ``Moreover, the decision was taken personally by Mr.
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was detained last week on charges of embezzling state
property and was thrown into a Moscow jail. Following complaints
from Russian tycoons, journalists and American officials that the
arrest was politically motivated, he was released after three days
and restricted to Moscow, pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has insisted he had no advance knowledge of the arrest, an
assertion few political experts seem to accept. And Tuesday night
Gusinsky used his television program for two hours as a prime-time
forum on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Leading pundits and politicians, including those who support
Putin and the chief ideologist for the Communist Party, joined the
fray. Viewers called in with their questions, not all of them
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Some wanted to know how Gusinsky had made his fortune and
suggested that the media tycoon, a Jew who holds Israeli as well as
Russian citizenship, managed to get out of prison only because of
the clout of the Jewish lobby. But there was also a female caller
from Minsk, the capital of autocratic Belarus, who cast Gusinsky's
case as part of a broader struggle for civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give in, and keep up the struggle,'' she said before
abruptly hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky quipped that the call lasted less than 30 seconds and
thus was hard for security forces to track.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the nation's only independent television network
and several publications, Gusinsky has often been in the spotlight,
but never as starkly as he was Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A 47-year-old former theatrical director, he is one of a small
group of tycoons who have acquired enormous influence since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky acknowledged tonight that he had deviated from the
principle of journalistic objectivity and used his company, Media
Most, to help re-elect President Boris Yeltsin in 1996. He said he
now regretted that role, which he said had led to a
quasi-autocratic government of aides intent on preserving their own
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed a serious error in 1996,'' Gusinsky said. ``In
1996, we gave birth to a small monster which has since grown into
the present system.''
</P>
<P>
   The injustice of the current system, he insisted, was driven
home to him during his brief stay in the Butyrskaya jail, where he
encountered inmates who had spent months in jail on the flimsy
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was held in preventative detention for several days
before he was charged, and sought to challenge the legality of his
arrest today in court. But a Moscow court threw out his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While his view of Putin's role is widely shared in the media,
the tycoon did not say how he had determined that the president was
behind his arrest. He also said he was convinced that Alexander
Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, did not have advance
knowledge of his detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that does not relieve him of his responsibility,''
Gusinsky added.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions seemed to have more to do with Gusinsky than with
Putin. Viewers wanted to know, for instance, whether it was
possible to be both rich and honest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The network's own anchor, Yevgeny Kiselyov, asked Gusinsky to
explain why he held Israeli citizenship, why his family lived
abroad and why he paid personal income tax in Gibraltar, questions
which appeared to be intended to give the media tycoon an
opportunity to explain his life to the Russian public.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the power elite feared that Gusinsky's arrest
might signal a broader crackdown, Putin continues to be popular
with much of the public, which likes his vision of a strong state.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist, Alexander Minkin, said much of the country
seemed to perceive the case differently than Moscow-based
opinion-makers did. That seemed to be underscored by a questioner
who suggested that the media tycoon was part of a system of corrupt
insider deals.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Gusinsky noted the gains Russia has made in free
speech and press freedom _ a development this media empire has
contributed to substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not asking for sympathy,'' he said. ``But the fact that
you could ask that question without ending up on the prison bunks
where I was indicates that things have improved.''

INC. MAGAZINE, WEB SITE MAY BE NEAR $200M SALE

<P>
   BOSTON _ Another Boston-based institution is close to being sold
as New York-based executives from Bertelsmann AG's Gruner &AMP; Jahr
publishing unit hammer out final details on the purchase of Inc.
magazine and its Web site for a reported $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Inc. founder Bernard Goldhirsh had put the business magazine and
other assets on the block earlier this year, after 20 years of
publishing a successful journal for small business owners and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's circulation is about 660,000, though in recent
years Inc. has battled to maintain advertising as competitors
jumped in to copy the model and to narrow the targeted audience to
Internet entrepreneurs. The conferences and Web site side of the
business also has been on a plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Gruner &AMP; Jahr publishes McCall's, Family Circle, Parents,
Fitness, and YM, a teen title. The acquisition of Inc., and its
advertising possibilities in the technology and business sector,
will widen the magazine unit's horizons considerably. It would be
the first acquisition under Daniel Brewster, formerly head of
American Express publishing, who became chief executive of Gruner &AMP;
Jahr earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders were believed to be the investing arm of New
York investment bank Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates of New York, home
to Joel Novak, formerly the number two man at the Goldhirsh Group,
owner of Inc.; and Time Warner's Time Inc. publishing unit,
publisher of Fortune, Fortune Small Business and most recently
eCompany Now. Goldman, Sachs Group Inc. was hired to handle the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhirsh, who reportedly became interested in selling Inc.
after his wife died and his own health started to fail, is well
regarded in business and publishing circles and known for founding
Sail magazine, which contained more how-to information than the
rival Yachting. Similarly, at its debut two decades ago, Inc.
provided more practical information for small business owners and
entrepreneurs than Fortune, Forbes and Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine and Web site business is based in Boston's
Charlestown section, near the waterfront.

INTIMATE VIEW OF THE DEATH HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ ``Our children are the apple of our eye, our
pride and most precious fortune, love them with all your heart and
always protect them,'' Julius Rosenberg, convicted of espionage and
condemned to death, wrote in a letter to one of his lawyers from
Sing Sing on June 19, 1953, just hours before his execution. The
handwriting is shaky with frantic crossings out.
</P>
<P>
   He also paid tribute to his wife, Ethel, who was to be executed
along with him. ``Words fail me when I attempt to tell of the
nobility and grandeur of my life's companion, my sweet and devoted
wife. Ours is a great love and wonderful relationship, it has made
my life full and rich.''
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of Rosenberg's letter is on view in ``Condemned,''
an unusually intimate and powerful exhibition about Sing Sing's
death row that recently opened at Time and Space Limited, an arts
center in Hudson, in Columbia County about 75 miles north of the
prison site at Ossining.
</P>
<P>
   There is an inventory of Ethel's possessions at the time of her
death: dainty, feminine things; deodorant; stockings; a shoebox of
letters from her children. There is her last letter to the
children: ``Dearest Sweethearts, my most precious children,'' she
writes. ``We press you close and kiss you with all our strength,
lovingly Daddy and Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lining the stark white walls of the exhibition at Time and Space
are mug shots of some 130 people who were executed at Sing Sing
Correctional Facility, photocopies of their final letters to loved
ones, autopsy reports, the menu for a last meal, and other
memorabilia. Between 1891 and 1963, the year of the last legal
execution in New York State, more people _ 614 _ were executed at
Sing Sing than at any other prison. For years hence there were no
executions because of legal challenges and the opposition of two
governors, Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo. In 1995, Gov. George
E. Pataki signed legislation reinstating capital punishment, but no
one has yet been executed under that law.
</P>
<P>
   Sing Sing has long held an almost mythological place in American
culture. Many books have been written about the prison and many
movies have been set there, including ``20,000 Years in Sing Sing''
and ``Each Dawn I Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the notorious people who met death there were Louis
(Lepke) Buchalter, the boss of the Brooklyn gang Murder Inc., which
was believed to be responsible for more than 20 murders. He was
convicted of ordering the shooting of a garment trucker.
</P>
<P>
   Also executed there were Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez, the
so-called Lonely Hearts Killers. Fernandez met Beck, a nurse,
through a pen pal club for the lovelorn, the exhibition notes.
During the 1940s and '50s, the pair made headlines for swindling
lonely women, and they were eventually condemned for murdering a
woman with a hammer. Beck told prison officials when she arrived at
Sing Sing that crime was ``something I got into. I had no
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crimes are particularly gruesome. Arthur Johnson,
21, was convicted of strangling and raping a 15-year-old girl.
Edward Haight was convicted of murdering two girls, 6 and 8. It is
recounted under his mug shot that he told prison officials, ``I
don't know why I did it.'' Frederick Wood, a salesman, was accused
of killing one man with a bottle, another with a shovel. A prison
official noted, the exhibition label relates, that Wood said ``he
hates homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   During sentencing procedures, the relatives of crime victims are
often given an opportunity to describe their loss to the court in
emotionally gripping ways. But this exhibition focuses on the
private emotions of some who were sent to the chair at Sing Sing
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was organized by Scott Christianson, former
deputy director of parole operations for New York State, who
resigned from his job in 1995 in opposition to reinstitution of the
death penalty. He is now director of the New York Death Penalty
Documentation Project, an effort to gather the official record
regarding the state's administration of capital punishment. In
assembling the show, Christian drew on research for his book
``Condemned,'' published in March by New York University Press.
</P>
<P>
   The records on which the exhibition is based were stored at Sing
Sing and inaccessible to outsiders until 1977, when they went to
the New York State Archives in Albany. After being catalogued, they
were made available to Christianson in 1997 under the state's
Freedom of Information law. Now that the death penalty is legal
again in New York, Christianson said, ``I thought it was even more
important for people to have an opportunity to view this reality
they've ignored or not gotten access to.''
</P>
<P>
   Many letters in the exhibition are intimate, almost naked in
their emotion. ``There is no definition in the law as to what
constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy,'' said James D.
Folts, supervisor of reference services for the New York State
Archives, in explaining why the records were released to
Christianson.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes details about executions written by
prison officials in a matter-of-fact style.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rosenbergs went to the electric chair, the executioner
penciled in the time and the duration of the event on an index
card, a photograph of which is also in the exhibit: ``Julius
Rosenberg, SSP (NU)110-649. Time in: 8:04, Time Out: 8:06}. Amps
8.'' A record of Ethel's death: `` Time In: 8:11{, Time Out 8:16.''
Ethel required 6{ amps. But it took several doses of electricity to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition continues through July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The records cover roughly 20 percent of the executions at Sing
Sing. ``I would hope the state could provide detailed records that
could be a basis for a challenge in the Supreme Court, if it is
shown that the death penalty was administered in an arbitrary or
capricious or racist way,'' Christianson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that the documents could be used to challenge
the death penalty in court by substantiating the argument that a
disproportionate number of blacks are executed.

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers achieve something like
perfect baroque crudity with ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' their latest
comedy about all things that the human body can drip, ooze or
secrete.
</P>
<P>
   Moreso than in the comparatively restrained ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,''
the zany comic dynamo and the writing-directing siblings prove that
their sickest sensiblities were made for one another. In
``Irene,''In ``Irene,'' they have crafted a densely packed circus
of scattershot insults, dirty jokes and bruising slapstick that is
often infernally hilarious _ and, yes, well out in front,
imagination- and daring-wise, of most competitors in the offensive
comedy sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it's a pleasure to report that Carrey's return
to full- throttled wackiness is among his best performances ever,
``Irene'' falls short of the giddy heights the Farrellys hit in
their last directing effort, ``There's Something About Mary.'' That
film did the impossible _ or at least, so far, unrepeatable _ for
this subgenre. It actually populated its outlandish gagscapes with
people you really believed could exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irene'' is not designed to pull off anything that difficult.
It's more purely a farce, with a knockabout road movie structure
that lends itself more to incident than character development. And
with Carrey playing two outsized caricatures in this one, there
ain't much room _ nor need _ for subtle behavioral niceties.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Carrey fits some remarkably understated effects in
the margins of all the foaming lunacy. As you're probably aware, he
pays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality
disorder. The cop's usual persona, kind but wimpy Charlie
Baileygates, keeps losing control to a vengeful Id monster that
calls himself Hank, hisses like Clint Eastwood at his most
intimdating and gets into all kinds of psychic and physical
trouble. Hank's nasty jags are vintage, inspired Carrey, but some
of the actor's Jekyll-to-Hyde transitions, as well as a scene or
two when he's operating through several layers of deception, have a
quiet canniness that's as complex and accomplished as anything he's
ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Hank and Charlie both fall in love with Renee Zellweger's Irene,
whom the entity escorts to answer an outstanding warrant in upstate
New York. The film's nonplot, which the Farrellys co-wrote with
childhood pal Mike Cerrone, has something to do with crooked cops
and land developers. But it's really just an excuse for Carrey and
the Farrellys to pull outrageous stunts against deceptively bucolic
backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible things are done to a cow, a chicken, a new mother,
innocent members of the law enforcement industry, young children
and a resilient albino fellow named, tastefully, Whitey (played by
droll newcomer Michael Bowman). Everybody is made merciless fun of,
including the game Zellweger's hard-pressed straightwoman, but no
one is mortified more frequently or severely than Carrey's
characters. Taking the sadomasochistic element that's always been
part of his comedy to the limit, Carrey violates and subjects
himself to every conceivable humiliation _ and a few most of us
mere mortals have thankfully never thought of.
</P>
<P>
   I keep coming back to Carrey's performance because it is that
unforgettably extreme. But even with all the effort he puts in, he
almost loses the film's comedy spotlight to three latter day
Stooges. Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon play _
are you ready for this? _ the three genius triplets Charlie's
runaway wife had with an African- American dwarf, whom he's
selflessly raised as his own. Somehow, though, the three hefty sons
talk trashier than Tupac; you've never heard atomic theory debated
quite the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   It's all utterly inexcusable. And uproarious. These guys have
such exuberant energy and fluid group timing that their foulmouthed
antics rise to the level of verbal ballet. Of course, it's also
disgusting, demented and evidence, if you want it to be, that civil
society is greatly endangered if not already dead and buried.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what all of ``Me, Myself and Irene'' is like. You can
hold your nose or laugh about it . . . but really, there's only one
viable option.
</P>

HUDSON, N.Y.: are executed.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sing Sing prison was built in 1825. The name comes from a Native
American tribe known as ``Sint Sinck,'' or ``stone upon stone,''
referring to the rocky terrain. An engraving from Harper's magazine
from the 1870s shows an idealized view of the prison as a
self-contained universe, with a hospital and sanitation facilities,
a nursery and a women's prison. There is a photograph of the ornate
warden's office with its wood paneling and coffered ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Another photograph shows a ``torture chair,'' as some convicts
referred to it, with a blindfolded and shackled prisoner. Sitting
upon it, the inmate was doused with water. Some drowned or died
from exposure, Christianson said. By the 1830s whippings were so
common at the prison that Sing Sing became known as a
``catocracy,'' after the cat o' nine tails.
</P>
<P>
   The first electric chair was built around 1889 and was designed
in the laboratory of Thomas Edison. Edison, an advocate of direct
current, was competing with George Westinghouse, who favored
alternating current. Edison suggested using Westinghouse's
alternating current for the electric chair to dramatize how
dangerous his rival's method could be for everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   The first execution by electric chair at Sing Sing took place in
1891. From 1920 to 1941, the prison's warden was Lewis E. Lawes,
who was an opponent of capital punishment. But he presided over 303
executions. The exhibition the well-known photograph of the
execution of Ruth Snyder in 1928, taken by a Daily News reporter
with a hidden camera, in which her body seems to shake with a
tremendous force.
</P>
<P>
   Death was not always instantaneous, Christianson pointed out,
and it sometimes required repeated administrations of electricity.
Sometimes the condemned person caught fire. There was debate about
whether death was caused by the electricity or by the autopsy that
quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   One autopsy report from 1951 in the exhibition notes: ``The
cerebellum seen from the posterior surfaces is opaque and grayish
in color. It has a boiled appearance. The whole brain is
uncomfortably warm to the touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my contention that one of the reasons legal autopsies
were made a requirement was not only an attempt to determine the
nature of death, but also to insure death,'' Christianson said.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of escapes from death row, a new death house was
built in 1920. It was called by The New York Times ``the most
impregnable penal institution in the world,'' and it began
executions in 1922. The death house had cells, an execution
chamber, a hospital, and an office for the ``Lunacy Commission,''
where prisoners were examined to see if they were sane when they
committed their crime. Radiating out from the execution chamber
were six staging areas, known as ``the Dance Hall.'' Adjoining the
chamber was a room where the executioner was concealed.
</P>
<P>
   The mug shots at Time and Space were taken when the condemned
arrived at the prison. Many prisoners wear the suits and ties they
had on for their sentencing in court. There is a mix of expressions
on the faces: panic, defiance, bewilderment. Most are young, some
only 17, like Norman Roye, a smooth-faced black youth with a
sorrowful look. Under the photo is his date of birth and the crime
of which he was convicted, strangling an old woman. He claimed
innocence and was executed on Jan. 9, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   There are letters from prisoners begging for mercy. Helen
Fowler, 37 and a mother of five, convicted of murder, wrote a
rambling letter to Lt. Gov. Hanley: ``I have a little boy, 10; one,
5; a girl of 14; one, 18; one, 20; a grandchild.'' She could not
hear the testimony at her trial, she said, because she was partly
deaf. According to the prosecutor, someone else actually killed the
victim. Fowler was convicted because she helped dispose of the
body. She was executed in November 1944.
</P>
<P>
   In one case a man was executed despite the last-minute plea of
his co-defendant that he was innocent. Two Chinese men, Lew York
Hing and Yun Tieh Li, were accused of killing a woman during a
robbery. But in a letter to Chief Justice Lehman, Yun Tieh Li wrote
that Lew York Hing ``had nothing to do with this murder. The one
who Do the killing in this case is `me and Eddie,''' a reference to
an unknown third person. Still, both Yun Tieh Li and Lew York Hing
were executed in August 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners were mentally disabled or illiterate. A
psychiatrist described Oliver Little, 19, a laborer, convicted of
stabbing a man to death, as ``mentally defective, borderline
level.'' Yet the execution was legal.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour of death approached, the prisoners were entitled to
choose their final meal. Prisoner No. 123-881, Henry Flakes, asked
for barbecued chicken and strawberry shortcake with whipped cream.
Many prisoners sat down to write a last letter. For some it
appeared to be a psychological imperative, a spiritual ritual that
had a cleansing effect. Frank Newman, convicted of murdering his
wife, had claimed temporary insanity and acute alcoholism. ``I do
not believe I could describe how much I despise myself for this
terrible thing,'' he wrote to his sons in August 1956, the day
before he died. ``I loved Mother. I pray to God to forgive me and
that my boys will try to soften the terrible hatred you have for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In another letter, from Jan. 14, 1960, Ivory Mason, convicted of
shooting a woman, wrote to his mother: ``Just a few lines to let
you hear from me as this will be my last letter to you.'' When
Mason arrived at Sing Sing, he was illiterate but later learned to
read and write. ``I must tarry on to my maker from which I come.
But don't worry mother. I have made my peace with God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And mother since you did not come to see me,'' he continued,
``I forgive you. I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason ended with a plea for forgiveness: ``Sorry if I cause you
any heart ache and pains if so please forgive me. So I will close
and until we meet beyond the river it is well remembered I were
your Son.''

JITTERS OVER PROFIT REPORTS PUSH DOW SHARPLY LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Tuesday as concerns about corporate
profit growth hurt old-line manufacturing concerns even as
enthusiasm about the earnings prospects for technology companies
continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of many old economy
names, fell 122.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,435.16. The
decline, which was led by General Motors and Honeywell, wiped out
Monday's 108.54-point advance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq composite index rose for a fourth consecutive
session. Fueled by gains in stocks like Intel, Yahoo and Apple
Computer, the index gained 23.53, or 0.6 percent, to 4,013.36. It
was the first time in more than two months that the Nasdaq has
closed above 4,000. The index remains far below its March 10 record
of 5,048.62. But with its recent recovery, the index is now down
just 1.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be impressed by the continued recovery of
technology stocks, both large and small cap, and the deterioration
of the old economy issues,'' said James Paulson, chief investment
officer at Wells Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is still a sense we are caught in a box: either the
economy is slowing much faster than anyone expects, which is a
negative, or the Fed is not finished tightening because the economy
is still growing strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 10.05, or 0.7
percent, to 1,475.95, as weakness in stocks like Tyco International
and Cisco Systems more than offset gains in America Online, Time
Warner and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, Oracle, the world's biggest maker of
database software, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall
Street's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the results, the stock, which closed Tuesday at 86 3/64,
up 3/64, fell after hours to as low as 83.
</P>
<P>
   Bad earnings news hurt GM after the automaker said its North
American operations would miss profit margin goals because of
declining car prices. And Honeywell fell sharply for a second day
after saying earnings would fall short of estimates.
</P>
<P>
   GM slumped 2 13/16, to 62 1/16. Honeywell dropped 3~, to a
52-week low of 36 3/8. The last two trading sessions, Honeywell's
stock price has fallen more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement from GM pulled down the other automakers. Ford
Motor fell 1 7/8, to 43, and DaimlerChrysler lost 1 1/16, to 54
3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings preannouncements have been holding the market back,''
said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have not had a major technology bellwether preannounce
an earnings shortfall, and that has allowed the Nasdaq to resume
its leadership role. As we muddle our way through to earnings
season, there is room on the upside, even if the Federal Reserve
Board raises short-term interest rates by one-quarter of a
percentage point.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Micron Technology were among the technology stocks
that helped lead the group's advance. Intel, which soared on
Monday, gained an additional 1 13/16 Tuesday, to close at 138 5/16.
And Micron rose 9, to 89].
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks did better on unexpected strength in
second-quarter earnings from Goldman Sachs, whose results beat Wall
Street expectations. After an early rally, its shares closed at 89,
down 2|. But the results helped push up Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter's stock 2[, to 86 9/16. And Merrill Lynch rose 3{, to 122.

`CHICKEN RUN': FLYING THE COOP WITH PLENTY OF YOLKS AND YUKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run,'' the first full-length feature from Aardman
Animation, makes brainy use of Mel Gibson. It parodies Gibson's
inane heroics in giving him a loud loose-cannon entrance.
</P>
<P>
   He's the voice of Rocky the Flying Rooster, and he comes soaring
into Tweedy's farm, where a grim set of henhouses look just like
barracks and the residents, led by the ... well, plucky Ginger
(Julia Sawalha), are constantly trying to escape. Ginger is,
anyway, and she has just been released again from the Tweedy
version of solitary confinement when Rocky, arms flailing and
screaming in an unusually uncomfortable version of flight, hits the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   He promises Ginger and her friends that he'll teach them to fly
and save them from a life of squeezing out eggs for the awful
Tweedy (Miranda Richardson).
</P>
<P>
   Based on the sympathy that ``Chicken Run'' will engender for
chickens, it's probably good that McDonald's doesn't have a
promotional tie-in. The sight of youngsters sobbing over Chicken
McNuggets in a Happy Meal while their parents try to explain the
food chain wouldn't be good for anybody. ``Chicken Run'' is,
though, because like other efforts from the directors Nick Park
(``Wallace and Gromit'' and ``Creature Comforts,'' the 1989 Academy
Award-winning short) and Peter Lord, who also produced this film,
it flies in the face of brightly colored, blandly energetic
song-filled animated features.
</P>
<P>
   There's one forgettable song sequence, but like the other
Aardman pieces that Park has directed, ```Chicken Run'' has that
yearning for home that's at the heart of all good fables. There's a
wistful calm in the gray skies of England, where all of Park's work
is set, and his characters just want a comfortable place to rest
their heads. Ginger dreams of lounging on grass instead of digging
in the dirt in the Tweedy yards. (In the Wallace and Gromit shorts,
Gromit, the poor thinking man's pooch, is constantly in danger of
being tossed out of his home.)
</P>
<P>
   Visually as depressively earth-toned as ``Stalag 17'' (which is
also parodied in the film), the world created by Park and Lord will
hypnotize the young who may have had a full dose of antic
full-length cartoons. (It assumes that children are up for
animation a little darker in spirit than what they're usually fed.)
The movie rewards them for their rapt, quiet attention, and its use
of modeled latex figures instead of drawn animation makes ``Chicken
Run'' more realistic and far more vigorously dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The film is packed with the kind of detail that adults will
like, too, with visual and verbal jokes that make references
ranging from ``Modern Times'' to ``Star Trek.'' When the hens,
following Rocky's daft flight instructions, are launched into the
air, Fetcher (Phil Daniels), one of the farm's hustler mice, moans,
``It's raining hen.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many directors of animation who make such effective
use of a Dickensian landscape and have Park's ability to wrest
laughs from situations that lean toward the tragic. Park and Lord
use several motifs of the Wallace and Gromit shorts, including some
unwieldy, potentially deadly machinery: Tweedy has installed a
chicken pie machine because egg production isn't bringing in the
kind of revenue stream she wants.
</P>
<P>
   Those expecting a breakthrough in animation storytelling may be
a little disappointed, though. The Dreamworks influence has made
``Chicken Run'' a little safe; the Wallace and Gromit pictures
provided more of an emotional roller coaster. The presence of
Gibson, even though he lends himself to satirizing his persona,
provides comfort.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the more subversive Nick Park you want or are unfamiliar
with, seek out the Wallace and Gromit films, all of which are
available and should be seen. There are other notable Aardman
projects as well, including the fabulous and rambunctious ``Rex the
Runt'' shorts, which can be found on the Atomfilms.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Chicken Run'' is by no means a letdown. It's immensely
satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film. Park and Lord
brilliantly integrate everyday objects into the story.
</P>
<P>
   This briskly paced epic _ not a minute is wasted _ uses their
satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority,
exemplified here in a cranky former RAF rooster, Fowler (Benjamin
Whitrow). The directors have transferred all the deftness and
talent of their shorter films into an artful big screen
realization.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger is ingenious and ambitious, and for a change the movie
gives children a quick-thinking heroine who eventually realizes
that she's responsible for her future.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ``Chicken Run'' doesn't try to cram messages of
uplift down its audience's gullet. It's a great eggscape from
banality.

COMMENTARY: THE PIG IN THE PYTHON: DEMOGRAPHY AND DEMAGOGUERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., the word (asterisk), 10th graf, should be replaced by the
symbol) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demographers describe the baby-boom generation as ``the pig in
the python'': a huge bulge in an otherwise skinny age distribution,
gradually moving down the distribution as the boomers age.
</P>
<P>
   As the pig's snout approaches the python's nether regions, it
poses two distinct policy problems: a narrow ``financial'' problem
and a broader ``real'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate in the presidential campaign doesn't seem to be
about either.
</P>
<P>
   The ``financial'' problem is how to pay for Social Security.
This problem is a legacy of Social Security's pay-as-you-go past:
because the baby boomers' contributions were used to provide
generous benefits to earlier generations, there isn't enough money
in the system to pay the benefits promised to the boomers
themselves. The good news is that solving this financial problem
isn't all that difficult. Despite the apocalyptic rhetoric you
sometimes hear, affordable injections of money would allow the
system to run untroubled for at least 50 more years. It's just a
matter of facing up to facts.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real'' problem is that in a few decades, the age
distribution of the United States as a whole will look like that of
Florida today. How will a relatively small number of workers be
able to produce enough both to live well themselves and to provide
the huge population of retirees with the standard of living it
expects?
</P>
<P>
   This problem is much harder to solve. The only answer _ other
than allowing large-scale immigration _ is to make tomorrow's
workers as productive as possible. We can hope for a technological
fix; with smart enough machines, who needs workers? But a
responsible government would meanwhile try to ensure that national
savings _ public plus private _ are high, so that future workers
are well equipped with capital and not burdened with large foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the campaign seems to be revolving around a quite
different issue: the perception that Americans get too low a return
on their contributions to Social Security. As I've explained in
earlier columns, the implicit return on Social Security
contributions is low only because today's workers are in effect
being taxed to pay the system's debts from the past. You may not
like that, just as you may not like the fact that 15 percent of
your federal tax dollar goes to pay interest on a debt mainly run
up in the '80s and early '90s. But in both cases the debts are a
fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the salesmanship surrounding George W. Bush's Social
Security plan is all about the meaningless contrast between the
returns that an unburdened individual can get on investments and
the implicit return that a very-much-burdened Social Security
system can offer. And Al Gore's new plan for subsidized retirement
accounts also isn't about the real problems; it's a response to
that salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Gore's plan could have been worse. It won't break the
budget; it probably will encourage somewhat more private saving.
And, like Social Security itself, it will be progressive _ that is,
it will tend to narrow disparities in wealth.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to give Gore some points for honesty. The details
of his plan are fully spelled out; he has also come clean about how
he will extend the life of the Social Security system _ namely, by
transferring money over from the general budget. By contrast, Bush
has said nothing about how much he plans to reduce benefits in
return for allowing workers to invest their contributions
elsewhere, let alone how he will deal with the overhang of
obligations from the past. All he offers are magic asterisks:
``(asterisk)details to be provided later.''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that if and when Bush finally does provide the
details, the size of the proposed benefit cuts will start a
political firestorm, forcing him to use general revenue to rescue
Social Security after all. But that won't happen until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   And where will the money come from? Remember that Bush is also
proposing huge tax cuts. Aside from eliminating a surplus that
might have been used to help Social Security, those cuts will
encourage the nation as a whole to consume more and save less,
exactly the opposite of what an aging society should be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the pig is still in the python, inching inexorably
toward its destiny. Is anyone paying attention?

LAWYERS SPAR OVER CULPABILITY AT DAVIDIAN COMPOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DICK J. REAVIS  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Militant followers of David Koresh may have set
one of the three fires that are blamed in the deaths of 74
residents of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993, an attorney for
Davidian survivors told a packed courtroom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead plaintiffs attorney in the wrongful death
suit being brought against the federal government, declared in his
opening remarks that, ``Once the building was on fire, it appears
that a few persons in the gymnasium area started a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They believed that it would protect them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell did not elaborate on his theory about the blaze,
although his comments set him at odds with other plaintiffs
attorneys, who do not agree that Davidians set any of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government was responsible for everything that happened
here,'' former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark told the court.
Clark is representing a group of adult Davidians who have remained
loyal to the faith.
</P>
<P>
   During his opening argument for the defense, U.S. attorney
Michael Bradford of Beaumont, Texas, maintained that the Davidians
``didn't just start one of those fires, they started all of the
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs and defense attorneys outlined contrasting scenarios
for the 1993 events during separate 55-minute presentations Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell began by showing jurors photos and a videotape of the 25
children who died during the 1993 standoff. He argued that during
the initial raid on Feb. 28, government agents fired
indiscriminately at the Davidian residence hall and worship center,
endangering unarmed women and children. Cadell also argued that
agents fired pyrotechnic tear-gas rounds into the building April
19, the day of the fire, and contributed to the blaze by attempting
to demolish the building.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents were also negligent, he charged, in failing to
develop a plan for combating any fire that might develop at the
Davidian compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about truth and responsibility, truth about what
happened at (the compound) and responsibility for it,'' the
plaintiffs attorney told the jury of four women and three men.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford countered that on Feb. 28, during the initial raid,
federal agents deployed ``cover fire,'' instead of firing
indiscriminately, as Caddell alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire ``was in defense of their lives,'' Bradford said,
pointing out that four ATF agents were killed in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford denied that any devices capable of starting a blaze
were fired into the Davidian compound on April 19. He said that the
destruction of its gymnasium, shortly before flames were spotted,
was a byproduct of attempts to penetrate the building with tear
gas.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents, in charge of federal operations at the time, did not
develop a firefighting plan because ``it was too dangerous to send
firemen into that situation,'' Bradford argued.
</P>
<P>
   Opening arguments concluded in the case before noon, and
following a short break, Caddell began to build the plaintiffs'
case with witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston lawyer's strategy is to show that adult males from
both the Davidian and federal camps needlessly endangered women and
children at the cult compound, bringing about the deaths of some 50
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he called three female witnesses, all of whom
testified that the windows to their rooms on the second floor _
where only women and children lived _ were shattered by gunshots
fired by ATF agents. All three witnesses exited the compound
several days before the April 19 fire. One of the witnesses,
Natalie Nobrega, now 18, told the court that during the shootout,
``All of my quilt coverings were just full of holes. If I had been
sleeping, I don't think that I'd be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobrega was 11 at the time. Her mother, Theresa, 48, died during
the April 19 fire.
</P>
<P>
   All three witnesses denied they were armed during the ATF raid.
They also denied seeing any women with guns. For witness Jaunessa
Wendell, that denial contradicted earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Feb. 28 events, Wendell, then 8 years old,
told a Texas Ranger that her mother, ``laid down, got a gun and
started firing.''
</P>
<P>
   She also told the Ranger that Tuesday's third female witness,
Rita Riddle, 42, had been armed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon she repudiated much of what she had said
during her childhood interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very scared at the time,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Jaydean, 34, was killed during the Feb. 28 gunfight;
her father, Mark, 40, died during the April 19 conflagration.

SPURNED SUDAN, LOOKING FOR FOREIGN SUPPORT, SAYS IT HAS CHANGED
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sudan wants to join a growing list of pariah
nations trying to create new images for themselves by engaging more
positively with the world, the Sudanese ambassador to the United
Nations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's immediate goals are ambitious. It is seeking African
support for a regional seat on the Security Council beginning next
year. It is also lining up international backing for a lifting of
sanctions imposed four years ago when Sudan was accused of
harboring suspects in an attempted assassination of President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Both intentions present problems for the United States, which
keeps Sudan on its list of nations supporting international
terrorism because, the Clinton administration says, the Sudanese
government maintains links with Osama bin Laden, the financier of
Islamic militancy.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that the United States has been working behind the
scenes to persuade other African nations to deny the Sudanese one
of the council's seats, which are rotated within regions. Some
African envoys say the Americans have suggested that if Sudan
withdraws its request for a seat, Washington may look more
favorably on other issues involving Sudan, though no promises have
been made about sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats and Sudan's ambassador, Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed
Erwa, deny that any direct talks have taken place between them. In
an interview, Erwa said that no deal would be possible because
Sudan would lose all credibility among Africans if it backed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not battling against the United States,'' Erwa said.
``Does the United States decide who goes to the Security Council or
not?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, Sudan's president, Omar Bashir, has taken steps
that demand a new look at Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Bashir has sidelined Hassan Turabi, a powerful
Islamic politician with whom he had shared power for years. The
move, other diplomats say, could be risky, because Turabi commanded
a significant following. The government has also made some gestures
toward negotiating an end to a destructive civil war with
Christians and African traditionalists in the south who have
refused to accept the Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. wants to see a change of behavior,'' Erwa said. ``We
think in Sudan there has been lots of change of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese, in a letter to the Security Council this month,
said that sanctions imposed in 1996, a year after the attack on
Mubarak, were no longer relevant because Sudan had reached an
agreement with Egypt, the aggrieved party, and Ethiopia, where the
attack took place. Both accepted Sudan's argument that the suspects
were no longer in Sudan, where they were believed to have hidden,
and that the government had tried to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say it will be hard for the United States to
indefinitely block a council resolution lifting sanctions because
they were applied largely on Egypt's behalf. The sanctions,
including diplomatic curbs on Sudanese officials abroad and an
embargo on Sudanese flights, were not strictly enforced, diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum in
August 1998, the strike was not related to United Nations sanctions
but was in retaliation for what Americans said were Sudanese links
to terrorists whom Washington held responsible for the bombing of
its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

A HAPPY GATHERING OF THE BALLETS RUSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday June 25)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Everyone kissed everyone else and the kisses were
wonderful to behold. People kissed on lecture platforms, in a hotel
lobby, at an art gallery, at receptions. There were delighted cries
of, ``My dear, I haven't seen you for 50 years!'' And the remark
was not hyperbole. Happy tears flowed like Champagne. Champagne
also flowed.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened at the Ballets Russes celebration, an
extraordinary event that took place here June 1-4. It honored the
three great companies with Ballets Russes in their names: Sergei
Diaghilev's pioneering Ballets Russes (1909-29) and the successor
troupes of Col. W. de Basil (1932-52) and Sergei Denham (1938-62).
Their achievements never fail to amaze. By producing works by
choreographers like Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine, Vaslav
Nijinsky, Bronislava Nijinska and George Balanchine and, later,
David Lichine, Frederick Ashton and Agnes de Mille, these
cosmopolitan companies of dancers of many nationalities
significantly altered our basic concepts of dance aesthetics. By
constantly touring the world, they also introduced thousands of
people to ballet. The first ballet company I ever saw was Denham's.
And I was hooked on dance.
</P>
<P>
   A Ballets Russes reunion committee had been planning a
get-together for almost three years without ever holding one.
Fortunately, the committee allied itself with two balletomanes:
Douglas Blair Turnbaugh, a New York-based representative of the
International Dance Council of Unesco, and Olga Guardia de Smoak,
president of the New Orleans International Ballet Conference. And,
miraculously, with the help of a band of devoted volunteers, the
celebration happened. It attracted students, dance fans and
scholars from North and South America, Europe, Australia and Japan,
and when dancers of the former Ballets Russes companies assembled
onstage, they numbered 65. Many of them also taught and lectured.
And all were voluble conversationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement was evident from the beginning, with people
scurrying to check in at the Sheraton Hotel, which, along with the
New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, was the site of most of
the events. There were little shrieks of delight that increased in
volume later that evening at the opening of an exhibition of
Ballets Russes memorabilia at the New Orleans Museum of Art. The
euphoria was infectious, and New Orleans residents who attended
events became as excited as the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   That did not surprise Adda Pourmel, a Ballets Russes dancer who
has settled here. ``All they need in this town is an excuse for a
party _ and the longer the better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marvelous presences at this party were the elegant
Irina Baronova, one of the legendary ``baby ballerinas'' of the
'30s (``Oh, how we all resented that name when we got older,'' she
recalled), and other ballerinas like Mia Slavenska, Nathalie
Krassovska, Tatiana Stepanova, Irina Borowska and Nina Novak.
Moscelyne Larkin, an American Indian ballerina from Oklahoma, was
there. So was Raven Wilkinson who, when she joined Denham's group
in 1956, became the first black dancer to perform with a company
that regularly toured America. The celebration also attracted Nini
Theilade, a Danish dancer of legendary radiance (she can be seen as
the lyrical first fairy in Max Reinhardt's 1935 film version of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream''). Unusual at the time, she was a ballet
dancer who was also interested in modern dance. Her hair has
grayed, but her vitality has not dimmed even though she has just
celebrated her 85th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The men present included premier danseurs like George Zoritch
and Alan Howard, and there was Marc Platt, who went on from the
Ballets Russes to a Broadway and Hollywood career, Robert Barnett,
who became the director of the Atlanta Ballet, and Robert Lindgren,
who founded the dance department at the innovative North Carolina
School of the Arts. Of course, no Ballets Russes assembly would be
complete without Frederic Franklin, a human perpetual-motion
machine who, at 86, keeps busy staging ballets and advising
companies everywhere. But he arrived late, for first he had to
portray Friar Laurence in American Ballet Theater's ``Romeo and
Juliet'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had stories to tell. There was the one about the Texas
tour when the dancers' train broke down and they were herded onto a
bus with a large hole in its floor, through which they could see
the road beneath them as they sped over it. Then there was the time
when the train was stuck for three days in a snowstorm in the
Canadian Rockies. On one bus tour, when the dancers felt a need to
limber up, the driver would stop at any flat field with a wire
fence around it. Holding onto the fence, the company would go
through its exercises before the eyes of inquisitive cows and
startled passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But this was also a serious and aesthetically provocative event.
There was a performance at which dancers from 12 companies
volunteered their services to perform excerpts from the Ballets
Russes repertories. Yet some of these items looked hastily staged.
Of greater interest was the intermission, during which backdrops
from several Ballets Russes productions were shown onstage.
Particularly stunning were Eugene Berman's handsome Italian
Renaissance square for Ashton's ``Devil's Holiday,'' Henri
Matisse's monumental arches for Massine's ``Rouge et Noir,''
Salvador Dali's desolate bone-strewn landscape for Massine's
``Bacchanal'' and the charming California mining community Raoul
Pene Du Bois designed for Platt's ``Ghost Town.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truly important events were the panel discussions and
lecture demonstrations. Theilade taught a fascinating modern-dance
class for ballet dancers that emphasized bending, stretching and
wavelike movements designed to promote freedom and fluidity in the
upper body. Larkin showed how certain fluttering movements Fokine
devised in ``Les Sylphides'' gain special vitality if one realizes
that he wished dancers to imagine that they were sprites gesturally
sending messages abroad on the winds. Tatiana Leskova bubbled as
she coached a young dancer in the giddy Frivolity solo from
Massine's ``Presages.''
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic sequences from ``Giselle'' were demonstrated by
Krassovska, in the title role, with Victor Moreno as Albrecht and
Miguel Terekhov as Hilarion, all over 70. What could have looked
merely odd became a lesson in expressiveness. Thus, in the mad
scene, it was fascinating to see Krassovska's shy Giselle steadily
slip from reality into a strange supernatural realm.
</P>
<P>
   Most thrilling of all was Baronova's interpretation of the mimed
passage in ``The Sleeping Beauty'' in which the Lilac Fairy defies
the evil fairy's curse. The ballerina's eloquent hands and fingers
made every gesture meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   So much of what the Ballets Russes companies represented is
being lost. Panelist after panelist lamented how today's emphasis
upon speedy feet has led to a neglect of nuanced movements for the
upper body. And the erosion of repertory is appalling. The Ballets
Russes danced major works that are now almost totally forgotten:
among them, masterpieces by the unusually versatile and often
daring Massine. Although Balanchine's ballets are being carefully
preserved, no one drew up plans to save Massine's.
</P>
<P>
   But, provided one acts now, some may be salvageable. Dancers
with sharp memories who know and love them came to New Orleans.
Enterprising companies should call upon them now. By preserving the
best of the Ballets Russes style and repertory, troupes today can
make the celebration continue artistically for years to come.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ASKS APPEALS COURT TO ALLOW BOY TO RETURN TO
CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Shorted) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department asked the full 12-member
federal appeals court in Atlanta on Tuesday to quickly affirm the
immigration service's ruling that Elian Gonzalez should be able to
go home to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The department also asked the court to shorten the process by
which Elian and his father could return to Cuba. The government's
brief was in response to an appeal filed last week by Elian's Miami
relatives to overturn the ruling by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the department asked the court, the U.S. Court of
Appeal for the 11th Circuit, not only to decide in favor of the
immigration service but to issue a mandate enforcing the ruling
immediately. That would eliminate the usual seven-day waiting
period after a decision.
</P>
<P>
   If the court accepts the government's request, Elian and his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, could board a flight for Cuba hours
after the ruling. Gonzalez is under a court order not to take Elian
back to Cuba until the court issues a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The most important remaining legal issue is whether federal
courts should give great deference to the rulings of the
immigration service in the case. In the absence of an explicit law,
the immigration service had ruled that Elian, as a 6-year-old boy,
could not request an asylum hearing on his own. The ruling meant
that Elian's father, and not Elian's Miami relatives, spoke for the
boy. The relatives have fought to have the boy remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of 3 of the 12 judges on the court decided that the
ruling by the immigration service was reasonable and should not be
reviewed by the courts. The Miami relatives asked the full
12-member court to reconsider the case.

EUROPEANS PERFORM HIGHEST IN RANKING OF WORLD HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Health Organization issued figures Tuesday that rank
health care systems around the world for the first time. They
indicate that European health systems are generally performing best
and that the United States is lagging behind, largely because of
inequal distribution of health care services.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are contained in the World Health Report 2000. The
report measured not just overall spending on health but also how
health care was distributed among different groups in each of the
191 nations that are members of the World Health Organization. The
countries were judged according to five health-care categories that
WHO surveys found to be most important to the people in various
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, argument over how well health systems and policies
are working has been based on anecdotes and fractional bits of
data, said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, director of the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the report was
the first attempt to put the arguments on a factual footing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the five top nations for health care
were France, Italy, San Marino, Andorra and Malta.
</P>
<P>
   One surprise in the findings, said Dr. David Evans of the WHO's
Global Program on Evidence for Health Policy, was the good rankings
for southern European countries such as Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in those countries don't believe their health systems
are doing very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oman ranked No. 8, a surprise because its health care system was
in a shambles in the 1970s, with very high infant mortality, and
because it has a relatively small budget for health. Its spending
per capita on health is one-ninth of that of the United States, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, an international health economist
from the Harvard School of Public Health, who is one of two leaders
of the project, said Oman demonstrates that great changes in a
country's health can be produced in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was China's ranking of No. 144. A little more
than a decade ago, China had a public health care system, but it
has collapsed, and now people there pay for virtually all their
care out of pocket. It was ranked No. 188 in fairness of financing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States outspends the world and ranks near the top in
average health measures, but fails to deliver good health care to a
large proportion of its population and distributes the cost
relatively unfairly, according to the report's measures, leaving it
at number 37 in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Using the measure ``health life expectancy'' _ that is, life
expectancy minus years of sickness and disability, there are
counties in the United States where Native American children at
birth can look forward to only about 50 years of healthy life on
average, while some Asian minorities in suburban New York can
expect more than 90 years of healthy life, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The report demonstrates, Murray said, ``that no one model is
best, but the numbers will give us the means over time to test
which innovation in health systems work best and which are
failing.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rating system bases national scores on five measures,
and in producing a ranking takes into account the financial
resources it has available.
</P>
<P>
   The five measures used are: overall level of health or life
expectancy; health fairness or life expectancy as measured across
various populations within a country; responsiveness or how well
people rated performance of their health care system; fairness in
responsiveness among different groups in the same country; and
fairness in financing among different groups, which looked at what
proportion of income is devoted to health care.

FROM MAY TO JUNE SOMETHING FOR THE EARS IN FLORENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ In a city where you spend the day living
through your eyes, the annual music festival provides compensatory
evenings for the ears. It is one of the oldest such festivals _ the
present is the 63rd _ and it long ago outgrew its name of Maggio
Musicale (Musical May): events start in the middle of April and go
on until the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are rather spread out over this period, and there
is not too much focus. Zubin Mehta is the principal director, and
he was around earlier to conduct the opening presentation of ``La
Traviata'' and a couple of concerts. Other musicians to appear this
year have included Maurizio Pollini and Radu Lupu.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Maggio makes a point of contemporary music. Last
month there was a program of orchestral works by Azio Corghi and a
new opera by Giorgio Battistelli, who seems to come up with an
opera almost every other year. This time his surprising subject was
Raymond Roussel's novel ``Impressions of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city where opera was born, Monteverdi's ``Coronation of
Poppaea'' was an appropriate choice a month back. Now the festival
is presenting Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin,'' still something of a
rarity in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The musical preparation was in the hands of Semyon Bychkov, one
of the Maggio's favorite conductors, though Monday night the baton
was taken over by Kirill Petrenko, a younger Russian beginning to
make a mark in Austrian and German opera houses. He proved very
capable. The Maggio Musicale's orchestra is unpolished, but
Petrenko kept it smartly on track and was sensitive to his singers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cast, Galina Gorchakova compensated for vocal problems
_ trouble pitching high notes and a diminishment of rapture _ with
a noble bearing. In the last scene, the passion of her acting
seemed to bring back some of the old glory in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   The other principals were non-Russian, and, in some cases, not
too familiar with the style. Ramon Vargas, as Lensky, sang sweetly
and freely in the first act but became overwrought in the second.
Ferruccio Furlanetto looked appropriately grave and proud as Gremin
but grossly sentimentalized his aria by singing it as if close to
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Frontali, though, was excellent in the title role. His
singing was always perfectly turned out: neatly phrased, secure,
elegant. Then in the final scene, where Onegin at last loses his
destructive self-possession, Frontali did not drop those qualities
but, far more effectively, heightened and emphasized them. He is a
fine, intelligent singer, and his Russian was convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The musical performance was also distinguished by Irini
Karaianni as Olga and by vigorous singing from the Maggio chorus,
rehearsed by Jose Luis Basso.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual side, the greatest impression was made by the
Pushkin-period costumes, designed by Joachim Herzog and beautifully
made. Christoph Sehl's sets featured wide spaces and tall birch
trunks, often surrounding and sometimes invading the interior
scenes. There were oddities of a similar kind, neither striking nor
meaningful, in Alexander Schulin's production. Having Onegin and
Olga dance in slow motion during the second-act ball, for instance,
made no sense when the music was up to speed, and just looked
clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, to end the festival, David Robertson conducts a
Stravinsky concert _ the Symphony of Psalms and ``Le Sacre du
Printemps'' _ out in the Piazza della Signoria.

Bird leaves Pacers, but not exactly on his terms
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ After eight years in the NBA, Shaquille O'Neal
finally won his championship Monday night, and he no longer could
control his emotions, each tear seeming to represent one of the
many criticisms that have dogged him since he entered the league.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird, too, looked as if he wanted to cry as he watched his
Pacers trudge off the court after the Lakers' 116-11 Game 6
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird, who came so close to leading the underdog Pacers to a
championship, stood firm, his stone face chiseled into unemotional
hardness. There would be no emotion for the cameras to gobble up.
No tearful farewells. Just a quick: ``Nice knowing ya. See y'all
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bird almost did it.
</P>
<P>
   He almost pulled off his three-year plan with the Indiana
Pacers. But unfortunately, that time frame happened to coincide
with Phil Jackson's one-year plan with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Bird took the Pacers to their first NBA Finals
appearance just three years after taking over the perennially
disappointing (or underachieving) team, only to get rolled by the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, the newly minted title is the franchise's
seventh since moving to Los Angeles in 1960 and 12th overall,
counting the five won by the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1940s and
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   The latest title came just one year and three days after Jackson
was named coach and was the franchise's first since Magic Johnson
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led the ``Lake Show'' to the 1988
championship, the last of five NBA crowns in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who won three championships in the defunct American
Basketball Association, are left to ponder what could have been. Or
what will be.
</P>
<P>
   Now, again true to his word, Bird is stepping down as coach of
the Pacers, despite his wildly successful tenure with his
home-state team. And despite that success, Bird said leaving the
game on a losing note will eat at him for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't be happy again,'' Bird said. ``I'll probably
be miserable the rest of my life, to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to walk away from a team that is still fully
capable of contending for a championship is confusing to many. But
the players who have spent the past three years learning to forget
about Bird the Hall of Fame player and accept him as coach respect
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I really can't (explain it),'' said point guard Mark
Jackson. ``I don't think anybody can. I respect the fact that he
made a decision from day one and then stuck to it when a lot of
people probably wouldn't have _ especially when they get a taste of
what has been accomplished this year. So I respect that. But, you
know, he's a different breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might go a long way toward explaining the decision.
</P>
<P>
   He compiled a 147-67 regular-season record in his three years,
winning Coach of the Year honors after a 58-24 season his first
year with the Pacers. And his team went at least as far as the
Eastern Conference finals all three years (34-19 record), losing to
Michael Jordan's Bulls in 1998 and the Knicks in 1999 before
breaking through this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird cannot tolerate being second-best, and the man who
drove the Boston Celtics to NBA championships can't accept losing,
even if it is in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that there's only one winner, and I've always felt that
way,'' Bird said. ``Whoever they crown champion is the only winner
that's going to be there. So it's not that I'm real disappointed in
what we've accomplished, because we've had some great games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our hearts out, (but) there's only one champion. I'm
disappointed in the fact that we didn't get an opportunity to play
in the seventh game.''
</P>
<P>
   What he means is they didn't get a chance to win, which must irk
Bird, because many think the Pacers blew a couple of Finals games
because of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was their first time here,'' said NBC's Isiah Thomas,
perhaps getting a head start on the critical analysis of what might
be his team next season. ``They weren't ready for it at the
beginning. They gave the first two games away. They didn't start
playing until Game 3 in Indiana (a 100-91 Pacers victory). That was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   So now the focus shifts to his replacement. The early favorite
seems to be Thomas, who owns the Continental Basketball
Association. If that's true, Thomas is letting no one in on the
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people are saying, but it's too early to tell,''
said Thomas of the speculation he will take over as Pacers coach.
``It depends on what (Pacers president Donnie Walsh) decides. I
should know in the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the organization continue to hope Bird changes his mind
and comes back to coach the Pacers. After all, the team intends to
make every effort to bring back free agents Reggie Miller, Jalen
Rose and Rik Smits for another run.
</P>
<P>
   But they are now left to savor the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a larger-than-life figure in this state, in this
city and in basketball,'' said Pacers general manager David Kahn.
``Sometimes I looked down the bench and I found myself saying,
`Wait a minute _ that's Larry Bird coaching our team.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think time will tell, but I think it will be three of
the finest seasons the franchise will ever have seen. I'm not
conceding anything yet (as far as Bird's retirement), but I don't
think people will understand it until later what his presence has
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a huge aftershock somewhere down the line and
you'll say, `You know what? Larry Bird coached us for three years.'
That was pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible and over.
</P>
<P>
   Bye, bye Birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's been a great experience,'' Bird said.
``Unfortunately, it's over, but it's time to move on.''
</P>

DIFFERING VIEWS OFFERED FOR FACTS IN WACO SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A lawsuit filed against the government by
survivors and relatives of those killed in the 1993 fire at the
Branch Davidian compound began Tuesday with the two sides giving
different interpretations of the same basic facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about truth and responsibility,'' said Michael A.
Caddell, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. ``We'll hear the
truth about what happened at Mount Carmel and who bears the
responsibility for what happened, including the death of 25
children.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Bradford, the U.S. attorney in Texas, told the
federal judge and seven-member advisory jury hearing the case that
responsibility was also the theme of his defense. ``The
responsibility for this tragedy is with David Koresh and the Branch
Davidians,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   The case grew out of a botched raid in which 10 people died,
including 4 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents who were
trying to arrest the religious leader, Koresh, for weapons
violations. After a 51-day standoff, Koresh and more than 75 of his
followers died when fire broke out as federal agents used armored
vehicles to pump tear gas into the sect's ramshackle Mount Carmel
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the Branch Davidians had ambushed the 80 officers
involved in the first raid on Feb. 28, 1993. He said Koresh had
trained them to use weapons in anticipation of just such a
confrontation, and quoted him as telling his followers, `If you
can't kill for God, you can't die for God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs are asking for $695 million in damages from the
government, accusing federal agents of contributing to the deaths
of the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Other allegations made by the plaintiffs, that agents fired into
the compound, preventing the Branch Davidians from fleeing, will be
heard later, according to an order by the judge, Walter S. Smith
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Saying his lawsuit revolves around four issues, Caddell ticked
them off: Did federal agents direct indiscriminate gunfire at the
compound during the initial raid? Did the FBI deviate from their
approved operational plan? Did unauthorized FBI action cause or
contribute to the fire? And did the FBI violate Attorney General
Janet Reno's orders by not having firefighting equipment available
on April 19, 1993?
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of this case rests on what happened on April 19,'' he
said, laying much of blame for the events of that day on the FBI's
field commanders for the Mount Carmel operation, the special agents
Jeffrey Jamar and Rick Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, The men driving the tanks that day were only
following orders,'' Caddell said. ``The men responsible were Jamar
and Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell moved quickly to separate his clients from those Branch
Davidians involved with weapons or violence during the raid,
admitting that hundreds of firearms were found in the burned-out
compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not in dispute here,'' he said. ``Eight people were
convicted for those crimes and sent to prison. None of them are
involved in this lawsuit. I am not here to defend David Koresh.''
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that some Branch Davidians may have set at
least one of three fires that government investigators say started
the April 19, 1993, conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradford tried to deflect charges of
indiscriminate firing by government agents by describing the
chaotic conditions during the raid. ``They did not expect to
receive gunfire,'' he said. ``The agents were in a situation where
they were pinned down and fighting for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Branch Davidians injured during the raid, he said, were
killed by their own companions. ``The BATF tried to get them out
for medical treatment, but instead of giving them medical
attention, they were shot,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   He also scoffed at Caddell's theory of the origin of the fires:
``They didn't start just one of the fires, they started all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that jurors will have to sift through mountains of
documents and physical evidence, both sides tried to personalize
the anguish their clients have gone through over the events of
seven and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford continually referred to the agents of the ATF and FBI
as victims of Koresh's bloodlust against the government. ``They
were simply trying to carry out their duties and responsibilities,
and they met a dangerous man named David Koresh,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, at one point in his presentation, Caddell displayed
photographs of 15 children killed, saying ``Let me introduce my
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   As the children's images appeared on a screen in the courtroom,
Caddell repeated a similar litany about each: ``She never owed a
gun. She never held a gun. She never fired a gun. She never hurt
anyone.''

IN VAIL, PROPOSING A CHANGE OF VIEW IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The view from The Lodge at Lionshead is to die
for.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Creek babbles along noisily, just beyond soaring pine trees
that seem to reach halfway up the mountains in the distance. ``You
can even see the ski slopes,'' said Marilyn Dyer, owner of Unit 1
and president of the Lodge homeowners association, who splits the
year between here and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But not all is as peaceful and serene as it appears outside the
back windows of Dyer's stylish three-bedroom, three-bath
condominium, which she has owned for 14 years. The Lodge, which was
built in 1978, is smack in the middle of a proposed major
development project that town officials argue is critical for
Vail's continued economic stability. To complete the most ambitious
of several options, town officials want to tear down the four-level
building and move all the residents, Dyer and 11 other unit owners,
to a nearby site, where the town would construct a new building for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 1 to 10, this would be close to a 10,'' Mayor
Ludwig Kurtz said, reflecting the town's urgent need to gain access
to the Lodge site. ``Specifically because of the competition we are
facing within the state and outside the state, not only in the ski
business but also in the leisure and lifestyle business, we need to
look at some pretty bold strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vail and many other mountain resort towns in the West, these
are challenging times because of a booming national economy that
keeps them busy year round, with skiers in winter and hikers in
summer. To attract the growing number of families with vacation
money to burn, they are now engaged in a mighty competition, in
which amenities often mean the difference between winning and
losing billions in leisure dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Vail opened its ski resort in the early 1960s, making it one of
the first Colorado areas to win acclaim as a world-class resort.
But others, like Aspen, Telluride and Winter Park caught up fast.
With unusually warm winters in recent years shortening prime the
ski season, the competition has only intensified. This season,
skier visits to Colorado's 26 resorts dropped 4.5 percent, making
it the second consecutive season in which fewer lift tickets were
sold than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Vail was a rare exception, with a 2.5 percent increase over the
1998-1999 ski season. But that was hardly enough for town officials
to abandon the ``Vail Renaissance,'' a master plan to re-energize
the resort, part of which includes building a second indoor skating
rink, a cultural center, a conference center, office and retail
space _ all of it wrapped around a small lake and open
European-style plaza that would serve as a community gathering
place.
</P>
<P>
   And so a band of architects set out to fulfill the town's
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, for Dyer and her 11 neighbors, the most lavish
option meant tearing down the Lodge at Lionshead and moving them,
at no cost to the residents, elsewhere, a proposal that has not set
well with them. Adding insult to injury, the town council had
considered using a local law that would have allowed it to take
control of the lodge by declaring it ``blighted,'' a tactic Kurtz
now says is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Dyer said, she feels as if the homeowners have been
strong-armed by the town, and by extension, Vail Resorts, the
company that operates the ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel?'' she asked, with a sweep of her arm
taking in the vista beyond. ``This is why I chose this place. The
pool, the trees, the privacy. We even have a waterfall over there,
and we're so close to the creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell W. Forrest, director of community development for Vail,
said the town would do everything possible to replicate what the
Lodge owners now have, in effect, units of 1,600 to 2,200 square
feet that sell for as much as $1.5 million. By one design, a new
building could be constructed at its current site, only turned from
its current east-west axis to north-south, a change that would
deprive most owners of the views they have now. Another option is
to build across the proposed lake, a site still near the creek but
away from the tall pines.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the residents could decline both offers, forcing town
planners to embrace a less dramatic vision of the future, with
fewer amenities and a more modest-sized plaza. Dyer said she has no
idea what the homeowners association might decide.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz and other officials involved with the redevelopment plans
say that whatever the homeowners decide is fine and that the town
will plan accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a small level of disappointment that we might
not be able to do as well as we could,'' Kurtz said, contemplating
the possibility that the homeowners would refuse to move. If so, he
promised, they would not be stigmatized as obstructionists.
</P>
<P>
   It was less clear if they were in any danger of having their
lift tickets pulled if they chose to remain. ``You know, I never
thought of that,'' Porter Wharton, senior vice president of public
affairs for Vail Resorts, said with a mischievous grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only kidding,'' he said.

CLINTON, IN REVERSAL, PROPOSES INCREASES IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday proposed increasing
Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other health care
providers Tuesday, as evidence grew that cuts made in 1997 had
harmed the quality of care around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Congress to increase payments to providers by $21
billion in the next five years and by $40 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals represent an abrupt reversal by the
administration. In his budget request just five months ago, Clinton
asked Congress to cut payments to providers by $30 billion over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The original cuts were made with bipartisan support, in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Lawmakers wanted to slow the growth of
Medicare, but the savings have far exceeded expectations. Medicare
spending declined last year, by nearly 1 percent, to $209 billion.
It was the first decline since creation of Medicare in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday asked Congress to increase Medicare payments
to hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes, and he
proposed a small increase for health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The first three sectors welcomed the proposals. But HMO
executives said they were disappointed, and they said the proposed
increases would not be enough to prevent HMOs from pulling out of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration seems not to be addressing the crisis
facing Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs,'' said Karen M. Ignagni,
president of the American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater
New York Hospital Association, hailed the proposal. Hospitals in
the New York area have laid off workers because of financial
problems that they trace to the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the U.S.
Senate in New York, has expressed concern about the adequacy of
Medicare payments to teaching hospitals. But Chris Jennings, the
health policy coordinator at the White House, said, ``She did not
develop, design, approve or review'' the proposals announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is, in effect, getting out in front of a
parade that has already begun to form on Capitol Hill, where
lawmakers are scrambling to help health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Home health care has been hit harder than any other service in
the last two years. Medicare spending on home care dropped 45
percent, to $9.7 billion in 1999 from $17.5 billion in 1997. Under
current law, payments will be cut by 15 percent in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Tuesday that Congress should delay that cut
for one year. But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said: ``The White
House plan is not enough. The 15 percent cut in home health
payments should be eliminated altogether.'' Many lawmakers share
that view.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, lobbyists for the elderly, seeking new prescription
drug benefits, had seen themselves as competing with health care
providers for scarce federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But with estimates of the federal budget surplus soaring, and
with the Medicare trust fund solvent until 2025, the president said
Tuesday, ``I believe we can do both'' _ enhance payments to
providers and add drug benefits to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all certain that Congress will do both this year.
Politically, it is easy to increase payments to providers, by
changing just a few words in Medicare reimbursement formulas. But
lawmakers have had immense difficulty agreeing on Medicare drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton explained in detail how he wanted to spend half of the
money he proposed to give health care providers. Use of the other
half would be decided with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   These are the highlights of the president's plan:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hospitals would receive $5 billion over five years and $10
billion over 10 years. They would receive a full allowance for
inflation, increasing their Medicare payments about 3 percent,
rather than the 2 percent expected under current law. Medicare
would increase special payments to teaching hospitals and to
hospitals that serve large numbers of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home health agencies would receive $2 billion over five years
and $3 billion over 10 years. Home care agencies would get a 3.4
percent increase for inflation, rather than the 2.3 percent
expected under current law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nursing homes would receive $1 billion over five years and $2
billion over 10 years. Restrictions on physical, occupational and
speech therapy would be delayed a year.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials had minimized complaints from health care
providers. But the White House changed its tune Tuesday, saying
that Medicare cuts appeared to ``undermine access to quality health
care services,'' as ``hospitals' financial status has deteriorated
significantly since 1997.''  &QL;

L.A. REJECTS DEMOCRATS' REQUEST FOR $6 MILLION IN CONVENTION
SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after the Los Angeles Lakers brought this
often jaded city to its feet by storming to the National Basketball
Association championship, the mayor and other embarrassed city
officials were grilled over a spasm of post-game violence that left
some police cruisers torched and four officers injured.
</P>
<P>
   Roving mobs that grew to several thousand people outside the
Staples Center, in downtown Los Angeles, where the Lakers won the
championship, burned and destroyed the two police cruisers, plus
one other automobile, and they made bonfires of souvenir T-shirts
and posters. They vandalized businesses, and battered and nearly
up-ended a television broadcast van before police on foot and on
horseback brought them under control, finally allowing the roughly
20,000 fans inside the arena to exit. There were 11 arrests, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said the police did a good job of
containing the violence to the vicinity of Staples Center. But what
made the issue particularly sensitive, and led to the questions
from City Council members at Tuesday's meeting, is the growing
nervousness here over security for the Democratic convention, less
than two months away.
</P>
<P>
   The council Tuesday refused to vote for a Democratic Party
request for $6 million in city support of the convention, scheduled
to begin on Aug. 14. Council members agreed to provide $2 million
in bus service and other support, but refused to hand over $4
million in cash, insisting on more information before granting the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan and other officials, including the police chief,
Bernard Parks, played down the violence and the threat to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, we all witnessed pride and shame, winners and
losers,'' the mayor said at a news conference. But he called the
police response ``outstanding,'' and commented, ``I think the
police acted very responsibly, with restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks added, ``I think that what we saw yesterday was a very
disciplined effort by the police department. Certainly that
property damage can be replaced. We certainly feel as though the
end result was the best that we could do under those
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   But some council members said that the destruction of so much
property, and particularly the open hostility some of those in the
melee showed toward the police, was not a small matter, and added
to concerns about what sort of violence might accompany the
Democratic convention.

SENATE VOTES TO MAKE ATTACKS ON GAYS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With strong bipartisan support, the Senate voted on
Tuesday to make hate attacks on homosexuals a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Tuesday was an unexpectedly wide 57-42 tally and was
also the first time either house of Congress backed protection of
gays in a roll-call vote that could have political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a similar measure last year, quietly and by
unanimous consent, only to see it killed in a House-Senate
conference, and Republican leaders said they planned to do so again
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Al Gore, who flew back from a campaign event
to preside and cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary, said that if
the House did not pass the measure on its own, the administration
would insist that it be included in wrap-up legislation before
Congress could adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was calling senators on Tuesday and on
Monday asking for their votes, has repeatedly used that tactic in
recent years, and Republicans have often given in to avoid being
accused of shutting down the government.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Tuesday would expand federal jurisdiction for
crimes based on race, religion and national origin, and would also
add gender and handicapped status to the categories covered, as
well as sexual orientation. But while the issue never came up
openly in debate, senators on both sides agreed that the sexual
orientation issue was the question that made the bill a close call.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who co-sponsored the bill with Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., appealed to those who he said had told him
they did not want to vote for the bill and thereby seem to be
approving homosexuality. ``No matter how we pray, nor how we sin,
we can stand up for each other,'' he said. ``We can stand up
against hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told the Senate, ``Hate crimes are rooted in hatred and
bigotry, and if America is ever going to be America, we should root
out hatred and bigotry.'' After the vote he said: ``This was a
bipartisan effort. It was the Senate acting at its best, with one
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four Democrats and 13 Republicans voted for the bill.
Forty-one Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, voted no.
</P>
<P>
   But the only senator who spoke against the bill was Orrin Hatch,
the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee. He contended
the measure was unnecessary, because hate crimes were already being
adequately prosecuted by states and localities, and
unconstitutional because it invaded state authority.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a narrower bill, one that would require a study of
whether states were ignoring hate crimes. ``I don't think it is
true,'' he said. But if it was, he added, he might support a
measure like the Kennedy-Smith bill. ``Hate crimes are abysmal,''
he said. ``They are horrible. We should all be against them.''
Hatch's proposal for a study was also adopted, 50-49.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hatch was the only vocal critic, others who voted no made
it clear that the protections based on sexual orientation had
turned them against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-Smith bill, like Hatch's proposal, would authorize
federal grants and other assistance to state and local law
enforcement officials to prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It would make a federal offense of crimes involving bodily
injury motivated by a victim's actual or perceived race, color,
religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or
disability. Federal law now prohibits crimes based on race,
national origin or religion, but only when the victim was seeking
to exercise a federally protected right, like voting, registering
for school or using a restaurant. But the bill passed on Tuesday
would also make a federal crime of random hate crimes, like the
murders of James Byrd Jr. in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But to reach the Shepard case, and also hate crimes against the
handicapped or based on gender, the prosecution would have to
establish a direct connection to interstate commerce, though the
connection could be no more than that a gun used in a hate crime
had been bought in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And before a federal indictment could be obtained, the Justice
Department would have to certify that it had consulted with the
local authorities, who either had no jurisdiction or intention to
act, or that the state had requested or at least did not object to
federal action, or that the state had completed prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fate of the legislation, Tuesday's vote propelled
the issue into the political campaign. At the presidential level,
Gore's enthusiasm contrasted to the attitude of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the likely Republican nominee. Last year, Bush said he
opposed including sexual orientation in a hate crimes bill the
Texas Legislature was considering. When that bill died without a
vote, supporters of it blamed him and said his lack of support was
dictated by presidential campaign considerations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, embraced
the bill eagerly. He said, ``Because hate crimes are an affront to
all Americans, this vote is a sign of hope for all Americans.'' He
said the next task was to get the House to vote on the measure. But
he was asked about the reluctance of Republican leaders, like Rep.
Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who said, ``I don't see
that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said House Republicans, like their Senate counterparts,
might learn that Americans wanted the bill passed into law.

PENDING EXECUTION IN TEXAS SPOTLIGHTS A SECRETIVE BOARD

 By SARA RIMER with JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some are active Republicans, their offices
decorated with stuffed elephants or pictures of Gov. George W.
Bush. Many have some sort of experience in law enforcement. These
include a former Secret Service agent, a former prosecutor and
several former parole workers. But there is also a psychologist, a
rancher and a former schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   These men and women are members of the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles, the obscure state agency whose job is to review the
clemency petitions of inmates in what is by far the nation's
busiest death row. When Bush is asked about the fairness of the
death penalty in Texas, he often says that the power to grant
clemency to death row inmates rests not with him, but with this
18-member board. Under state law he can only commute a death
penalty if they recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush has made a point of distancing himself from the
board's decisions in capital cases, as governor he has appointed
al of its members to their six-year terms. He has also selected
the chairman and designated the six board members who set policy
and guidelines, all subject to approval by the state senate.
</P>
<P>
   Now the board is faced with its latest high-profile decision.
Unless it intervenes, Gary Graham, a convicted murderer whose case
has drawn national attention largely because of accounts of poor
work by his lawyer, will be executed at 6 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the chairman of the board has postponed the
deadline for the vote until noon Thursday, six hours before the
scheduled execution. If history is any measure, Graham's lawyers
face an uphill struggle. Since 1995, 68 death row inmates have
asked for clemency, and only once has the board granted it. They
have not held a public hearing on a capital case since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the board has been criticized for working in secret,
seldom explaining its life-or-death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Shank, an Ohio lawyer specializing in capital defense who
argued a landmark clemency case before the U.S. Supreme Court in
1997, said the Texas board is out of step with the decades-long
trend toward greater openness in handling capital clemency
decisions. Many state boards require public hearings if requested
in capital cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas board has also been accused by defense lawyers of not
giving a thorough review to the death row cases it is responsible
for evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   A majority vote is required for any form of clemency. Once the
board's votes are all in _ they generally send them in to the main
office in Austin by fax _ the decision is immediately relayed to
the governor. Board members are not required to meet publicly on
capital cases, or even to hold telephone conference calls _ and the
apparent lack of such discussion on any sort of systematic basis
has prompted criticism from defense lawyers as well as judges.
</P>
<P>
   But with Graham's lawyers trying to make a powerful case for his
innocence in the 1981 robbery murder for which he was sentenced to
death, there has been an unusual amount of conferring among members
about his case, said one board official who asked not to be quoted
by name. ``There's an awful lot of talking going on,'' said the
official. ``They're concerned about him being possibly innocent.
And they're concerned about the lack of an adequate defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Michael Jones, a spokesman for the
governor's office, said Bush does not personally interview any of
the candidates for the Paroles Board, noting that the governor
controls 3,000 appointments. He said candidates usually apply to
the governor's appointment office, which asks a variety of
questions, probing a person's views on crime and punishment and on
methods of treatment. But Jones said none of the candidates are
asked their views about the death penalty, nor are they asked their
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of the questions they ask people,'' Jones said of
the death penalty. He added, ``Capital murder cases are a very
small percentage of the caseload. The goal is to select people who
are balanced, fair, thorough and who make decisions based on facts
and who have no agenda except to protect the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said one goal in choosing members ``is to get a diverse
perspective,'' and the board is diverse in ethnicity and geographic
representation. But none of the members are criminal defense
lawyers, for example. In fact, at least five of the members once
worked for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the same
department charged with carrying out executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume those are all folks strongly interested in improving
the criminal justice system,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with present and former officials indicate that most,
if not all, of the board members seem to support the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   One member who left in the last year, Bennie Elmore, abstained
in all capital cases, though he declined to say why. Some board
members said they believed it was for religious reasons, but
Elmore, in an interview in April, denied that, although he declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Kent A. Schaffer, immediate past president of the Texas Criminal
Defense Lawyers Association, said all Texas governors carefully
select board members who can serve as a firewall when a
particularly sensitive case arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are predisposed to protect the governor,'' said Schaffer.
``The governor makes appointments to the board with people he knows
can take the heat. He's in the enviable position of saying, `I can
only do what they allow me to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the board acts independently, but some lawyers here
believe that governors have ways of making their feelings known to
members who are beholden to them for their $80,000 a year jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure there are ways of communicating with the board
and letting them know what the governor wants,'' said Neil McCabe,
a law professor at South Texas College of Law. McCabe and others
pointed to the case of Henry Lee Lucas, the only person to be
granted clemency by the board. Ten days before the vote, Bush
publicly spoke of how he and the board would have to give careful
consideration to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Five board members interviewed in April said they regarded
themselves as independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no communication between us and Governor Bush on how
to vote,'' said Linda Garcia, a former prosecutor who works out of
the board's Angleton office, outside Houston. ``There just flat
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that when he reviews scheduled executions, he
considers two questions: whether the inmate may have been innocent,
and whether the inmate received full access to the courts. While
there are no clear guidelines on how the board's clemency decisions
in capital cases are made, several board members who discussed
their review of capital cases during interviews with the Times in
April said they also focus on those questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of innocence and guilt is something that I've always
looked at very closely,'' said Cynthia Tauss, who has studied
criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Another board member, Tom Moss, a retired federal parole
officer, said he asks these questions: ``Have they had their day in
court? Is there anything in front of me to lead a rational person
to believe that this person might be innocent?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit against
the pardons board, criticizing its secrecy and failure to explain
its reasons for denying clemencies, in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sam Sparks, of U.S. District Court in Austin, found that
while the Texas clemency system met ``the minimal procedural
safeguards'' required by the U.S. Supreme Court, he still suggested
that the board could easily offer reasons for its decisions and
hold public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administratively, the goal is more to protect the secrecy and
autonomy of the system rather than carrying out an efficient,
legally sound system,'' Sparks wrote in his opinion. ``The board
would not have to sacrifice its conservative ideology to carry out
its duties in a more fair and accurate fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time the inmates' lawsuit was pending, legislation had
been introduced in Texas that would require the board to consider
clemency appeals in public meetings. Bush resisted the changes. He
said public deliberations might create ``a chance for people to
rant and rail, a chance for people to emotionalize the process
beyond the questions that need to be asked.'' The bill died in the
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   In capital clemency cases, both the prosecution and the defense
are free to submit documents, letters, videotapes and affidavits.
Board members said they also regularly receive letters from
relatives of both the victims and the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The material in the Graham case is voluminous and fills several
notebooks, according to the board's general counsel, Laura McElroy.
In the clemency petition they submitted to the board three weeks
ago, Graham's defense lawyers, Jack B. Zimmermann and Richard H.
Burr, contend that Graham is innocent of the murder for which he
was convicted in 1981. The lawyers also presented videotapes of two
eyewitnesses who say they saw the killer, and that he was not
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday Zimmermann and Burr met with the board chairman,
Gerald Garrett, and presented additional information, including
affidavits from two jurors who viewed videotapes of the witnesses
and said if they had heard their testimony during the original
trial, they would have voted to acquit Graham, Zimmermann said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also included in its new submission a seven-minute
videotape of Jennifer Thompson, a North Carolina woman who
misidentified the man who raped her, and thus sent the wrong man to
prison. (He was released after 11 years because of DNA evidence
that showed he did not rape Thompson.)
</P>
<P>
   A jury sentenced Graham to death based on the testimony of a
single eyewitness, who said she saw him through the windshield of
her car, from 30 to 40 feet away at night, and fleetingly. That
witness has stuck to her account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman assured us they will look at it, and get it out
right away to the members,'' Zimmermann said, referring to the new
material.
</P>
<P>
   The board members who were interviewed by the Times said they
review cases scrupulously, pouring over volumes of evidence. ``We
are their last chance,'' said Daniel Lang, a lawyer and board
member who works out of the Angleton office. ''It's somebody's
life. I think they're entitled to my full concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is their rulings in capital cases that have thrust the
board into the spotlight, they spend most of their time making
about 1,000 decisions a month on parole for state inmates,
decisions that mostly involve robberies and drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   Paddy Lann Burwell, the rancher on the board, says he spends 50
hours a week on the job, eating lunch at his desk, and taking cases
home to give them further consideration at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst nightmare would be to execute an innocent person,''
he said.

INVESTORS OPPOSE BREAKUP OF RUSSIA'S ELECTRIC MONOPOLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of foreign investors in Russia's electricity monopoly,
Unified Energy Systems, has asked President Vladimir Putin to stop
a corporate restructuring they say is moving too fast and would
destroy the value of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 18 investors, representing more than 15 percent of
Unified Energy's stock, sent a letter to Putin stating that the
restructuring proposal would reduce future investment levels by
robbing the company of its principal assets at extremely low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Their letter elevates what has been a simmering dispute between
foreign investors and the management of Unified Energy, which runs
the world's biggest power grid and is the most actively traded
Russian stock.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring proposal, designed by Anatoly Chubais, Unified
Energy's chief executive, would break the monopoly into hundreds of
smaller companies and sell stakes in them to raise $30 billion in
badly needed investment over 10 years. The company said Monday it
had reworked the proposal and planned to submit the revisions to
the government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring proposal has attracted widespread attention in
Russia and abroad as a test case of restructuring the country's
investment-starved energy sector. Chubais, the architect of
Russia's state asset sales program, has championed free market
reforms and foreign investments in Russia. As recently as last
year, Chubais was a favorite of foreign investors, who voted to
make it more difficult to oust him from the post. But now they have
banded together against him, saying they fear a repeat of his asset
sales program, in which prize companies were sold at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete mess,'' said Alexander Branis, associate
director at Prosperity Capital Management, with $140 million under
management, a quarter of which is in power companies. ``I doubt
that the proposal has changed much. For us it's disturbing that
Chubais has admitted that some of our concerns were legitimate but
is still pressing ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Unified Energy currently holds majority stakes in most of the
country's more than 80 regional power companies. Investors say
breaking regional companies up into distributors, sellers and
generators would create companies too small to actually attract
buyers. Unified Energy should merge groups of regional companies,
and sell stakes in the larger companies, they say. They also argue
that Russia must allow electricity prices to rise before Unified
Energy's assets will be attractive to serious buyers. Tariffs are
still well below production costs, while unpaid electricity bills
cripple the finances of the regional companies. Russians pay about
1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for their electricity, while Western
Europeans pay about 7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone from shareholders to company management agree
that a restructuring is needed. They argue that aging regional
power stations need new equipment, and that companies need the
ability to charge market prices for electricity and terminate
service to nonpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Unified Energy has said the country will suffer major gaps in
power supplies without major new investment within the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not all investors oppose the breakup of the company. Some say
its dominant position is part of the problem. Charles Frank, acting
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which invests in post-Soviet Russia companies, said last week in
St. Petersburg that while some of of the criticism of Unified
Energy's restructuring is valid, some is driven by a desire to
preserve the company's dominance. The Unified Energy monopoly, he
said, ``must be broken soon, without waiting for the perfect
regulatory regime or 100 percent tariff collection.''

MASSACHUSETTS SET APART IN RATIO OF OLDER MOTHERS
</HEADLINE>
  By CAREY GOLDBERG 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At first, it seemed that it might be a statistical
blip. But no, public health officials said Tuesday, it is a
definite and striking trend: Massachusetts, they believe, has
become the first state where more babies are born to women over the
age of 30 than under it.
</P>
<P>
   State figures made public this week showed that among
Massachusetts women who gave birth in 1998, about 43,000 were 30 or
over, and about 39,000 were under 30. That contrasted sharply with
state figures as recent as those from 1990, when only about 37,000
women 30 and over gave birth, compared with 55,000 under 30. In
1980, the number of new mothers under 30 was nearly triple the new
mothers 30 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trend, this is happening,'' said Deborah Klein
Walker, the Massachusetts associate commissioner of public health.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1996 that the over-30 mothers first slightly exceeded
the under-30 mothers here, Walker said, and the increase in their
dominance has been steady ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in older mothers may be mainly of sociological rather
than medical interest, because there is no sharp change in
fertility or healthy births at the age or 30 or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But in Massachusetts, at least, it does bring one medical
corollary: a slight rise in cases of low birth weight. That
condition usually occurs in premature babies, and they are more at
risk for problems like breathing difficulties and brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The link, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of obstetrics at
Massachusetts General Hospital, is that ``older women might have
slightly more difficulty getting pregnant.'' These women,
Frigoletto added, often ``resort to artificial reproduction
techniques, which are associated with multiple births, and multiple
births are associated with prematurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Massachusetts, where insurance companies are required to
cover infertility treatments, has the highest number of multiple
births in the United States, and multiple births are strongly
associated with low birth weights, those less than 5.5 pounds.
According to the state statistics just released, in 1998 less than
5 percent of single babies were born at low birth weights, but 50
percent of twins and 92 percent of triplets weighed in low.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in multiple births means a change for health workers
gauging and fighting low birth weights. Historically, low birth
weights have occurred largely among poor young minority women, and
have tended to be a sign of faulty nutrition and prenatal care. But
now, with so many older mothers using high-technology help to have
babies, the low weights are occurring more often among white, more
affluent and more educated women as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to draw that distinction, state health officials
say, because the numbers might seem to indicate that efforts at
helping poor mothers were bringing little result; in fact, they
say, they are making progress, but the low birth weight numbers are
skewed by the pool of multiple births to older mothers.
</P>
<P>
   As for why Massachusetts has such a preponderance of older
mothers, many attribute it to the large number of educated women in
the state and their tendency to delay having children.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said she was virtually sure that Massachusetts was the
only state to reach the point where more babies were born to women
over 30 than under it. Federal reports on pregnancy rates and
births do not break the numbers down by state, and officials at the
National Center for Health Statistics said Tuesday that such
figures were not readily available.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ The long-frustrated effort to find and punish
the killer of teenager Martha Moxley exploded onto the public stage
Tuesday when two former classmates testified in court that Michael
Skakel confessed more than 20 years ago to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's classmates at a Maine treatment center for troubled
youths said that Ethel Kennedy's nephew, alternating between
anguish and arrogance, told them separately in 1978 that he had
killed a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel boasted: ``I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a
Kennedy,'' testified Gregory Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-classmate, John Higgins, said that during a tearful,
rambling, soul-purging on a porch at the Elan School in Poland
Spring, Maine, Skakel also confessed to him.
</P>
<P>
   As Higgins testified Tuesday morning, according to court artist
Christine Cornell, Skakel mouthed an obscenity at his former
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful testimony occurred during the opening day of a
single-judge hearing to determine whether ``reasonable cause''
exists to try Skakel for murder, and whether the case should be
transferred to Superior Court. In January, a grand jury indicted
Skakel, 39, for the 1975 murder of his next-door neighbor in a
gated neighborhood in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel and Moxley were both 15-year-old juveniles when she was
bludgeoned and stabbed by a golf club traced to the Skakel family.
Moxley was found the day after she failed to return home from a
gathering at the Skakels' house, her body hidden under a pine tree
on her family's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's testimony marked the first time that Skakel has
publicly heard the evidence collected against him during the grand
jury proceedings. And after the morning session ended with Higgins'
testimony of a confession, Skakel left the courtroom shaken and
heaving with sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those were tears of joy,'' said John Moxley,
Martha's brother. ``He now knows this is real.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-classmates insisted under cross-examination that Skakel
confessed to murder. Coleman told State's Attorney Jonathan
Benedict that Skakel ``made a comment that he was trying to make
advances to this girl, and this girl was not complying with those
advances, and then drove her skull in.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel also admitted the slaying during ``primal scream''
sessions, Coleman said, in which students were told to yell
apologies in an effort to confront their guilt. Joe Ricci, the
owner and operator of the Elan School, told The Boston Globe in
March that he is convinced Michael Skakel did not kill Moxley and
that his former students who claim he confessed to the murder are
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who is serving a one-year sentence in New York state
for criminal trespass, testified Tuesday that Skakel told him he
had returned to the body and masturbated over it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``Mickey'' Sherman, Skakel's attorney, had only begun to
question Coleman when he asked for an adjournment until this
morning. Earlier in the day, he called Higgins' testimony
``garbage'' after subjecting the Illinois man to a ferocious
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Both Higgins and Coleman said they did not speak with
authorities about the alleged confessions until several years ago,
after they had contacted television news and crime shows that had
focused on the unsolved case.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins admitted to Sherman that he had lied when he told
investigators as recently as three years ago that Skakel never
confessed to him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Higgins said, he lied only because he did not want to
become involved in the case. But he said that as his conscience
began to weigh more heavily on him, he called Dorothy Moxley, the
victim's mother, and asked her whether she wanted him to testify.
When she said yes, Higgins said, he decided to come forward and
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that your final answer,'' asked Sherman, in one of many
sarcastic questions designed to damage Higgins' credibility before
Judge Maureen Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very amusing,'' Higgins replied.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman pressed the issue: ``Are you telling the truth today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' answered Higgins, his arms spread wide in exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know?'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins fired back, a finger pointed at Skakel: ``The one person
who knows is sitting right there, and that's the only one who
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy that,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins testified that Skakel confessed during a late-night
conversation while the pair acted as staff-appointed ``police'' to
monitor the activities of other students at Elan, which Higgins
described as ``a place to hide your kids if they bothered you.''
</P>
<P>
   While he listened in silence that night, Higgins said, Skakel
recounted taking a golf club from a bag in his home's garage,
running through pine woods, and then blacking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't know whether he (killed Moxley). He couldn't
remember if he did it,'' Higgins said. ``He eventually said that he
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman asked: ``Did Michael Skakel tell you he committed this
crime?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he did,'' Higgins replied.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses at Tuesday's hearing included former Greenwich
police chief Thomas Keegan, who conceded that the Skakels
reportedly left golf clubs lying on their grounds. However, he
scoffed at the theory that a transient committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you are in Belle Haven, a gated community, with lots of
cops around,'' Keegan said. ``It just doesn't seem probable that
someone wanders into Belle Haven, finds a golf club, and kills
Martha. ... It defies logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Moxley's battered corpse were shown to Sheila
McGuire, a friend who was the first to discover the body, which she
initially believed to be an egg crate.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible discovery still haunts her, McGuire testified.

SENATE VOTES BILL EXPANDING HATE CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Invoking the memories of those killed out of
bigotry, the US Senate Tuesday approved a sweeping measure
expanding protection under the federal hate crimes law and
extending it for the first time to victims of violence on the basis
of gender, sexual orientation or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-42 vote surprised the proposal's sponsors, who had
summoned Vice President Al Gore from the campaign trail in Kentucky
to cast a tie-breaking vote, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpectedly wide margin of the Senate vote is also fueling
once-meager hopes by supporters that the House _ which rejected the
hate crimes legislation last year _ might go along with it in this
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say we have equal protection of the laws only if
you're a white male, if you have no disability, (or) if you are
straight,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, author of the bill, said
during floor debate. ``Equal protection of the laws must apply to
all Americans. That's what this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were effusive in thanking Gore for his help in
passing the bill, although all he did was preside over the vote.
Serving as president of the Senate, Gore's role was a common one
for those who sit in the elevated chair at the front of the
chamber: chiding senators for talking too loudly during the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an enormous difference,'' Kennedy insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that every time Al Gore comes to Congress, we
win,'' said Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota.
He likened the measure in importance to the Civil Rights Act of
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was referring to the fact that Gore, as a Democrat,
would naturally vote with his party and give Senate Democrats a
victory in case of a tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's very presence also put pressure on Republicans, who
are reluctant to give the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee the opportunity to swoop dramatically into the Senate,
break a tie and take credit for getting landmark legislation
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, we figured that if everything cut our way, we'd
have 52 votes,'' Kennedy said after the measure passed. ``With that
kind of energy behind it,'' House approval of the proposal _
considered extremely unlikely as late as Tuesday afternoon _ is
within reach, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was an amendment to a massive defense bill, dubbed a
``flypaper'' bill because it has attracted more than 100 amendments
unrelated to defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the headcount still razor-thin at midday, Gore interrupted
his campaigning in Knoxville and Des Moines to dash to Capitol Hill
for the vote. ``It's my job,'' Gore quipped when asked why he was
there.
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew 13 Republican votes. All New England senators
voted for the amendment except for New Hampshire's two senators,
Republicans Judd Gregg and Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged aggressive support from the White House, but he
declined to say whether President Clinton would veto the defense
bill if it does not include the hate crimes amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed a defense spending authorization
bill, and it does not include a provision about hate crimes. That
means the Kennedy amendment could be kept when the House and Senate
work out a compromise defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House could also attach the hate crimes measure to another
bill, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the United States Senate at its best,'' Gore told
reporters afterward. ``This vote is a sign of hope for all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked what the White House would do to pressure House
Republicans to approve the hate crimes measure, Gore said, ``I'm
not going to engage in a lot of hypotheticals about what's going to
happen at the end of the session.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would expand an existing 1968 hate crimes law to
allow greater federal prosecution of bias crimes. Currently,
federal law enforcement can intervene only if the victim is being
prevented from participating in a federally-protected activity,
such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two states, including Massachusetts, have hate-crimes
laws. But some localities are reluctant to prosecute under their
own bias crimes laws, or lack the resources to do it alone, backers
of the Kennedy measure argue.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure would also expand the groups specifically
protected from hate crimes, adding gender, sexual orientation and
disability to the existing categories of race, color, religion and
national origin.
</P>
<P>
   No one spoke on the Senate floor against the general idea of
hate crimes legislation. Only Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of
Utah, openly citicized Kennedy's proposal, saying it was too broad
and gave too much power to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These crimes are important to me and to all Americans. They
should be stopped,'' Hatch told his Senate colleagues during
debate. But ``the system is working,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Utah lawmaker offered his own, weaker amendment to
commission a Justice Department study of hate crimes. Echoing the
concerns of other opponents of the Kennedy language, Hatch warned
that singling out certain groups for special protection is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's amendment also passed, 50-49. The full Congress could
accept either or both of the senators' amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative organizations opposed both the Hatch and
Kennedy amendments, saying hate crimes laws raise the specter of
``thought police'' who would punish individuals for their
motivations and not simply the violence they commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to what a person thinks, instead of what he does,''
said Heather Cirmo, a spokeswoman for the Family Research Council.
``Christians and people of faith'' could be unfairly persecuted if
they continue with their campaign against homosexuality, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kennedy measure addresses violent acts _ not hateful
speech _ Cirmo said the proposal creates a ``slippery slope'' that
could encourage restriction of speech alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Capitol Hill was far more heavily lobbied by families of
bias crime victims, law enforcement officials and the White House,
who recalled the tragic stories of James Byrd Jr. and Matthew
Shepard. Byrd, an African-American man, was dragged to his death in
Texas. Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, was beaten and
tied to a post, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a legislative miracle occur here today,'' said
Elizabeth Birth, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
rights organization. Birch said she had spoken to Shepard's
parents, who said Matthew was ``smiling down'' at the Senate for
its action.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal was one of the most dominating
forces in the history of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal turned the 7-foot-4 Pacers center into the incredible
shrinking man by averaging 38 points and 16.7 rebounds during the
six-game series. O'Neal climaxed his terrific series Monday night
with 41 points and 12 rebounds as the Lakers survived Indiana in
Game 6, 116-111, to win the NBA title and the best-of-seven series,
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Neal, it was the sweetest of moments. O'Neal, 7-foot-1,]
had been belittled by critics in the past because his teams had a
penchant for ending their postseasons on the wrong end of a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1999-2000 season, O'Neal did the sweeping. He joined
Willis Reed and Michael Jordan as the only players to win Most
Valuable Player honors in the All-Star Game, the regular season and
the NBA Finals in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years, and this is what I
wanted to come to the NBA for,'' O'Neal said of his first NBA
title. ``Growing up, I used to see Larry \RBird\S and Magic
\RJohnson\S celebrate. Mike \RJordan\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the Finals in '95 \Rwith Orlando\S. I saw Hakeem
\ROlajuwon\S and Robert Horry celebrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, O'Neal can celebrate in style after dismantling the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was huge,'' Lakers forward Rick Fox said. ``People don't
realize until they play with him how much he makes you better. How
much easier the game is when he is on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, who completed his first season coaching the
Lakers, questioned whether O'Neal was in really good basketball
shape the past two seasons. O'Neal, in turn, said there's no way
the Lakers would have won it all without Jackson barking the
commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his resume, guys believed in him,'' O'Neal said.
``When he came in from the first day of training camp, it was no
nonsense. Being here in previous years before, coaches talking,
guys messing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Phil came in and said what he had to say, because of his
resume _ and we all know his resume _ we knew it was no nonsense.
He said, `If you don't do what I say, you're not going to be here.
If you don't like the way I handle it, let me know and we'll get
you out of here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of discipline I was used to with my father,
from LSU with Dale Brown. It was nice to go back to that
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said it was nice that O'Neal could stay
healthy the entire season. O'Neal missed more than 50 games in his
first three seasons with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq had a hole in his abdomen last year,'' Bryant said.
``That's a tough thing to play with.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, Shaq was completely healthy and he just
attacked from the beginning of the season, and he's been great for
us all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal, 28, and Bryant, who turns 22 on Aug. 23, there's
talk of a Lakers dynasty. Pacers coach Larry Bird said as long as
O'Neal is patrolling the middle, beating the Lakers in a playoff
series will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most dominating player in our league,'' Bird said.
``He's powerful, strong, able to get the ball in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's improved immensely, starting to make shots farther from
the basket. He's just so dominating that they have an opportunity
here to do something great for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers tried double- and triple-teaming O'Neal. They tried
Hack-a-Shaq. But no X's and O's have been able to contain the
self-proclaimed ``Big Aristotle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Shaquille O'Neal in the middle, he's very dominating,''
Bird said. ``He was phenomenal throughout the series.''

TESTIMONY BEGINS IN WACO 
WRONGFUL DEATH TRIAL &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Following the botched raid on the Branch Davidian
compound, federal agents admitted to police they fired blindly into
windows without knowing what they were shooting at, a federal jury
was told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, lead attorney for the more than 100 Davidians
and families suing the federal government over the raid, read the
statements from more than two dozen Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents to the jury. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It took Caddell nearly an hour to get through the statements,
which painted a picture of agents shooting at shadows and
fluttering curtains after they were repelled with gunfire from
arresting Davidian leader David Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people, including four ATF agents, were killed in the hail
of gunfire. Inside the compound, among those killed was a mother
shot in front of her 8-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of shooting was going on in violation of
instructions given to the agents,'' said Jim Brannon of Houston,
another attorney for the plaintiffs. ``You don't just shoot
generally. You shoot at specific targets.``
</P>
<P>
   Indiscriminate gunfire is one of four key elements to the case,
Caddell told the jury. The others are the FBI's deviation from a
plan approved by Attorney General Janet Reno to end the standoff;
the FBI's actions that caused the deadly fire; and the FBI's
failure to have firefighting equipment on the scene, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout led to a 51-day standoff that ended April 19 in an
inferno that killed 80 Davidians, including 25 children.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit against the federal government, survivors claim
ATF and FBI agents caused the deaths of innocent people both in the
way the initial assault was conducted and in the way the siege was
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first day of testimony in the trial before U.S.
District Judge Walter Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs presented Smith and the six-person jury with the
statements ATF agents gave to Texas Rangers following the assault
on Mount Carmel. Many of the agents said they fired into the
building even though they never saw anyone through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anyone shooting at our people,'' said sniper Paul
J. Smith's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said after he realized AFT agents had not entered the
compound, ``I just started shooting at those windows. I put 30 or
40 rounds in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did I see any occupant, other than shadows
moving,'' agent Mark Murray told the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the consequences of the gunfire, Caddell put
16-year-old Jauness Wendel on the stand. She was 8 in 1993 and was
in her room at Mount Carmel with her mother and three siblings when
the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the room was armed, she said. Her mother was killed by
the gunfire that shattered the windows and spewed glass into the
crib where her 1-year-old brother was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not here to defend David Koresh,'' Caddell said, ``but
the Davidians did not ambush the ATF.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell began the day with a video of children who died in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   As each child's image appeared on the screen, Caddell gave the
name, age and repeated, ``never owned a gun, never fired a gun,
never broke the law, never hurt anyone.``
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford told the
jury that ``the evidence will show that the responsibility (for the
deaths) should not be placed on the shoulders of the brave men and
women of the ATF and the FBI. David Koresh and the Branch Davidians
themselves were responsible for those events.''
</P>
<P>
   Mount Carmel, Bradford said, was ``an armed compound'' presided
over by Koresh, who had warned his followers that the end would
come in an armed conflict with the ATF. He quoted Koresh as saying,
``If you can't kill for God, you can't die for God.``
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Caddell said Bradford offered the jury
``a case he can't deliver. It was just his spin on things.''

UNDERDOG STATUS BOTHERS OLYMPIC WRESTLING HOPEFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEIDI PEDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stephen Neal thought his days in the underdog role were
over.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 265-pound Neal had captured amateur wrestling
titles at will for the past three years. The triumphs included
perfect 1998 and 1999 NCAA seasons at California State-Bakersfield,
then freestyle crowns at the 1999 U.S. nationals, Pan American
Games and World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   All this, before age 24. In October, little seemed to stand
between Stephen Neal and the 2000 Olympic Games super-heavyweight
title.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months later, Neal finds himself in a struggle for a
berth on the U.S. Olympic team. His nemesis, Kerry McCoy, defeated
him in the final at the 2000 U.S. nationals in April. The two are
expected to meet again Saturday in the final at the U.S. Olympic
team trials, which start tomorrow at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd believed no one could stop my shots. But they've been
stopping them this year,'' said Neal, a four-time NCAA All-American
who continues to train at Cal State-Bakersfield. ``But when someone
beats me I always try to find why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me put in a lot more hard work, and I think I'm in the
best shape of my life right now. I guess we'll see in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the Worlds in October, the California native has
had to face more than being the prime target of opponents. A torn
right-shoulder muscle suffered at a training camp in July was
repaired through arthroscopic surgery two weeks after the Worlds,
and recovery took longer than Neal expected.
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Neal said he stayed off the mat for three
months, and did little of his usual conditioning before January. He
said he gained about 10 pounds during the layoff, up from his usual
260.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably let myself get a little farther out of shape than I
should have,'' he said. ``I let my body fat percentage get up a
little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal, who possesses unusual quickness for a heavyweight, had
become known for his ability to attack with force for an entire
match. The longer he sat out of training, the more he lost
conditioning, one of the primary advantages he had had on
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCoy, a Penn State graduate who had defeated Neal in
the 1997 NCAA final and in one bout at the '99 World Trials, won
the 2000 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Neal's layoff showed when he returned to competition in March.
In his first tournament since the World Championships, he lost his
first match, 5-4, in Bulgaria to David Musulbes of Russia. Neal
went on to dominate two Bulgarians and place fifth, but he said his
performance was a sign that he needed to get back to work,
regardless of the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Though Neal started training full time again, his coach, T.J.
Kerr of Cal State-Bakersfield, said Neal wasn't in prime condition
at nationals. There, he defeated three opponents before he fell
behind in the final and lost to McCoy, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said he thinks the loss upset Neal more than the wrestler
would admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really talk about it, but when you \Rwin\S
everything possible and then you lose the national championships,
that's got to really bother him,'' Kerr said. ``Now he's got some
things to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the loss, Neal's training program was redesigned.
In addition to intensifying his mat time and running, he began
following weightlifting and nutrition programs designed by a
bodybuilder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leaner and stronger now. We think we've gotten him better
than he's ever been,'' Kerr said. ``We think that with Steve in the
best possible shape, with his mind ready to compete, things will
take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory at nationals earned McCoy an automatic berth in the
finals at the Olympic trials. Neal will have to win the
mini-tournament, which takes place tomorrow and Friday, to earn the
right to face McCoy in the finals. The wrestler who wins two out of
three matches Saturday wins the Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Neal said thoughts of the Olympics are all the motivation he
needs to do his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you train for. I think Kerry and I pretty much
are wrestling for a gold medal,'' he said. ``It's hard to wait
around another four years. For me, it's right now.''

CLINTON SEEKS TO DELAY FINAL MISSILE DECISION UNTIL NEXT
ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is quietly maneuvering
to sidestep a contentious decision over whether to build a national
missile defense system, playing down the significance of the
Pentagon's next test of the system and leaving final decisions on
deployment to the next administration, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avert a diplomatic and political crisis over breaking
the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, administration and
military officials have begun emphasizing that President Clinton
faces a decision this fall only on whether a defense shield is
feasible to counter missile threats.
</P>
<P>
   More binding decisions on building a radar site on Shemya Island
in Alaska and deploying the first of 100 interceptor missiles do
not have to be made until 2001 and 2003, well after Clinton leaves
office, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the president has to decide this year is
whether to put out'' a request for bids to begin work at Shemya
Island, a senior Pentagon official said. ``And even then, the
contract will be written so the next administration can change it.
The name of the game now is not foreclosing any options.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has expressed support for building a national
missile defense, something long advocated by Republicans, the
administration's goals have shifted markedly in the past few months
as the Russians have balked at revising the ABM Treaty to allow the
deployment of an American system.
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have already drafted legal arguments for
Clinton that would allow him to give a preliminary approval to move
ahead with construction of the first phase of the system on Shemya
Island, without having to announce a withdrawal from the treaty.
Several officials said Clinton did not want to make breaking the
treaty his lasting legacy in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The administration imposed the deadlines that it is now having
trouble meeting. The timetable was designed by the Pentagon to meet
possible missile threats to American territory, specifically those
posed by North Korea, which has an active ballistic missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the timetable, Clinton was faced with making a crucial
decision on whether to move ahead with the system and announce a
withdrawal from the treaty. That decision had been timed to the
Pentagon's tests of prototypes of its highly complex system of
radars and interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' recommendations have now taken considerable
pressure off the next test, which the Pentagon announced Tuesday
would held on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   For months, officials have portrayed the test, which has already
been delayed by three months, as a make-or-break milestone in the
program's development. But now they say that because Clinton's
decision does not have to be a final, binding one, the test's
success or failure is not as crucial to the Pentagon's plans.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the Pentagon on Tuesday, the
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology, Jacques
S. Gansler, suggested that the Pentagon could recommend moving
ahead with the initial stages of development even if the next test
is not a complete success. Because more tests are planned and the
president must simply approve preliminary steps toward
construction, the test need only to indicate the program is
feasible, not actually ready to deploy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past few months, the debate over national missile
defenses has become more complicated, particularly in light of the
Russian refusal to renegotiate the treaty and what the
administration describes as the surprising depth of opposition from
allies wary that a defensive shield could spark an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing, bipartisan chorus from lawmakers on
Capitol Hill urging postponement of a final decision on deployment
to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   The two presumptive presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, have both expressed support
for a system and not put pressure on Clinton to make any binding
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and defense officials said the next missile test
remains important but has become less significant as the
administration tries to find a course somewhere between stirring a
diplomatic crisis by moving ahead with the system and a potential
political crisis for Gore by deciding not to.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan next month, an aging Minuteman II
missile will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California toward the South Pacific. An interceptor missile will be
fired from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands about 20 minutes
later and, after receiving communications from a complex array of
radars and command centers, home in on its target.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in a statement that the
test would be ``our most demanding yet,'' but the statement went on
to say that ``at least 16 more intercept tests'' were planned
before the system is to be fielded in 2005, including eight before
the decision in 2003 to actually buy interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The officials appeared to play down the test, in part because
they fear it will fail. One senior officer rated the chances of
success as no better than 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   The two previous tests of interceptor missiles had mixed
results. One in October succeeded in striking its target, but the
most recent one, in January, failed. The Pentagon has said it would
need to have two successful intercepts before moving ahead, but, as
Gansler suggested, officials appear increasingly confident that the
system is at least technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   An independent review of the Pentagon's program, led by a
retired Air Force general, Larry D. Welch, concluded in a report
released Tuesday that the ``technical capability to develop and
field the limited system'' against a relatively unsophisticated
threat like North Korea's ``is available.''

SENATE KILLS PLAN FOR PANEL TO REVIEW CUBAN EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Tuesday to defeat an effort to
create a special commission to study the effectiveness of the U.S.
economic embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was struck from the defense authorization bill by
a vote of 59 to 41, after Republicans and a few Democrats rallied
against it, calling the measure ill-timed, ill-advised and a
backhanded attempt to change Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have created a commission in which
Republicans, who tend to support the Cuban embargo, would have been
outnumbered by Democrats, who tend to want to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat came as no surprise. Even Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,
the Connecticut Democrat who was one of the measure's sponsors, and
who has long worked to end sanctions against Cuba, did not expect
the amendment to survive. But it served a larger purpose for
critics of the Castro government: to keep the debate over Cuba
policy alive on Capitol Hill at a time when the Clinton
administration is softening on sanctions against other defiant
nations. On Monday, Clinton announced he would lift sanctions
against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who voted to remove the amendment was Sen. John W.
Warner, the Virginia Republican. Warner, the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, originally cosponsored the measure, an
indication of just how sensitive the issue of American's foreign
policy toward Cuba remains.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a commission said that American policy toward Cuba
was outdated. ``Castro is in no position to export revolution, none
whatsoever,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, referring
to the country's financial crisis. ``According to the Pentagon,
Castro represents no real threat to national security. So times
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have in place a policy that has not worked in 40 years. It
was a different world in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   But the measure's opponents argued that nothing has changed, so
Cuba should not be rewarded by a commission likely to recommend
ending the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same regime that sent its troops to Africa to
further the cause of Communism,'' said Sen. John McCain, the
Arizona Republican, who said he supported lifting sanctions against
the communist government of Vietnam but only after it carried out
new policies. ``It's the same regime that continues to repress and
oppress its people.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the United States should alter its
foreign policy toward Cuba, specifically on trade, took on new life
this year, when a powerful coalition that included agribusiness
giants increased pressure on lawmakers from farming states to open
new markets. Human rights organizations and major business groups,
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have also lobbied
extensively on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two Senate and House delegations sympathetic to the call for
weakening or lifting sanctions recently visited Cuba to see
conditions there for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders continue to grapple over how to proceed
on a measure, which some of them oppose, that would permit the
export of food and medicine to Cuba under certain restrictions. The
measure, sponsored by Rep. George Nethercutt, a Washington
Republican, has delayed consideration of the huge agriculture
spending bill. A similar provision has already passed the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including Cuban-American lawmakers, say they are
ready to fight back. And Nethercutt is up against a formidable
opponent, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, who has tried
once already to strip the provision from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, has also
come out in opposition to the provision.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the Cuban American National Foundation, the
anti-Castro lobbying group, began running television ads reminding
voters that Cuba is run by a communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Cuban-American lawmakers want to ensure that
Cuba will be denied private and public financing to purchase food
and medicine. The Nethercutt measure excludes public financing and
is silent on other forms, House Republican aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``American farmers are being told, if only you can sell some
crops to Cuba, your crisis will be relieved,'' said Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat. ``Cuba has no money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders face a quandary over how to handle
Nethercutt in this election year. He is a Republican who faces a
tough re-election effort in a one-time Democratic district. And
Nethercutt maintains he has enough votes to win on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he and the two Florida senators met with Warner
to try to persuade him to set aside the measure, arguing that the
best time to create a commission is after a new president is
elected. ``It makes more sense for a new president to consider the
idea,'' he said.

L.A. CITY COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON MONEY FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A besieged Los Angeles City Council has put off a
decision on a $4 million payment to stage the Democratic National
Convention, citing concerns over how the money will be used and if
it should be in the form of a direct payment or a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Council members asked on Tuesday that more details be provided,
possibly as early as Friday, on the impact on the city's finances
and whether other ways - such as a temporary hike in the hotel bed
tax - could be used to repay part of the money. Officials
immediately expressed doubt about the legality of a bed tax hike
unless it is put to a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   The request from the convention's Host Committee for the money -
because its private fund raising has fallen short - has stirred a
controversy among city officials and the public, with radio talk
shows and the Daily News giving out the council office telephone
numbers to urge officials not to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Council offices reported receiving hundreds of calls and
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   And, the more-than-hourlong debate pitted council member
frustration with the convention's Host Committee as well as
competing political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I resent being put into this position,''
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said. ``Frankly, there's been no
outreach from the Host Committee to my office. I haven't been asked
for any input ... or any actual involvement. Now, my involvement is
sincerely requested when you're $4 million short. To say I don't
resent it would be a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Noelia Rodriguez, head of the Host Committee, acknowledged the
problems the committee has had in raising the money and said she
was ``humbly'' requesting the city help.
</P>
<P>
   The problem faced by the committee is that it needs the money by
July 1 to pay contractors for work to be done at Staples Center for
the convention, Rodriguez said, adding her group would prefer a
direct payment from the city rather than a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez pointed to the $32.5 million that has been raised
privately, more than any other host committee, and said she was
looking to expand the group's partnership with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great investment for the taxpayers of Los Angeles,''
Rodriguez said. ``The Democratic Convention is expected to generate
about $135 million in direct economic benefit for Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   She also cited the amounts invested by other jurisdictions in
their hosting of other political conventions. In Philadelphia, some
$17 million in direct cash payments from government were received
for this year's Republican National Convention, and in 1996, the
Chicago Host Committee received $14 million in public funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Joel Wachs questioned the need for city funds now
and raised the credibility problems it created.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really have here is a few of the richest men in Los
Angeles asking the city to bail them out of their financial
obligations,'' Wachs said. ``That redefines what chutzpah is all
about. It is a slap in the face of every citizen who expects this
government to spend money in their interests and not the affluent
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a deal and said we would provide all the services we
would provide any convention. We are honoring that deal. It is time
for those who put in writing that they would raise all the money
that they live up to their end of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But other council members argued the Host Committee and its
principal backers - billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle - had
done well and it was the city that would be embarrassed if the
convention did not go off well.
</P>
<P>
   ``However uncomfortable we may be with this, I don't think we
have a whole lot of choices,'' Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said.
``The fact of the matter is, it is the city that will hosting all
these people. They're not going to turn around and say the Host
Committee didn't do this or didn't do that. They're going to say it
was the city of Los Angeles that didn't do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Galanter and others noted the convention provided an opportunity
for the city to redeem itself from the dismal millennium New Year's
Eve party.
</P>
<P>
   It was Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas who asked for the delay on
the vote to get more information from city staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have confidence that our own staff knows where this
money is going and that it is needed,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``I do
not recall a time when we have allocated money without knowing how
it will be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Hal Bernson came up with the proposal to have the
city lend the money to the Host Committee as well as the temporary
increase in the bed tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to put on a good show but we also don't want to
use tax dollars,'' Bernson said. ``If we loan them the money, then
we will get some assurances it will be paid back as they continue
their fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   While some skepticism was voiced over the proposal on how the
Host Committee could guarantee any repayment, other officials said
they believed it was worth studying.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the council did agree to make a $2
million payment to the Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau
to contract for shuttle buses during the convention.

NEW TEST FOR LUNG CANCER RAISES ANEW QUESTIONS ABOUT EARLY
DETECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When word got out recently that two radiology centers in
Portland, Ore., were offering a new screening test for the early
detection of lung cancer, the response was overwhelming. Smokers
and former smokers jammed the centers' phones, demanding the
simple, painless test that can find lung cancers so tiny that they
can be snipped out and, doctors hope, the patients cured.
</P>
<P>
   In a single day, more than 300 people called one of the centers,
Epic Imaging. ``I got in at 6:30 that morning and didn't get off
the phone until 6:30 that night,'' said Melanie Haymond, a
marketing director there.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by newspaper articles and Epic's brochures describing the
test as ``fast, inexpensive, lifesaving,'' patients readily agreed
to Epic's $295 fee, even though the test is not covered by most
health insurance policies because it is considered experimental.
They even agreed to pay half of the money at the time of the test,
as Epic required.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene that is being repeated throughout the country as
more and more radiologists begin advertising the lung cancer
screening test. It is done with a powerful new X-ray machine, a
spiral CT scanner, which can detect tumors many times smaller than
those found with a conventional chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts agree that there is an urgent need to improve the
prospects for patients with lung cancer. It is the nation's leading
cause of cancer deaths, killing about 157,000 Americans every year,
more than colon, breast, prostate and uterine cancers combined.
Lung cancer is diagnosed in about 164,000 people each year, but the
five-year survival rate is just 14 percent _ virtually the same as
it was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden proliferation of the test is giving rise to
wrenching questions because the scanner's effectiveness has not yet
been rigorously tested. One study shows that most people who have
suspicious test findings will not have cancer _ but they will have
to have additional expensive tests, and sometimes surgery to find
out. For the rest there are three possibilities. Some may be cured
when surgeons snip out their tumors. Others may have tumors that
may turn out not to have been dangerous after all, but they still
would have had treatments as though their lives were threatened.
And still others may have tiny tumors that turn out to be incurable
despite the treatments.
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that researchers say are going to occur more
and more often as science makes it possible to find a variety of
diseases at earlier and earlier stages.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier that diseases are found, the less that is known
about their likely course and the more difficult the questions.
Molecular tests are being developed for bladder cancer and colon
cancer, for example, that would look for individual genes that go
awry, long before any tumors are evident. Scientists are working on
scanning tests for early Alzheimer's disease and on ever more
precise ways of finding very early breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But seldom have the stakes been so high and the choices so stark
as with the new lung cancer test.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of testing all current and former smokers with the lung
scanner would be immense _ more than $39 billion, according to the
National Cancer Institute. Yet if the test works, it could save
hundreds of thousands of lives and alleviate terrible suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a huge debate,'' said Dr. Jonathan Goldin, a
radiologist at the University of California in Los Angeles.
``There's an academic interest, there's a health policy interest,
there's a highly emotional desire to do good for patients. And then
there's an economic interest _ you can make a fair amount of money
right now if you opened up a spiral scanner and said, `Let's go for
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using the spiral CT scanners to find early lung
cancers began with an iconoclast, Dr. Claudia L. Henschke, the
division chief of chest imaging at Weill Cornell Medical Center of
New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She knew that most
scientists dismissed lung cancer screening as useless. Doctors
could find the cancer early with chest X-rays. But studies
indicated that the lives of these patients had not been prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Henschke wondered whether advances in technology might have
changed the prospects for lung cancer screening. A new generation
of X-ray machines, the spiral CT, or computerized tomography,
scanners, could show nodules as small as the diameter of a soda
straw, compared with the the quarter-size tumors that were seen
with chest X-rays. Could it be, Henschke asked, that the spiral
scanners, already widely used by radiologists, could find lung
cancers so early that they could be cured?
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1991. ``No one was willing to talk about it,''
Henschke said. ``They said it's a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the skeptics, Henschke organized a study of 1,000
smokers and former smokers, examining each person's lungs with both
spiral CT scans and with conventional chest X-rays and comparing
what the two machines found. When the radiologists saw very small
nodules, they asked the patients to come back in a few months to
see if the nodules were growing. If a nodule grew, patients needed
more tests, sometimes involving surgery, to see if it was
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   With the spiral CT scans, 23 percent of the people had
suspicious nodules but only 2.7 percent of them turned out to have
cancer. Almost all the tumors were in Stage 1, meaning they had not
yet spread. Chest X-rays found suspicious nodules in 7 percent of
the people but only 0.7 percent of them had cancer. Half of the
tumors were in Stage 1. The rest were more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Henschke's paper was published in a British medical journal, The
Lancet, on July 10 last year and reported widely in the news media,
setting off a groundswell of demand for the test because she showed
that lung cancer can be detected early.
</P>
<P>
   The University Radiology Group in New Brunswick, N.J., began
advertising its $295 test on the radio and in newspapers last
December, drawing 200 patients. ``We already had the scanner, so it
was not a big deal,'' said Dr. Judith Korek Amorosa, a radiologist
there.

SENATE APPROVES EXPANSION 
OF FEDERAL HATE CRIME LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
 CRIMES-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved legislation Tuesday that would
broaden federal hate crime laws to include protections for gays and
the disabled following an aggressive lobbying effort by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved 57-42, was prompted in part by the public
outrage over two brutal 1998 murders, one involving the dragging
death in Texas of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man, and the
beating death in Wyoming of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay
college student.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore interrupted his campaign for the
presidency to preside over the Senate in case his support was
needed to break a tie vote. But 13 Republicans joined with 44
Democrats to help pass the measure by a wide margin, leaving Gore
with no other job in the proceedings than to announce the final
tally.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton applauded the Senate action. ``This amendment
recognizes that hate crimes are different from other crimes,'' he
said in a statement. ``These crimes affect entire communities and
strike at the heart of our American system of values.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., would expand 1968 federal hate
crime statute involving religion, national origin and race to
include new categories specifically related to offenses motivated
by sexual orientation, disability or gender. It would also make it
easier for prosecutors to prove hatred as a criminal motive, and
give them more freedom to decide whether to step in if local
authorities decline to pursue a case.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure drew more Republican support than expected,
its future is unclear because the Senate also approved a competing
hate crimes amendment offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch measure, which passed 50-49 shortly before the
Kennedy-Smith bill was brought up, calls for a federal study of
hate-crimes prosecutions by state and local authorities and adds $5
million more to the Justice Department budget for the prosecution
of hate crimes. But Hatch stopped short of adding any new
categories to the federal laws, saying he believes that local
governments are doing well enough on their own dealing with crimes
of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Both amendments will now be attached to a larger defense
spending bill, which has been bogged down in the Senate for weeks
because it is being used as a vehicle for hundreds of unrelated
measures that senators on both sides of the aisle would like to see
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday there
may be as many 100 more amendments to the bill to consider, and he
suggested that the entire measure might have to be set aside
indefinitely unless members can come to some agreement on detaching
unrelated amendments from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opposed the administration-supported bill, saying it would
``federalize'' many violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``State laws are working and doing a fine job,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hatch and the Kennedy-Smith amendments were identical
to two competing measures that were approved by the Senate last
year by unanimous consent. But the House voted down a hate crimes
bill of its own last spring, and the Senate measures never survived
a conference with the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he hopes the legislation's fate will be different
this year, given the outrage many Americans feel in the aftermath
of the Byrd and Sheppard cases. He urged the House to take up the
issue again this year to ensure that a final bill gets to the
president for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House leaders have said they have no plans to
schedule a vote this year on hate crimes legislation. But Gore
suggested that the administration may use the threat of a veto on
other legislation to help force action by the House. &QL;

 UNDATED: radiologist there.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix began advertising its
$500 test last December, bringing in 300 people so far, said
Jeannie Swindle, the vice president for marketing there. The
institute even offers specials, such as the one it had in May, when
it reduced its price by more than $100, Swindle said.
</P>
<P>
   Many who had the lung scans were delighted. Kenneth MacWilliams,
a 63-year-old investment banker in Dumont, N.J., went to Henschke's
office for a test last year because he had breathed other peoples'
smoke at work. His scan showed no signs of tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no downside for me,'' MacWilliams said.
``Why would I not want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   But as the lung scans are being promoted, one gap in the logic
remains. Henschke's study had shown that spiral CT scanners could
find tiny lung cancers. What it did not show was whether finding
them saved lives. And that is fueling the bitter debate over how
much evidence of that is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fundamental question,'' said Dr. David F.
Yankelevitz, Henschke's colleague at Cornell. ``These are critical
issues, and it's a discussion that needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Henschke cannot convince herself that there is much more to ask.
She knows the hypothetical problems with early detection, but she
does not believe they apply to lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically, we know you can cure cancer only when you get it at
an early stage,'' Henschke said. ``CT gets it much much earlier.
The only thing that has to be documented is how many lives are
saved.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthodox way to find out is to randomly assign patients to
have the lung scanning test, or not, and then compare outcomes. If
more people die in the unscreened group, it can be concluded that
the test is saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   But, Henschke asks, how many people are going to enroll in such
a study? Who would forgo a simple, painless test that could find
cancer early? And even if people did agree, would they hold off
having a lung scan for more than a decade while the study wound its
way to a conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the line, more and more people are going to be
convinced'' of the effectiveness of the test, Henschke said. ``What
do you do when your neighbor has a CT scan and it detects a nodule
and the nodule is cured?''
</P>
<P>
   So what Henschke is planning is almost scientific apostasy _ a
study in which everyone gets a CT scan. The researchers will use
statistical analyses to decide how much better people fared than
they would have if they had not been screened.
</P>
<P>
   Henschke said she could not conduct the study any other way. She
said she had seen too many patients with tiny cancerous tumors that
were removed and did not return, and too many who had no screening
and whose tumors were found too late. She could not conceive of
waiting well over a decade for a randomized clinical trial to
enroll patients, screen them and follow them as the study wound to
a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many lives will you be losing?'' Henschke said. ``If there
are 160,000 people who die from lung cancer each year, you could
save a lot of lives during that trial _ certainly over 100,000 from
my best estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health knows
the emotional pull of patients' stories, and he knows that when it
comes to arguing about lung cancer scans, he is at a disadvantage.
He does not do the scans and must rely instead on cold logic and
reasoning. But he does look at data, and at recent medical history.
And he is very worried about the rapid spread of spiral CT
screening for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer remembers the last time that doctors thought they had a
way of preventing lung cancer deaths. During the 1960s and 1970s,
many recommended that smokers and former smokers have regular chest
X-rays, and some also ordered tests of their sputum to look for
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, researchers managed to do large clinical trials that
asked whether such screenings saved lives. The results were
eye-opening. Although more cancers were found in the screened
group, and at earlier stages, the screenings did nothing to cut the
death rate from lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dr. David Eddy, who is an independent consultant and an
adviser to Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, summed up the
situation in a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
``It is important to emphasize that these conclusions are not based
on a lack of evidence of an effect,'' Eddy wrote, ``but are based
on good evidence that there is no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kramer, it was a valuable lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the classic case,'' Kramer said. ``You were picking up
cancers that would not have killed the patients, and you were
curing people who did not need to be cured. In exchange you were
doing a lot more surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancer institute hopes to do a large definitive study
involving at least 20,000 people who would be randomly assigned to
have a CT scan or, for comparison, to forgo it.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is optimistic that once the uncertainties of the lung
scan are explained, people will volunteer for the study.
</P>
<P>
   For now, medical experts said, the nation is poised at a
critical moment when a decision on how to proceed can reverberate
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there is no question that spiral CT is a promising
technology,'' said Dr. Paul S. Frame, a family practitioner in
Cohocton, N.Y., who is evaluating the lung scanner as a member of
the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes
recommendations on screening tests. ``But the fear and the caution
is that our society is geared to like miracles. And when somebody
mentions a miracle, nobody wants to wait around and see if it's
true. That's the dilemma we're in.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a carpentry shop at Ralph McKee Vocational and
Technical High School on Staten Island the other morning, a class
of 18 seniors put the finishing touches on their final projects for
the year _ filing and chiseling, making mailboxes and small round
tables. Their teacher, a cabinetmaker by trade, moved busily around
the work benches, helping with a measurement here and there.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a degree of resignation to go with all the eager
work: the carpentry class of 2000 will be McKee's last, and in
closing, it will be joining the school's list of recent casualties.
In the last two years, the school has shut down the plumbing and
electrical shops. The electrical shop, now a graphic arts
laboratory filled with computers, was closed after the teacher
retired and the school could not find a qualified replacement.
</P>
<P>
   McKee High is not alone. Facing a changed marketplace, dwindling
enrollment, years of fiscal neglect and immense pressure to raise
academic standards and prepare students for college, vocational
schools and programs in New York and across the country are
struggling to survive and rushing to reinvent themselves. In every
state, vocational schools _ many of them no longer using the word
vocational in their names _ are in some phase of transition, either
because of intense pressure to adapt to new demands or because
educators have seized the moment as an opportunity to turn them
around.
</P>
<P>
   At Thomas A. Edison High School in Queens, the plumbing shop
closed four years ago; George Westinghouse High School in Brooklyn
is closing the last of its jewelry-making shops this year and
phasing out its carpentry program. Fifteen years ago, there were
nearly 30 teachers of machine shop in the city's trade schools;
now, there are none. And the number of freshmen entering city
vocational schools has slid by more than a quarter in the last
three years alone. The schools have turned away from the building
trades even as industry officials have complained about a shortage
of skilled workers in plumbing and carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, McKee and schools like it sent legions of
students into the everyday, reliable work world of plumbing,
electrical installation, auto repair, hairdressing and carpentry.
In their glory, the city's vocational schools were stepping stones
for immigrants, as well as for the children of plumbers and
electricians and others, to get a good job and get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any degenerative illness,'' said Chuck Merten, who
taught plumbing at Edison until the shop was closed and he moved to
one of the school's few remaining electrical shops. ``You go along
not paying much attention to the aches and pains, and then you wake
up one day and you say, `Oh my God. I'm really sick.' I think
that's where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The condition of vocational education across the country runs a
wide gamut, from programs that are dying and fading to schools in a
state of confusion to some that have begun to thrive as they
redefine their missions, education experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like those in Fairfax County, Va., have eliminated
vocational education altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took vocational education out of everything we do in this
county,'' said John Witmann, administrator of the Chantilly Academy
for Engineering and Scientific Technology in Fairfax, which used to
be called the Chantilly Vocational School. ``It no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since the school was revamped, enrollment at
Chantilly, which offers several concentrations of study in
engineering and health and human services, has tripled, to 1,000
students from 300, Witmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, schools in Ohio, which had a long tradition of
teaching trades like welding, masonry and electricity, began to
eliminate many shop classes, folding them into more general
concentrations of study and allowing students more time for
academic courses, Ohio education officials said. Ohio, like New
York, has recently required all students to meet tougher academic
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing view that vocational education is not
an appropriate role for a high school education,'' said James R.
Stone III, deputy director of the National Center for Research in
Career and Technical Education, a federally funded research center
based in St. Paul, Minn. ``It is increasingly difficult to sustain
the traditional programs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York City, the range of explanations for the decline of
its once vaunted trade schools is wide: budget cuts and the sense
that the schools had become dumping grounds for students not smart
enough to go to college; waning interest among youngsters worried
about making their way in a high-technology economy; the difficulty
of keeping teachers who, in a booming marketplace, have no trouble
finding high-paying work.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not been made easier for the vocational schools in
recent years as the state has toughened its academic standards for
all high school students. The roughly 25,000 students at the city's
vocational schools, who used to balance their shop work with a more
modest academic curriculum tailored to their trades, will soon have
to pass the same statewide English and other exams as all other
students to earn their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   For many, there is the sense that the future of the city's 18
vocational schools is in peril, and that something legendary could
be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Schools like Harry Van Arsdale High in Brooklyn, Edison in
Queens and Alfred E. Smith in the Bronx were once known as great
training grounds for skilled craftsmen. They had a prestige in the
blue-collar world; even before students earned their diplomas,
stamped with vocational endorsements in their trades, they had jobs
or apprenticeships lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at several vocational schools that have eliminated
programs say they still get calls from plumbers, carpenters or
heating and cooling companies looking for graduates of the city's
vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had graduates working all over Queens and Brooklyn,'' said
Merten, who was a plumber before taking the Edison teaching job 25
years ago. ``They had four years of training and an endorsement
from a city school. That carried a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like Queens Vocational High School in Long Island
City, have held on to the traditional skilled trades. They have
refused to close down their shops, and in the process made what
they characterize as a principled and practical stand on the belief
that no matter how high-tech the world gets, someone is still going
to have to know how the toilet's plumbing works. Unlike many of the
city's vocational schools, it has not lost students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked working with my hands,'' said Byron Mendoza,
a senior at Queens Vocational who has studied plumbing there for
four years. ``It's hard work, but it's a good trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall from the plumbing shop, where Mendoza was cutting
and soldering pipes and testing them for leaks, Hugo Cruz, a senior
studying electrical installation, was finishing up a wiring job on
a 220-volt control panel, his final project for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how they say you have a natural-born talent,'' he
said. ``That's me. I love this job. I like to have pride in what I
do. If one day I build a whole building, I'll be able to look at it
and say I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Queens Vocational, which opened in 1929, still offers a full
complement of plumbing, electrical installation, cosmetology,
stenography and other traditional subjects. It has one of only two
plumbing shops left in the city's school system _ the other is at
Alfred E. Smith Vocational School in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that we are a vocational school and that is our
mission,'' said Steve Serber, the principal.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not been easy. For the vast majority of the city's 18
vocational schools, the challenge is perhaps best summed up by a
phrase on the brochure that McKee uses to promote its newly
designed computer technology program: ``adapt or perish.''
</P>
<P>
   For some schools, like McKee, whose 600 students are half as
many as it had in 1981, adapting has amounted to a complete
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The old machine shop will soon be used as a robotics shop. The
sheet-metal shop, the city's last when it was closed in the 1980s,
was turned into a guidance office. Fiber optics, computer
networking and graphic design, courses with a focus on the latest
technology, have taken the place of the traditional trades. The
plumbing, carpentry and electrical trades will be folded into one
broader program called construction technology, which the school
hopes will draw more students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rapid pace of change demands this,'' said McKee's
principal, Beverly L. Garcia-Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Many other New York City vocational schools, like Edison and
Grace H. Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx, now promote
themselves as academic institutions and emphasize college
preparation, with opportunities for vocational training sounding
almost like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators in vocational schools support the new focus on
college and academics, saying it will broaden the students'
knowledge, better prepare them for work and give them an education
that, with both academics and vocational training, offers them
``two for the price of one.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even to be a plumber, you have to be a good businessman,''
said Tony Sawyer, superintendent of high schools in Manhattan,
where there are four vocational schools, all of them changing their
programs to accommodate more academic requirements. ``In order to
get a high school diploma, you have to succeed academically.''
</P>
<P>
   The new academic standards for high school students have forced
all vocational schools to redesign their days, and students spend
less time in the shops. A decade ago, students spent at least half
their day in the shops; today they may not take any vocational
courses during their freshman year and then will gradually add two
50-minute periods in their sophomore year, three in their junior
year and four in their senior year.
</P>
<P>
   With the added academic requirements, the average day for a
vocational student is two or three periods longer than at a regular
high school. Students carry an average of 10 extra credits compared
to students at other schools. At some schools, like Aviation High
School in Queens, a five-year high school career is now the norm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have to redefine what a high school
experience is,'' said Steve Feldman, director of the
school-to-career program at the Board of Education, which helps
coordinate vocational programs and courses.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said he would support a set of proposals now under
consideration by the state's Board of Regents, which in 1996
mandated the new high school graduation requirements, allowing
vocational students greater flexibility in their academic
coursework toward a diploma, and possibly offering credit for
courses related to the trades that also prepare them for exams in
the five academic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the predicament of vocational schools that have
had to steal time from trades to help prepare their students for
the Regents exams, a panel of state education officials presented
recommendations to the Regents last Wednesday on ways to allow the
students more time in their shop and trade courses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 graduation policy, which will be phased in by
2004, all public high school students must pass exams in English,
math, science, global studies and American history and government.
</P>
<P>
   Serber of Queens Vocational, like other principals at vocational
schools, has searched for ways to bring academics into the shops.
Several days a week, English teachers work in the shops with
plumbing students and he has asked the shop teachers to include
more writing in their lesson plans, such as developing instruction
manuals for electrical wiring projects and plumbing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try our hardest,'' Serber said. ``But it may
get to a point where the kids whose skills are poor have to
leave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among Serber's students, it is easy to see that the life of a
vocational student can be exhausting these days.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Denson, 17, a senior cosmetology student at Queens
Vocational, is studying to be a hairdresser. She must complete
1,000 hours of cosmetology training to get a state license that the
school will give her when she graduates.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at 6:30
a.m., to get to school for four periods of cosmetology. She has no
lunch period, and often gets permission to eat a snack after
cosmetology, during gym class. Her afternoon is filled with
academic courses, regents-level mathematics, English, economics and
earth science.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week Denson attends night school at a high school in
Queens because she failed a math course that she must pass to earn
her diploma. ``I've wanted to do hair since I was a kid,'' she
said. ``But I'm so tired.''

SIERRA LEONE ASKS UNITED NATIONS FOR ROLE IN WAR COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sierra Leone has asked the United Nations to
set up a war crimes tribunal to try rebel leaders whose troops
maimed and killed Sierra Leoneans and abducted 500 international
peacekeepers, plunging the country into a new round of violence in
May.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed court, as outlined in a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan from Sierra Leone's president, Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah, would be a far cry from an international tribunal of
the sort established in the 1990s for the Balkans and Rwanda.
Instead, it would be closer to the one now being created for
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, with considerable power in the hands of the
national government. Prosecutors and judges would be a mix of
Sierra Leoneans and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid court envisioned by Sierra Leone would be based there
and limited to hearing cases against only one faction, the
Revolutionary United Front of Foday Sankoh. This spring, Sankoh
broke a year-old peace agreement that had given him a role in
government and turned his troops on both President Kabbah's army
and U.N. peacekeepers. He is now in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which sent troops to Sierra Leone last month, helped
Sierra Leone draft its proposal for a tribunal, diplomats said
Tuesday. The court would be established under one of possibly three
Security Council resolutions on Sierra Leone to be debated in
coming weeks. The other two would impose an embargo on arms sales
and diamond exports and enlarge the U.N. peacekeeping force and
strengthen its powers.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say the United States originally appeared to want a
more international tribunal, but now seemed to be closer to
supporting the British-assisted plan outlined by Kabbah. An
American official said that the United States was still far from a
decision on the shape of the court.
</P>
<P>
   At a Security Council meeting Tuesday, the American Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke said that he was against creating an entirely new
tribunal for Sierra Leone but that ``some form of extension of the
international war crime umbrella to cover these odious people must
be undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of Kabbah's letter and its detailed annex, sent a week
ago, was made available to The New York Times by experts outside
the United Nations. Officials in the organization would not discuss
the plan, saying it is still being studied.
</P>
<P>
   The limitations on the proposed court's reach and the large role
reserved for the weak government and justice system of Sierra Leone
raise fears among some international human rights experts, who say
that numerous factions have been involved in abuses in Sierra
Leone, in a war marked by the hacking off of civilians' limbs and
the destruction of countless communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two main concerns that we have,'' said Peter
Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, who recently returned from Sierra
Leone. ``One is that it deals only with the RUF. We think for a
tribunal to have any kind of international credibility, it would
have to address the criminal responsibility of all sides in the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Revolutionary United Front, he said, there
are the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council; one of its most violent
factions, known as the West Side Boys; and bands of former
government soldiers who joined the rebels to attack Freetown, the
country's capital, in January 1999 after Sankoh broke an earlier
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A second concern cited by Bouckaert was ``the dominant role that
Sierra Leone would play in this proposed hybrid court, considering
the politicization that would take place and also the limited
capacity that the Sierra Leone judiciary has at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah said in his letter and annex that a court created by the
Security Council would have ``the advantage of strong enforcement
powers that will call for cooperation from states in
investigations, arrest, extradition and the enforcement of
sentence.'' He also asked that it be paid for through an
international trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the working of the court, Kabbah called for a
``narrow'' list of those to be charged from the Revolutionary
United Front, possibly in the dozens. He said this would allow the
court to be ``quick and efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah asked for a blend of Sierra Leone and international law
to be applied in order to include crimes against humanity and
crimes against peacekeepers, which are not in the national code. He
expected the court to sit in Sierra Leone unless security made it
necessary to move elsewhere. It would have West African and
possibly other judges. For appeals, the tribunal could make use of
an appeals panel in The Hague, which hears cases from the Balkans
and Rwanda.

FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS SUSPECT GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Midwest)   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With gasoline prices in the Midwest surging past $2
a gallon, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana on Tuesday suspended
the state's gas tax for two months and warned that he may seek an
inquiry into possible price gouging by the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   O'Bannon, who said the tax break would reduce the price of
gasoline in his state by as much as 10 cents a gallon, demanded to
know why gas stations in Indiana are charging record prices,
exceeding the national average by as much as 50 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as the Federal Trade Commission opened an
investigation into the price increases in the Midwest, which have
drivers in Chicago paying an average of $2.13 a gallon, a 55
percent increase since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoosiers can't afford to wait on federal and state
investigators to tell us why the Midwest is being hit so hard,''
O'Bannon said.
</P>
<P>
   If prices do not fall soon, he said, he will ask the state's
attorney general to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said in Lexington, Ky., Tuesday that
profit reported by oil companies earlier this year suggested that
``big oil is gouging American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said he
is seeking to arrange a meeting with the governors of states most
affected, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Carol Browner, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The governors and the administration officials should work
together to determine whether the oil companies are fixing prices
or otherwise colluding against consumers, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry experts have attributed the rising prices to
limited supplies, the disruption of a pipeline in Michigan and a
new federal environmental requirement that regions with significant
air pollution sell cleaner-burning fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA last week said it would consider a request by Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois to waive rules that would have required
dealers to sell gasoline with less-polluting additives such as
ethanol beginning this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had accused the environmental agency of failing to consider
the impact the new requirement would have.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials said there were few indications that the
anti-pollution requirement was to blame for the price increases,
especially since the stock of reformulated gasoline is sufficient
and oil companies have had five years to prepare for the change.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., accused the oil companies of
gouging consumers in Chicago and Milwaukee in retaliation for the
new rules on additives.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,
told members of the Illinois congressional delegation Tuesday that
price surges in some Midwestern cities raised enough questions to
warrant the inquiry, congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC will issue subpoenas for testimony from oil company
executives beginning next week, the officials said. The
investigation, which could take as long as six weeks, will be
conducted by the FTC's Bureau of Competition, which has already
been looking into whether higher prices in California resulted from
collusion between gasoline refiners or distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., told The Associated Press that
the investigation in the Midwest would send ``a clear signal to the
oil companies to bring down prices immediately.''

 &HT;    Baseball fanatics gather to pay homage to sport
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Skip Smith, a trial lawyer for Florida's
largest law firm, Holland &AMP; Knight, is supposed to be taking
depositions this week for a class-action lawsuit against a medical
management company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 57-year-old litigator will stand at a podium in the
Sheraton West Palm Beach Hotel and argue a subject passionate to
his heart:
</P>
<P>
   Has Major League Baseball lost its pennant fever?
</P>
<P>
   Smith will be followed by a computer science professor from the
University of South Carolina, who will offer a debate on this
thought: Do intentional walks save runs?
</P>
<P>
   Retired newspaperman Eddie Gold will recite six poems, including
``Kerry Wood is Pitching Today.'' Rob Edelman from Albany, N.Y.,
will devote his 30-minute session to William Frawley, the actor
best known as Fred Mertz on ``I Love Lucy,'' who hung out with Joe
DiMaggio and had a clause in his contract that gave him time off
the set to attend the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most diehard fans, there's the slide show ``Where
They Lie: A Tour of Baseball Gravesites,'' offered by Stew
Thornley, who says he has visited the graves of more than 100
Baseball Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 30th annual convention of the Society For
American Baseball Research, a grass-roots following of 6,800
members from Cooperstown, N.Y., to Tahiti devoted to everything
balls, strikes and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Trekkies of the baseball world, about 400 Saberites are
expected to converge on the Sheraton for four days of lectures,
numbers-crunching and general baseball breeze-shooting. Some will
clutch binders thick with stat sheets; others will stroll the lobby
dressed head-to-toe in uniforms of not-forgotten teams such as the
St. Louis Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I thought I was a baseball expert,'' said
Smith, a lawyer for 33 years who joined SABR (pronounced
``say-ber'') in 1997. ``These people are total baseball geeks. They
make me look like an amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   Registration begins today, but the action starts Thursday with a
welcoming luncheon speech by SABR member and Florida Marlins
General Manager Dave Dombrowski. After two hours of committee
meetings, the research presentations begin with talks about Italian
baseball and Tom ``Lefty'' Sunkel, a minor-league pitcher who
pitched a no-hitter in 1946 despite being blind in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   In between discussions on ``The Evolution of the Relief
Pitcher'' and ``111 Years of Major League Ejections,'' the
Saberites will gather for the keynote speech by 89-year-old Elden
Auker, a submarine-style pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who once
struck out Babe Ruth and faced Dizzy Dean in Game7 of the 1934
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the highlight will be the annual Trivia Challenge,
described by veteran whizzes as a thorough and often ``vicious''
competition in which the top prize is bragging rights for being the
Mark McGwire of SABR know-it-alls.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's convention in Phoenix, one member recalled, ``I
was sitting at the hotel bar and there were guys talking about how
they could lure this other guy away from a team.''
</P>
<P>
   While it all sounds far out even to casual baseball fans, to the
Saberites, knowing who replaced Tony Kubek after he was struck in
the throat by Bill Virdon's grounder in Game7 of the 1960 World
Series (Joe DeMaestri) is serious stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has a question about baseball, if we can't answer
it, chances are no one can,'' SABR President Jim Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   From Hall of Famer Ted Williams to Wellington High School
teacher Dale Hains, members pay annual dues of $50 and receive four
meticulously researched publications. Like articles in the New
England Journal of Medicine reporting the latest medical
breakthroughs, SABR's Baseball Research Journal has published
studies that have helped correct dozens of errors in baseball's
record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't as noble as fighting cancer,'' said West Palm Beach
attorney Jim Watt, the local organizer of the convention. ``It's
just all people who love baseball and love to research it.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they ever. One member, retired Western Union employee Joe
Donner, has looked up the box score of every major-league game
since 1871. ``I went to one presentation last year,'' Watt
recalled, ``and this one guy studied 17,000 intentional walks. I'm
sitting there thinking, `Get a life, guy!'''
</P>
<P>
   SABR geeks such as convention lecturer Mark Pankin, whose vanity
car plate reads ``NO DH,'' will argue that they have a life. It's
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always intersted in baseball. Lou Gehrig was my favorite
player,'' said Bob Davids. A retired U.S. Department of Energy
employee, Davids began publishing a newsletter called Baseball
Briefs around 1971 when he put out a call for people like him
intersted in forming a group.
</P>
<P>
   The first gathering of about 16 members took place in
Cooperstown, N.Y. Today, the society is recognized by Major League
Baseball for its work. It has helped spawn a new wave of baseball
research, which includes the basis for the Total Baseball
encyclopedia and for Bill James' thought-provoking revisionist
philosophy known as Sabermetrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very respected. They've definitely made a
contribution,'' said Jerome Holtzman, official historian for Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Log on to SABR's daily e-mail digest, and discussions will range
from players who appeared on baseball cards without ever making it
into a game to the pronounciation of names (''It's 'Hah-nus'
Wagner, not ``Hoe-nis,'' a Saberite wrote last week).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very, very deep,'' Dombrowksi said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some members say, SABR is divided into two camps, bonded
by baseball but ``often at war with each other'': folks interested
in general history and the folks the longtime member referred to as
``the statistical freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me,'' said stat expert Bob McConnell, one
of the original 16 charter members who acknowledges the ``freak''
label. ``I guess I'm a little bit odd. I like to play with numbers.
Other people have hobbies and I think they're odd. But I don't say
anything because I know mine is odd.''
</P>
<P>
   The history buffs have been labeled as odd, too. At the SABR
convention in Pittsburgh a few years ago, one tour went to a house
just off the University of Pittsburgh campus where Babe Ruth's
final home run is said to have landed on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple college kids living there were looking out the window
at us, wondering why 20 guys in Pirate caps were standing in their
front yard,'' recalled Dennis Repp.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Watt says he won't be surprised if small crowds are
seen milling about in the Kravis Center parking garage looking for
the home-plate marker from old Connie Mack Field.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watt admits he was impressed enough after attending a
recent convention that he and his pal Skip Smith lobbied hard to
persuade SABR to hold this year's gathering in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it certainly didn't hurt when Watt did some
name-dropping about a secretary in the law firm where he works,
Steel Hector &AMP; Davis. Judy Wilkinson is the daughter of the late
Bob Cain, the White Sox left-hander who walked Eddie Gaedel in the
midget's famous pinch-hitting apperance for the St. Louis Browns in
1951.

CLINTON AND SENATORS MANEUVER TO EXPEDITE VOTE ON CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four weeks after the House approved a decisive bill
on trade with China, President Clinton summoned a bipartisan group
of senators to the White House on Tuesday night to talk strategy on
pressing Republican leaders to set a date for bringing up the bill
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike supporters in the House, who had to hustle votes up to
the last minute, Senate backers of granting China permanent normal
trading status say they have more than 70 votes in favor. That is
enough to defeat a filibuster and win handily.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters want to pass a clean version of the House bill,
free of amendments that would force the measure back to the House
for a potentially treacherous second vote. And that is proving to
be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader and a supporter of the
bill, has said the Senate does not have time to defuse all possible
amendments and to vote on the measure before the weeklong July 4
recess. That leaves a three-week window in July before the long
August recess.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican leadership has given priority to approving
several must-pass spending bills this summer before considering the
trade measure, which would end Congress' annual review of China's
trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Some top Senate Republican aides suggested that the twists and
turns of the spending bills could put off a vote on the China
legislation until September, which supporters angrily said could
imperil the bill, as it might get caught up in election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into September, our chances for passage drop
precipitously,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House early on Tuesday evening, Clinton met with 17
Republicans and Democrats who support the bill. They included the
top Republican and Democrat on the Finance Committee, William V.
Roth Jr. of Delaware and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. It
was Clinton's second strategy session with senators since the House
passed the measure, 237-197, on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is undoubtedly one of the most important votes any of
these senators will ever take,'' the White House spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said on Tuesday. ``And it's certainly our hope we can get
this done quickly and without the long arm of partisan politics
entering the fray.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans who support the bill say they were watching
the Senate machinations and consulting with Lott's staff. ``We're
monitoring it and we're not worried _ yet,'' said one House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle are talking with several senators who have
expressed interest in offering amendments. Sen. Jesse Helms, a
North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations
Committee, has promised a ``robust debate'' and ``uncomfortable
votes'' on issues ranging from China's use of prison labor to its
crackdown on political dissent. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said
on Tuesday that he would offer amendments on human rights and labor
conditions in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the most immediate problem for Lott and the administration
is an amendment sponsored by Sens. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. The amendment would provide for an annual
review of China's record in trafficking nuclear, chemical and
biological warfare and missile technology. The measure would also
require the administration to impose sanctions on individuals,
groups or companies that the United States identifies as weapons
proliferators.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, met
with Senate Republicans to discuss Thompson's proposal and other
national security issues. On Friday, the White House chief of
staff, John D. Podesta, also met with Thompson about his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is trying to negotiate with Democrats to allow for debate
and a separate vote on Thompson's measure _ the price for his
agreeing not to amend what is likely to be a popular provision to
the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said on Tuesday he would insist on a vote on his
measure before the Senate considers the trade bill. But the
administration opposes it, saying it is unnecessary and overly
broad and has thresholds for imposing sanctions that are too low.

CELEBRATED SHOE DESIGNER STEVEN MADDEN FACES STOCK MANIPULATION
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., a word in double parentheses ((thus)) should be set in
brackets.) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Madden, a designer who is chairman and chief
executive of a popular women's shoe company, was arrested Tuesday
on charges of securities fraud, including the initial public
offering of his own company.
</P>
<P>
   In separate indictments, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and
Manhattan charged Madden with securities fraud, conspiracy and
money laundering, saying that he participated in more than 20
fraudulent initial offerings of stock dating back to 1993, when
Steven Madden Ltd. went public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a
civil lawsuit arising from Madden's trading activities that the
stock frauds generated about $7 million in profits for Madden and
others who participated in the conspiracy. The commission is
seeking to bar Madden from serving as an officer or director of any
publicly traded company, said Wayne Carlin, SEC associate regional
director.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, 43, is a celebrated shoe designer whose trendy platform
styles are available in 3,000 department stores and 60 Steven
Madden Ltd. stores. The company had sales of $163 million in its
1999 year, nearly double the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But Madden's arrest Tuesday cast a cloud over his fast-growing
company.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Marotta, an analyst who follows the company for
Wasserstein Perella Securities, called Madden pivotal to the
company and downgraded the stock from a ``buy'' to
``underperform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the key visionary,'' Marotta said. ``He has a team of
designers who execute his order, but he is the key guy. It is
difficult to understate his importance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement released Tuesday, the company said its
``business remains strong and it plans to continue to execute its
long-term strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Madden denied the charges Tuesday afternoon, and
said that their client was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said Madden was involved in a
fraudulent scheme to manipulate the the stock of Steven Madden Ltd.
when it went from being a small regional company with limited
assets to a public company in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was underwritten by the now-defunct brokerage firm
Stratton Oakmont. The National Association of Securities Dealers
had refused to allow Stratton Oakmont to underwrite the sale if any
of the brokerage firm's principals owned more than 4.9 percent of
the company's stock. To deceive regulators, prosecutors charged,
Madden falsely said that Stratton Oakmont's principals had sold
shares to a separate company controlled by Madden. Prosecutors said
that the sale was a sham and that Madden, in fact, had promised the
Stratton Oakmont principals that they would continue to control the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that in 1997 a principal in Stratton Oakmont
demanded that Madden sell the stock and provide him with the
proceeds. Madden refused, the prosecutors said, because he did not
want to flood the market and depress the company's stock price.
After a lawsuit was filed in state court, prosecutors said, Madden
agreed to pay $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments in both Brooklyn and Manhattan charge that
Madden allegedly participated in a series of illicit stock
transactions during next several years involving Stratton Oakmont
and another brokerage firm, Monroe Parker, which is also now
defunct.
</P>
<P>
   In those deals, prosecutors charged, Madden agreed to buy stock
from from companies before their public offerings and then sell it
back to the brokerage firms once public trading began. The
prosecutors said that Madden was allowed to keep a portion of the
proceeds amounting to the difference between what he paid for the
stock and the price at which he sold it. They said the arrangement
allowed the firms to illegally manipulate the market price for
those stocks. In some examples, prosecutors said, the firms were
able to resell the stocks at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the principals of both brokerage firms have
already pleaded guilty to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's lawyers said their client had engaged in stock
transactions with the defunct brokerage firms, but that he was
innocent of acting illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``These indictments contain charges based on the words of
convicted felons who wreaked havoc on Wall Street, based on
campaigns of deception, fraud and lies,'' said Corey Winograd, one
of Madden's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody disputes ((Madden)) had transactions of stock,''
Winograd said. But he said that accusations of kickbacks and
fraudulent trades were unsubstantiated. ``There were transactions,
transactions that were documented, transactions that were lawful
and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden was released on bond of $750,000, backed by three pieces
of property, including his home in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Madden is being charged with manipulating the stock
of Steve Madden Ltd., stock analysts say the company itself is in
sound financial shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two cast of characters we are dealing with here,''
Marotta said. ``One is the group that handled the IPO and is
involved with what happened with Steve's personal financials, and
the other are the people he hired for the company, and these groups
don't intersect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Marotta says the company has a healthy balance
sheet, investors may lose confidence in the company in the short
run and the brand could ``get off track'' in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Madden owns 1.2 million shares, nearly 10 percent, of the
company, according to recent securities filings, and has options
that would bring his stake to 18 percent. While the prosecutors
were closing in on him, he sold 100,000 shares at $16 on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which peaked at $22 7/16 in April, fell $1.94 Tuesday
to $11.125 before trading was halted late in the morning. The
company went public at $4 a share in 1993.

SPORTS COLUMN: LAKERS RULE. SOME DAY, THE BULLS. 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning after the pro basketball marathon finally ended,
Jerry Krause looked out the window of his office at the Chicago
Bulls' practice facility and there was the co-rookie of the year,
Elton Brand, working on his footwork for next season,
four-and-a-half-months away and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the Bulls' other young players, Ron Artest and
Michael Ruffin, were also in the building, energizing Krause as he
planned for the college draft and free-agent season, the time of
year when general managers become franchise players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Jerry West is responsible for what happened in Los
Angeles last night,'' Krause said Tuesday. ``He's the one who
maneuvered to get that team under the cap so they could sign
Shaquille O'Neal. He's the one who made the Kobe Bryant deal
happen. But he's getting far less credit than he should. Instead
you hear, well, other things.''
</P>
<P>
   You hear about Phil Jackson winning in his first coaching try
out of Chicago, without Michael Jordan, for whom he has always had
the ultimate respect, and without Krause, for whom he has had,
well, other things.
</P>
<P>
   Intramural pettiness aside, Jackson deserves a round of applause
for being able to take his high-profile act elsewhere and
immediately succeed. Ditto West, who restored the Lakers to
prominence 12 years after they last won the title and nine years
after their last trip to the National Basketball Association
finals.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a long time, consider when Boston and
Detroit, those erstwhile Lakers combatants in championship series
past, might next play in June.
</P>
<P>
   Krause spoke with West last week, the Pacers still nipping at
Shaq's heels, and West admitting that he was sweating, as in the
old days. ``He was saying that you go along for years trying to put
your team back into position where it has a realistic chance to
win, and then the pressure of feeling like you have to win hits
you,'' Krause said. ``At the end of our run here in Chicago, we
were playing not to lose. You get a little excited when you start
to think that soon, we could be playing to win.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees that the stripped-to-the-Brand Bulls
will soon be very good, or any good. Yet just as Jackson's
achievements should not pass without a proper salute, nor can the
work Krause has done steering his team into quality rebuilding
position. Less than two years after critics foolishly blamed him
for the deconstruction that had to occur the moment Elvis left the
building, he is taking two first-round selections, Nos. 4 and 7,
and six picks in all into next week's draft. For a class of
talented and potentially dominant free agents who are in various
stages of home-team disaffection, the Bulls are armed and ready,
$19 million under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there are no sure things, but considering the altitude
from which the Bulls fell, Krause has a chance to author one of the
fastest and greatest retooling jobs in the history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   As a mass-appeal phenomenon, the NBA suffered a descent that has
been, at least by measure of public perception, parallel to the
Bulls'. Television ratings fell precipitously, no shock considering
how invested in one player the league and its synergistic partners
were. Golf may be the current ratings rage, but if Tiger Woods left
Earth tomorrow to defy the gravitational odds elsewhere, golf would
revert to the modest, elitist draw it was.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern was right when he called this season a
``transitional year where the fans are getting to know our new
players.'' The commissioner's marketing machine tried too hard with
Vince Carter, but the league does have a solid nucleus of young
stars, and, as we've seen with Kobe, the kind who really want to
validate themselves with championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what these people are talking about when they say
it was a bad season,'' said Krause, the lifer who was thrilled by
the finals and the sight of games again featuring the art of
scoring the ball.
</P>
<P>
   His team won 17 games, but to measure the Bulls' standing by
number of victories distorts the context of how one can best cope
with prosperity's end. While a phenomenon such as Jordan bloats
interest, fan bases don't disappear overnight. Krause has noticed
that the White Sox fans, thought to be an endangered species in
Chicago, are returning in droves to Comiskey Park. Those 23,000
Bulls fans at the United Center won't stay forever, but, as Krause
said, with any luck, they'll have a competitive team again soon.
</P>
<P>
   For team and league, two years is a snap of the finger, a blink
of an eye, a chance to work on footwork and take small steps
forward.

CANCER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT CENTER PLANNED FOR HARLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one of the most expansive collaborations between a
major medical center and a New York community hospital, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will help establish a cancer
prevention and treatment center at the North General Hospital in
Harlem, executives at both centers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The center will be known as the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer
Prevention and Care, reflecting a $5 million gift from the fashion
designer's company. The creation of the center, which is expected
to be announced Wednesday, springs in part from years of research
demonstrating large disparities between blacks and whites in cancer
detection and survival rates, as well as Lauren's longstanding
interest in breast cancer philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The center also reflects a subtle but significant shift in the
role that Sloan-Kettering, now under the leadership of Dr. Harold
Varmus, plays in areas where most people lack access to basic care,
let alone the cutting-edge research and high-profile doctors for
which Sloan-Kettering is internationally known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to feel we are serving the city,'' said Varmus, former
director of the National Institutes of Health who took the helm of
Sloan-Kettering this year. ``We are not doing as much as we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is also an outgrowth of the relationship between
Sloan-Kettering and Dr. Harold P. Freeman, now president of North
General. Freeman was a founder and medical director of
Sloan-Kettering's Breast Examination Center of Harlem, which was
set up 20 years ago with the New York State Department of Health to
try to lower the rates of late-stage breast cancer among black
women.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman and Varmus decided that the hospital could reach more
people in Harlem with a center that could diagnose other forms of
cancer and with one that offered on-site treatment, rather than
referring patients elsewhere, which often leads to people's
stopping care. The Ralph Lauren center, which is to open late this
year, will provide screening and diagnostic tests for breast,
prostate, colon and cervical cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Sloan-Kettering's most prominent doctors will help
oversee the development of the center, and patients whose cancers
are diagnosed there may be referred to Sloan-Kettering for drug
trials or other treatments, something that many Harlem patients can
ill afford and know little about. The move may reflect Varmus'
interest in applying more of the hospital's research toward
clinical care for a broader swath of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Easy access to good care is crucial to early diagnoses of
cancer, both doctors said. Late detection is the No. 1 reason that
people die from treatable forms of cancer, and studies have shown
that many forms of cancer are detected later in blacks than in
whites. .
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a 20-year study of more than 700 women in
Harlem that ended in 1986, only 30 percent had survived breast
cancer five years after diagnosis, compared with national rates
closer to 65 percent, Freeman said. Looked at another way, the
study found that only 6 percent of the women had early-stage, or
the most treatable, cancers. Since the center's inception, that
rate has risen to 40 percent, Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a study reported last year in the New England Journal of
Medicine found that blacks were less likely than whites to have
surgery for early-stage lung cancer and were thus more likely to
die from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this community, 41 percent of the people are poor,''
Freeman said. ``And poverty causes a set of complex human
circumstances that lead to late diagnoses. But there are things we
can do to confront those conditions by creating easy access to care
and smooth systems without barriers to treatment. We have found
that when you offer certain conditions to people, they tend to be
compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren was an early financial supporter of programs for breast
cancer. In 1989, he donated $100,000 to begin the Nina Hyde Center
for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University, named for his
friend, a fashion writer for The Washington Post who died the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   He also started a campaign called ``Fashion Targets Breast
Cancer'' and was recently introduced to Freeman. ``I wanted to do
more,'' Lauren said in an interview. ``Dr. Freeman really impressed
me. He made me aware of a lot of things I was not aware of in
Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren said that recent reports of a mammogram center in the
Bronx where the state said hundreds of faulty tests were performed
had furthered his interest. ``That was really scary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what attracted Lauren to the project was that the center
will educate patients about their treatment. Lauren, who battled
with a benign brain tumor 12 years ago, said, ``I knew what it was
like not to know which doctor to go to, and I was well known.''

   Judge Delays Restrictions in Microsoft Antitrust Case
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge in the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly
issued an order delaying the sweeping conduct restrictions he had
imposed until a higher court affirms them. Until the order by the
judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the Supreme Court would have been
called on to rule quickly on Microsoft's request to stay the remedy
order _ or to decide that the case should be sent to the appeals
court. Now the Supreme Court, or the appeals court, can review the
entire appeal, and rule on it, before deciding whether to impose
the judge's remedy, modify it or cancel it. The process could take
a year or longer.

GOLDMAN SACHS REPORTS 21 PERCENT RISE IN QUARTERLY EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overcoming big paper losses on some of its investments, the
Goldman Sachs Group rode its best performance in investment banking
to a 21 percent increase in net income in its fiscal second quarter
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said Tuesday that it had earned $755 million, or $1.48 a
diluted share. The profits were as good as analysts had expected
before cautious talk from Goldman caused analysts to lower their
estimates last month. On May 25, a day before Goldman's quarter
ended, the analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
estimated that the firm would earn $1.47 a diluted share, but by
Tuesday that projection had dropped to $1.37.
</P>
<P>
   The results compared favorably with the pro forma earnings of
$1.30 a share Goldman reported last May _ adjusted for the costs of
its initial public offering _ but they were 16 percent below the
record earnings of $887 million, or $1.76 a diluted share, it
recorded in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unexpectedly strong earnings, Goldman's share price
fell $2.625, to $89 on the New York Stock Exchange, while stocks of
some of other securities firms, including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Lehman Brothers Holdings, rose 2.5 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second time that Goldman has reported strong
numbers and other firms have rallied,'' said Henry McVey, a Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter analyst. McVey said investors appeared to be
hunting for less expensive stocks that would benefit from the same
factors that drove Goldman's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also worried that the firm's employees and former
partners will flood the market with new shares that they can sell
for the first time this week, analysts said. Only about 15 percent
of the firm's outstanding shares have been available to trade,
McVey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried that what gave the stock a huge lift on the
way up _ an imbalance of demand and supply _ will start to work
against it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's balance sheet received its biggest boost from
underwriting stocks and advising companies on mergers in the United
States and, increasingly, in Europe. Its investment banking revenue
of $1.59 billion was 29 percent higher than in the first quarter,
which was Goldman's most profitable since it became a public
company a year ago, and 59 percent higher than in the second
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman reaped hefty fees for underwriting huge stock offerings
for AT&AMP;T Wireless and PetroChina and for advising on acquisitions
like British Petroleum's purchase of Arco and Royal Bank of
Scotland's purchase of National Westminster Bank. Goldman ranked
first during the quarter as an underwriter of stocks, both global
and in the United States, David Viniar, the firm's chief financial
officer, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really dominated that sector completely in the quarter,''
Viniar said.
</P>
<P>
   The gains from banking and trading more than offset a sharp drop
in the value of Goldman's investments in private companies and
companies that have recently gone public. With the sell-off in
technology stocks that began in April, the value of those
investments fell $321 million in the quarter. Viniar estimated
those markdowns would result in a loss of about 19 cents a share
after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that loss represents a markdown on paper of unrealized
gains that had inflated Goldman's earnings in previous quarters,
Viniar said. Goldman recorded increases in the value of its
principal investments of more than $600 million in the previous two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Viniar called that reversal a ``give-back of some of the froth
that was in the market.'' Still, he said, Goldman is looking at
``excellent'' returns on all of the investments that it had to mark
down last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's trading desks were living in two different worlds:
Revenue in stock trading rose 76 percent, while revenue from
trading bonds, currencies and commodities sank 30 percent from the
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bond markets ``were really just slow,'' Viniar said, but
they have picked up in the last few weeks. ``When we look at the
business environment, we think the long-term prospects for our
business are as good as they have ever been,'' he said.

HOUSE SHIFTS ON U.S. FUNDING FOR SUIT AGAINST TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whirling around 180 degrees, the House on Tuesday
voted to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to transfer $4
million to the Justice Department to help in its wide-ranging
lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary about-face took place on a voice vote and
occurred less than 24 hours after the lawmakers had specifically
voted to ban such a transfer, arguing that the Justice Department
was taking away medical benefits from veterans to pay for its
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure defeated on Monday, an amendment by Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif., would have permitted the transfer through
revisions of a $76.3 billion spending bill for the veterans agency
and the Department of House and Urban Affairs. It was defeated
207-197.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats crowed about the reversal Tuesday, asserting that it
showed that when forced into a public fight in defense of tobacco
companies, Republicans will ultimately back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let them stop a lawsuit without people
noticing it,'' Waxman said. ``We believe that when people do notice
it, they can't sustain their position.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert scoffed at
suggestions that the reversal was an embarrassment to his party's
leadership by showing that it was unable to maintain a unified
front on the tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a decision that we had a good fight about taking
money from veterans health care and giving it to trial lawyers,''
said Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is not yet over, Feehery said, and there will be
other opportunities to prevent the transfer of money to the Justice
Department for use in the lawsuit, which is seeking billions of
dollars from the tobacco companies to cover federal health-care
expenses related to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican amendment in an upcoming spending bill to fund the
Commerce, Justice and State departments prohibits the Justice
Department from receiving any money for the lawsuit from other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bipartisan victory should be a model for Congress,''
President Clinton said Tuesday in a statement praising the House
vote. ``The legal responsibility of the tobacco companies should be
decided in the courts by the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the first vote on Monday, Attorney General Janet Reno had
pressed lawmakers to defeat of the measure blocking the transfer.
If the Justice Department cannot get financial help from other
agencies, Reno said, it might have to drop the lawsuit.

ON ABC, BALLGAMES TOP POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the television battle between the Republicans and the
Democrats this summer, the winner is: the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one of the winners, anyway. In a further downshifting of
convention coverage in prime time, ABC News announced Tuesday that
it would not pre-empt two preseason football games scheduled for
the opening nights of the Republican and Democratic national
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But the network will not completely abandon politics in prime
time when the Republicans convene in Philadelphia on Monday, July
31, and the Democrats in Los Angeles on Monday, Aug. 14. David
Westin, the president of ABC News, said the network will provide
coverage during halftime of the games, one on July 31, when the
49ers play the New England Patriots, and the other on Aug. 14, when
the St. Louis Rams face the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said that ABC News was planning an hour of coverage on
the second and third nights and two hours on the final night of
both conventions, with additional exposure on ``Nightline'' with
Ted Koppel. ABC officials said that was slightly less than the
network provided four years ago, when football did not intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ABC News may as yet provide more prime-time coverage than
either of its rivals. CBS News and NBC News have yet to announce
their plans, but the two networks are considering scaling back.
(Neither party has announced its lineup of convention speakers.)
NBC News, however, will have a presence each night through its
all-news cable station, MSNBC, which will offer gavel-to-gavel
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for maintaining a strong prime-time presence by the
networks were disappointed by ABC News' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential campaign merits a halftime report in an NFL
preseason game,'' said Paul Taylor, executive director the Alliance
for Better Campaigns, which monitors network coverage of politics.
``What has broadcast television come to in terms of commitment?''
</P>
<P>
   Network officials say the lack of a contest for the nominations,
and the parties' desire to turn the gatherings into tightly
managed, four-day-long advertisements has diminished their value as
news events.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a former political reporter, said the parties' decision
to present the conventions as feel-good commercials contributes to
the receding coverage on the networks, which still draw vastly
larger audiences than cable. But he added, ``By any modicum of news
judgment, it's an important occasion, even if it's a frustrating
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said ABC News had also invited Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to face each other some time after the
conventions in an hourlong televised discussion, without a
moderator, and that the initial reaction from the campaigns had
been positive. He added that the network also wanted to produce
hourlong biographical specials of the two. The project's fate was
uncertain, he said, because the network might be required under the
fairness doctrine to also devote that amount to third-party
candidates.

ANALYSIS: TWO MEN, FATES LINKED 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Gov. George W. Bush confronts yet another
closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate
decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over
the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half
years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt
the next one.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bush is running for president and the eyes of an
entire nation are upon him as never before, he faces a second,
amplified challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It is to demonstrate, through the tone of his voice and the set
of his jaw, that he feels the full weight of his responsibility.
And it is to show, through his bearing and his choice of words,
that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death
penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the
welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the
death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush's seriousness, a
quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys
that his advocacy of capital punishment in itself carries political
risks, there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few
voters are watching, and judging, the manner in which he navigates
this sensitive terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be careful to portray this in the most sober and
respectful of lights,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a professor who
teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas. ``Any
evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem
for him, not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of
gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   The current case in question is that of Gary Graham, scheduled
to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville,
Texas. Graham was convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the
embattled testimony of a single eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances
of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas
governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion
over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
renders its ruling on the matter this week. If the board authorizes
execution, the most the governor can typically do is grant a
one-time, 30-day reprieve. And Bush's ability to do even that in
Graham's case is in question, since Gov. Ann W. Richards granted
such a reprieve to Graham in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the limits on Bush's discretion, they do not alter
the burden on his public comments and demeanor when the moment of
decision comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gravitas issue is a very important one,'' said Stephen J.
Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University who
specializes in the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can say, in a snide way, `I'm going through
with this, he's guilty, period,''' Wayne said. ``He's got to
demonstrate some reflection in his words.''
</P>
<P>
   The capacity to do so is something that many Americans want in a
president, said Wayne, who, along with other political analysts,
noted that there had been a few occasions when Bush failed to
exhibit it.
</P>
<P>
   A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene,
which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in
which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye
Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate
in early March when Bush laughed, perhaps somewhat nervously, when
asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that
ended with a death sentence for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are extreme. But there have been many other times
when Bush, who seldom holds any private introspection up to public
light, has responded to questions about capital punishment with
strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn
script.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that
and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as
prolonged and profound.
</P>
<P>
   That was the portrait of the governor that emerged in the
autobiography he published last year, ``A Charge to Keep,'' written
primarily by his communications director, Karen P. Hughes. An
entire chapter of the book was devoted to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for the first time since entering office,
Bush granted a death-row inmate a 30-day reprieve, in defiance of
the Board of Pardons and Paroles. The issue in the case was the
possibility that further DNA testing could clarify the facts
presented at trial, and Bush's decision allowed him to show that he
was neither oblivious nor aloof to a central, scientific reason for
the changing dynamics of the death penalty debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the
West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be
dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas, Bush was more
voluble on the death penalty than usual.
</P>
<P>
   He said not only that he was standing his ground ``in the face
of a pretty considerable movement to undermine the death penalty in
Texas,'' but also that he understood the passion of that crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I harbor no ill will,'' Bush told reporters. ``I understand
it's a very emotional issue for people. It's an issue where fine
people disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about how much attention he was paying to Graham's case,
he emphasized that he had spent the entire ``trip from the
governor's mansion to the plane'' _ a drive of 15 to 20 minutes _
talking to a state lawyer about it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether accounts like the one about the sleeping lawyer
made him wonder whether people were getting fair trials, he quickly
and succinctly responded, ``That's what the appellate process is
for.''
</P>
<P>
   But several hours later, he returned to the reporter who had
posed the question and pointed out that in that case, the defendant
had confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had clearly gone and done some research. He had just as
clearly come to the conclusion that it was a good idea to let
people know that.

MEDIA GIANT TO SHED ASSETS FOR EUROPEAN-STYLE SYNERGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The new Vivendi Universal will quickly morph into
a global media company with a decidedly European accent, but don't
expect American theme park and studio operations to be bit players.
</P>
<P>
   The $34 billion buyout by Vivendi, the world's largest water
treatment company, of Seagram Co. Ltd., one of the world's biggest
spirits purveyors, will necessitate some asset shedding, the new
conglomerate's top two executives, Jean-Marie Messier and Edgar
Bronfman Jr., said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Southern California-based studio and theme park
operations to be spared pain, at least in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme parks will remain with the group. They are not going
to be (sold) off as a noncore asset,'' Bronfman, Seagram's
president and chief executive officer, said during a conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's key media and entertainment executives have
long-term contracts, so layoffs at this level are not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be remaining in place, not because they have
long-term contracts but simply because they are good at what they
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the Seagram empire are not so secure. Seagram's
beverage business and such noble brands as Chivas Regal, Absolut
Vodka and Crown Royal will be divested as will Vivendi's
environmental enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But both Messier, Vivendi's chairman and head of the new
company, and his second-in-command Bronfman stressed that Universal
Studios Inc., which includes the theme parks, will be critical to
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Lescure, chief executive officer of Paris-based
entertainment company Canal Plus, in which Vivendi is half-owner,
will be responsible for all filmed entertainment assets, including
Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Messier said he considers the parks and studio to be core
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi Universal will be able to offer consumers movies,
television programming, sports, music, games, and educational and
professional information via digital and analog formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first company to combine premier global and local
content with next-generation digital distribution,'' Messier said.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi Universal will be the world's second-largest music
company after the Warner Music/EMI combination; have big studio
operations in the U.S. and Europe; control the second-largest film
library; and be an international leader in PC-based software game
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business and geographic mix of the two companies' media
properties is highly complementary,'' said Bank of America
securities analyst Stewart A. Halpern. ``The addition of Seagram's
content will create a compelling consumer proposition by offering a
comprehensive suite of service with seamless integration across all
distribution platforms, including the Internet, wireless and ...
television.''
</P>
<P>
   However, both executives, who jetted between news conferences in
Paris and New York on the supersonic Concorde, focused more on what
the combination means in Europe than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's where the synergies of the deal first
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, Vivendi Universal vice chairman, will be responsible
for Universal Music and all Internet activities. The music
operations were especially attractive to Vivendi, which has a new
50 percent stake in Internet portal Vizzavi.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the default portal for 80 million mobile and
interactive TV subscribers in Europe and a valuable new
distribution outlet for Universal's music content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet Age is no longer a PC environment. It's
all-device, all the time, in all the places,'' Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a cell phone user in Europe could be sent phone
mail message announcing the release date of a favorite artist's new
album, along with a sample cut.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers could also be alerted to concert dates, then order and
pay for tickets via the cell connection.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans may be familiar with this concept, but it is still
foreign to many in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to educate everyone on the power of the
distribution platform in Europe,'' Bronfman said. ``Clearly, we
have a lot on our plate. We don't have as powerful a footprint in
the U.S. as we do in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the one puzzling aspect to some analysts. At present,
the deal is more geared more toward the European market than the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a head scratcher. I think the synergies here in North
America are quite a bit lacking. I would have to think that there
are further shoes to drop,'' said Newcrest Capital Inc. analyst
Glynn Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this deal is an interim step. This is not the end
game.''
</P>
<P>
   One player that could emerge is Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
which also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. Messier on Tuesday said he
would like to discuss the Seagram deal with Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's office declined comment.

NEWS OF MERGER CAUSES RIPPLE AT THEME PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ &UR;  &LR; The music still blared, the fountains
still splashed and the crowds still came.
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual Tuesday at the recently renovated
Universal CityWalk following the announcement of parent company
Seagram's merger with French communications giant Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups of tourists visiting the Southern California
studio/theme park/shopping destination said they had no knowledge
of the merger, but the workers who spend each day in the shadow of
Universal Studios knew.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, an undercurrent of worry could be found. Some
employees said they were unsure about the future of their jobs, a
natural concern when one's employer is the subject of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be any impact in the short run,''
said Universal employee Bud Wisinski, who conducts tours of the
studios. ``But in the long term, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi said it plans to shed noncore businesses in its effort
to build a corporate giant controlling the creation and
distribution of entertainment content. Seagram's liquor business
appears a likely spin-off target, but Wisinski wonders whether the
studios' tourism aspect might be another.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees on the fringes of Universal's empire were
completely unaware of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about it until now,'' said Isabel Hernandez, a
sales clerk at The Prop Cart, a gift kiosk at the entry to
Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Managers did not explain the implications of the sale to the
employees, Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Decatur, a limousine driver, said the merger is not likely
to have a significant effect on his business. Tourists will
continue to come to Universal Studios, one of Los Angeles' primary
tourism destinations, he said as he waited outside the studio for
his clients, who are visiting from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't even know it has happened,'' Decatur
said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the merger probably won't have an effect on the
souvenir businesses located at the CityWalk, said Alex Alcala, a
sales associate at the Hollywood T-shirt kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   But Alcala said he worries for some of his friends, who work in
the studio's food service and are union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might affect them more than it will affect us,'' he said.
``I don't know if this company is pro-union or what.''

MELDING CULTURES THE NEXT STEP IN SEAGRAM-VIVENDI DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SEAGRAM-VIVENDI-INTERNET) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Sitting on a stool next to Jean-Marie Messier, the
chairman of the newly minted Vivendi Universal, Edgar Bronfman Jr.
looked a little uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon become clear that Bronfman was not anxious because
he announced the sale of Seagram Co., his family's business, for
about $34 billion in stock to Vivendi SA, the French water utility
turned telecommunications and entertainment conglomerate. It was a
much more practical problem: He could not understand his new boss'
presentation, because, as one journalist whispered quite loudly,
``He doesn't speak French.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment offered a glimpse into the enormous challenge facing
the new company as both sides try to merge their vastly different
businesses and cultures _ and, of course, languages _ into a global
force that combines European business sensibility with American
popular culture. Vivendi Universal to become the second largest
media company after Time Warner-America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Investors worried Tuesday about the two companies' ability to
create a seamless worldwide telecommunications and entertainment
giant managed by a French company, pummeling Vivendi's shares down
8.35 euros, or 8.7 percent, to 88.10 euros, or $84.55. Shares of
Seagram fell about 9 percent _ $5.6875, to $58.625.
</P>
<P>
   Messier blamed the market's reaction to ``classical arbitrage''
and said it was a great time to buy Vivendi's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Vivendi will issue stock valued at
$77.35 for each share of Seagram. Seagram shareholders will get 0.8
shares of Vivendi stock if Vivendi's share price is less than
$96.69. If Vivendi's stock rises to more than $124.30 a share, the
ratio is fixed at 0.622 shares. With about 440 million shares
outstanding, that brings the value of the acquisition to about $34
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi also plans to buy the 51 percent of Canal Plus, the pay
television group, that it does not already own for about $10.6
billion. Canal Plus shareholders will receive 2 Vivendi shares for
each Canal Plus share. Shares of Canal Plus fell 12 percent
Tuesday, to 178.6 euros.
</P>
<P>
   However one trader said he doubted the decline was entirely
because of due to arbitrage. He speculated that there may be some
concern among Vivendi shareholders about the strategic value of the
deal, but said it was still likely to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi has agreed to pay Seagram $800 million as a break-up
fee, if the deal falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Though Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick described the
deal as a ``home run'' Tuesday, she nevertheless downgraded her
recommendation on Seagram from buy to neutral, contending that
trading in the stock reflected a frenzy, but not the fundamentals.
First Union's Scott Davis also came out with a neutral
recommendation after having been bullish.
</P>
<P>
   The union of Vivendi and Seagram puts Universal Studios and
Polygram records under the same roof as Canal Plus, as well as
Vizzavi, an Internet portal that will allow access across Europe
through wireless devices and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are hoping to leverage Seagram's stable of
entertainment content over Vivendi's many distribution channels,
especially in the potential market for downloading digital media
over the Internet and wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Messier said he was also enthusiastic about his new relationship
with USA Networks, of which Seagram owns 42 percent, with the right
to increase its investment. However, he acknowledged that he had
not yet met with the USA chairman, Barry Diller, though he had
spoken to him by phone and planned a meeting in the next several
days in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Diller would have one of the five seats that
Seagram will control on the 18-member board, Bronfman said that had
yet to be decided. Three of the seats go to Bronfman Jr., his
father, Edgar, and his uncle Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bronfman said Tuesday that his family was completely
behind the deal, he added that they do have the right to sell their
stock 90 days after the deal's completion, which is expected to
happen next January or February, Vivendi officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bronfman was unhappy about giving up control of the company
his family had run for decades, he handled it smoothly Tuesday,
saying that if his mission had been to keep control, he would not
have sold. But he said, his goal had been to enhance shareholder
value.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will have revenue of $65 billion, of
which $28 billion will represent entertainment and media
operations. There will be roughly 1.2 billion shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The French press had tempered praise for the deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be applauded, but with some reserve,'' said an
editorial in the Le Monde, the French daily newspaper. ``This bet
is founded on a certain number of risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial went on to warn: ```All foreign companies burned
their wings in Hollywood,''` referring to Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.'s troubled ownership of MCA before it was
sold to Seagram, and Sony's somewhat difficult ownership of
Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vivendi will be putting a Frenchman, Pierre Lescure,
Canal Plus' chairman, in charge of the combined company's film
operations, including Universal Studios. Lescure will manage the
unit from here rather than from Hollywood. Messier went to great
pains to explain that the U.S. film business would still be managed
on a day-to-day basis by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural differences between Messier and Bronfman were also
made apparent Tuesday, despite both executives' efforts to point
out their similarities. Telling the audience about his first
meeting with Bronfman at his house on Oct. 12, Messier ribbed him
for showing up ``without a tie and in short sleeves.'' (Bronfman
was on vacation.)
</P>
<P>
   For Messier, a former investment banker, the meeting was an
opportunity to discuss his vision to create what is now called
Vizzavi and was then code-named MAP, for a multi-access Internet
portal, prior to its development by Vivendi and Vodafone AirTouch,
the wireless telephone company. Both executives believed in the
idea of delivering content over the Internet and believed that was
the key to striking a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said executives close to the talks, Bronfman
continued to shop the company around, particularly to Sony and the
News Corp. While both companies expressed initial interest, talks
with neither company went anywhere. Over the next eight months,
Bronfman met with Messier nine more times before reaching a deal
about 10 days ago.

SADLY, A BURNING MEMORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ You want to remember Monday night for the right
reasons. But it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after midnight, our stories on the Lakers' title-
clinching victory finished and filed, a Daily News colleague and I
walked up Staples Center's 11th Street driveway ramp, out of an
arena scented with celebration and into darkness tinged with
combustion.
</P>
<P>
   I had parked in a lot across the street. He had parked blocks
away in a lot at the corner of 9th and Figueroa. We had been
watching the rioting on television in the press room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, can you drive me to my car?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh . . . sure,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers and straggling fans milled about. The worst of
the vandalism immediately outside Staples Center was over. These
things always look wider-spread on TV. We had to wait, though, for
a fire truck to pass before we could walk across 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters might be coldhearted cynics, but we get excited
about an historic moment and share in the hometown pride about Los
Angeles' first professional championship since 1988. I asked, as we
turned out of the parking lot onto Georgia Street, ``Where will
this rank among your sports memories?'' He answered, ``This was one
of the better ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we came to Olympic Boulevard and were stopped by a police
officer on foot. Squad cars were parked in the crosswalks. We
wanted to turn right and head east but were told we'd have to drive
straight ahead. I eased off the brake _ and immediately stomped on
it again.
</P>
<P>
   From our right, a black-and-white, lights flashing and siren
blaring, made a hard left in front of us. Then here came another
police car, and another and another. A dozen or more police cars in
single file, racing south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will remember !ital!this,'' my colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the shame of what happened after the Lakers finished off
the Indiana Pacers Monday night in the sixth game of the NBA
Finals. At least for now, what we'll remember most vividly about
the feats of the extraordinary young men in purple and gold is the
lunacy of the idiots in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The TV news shows recycled scenes of burning automobiles when
they could have been replaying Shaquille O'Neal hugging his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Radio news made the Lakers championship its lead story at 1
a.m. _ for half a sentence, before diving into a from-the-scene
report on the violence.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the nation saw and heard Los Angeles at what should
have been one of our finest hours.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call them fans. Don't call it celebration. Fans don't
celebrate their team's accomplishments by burning its posters and
T-shirts, by looting its city.
</P>
<P>
   Call them criminals, a mob looking for an excuse to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave the whys to others.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether Lakers and Staples Center officials are to
blame for drawing a crowd of thousands to the streets outside the
arena by showing the game on a huge television screen.
</P>
<P>
   (Although inviting have-nots to press their noses against the
window as ticket-holders party inside the building would seem to
encourage the us-against-the-establishment passion that would lead
to the burning of police cars and TV news vans and the smashing of
store windows.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the police are to blame for responding slowly
and weakly.
</P>
<P>
   (Although they should have remembered what has happened
following championships in other cities and seen it coming _ when
that throbbing outdoor crowd was shown on the video screen inside
Staples Center following Rick Fox's 3-pointer with 8:21 left in the
game, I turned to the writers next to me and said, ``We'll be in
here for a long time if the Lakers win.'')
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what makes people do these things.
</P>
<P>
   I do know a relative few were involved in the rioting, and that
they weren't as bad as the soccer hooligans who bust heads, not
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   I do know that Monday night's hooligans are no more
representative of the citizens of Los Angeles than Shaq is. We are
not a city of mental midgets any more than we're a city of giants.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the rest of the world realizes that, too.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, I'm not sure what I'll remember best, the
victory parade on Figueroa this morning or the police-car parade on
Olympic Monday night. &QL;

 &HT;    Researchers exploring high-tech solution to rail crossing
collisions
 &HT;    By Joe Ledford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ As the brown Honda approached the unguarded
railroad crossing Tuesday, the radar detector hanging from its
windshield erupted with a constant stream of beeps.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what you think. Otto Rausch's detector hadn't picked up
a trooper trying to write him a ticket. It had detected the big red
and white Georgia Northeastern Railroad Co. locomotive sitting 164
feet down the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how it's beeping now?'' asked Rausch, a senior research
scientist at Georgia Tech. ``We're getting good signal strength.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch, Gene Greneker, another Georgia Tech researcher, and
Danny Diaz, a Georgia Tech senior, were working on the railroad on
this hot steamy day, testing a technology that could someday soon
be saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, only about 30 miles from this spot just north of
Blue Ridge, a CSX train piled into a school bus, ripping it into
two pieces. Three children died and two others were critically
injured. The Tennessee Highway Patrol, which was called to the
crash just across the state line, later said an onboard video
camera indicated the Murray County school bus driver never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had this receiver been sitting there (on the bus) beeping _
it's pretty raucous _ it would have been a wake-up call,'' said
Greneker.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists from the Georgia Tech Research Institute have
been working on the safety warning system since 1996, getting a
grant the next year from the Federal Highway Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put one of these on every school bus in the
country,'' said Greneker, who said the system had performed
flawlessly during two days of tests. ``Next year, we'll probably go
to a rural county and put a receiver on every school bus and a
transmitter on every train going through the county.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of such tests, the safety warning system could be
ready for use anywhere. Greneker said he's confident enough in the
system that it could be used already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this system holds a lot of promise,'' said Dick
Hillman, safety manager for the Georgia Northeastern Railroad, who
volunteered a stretch of the railroad's popular Blue Ridge Scenic
Railway for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Greneker said the transmitter aboard locomotives would be about
the size of a brick and is capable of transmitting a nine-digit
alphanumeric code as well as a voice message to specially designed
radar detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locomotive approaching crossing,'' the transmitted voice would
say, alerting the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Greneker said it is conceivable the system might be cheaper than
installing electric signals and gates on all unguarded rural grade
crossings. Those can run up to $100,000 per crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The safety warning system would cost much less _ about $600 for
each receiver on each locomotive, less than $100 per radar detector
receiver and about $25 for reflectors at each grade crossing. The
reflectors, a one-square-foot metal plate, are used to reflect the
line of sight signal from the locomotive up either side of the
highway, alerting equipped motorists approaching the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The reflectors, which would sit on a pole, could be painted with
a small railroad crossbucks symbol and hopefully protected from
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed something that would degrade gracefully on a country
crossing where people might shoot it up,'' said Greneker. A
reflector might even be able to take a shot or two and still send
the radar warning up and down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitters could even be installed on crossing gates and be
programmed to beam the signals when the gates are closing. But
Hillman noted that about half of all train-vehicle collisions occur
after motorists see crossing gates _ but ignore them _ driving
around the gate in an attempt to beat the train.
</P>
<P>
   The signal can transmit up to a mile away, but the reflectors
reduce the range to the point that motorists won't be distracted by
too-frequent alarms of possible hazards too far away, said
Greneker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to warn people,'' he said, ``but not too long before
they see what they're looking for.''

ORACLE SAYS EARNINGS UP, DRIVEN BY SALES OF INTERNET SOFTWARE
APPLICATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Propelled by strong sales of software
applications for doing business over the Internet, Oracle Corp. on
Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings well in excess of
analysts' estimates. But sales of Oracle's core database product
slightly trailed estimates, and Oracle shares dropped in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding investment gains, Oracle reported earnings of $926
million, or 31 cents a diluted share, up 76 percent from similarly
adjusted earnings of $527 million, or 18 cents a share, in the
period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $3.37 billion
from $2.94 billion, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 26 cents in the quarter,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Total earnings for the quarter ended May 31 were $4.91 billion,
or $1.63 a diluted share. Total earnings included a $6.5 billion
one-time gain from the sale of shares of 12 percent of Oracle's
holdings in Oracle Japan; Oracle now owns 74 percent of the
operation. This equity reduction was necessary for Oracle Japan to
comply with the listing requirements of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed Tuesday at $86.04, up 0.04 cents, in Nasdaq
trading, but dropped by $5 in after hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had one chink in their armor, which is that database
growth wasn't as strong as it should have been,'' said Robert
Austrian, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``But that's
balanced by the five gold stars they get in other areas. Their
e-business applications really are taking off and that of course is
the future of the new economy. Operating margins are on fire, and
it's really a case of leading by example.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said a year ago that it would cut $1 billion from
expenses, and company executives say that goal has been
accomplished by using their own Internet-based applications for
processes like sales force management and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now shooting for $2 billion,'' Geoff Henley, Oracle's
chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. ``Of course
the second billion will be harder. It will have to come from higher
revenue growth, but we're confident we can do that,'' he said. ``A
billion dollars in annual savings translates to a 10-point
improvement in our margins. In Q4, our operating margin improved
13.7 points from 27.4 percent to 41.1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley said the greatest contributor to the quarter's sales was
the strong growth in applications, and he added that he sees this
performance continuing in the first quarter. Oracle said
applications software sales increased 61 percent to $447 million in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-one percent growth is just a stunning number, and the
pipeline is absolutely awesome. I would expect to see higher
license growth in Q1 than in Q4,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent slowdown in database license growth reflects a
shift in Oracle's sales model, not a longterm demand trend, Henley
said. ``It is strictly a comparison issue,'' he said. ``We had a
few really big deals close in Q4 1999, and we didn't do that this
year, by choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in applications was led by customer relationship
management, or CRM, programs, sales of which grew at a 161 percent
rate. Companies use CRM programs to manage sales and service
operations. Database software sales increased 12 percent to $1.2
billion. Consulting, education and support revenues increased 7
percent to $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman and chief executive, said that
during the last quarter Oracle sold more application software than
SAP, the large European software company, ``$447 million vs. $352
million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our applications business has been accelerating while there
has been flat. We think we have a chance of rolling up the
enterprise applications space,'' he said in a conference call with
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, adjusted net income increased 61 percent to $2.1
billion, or 69 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion,
or 43 cents a share, in fiscal 1999. Revenue grew 15 percent to
$10.13 billion from $8.83 billion in the previous year.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alliance Capital Management, the giant New York money
management firm, has agreed to acquire the privately held money
management and research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. for $3.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was announced after trading closed Tuesday,
would create a company with $475 billion in assets under
management, 4,000 employees and 5.8 million mutual fund
shareholders. In trading after hours, Alliance, which is controlled
by the French financial services holding company AXA Group, fell
2.9 percent, to $48.50.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance is publicly traded, but structured as a limited
partnership. The deal consists of about $1.5 billion in cash and
40.8 million newly issued limited partnership shares of Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   After the death last year of Zalman C. Bernstein, the founder of
Sanford C. Bernstein who changed his name after converting to
Orthodox Judaism, executives have considered selling the company,
including a public offering. After the stock offering in Goldman
Sachs last year, Bernstein was left as one of the last prominent
privately held securities firms in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The combination is another in a string of recent mergers and
acquisitions among money management firms. Last week, the
Boston-based money manager Nvest agreed to be acquired by the
French money manager CDC Asset Management, in a deal valued at $700
million. On Monday, Old Mutual, a South African money manager,
agreed to buy United Asset Management Corp. for $1.46 billion. And
last month, UniCredito Italiano Group agreed to acquire the Boston
mutual fund company Pioneer Group for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is becoming very commoditized, and it's become
very hard to differentiate yourself,'' said Christopher J. Brown,
an analyst with Financial Research, a mutual fund industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Alliance and Bernstein, however, is larger
than the three previous deals combined, and the new company will
manage billions of dollars in retail and institutional accounts,
including equities and fixed-income investments. It also brings
together two firms known for different styles of investing.
According to Alliance executives, the potential for more
diversified offerings is part of the deal's attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliance Capital is a recognized leader in the growth style of
investing; Bernstein in the value style,'' said Bruce W. Calvert,
chief executive of Alliance. Bernstein is also one of the largest
managers of private portfolios for wealthy clients, a coveted field
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to compete effectively for institutional
investment management assignments in any of the world's major
markets,'' Calvert said.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent investment styles have led to divergent fortunes
of late for the firms. Investors, who have been impatient with
value-oriented investing during the technology-fueled bull market,
have withdrawn $1.6 billion from Bernstein mutual funds this year,
through April, making the firm's mutual fund division the
industry's third-worst seller, according to Financial Research.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance funds, meanwhile, have had $3.5 billion in inflows over
the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bernstein's struggles, the addition of a value-oriented
firm is considered critical to AXA's plans to broaden Alliance's
investment offerings and be ``sort of an international Citigroup,''
according to Clare Nickson, an analyst at UBS Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, AXA also controls Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
and AXA Financial, formerly the Equitable Companies.

DEATH OF A FRIEND PUTS TYSON IN A SOMBER MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Being Mike Tyson means never having to say anything.
But his very presence induces an inimitable maelstrom of tumult and
disorder, even in London _ the home, incidentally, of the reigning
heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The play of England's national soccer team in the 2000 European
championships may be the top sports story here this week, but Tyson
has managed to find his niche in the sports soap opera category.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he made news by canceling the only London news
conference he had scheduled for Saturday's fight in a Scottish
soccer stadium against Lou Saverese.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to meet with reporters is not significant for Tyson,
but since he has already postponed the Saverese fight twice _ and
delayed his trip to London by four days because of the death of a
friend _ it fueled new suspicions that he may still pull out of
this fight.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Tommy Brooks, Tyson's co-trainer, who said of his
fighter, ``He's mentally distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks acknowledged that Tyson was disturbed enough by the June
9 murder of a longtime friend, Darryl Baum, that he considered
postponing the fight last week. But then, there was the matter of
his contract with Showtime. Brooks said of Tyson, ``He's trying to
honor the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson did take a walk along Park Lane, across from Hyde Park,
followed by a huge contingent of reporters and photographers.
Wearing a soccer jersey and matching shorts, he stopped to pose for
a few photos and shook hands with some well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a familiar public figure here. He took to the
streets of London on Sunday as well, visiting a tailor on Bond
Street by day and two wine bars in the Brixton neighborhood by
night. English newspapers ran accounts of Tyson being mobbed at the
wine bars. They quoted a female photographer who said she was
rescued by Tyson when the crush of people rushing at the boxer
knocked her over and pinned her against a railing. The photographer
said Tyson interceded and saved her from injury.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, British television crews were camped outside
Tyson's hotel astride Hyde Park hoping to catch his next absorbing
foray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Tyson does, whether it's good or bad, the more they
want to see him,'' Saverese said Tuesday, a wily smile beneath a
boxer's askew nose. It's like going to a car race to see a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Tyson does not appear to be is woefully out of shape.
It had been rumored that his weight had ballooned to 270 pounds,
but walking past reporters on his way to a brief workout, he looked
trim. And calm.
</P>
<P>
   He also responded quietly to a question or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to fight,'' said Tyson, whose appearance in London
has also been opposed by leaders of women's groups, who did not
want him, as a convicted rapist, granted entry to England. ``That's
what I do. I'm a professional fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   This being the stealthy, shady world of boxing, where the
referee's last command is always ``protect yourself at all times,''
there are some who believe Tyson did not meet with reporters or
open his workout as planned because he is hiding something from
Saverese.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to play along, Brooks said: ``We have a nice little
surprise set up for Saverese. We've been working on some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had been expected to arrive in London last Wednesday, but
instead he flew from Phoenix, where he had been training, to New
York to attend Baum's funeral on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's handlers said Baum and Tyson had been friends since
grade school. Brooks said Baum was like a brother to Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated each other like family,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Baum had been with Tyson in Phoenix until June 8. Because he was
not part of the group coming to England for the fight, Baum flew
home to New York. He was shot on a street corner the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mike's hurting,'' Jay Bright, Tyson's other trainer,
said. ``But he's very focused about these things. I never heard
anything about the fight being postponed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but when Tyson flew to London on Sunday, Saverese _
already training in Glasgow _ made sure he got the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard he had landed over here,'' said Saverese, who
flew to London Tuesday to conduct his scheduled news conference,
``I was doing back flips in Glasgow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Tyson plans a last London workout. He may even
entertain questions from reporters. Or he may not.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Tyson is set to fly to Scotland. He is
expected to be met at the airport by protesters opposed to his
presence. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: ``Son,
always do right. Always do right.'' His father, the senator, felt
he had himself done right a lot of the time, and he reliably kept
after his son to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two
nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had
tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in
part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books.
This time, nobody came right out and accused Gore himself of
tweaking the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now
widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
</P>
<P>
   That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
vice president. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests
that Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every
remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently
said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered
if he could prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are about more than Gore's claims about the
Internet and ``Love Story.'' What in his life was scripted and what
was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing
out hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
</P>
<P>
   But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Gore's life,
perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
material that is the most widely doubted is also the most
demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in
Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm there _ so hard, in fact,
that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father
should ease up.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Gore's
life is not true: He did not, for example, live in luxury back in
Washington during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents were both famously frugal, and they were not well
off until after their son was grown and after the senator's
political career had ended. Though they sent their children to
exclusive schools and provided social necessities like ballroom
dancing lessons for their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's
hand-me-downs and lived in a hotel because it was owned by a
relative who gave them a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the contours of Gore's unusual
upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
childhood _ the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him
the most good politically. The problem, for him, are the scenes
from the past that portray Gore sympathetically at the expense of
his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy
forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations, and Gore,
who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory
of his father, categorically balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign and his son's near-fatal car accident the
next year, Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of
his own life story. He made a serious study of family dysfunction _
the subtext of his 1992 environmental manifesto, ``Earth in the
Balance'' _ and passed out copies of Alice Miller's ``Drama of the
Gifted Child,'' a book about how narcissistic parents can leave
their high-achieving children cut off from their own feelings and
hazy on just what they want, other than to make Mom and Dad proud.
Back then, friends said, he was absorbed by the need to figure
things out, to emerge from his father's shadow. To decide.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want to be
president, and if he can never really know exactly how much of that
desire began with his parents, his current attitude seems to be: So
what? ``One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows
parent,'' he said recently, with what seemed like authentic
boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and
appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood
in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of
continuing political calculations _ maybe the same way writers
often end up milking their families for material. When he got in
trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore
farm when he was 12, for example, his father made him send letters
of apology to a number of trucking companies. ``That was also an
election year, I believe,'' he remarked wryly. But, he made clear,
it was also just a kid's life.

 &HT;    Raspberries in rhapsody: It's time to take your pick of the crop
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ tired of forking over megabucks for a miniscule
box of raspberries that are soft and moldy at the bottom? Well,
rejoice. Local raspberries are in season.
</P>
<P>
   For three glorious weeks, as spring eases into summer, the
harvest of local raspberries begins at area farms.
</P>
<P>
   Picking at Stoke's Berry Farm near Wilmington, Hidden Valley in
Warren County and Monnin Fruit Farm in Montgomery County started
Thursday with black raspberries, always the first to ripen. Red
raspberries are expected to be available at the middle or end of
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Stokes, who operates the biggest berry farm this side of
the Mississippi River, says the crop looks good and the harvest
might stretch into a fourth week.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside is that devout raspberry fanciers still have
to seek out the berries at farms and farm markets. Forget about
one-stop shopping at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   At some farms, berries may be available for picking as well as
by the quart. They don't get any fresher than that.
</P>
<P>
   And freshness is essential for these most-perishable berries. As
Stokes says, people are more and more distant from the farm and
don't realize how much longer produce can keep when it's fresh.
With attention to the details of storing the berries, they can last
two to three days in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   First, take a cooler to the farm or market. Don't haul the
berries home in a hot car. Don't stick them in the refrigerator
still in the quart basket. Spread the berries in a single layer on
a cookie sheet. Stokes is not in favor of lining the sheet with
paper towels, because when the towels get damp, that can encourage
mold. Don't cover the berries because that, too, can cause moisture
to form. And because the berries aren't covered, be sure there's
nothing like smoked fish in the refrigerator. Uncovered berries
will pick up any refrigerator aromas.
</P>
<P>
   While a big bowl of raspberries and cream may be the first and
best way to enjoy abundant raspberries, they can be dressed up even
for special occasions. Below are three easy recipes.
</P>
<P>
   RASPBERRIES IN CHANTILLY CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   I made this fabulous dessert with the first berries off the
farm. The recipe offers a triple hit of raspberries. Serve with
thin, crisp cookies, preferably chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whipping cream, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons raspberry liqueur
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   Whip the cream with the jam, powdered sugar and liqueur until it
thickens and forms very soft peaks. (The cream can be prepared up
to two hours before serving and refrigerated.) Just before serving,
rinse the berries gently in water and drain. Divide the raspberry
cream among 4 shallow dessert bowls. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of berries
over the top of each.
</P>
<P>
   Look for mini bottles of Chambord at liquor/wine stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe from Short &AMP; Sweet, Sophisticated Deserts in No Time at
All by Melanie Barnard (Houghton-Mifflin, $25).
</P>
<P>
   RASPBERRIES WITH TWO SORBETS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   This dessert celebrates the exquisite pairing of raspberries and
chocolate. Stash store-bought frozen raspberry and chocolate
sorbets in the freezer. When you pick or buy raspberries at the
farm, an elegant dessert can be ready in just a few minutes. I
prefer Haagen Dazs sorbets in these flavors. Add a tablespoon or
two of sugar to the berries if they aren't as sweet as you like.
</P>
<P>
   1 pint red or black raspberries
</P>
<P>
   1 pint raspberry sorbet
</P>
<P>
   1 pint chocolate sorbet
</P>
<P>
   Lightly rinse berries and set aside to drain on paper towels.
Put a scoop of raspberry and chocolate sorbets on individual
dessert plates and scatter berries around them.
</P>
<P>
   MASCARPONE AND BERRY PARFAITS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   This parfait calls for mascarpone, a soft Italian-style cream
cheese not available everywhere. If you can't find it, use this
substitute: Blend 12 ounces cream cheese (not low-fat) with 6
tablespoons whipping cream and 1/4 cup sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   1 full pint fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 8-ounce containers mascarpone cheese
</P>
<P>
   Blend 1 1/2 cups of the berries and sugar in a food processor to
a smooth puree. Drop a few of the remaining berries in the bottom
of four wine glasses. Top with a little of the mascarpone and two
tablespoons of the puree. Repeat, layering two more times,
finishing with the soft cheese and then a few berries. Chill at
least one hour before serving.

 UNDATED: kid's life. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROM THE FARM AND THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   ``I was conceived in Tennessee,'' Gore began, drawling for
effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
biographical exercise. Though his political opponents have
successfully portrayed him as a pure-bred Washington creature, with
only photo-op moments in the heartland, he did have a life there,
on the family farm, and by all accounts a more intense emotional
connection to that place than to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
time with adults _ important adults, in whose presence he was
expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where
the Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. ``There
were not a lot of kids around the Fairfax,'' the Embassy Row hotel
where the Gores lived while in Washington, ``so he could not wait
to get back home,'' said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest
childhood friend, and a good pal still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up there'' when Gore was in high school, ``and the
friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop,'' Armistead said.
``There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There
was a dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around
Washington much when he could have been in Carthage, and that's
where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around
Smith County people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee
_ and of the very fact of having grown up in two places, with two
groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was born
in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he
was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved between
the two places until college.
</P>
<P>
   This back and forth set him slightly apart from those around
him, in season and out, and made him tough to figure. Even his
sense of humor is a hybrid, a little bit corny with flashes of
sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
world was a gift, at least in the end. ``Even though I spent more
time each year in Washington, Tennessee was home,'' he said
recently. ``Now I'm sure that part of that was me, as a kid,
absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of their
lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Tennessee as a place where ``the human
relationships were much warmer,'' and where he had his dearest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned a great deal from the, forgive the word, the
parallactic view provided by growing up in two places,'' he says
now, ``because just as having two eyes gives you depth perception,
having two homes allows you to see some things that stand out in
relief when viewed from two different perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father _ who also favored fancy words _ moved between two
worlds, too, and for all his striving in Washington did not believe
in leaving either Tennessee or his farm roots behind, ever, even
after his career in politics ended.
</P>
<P>
   And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be
good for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be
president one day. ``It was expected from the time he was little,''
said James Fleming, a Nashville, Tenn., doctor and friend of Nancy
Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family physician. It was
not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add
just the right touch of ``log cabin'' to his resume, family friends
said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him
a proper work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``His daddy used to get him up about 6 o'clock in the morning,''
said Mattie Lucie Payne, who worked for the Gores as a housekeeper
for more than 40 years. ``And Al would say, `Daddy, we have men
working,' and his daddy would say, `I know, and you go on down and
help them.'''
</P>
<P>
   He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
the hired help. But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning
his son some of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly
acres with a hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drive him pretty hard,'' said Gordon Thompson, a friend
whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own
father worked for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Al Gore drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as
a 9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. ``He was the only camper
I ever had volunteer for K-P,'' said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H
agent.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks every summer after school let out, but before
his parents could get away from Washington, Thompson said, Al would
stay with them in a house with no indoor plumbing. ``He never
complained,'' Thompson said. ``I think he was always happiest on
the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was serious. ``He pretty much acted the same way when
he was 13 as he does now,'' said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
sister and Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific listener,'' recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
stretches several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own mother ``was not very touchy,'' Ms. Armistead said,
adding, ``When he came in she just wouldn't come running to hug
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said his father used an entirely different voice when he
talked with Al. ``He'd talk with authority,'' she said. And nobody,
the way Ms. Armistead remembers it, gave him any breaks for being a
senator's son.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after Gore and Ms. Armistead had done a particularly hard
job on the farm, the senator told him to take her out for a meal at
a certain cafe. ``We were so thrilled,'' she remembered. ``But
after dinner Al gets up to the cash register and said, `My dad said
to charge it to him,' and the guy wouldn't do it.''

 UNDATED: Armistead said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A TOUCH OF MISCHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Still, his time in Tennessee was not all boot camp and character
building, and Gore did manage to have some unscripted fun. Thompson
remembers his friend as ``pranky,'' with a love of practical jokes
that endures today.
</P>
<P>
   One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole
group was snowed in at the Gore farm, so Pauline Gore corralled all
the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the
lower level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty
at the top of the stairs all night long, and every so often yelled
downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one
bottle of beer.
</P>
<P>
   At first light, Ms. Armistead heard a knock on the window,
looked out and saw Al and his buddies, who had slipped out a window
and climbed up onto the deck outside her room, where they were
making snowmen in their underwear for the girls' benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Albert still thought he had everything under control,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Steve, describes a pretty mild teen-age rebellion:
``We did all the experimental things kids do. We'd sneak out at
night and pick up Coke bottles off a front porch that probably were
not ours, or go to the lake and maybe do a little water skiing at
night that was not too smart, and occasionally have a party. We
probably did a little bit of alcohol abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also times, even as a kid, when Gore flouted
authority more frontally. Once, while staying with the Thompsons,
he heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a
speech in Nashville, 55 miles east. His parents, though, had
decided that their son should not come to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was little,'' 12 at most, Thompson said, ``but Al went over
to Carthage and caught the bus and went down there, still dressed
for the farm. That didn't go over too well. His mom called and
wanted to know where he was _ that was a biggie. My mom had to tell
her he wasn't here. Today, you'd be worried about all kinds of
things happening. But they were more concerned about him not being
all cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of mothers, Pauline Gore always insisted publicly
that her son was at all times the perfect boy. But was she
embellishing a little? At least at times, she apparently thought
she had reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   James Fleming, the Nashville doctor, said, ``I remember Donna,
this good-looking girl, running around the house, and Pauline
saying, ``Ohmigod, she's going to get pregnant, I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not shy about expressing affection for his girlfriend
in front of his mother. ``I remember Pauline and I drove him to the
airport one time,'' said Ms. Armistead, ``and he kissed her on the
cheek and then he kissed me. I mean, he laid one on me, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armistead says the two of them were lectured. ``Miss Pauline
said keep busy, don't think about sex, enjoy your time together but
always have something in mind to do,'' she said. ``Cold showers and
lots of exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also says Mrs. Gore need not have worried. ``Sex was sex
even then,'' Ms. Armistead said, ``but Al and I both had goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the
benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in
Tennessee _ skinny dipping with Thompson in a cattle trough or
hypnotizing chickens, which Gore says is ``a little-known farm
skill passed down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also situates himself politically in Tennessee, as heir not
only to his father but to Cordell Hull, whom he describes as ``the
model for public service in our part of the country.'' Hull floated
logs down the Cumberland River with Gore's grandfather, settled in
Carthage and became the congressman in the seat the Gore father and
son later held.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent free-trader, Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize for his
role in founding GATT, now the World Trade Organization, and was
secretary of state during World War II. ``But before that he was a
judge on the circuit, and in 10 counties there, the picture above
the judge's chair in the courtroom is neither George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson nor Franklin Roosevelt,'' Gore said, with the
greatest possible reverence. ``It's Cordell Hull to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the most important things he had inherited from
his parents, Gore talked for a long time about his father and his
father's ideals. But the first thing he said in answer to the
question was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality I
sometimes lapse into comes in part from my father's habit of trying
to ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live
up to the position he felt deserved dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find
that ironic because they don't remember the formal bearing that he
had in most of his appearances. He had a capacity to enjoy humor
and music and friendship, and he also felt the need to present
himself as a senator in a formal and dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew the senator say his climb from poverty was still
too fresh and stereotypes of Tennessee hillbillies with dirt under
their fingernails still too prevalent for him to feel he could
afford the luxury of letting his guard down in certain public
settings.
</P>
<P>
   His father ``always raised cattle, he always farmed, he always
found relaxation, even in Washington, by going to the farm and
working with cattle,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he became a statesman,'' too, Gore said. ``I've often
thought in my father's persona he continued to manifest both.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends feel sure Gore would move back to Carthage if, as
Thompson delicately put it, ``worse comes to worst.'' The vice
president laughed at that, but agreed. ``Well, I'll retire in
Carthage for sure,'' he said. ``You know, I hope that's many years
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to
wear any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for
him _ T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St.
Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like
he was better than the rest of us,'' guessed his old friend Edward
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who had his boots up on the table in front of him as
he talked, snorted when he heard this. ``I guess maybe they were
thinking that Washington is such a neat place,'' he said, ``that I
would naturally want to tell them all about the great things
there.''

 UNDATED: things there.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON CHILDHOOD
</P>
<P>
   If the Fairfax was a cold place to grow up, it was not because
there was no family close by. The owner, Grady Gore, was a cousin
of the senator's. Louise Gore, one of Grady's daughters, lived in
the hotel. Her sister, Mary Gore Dean, moved in, too, after her
husband died in a plane crash. For a while, their brother Jimmy
Gore and his family were on the premises, as well. When they moved,
it was just down the block.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president is not sentimental about his time there.
``I came to love the farm,'' he said. ``The hotel I never loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's correspondence makes clear that he and his family
were there because the price was right. The Gores looked for a
house in Washington for years, but never found anything they felt
they could afford.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing that seems to bother Gore _ far more, in fact,
than the idea that his 52 years add up to something that is not so
much a life as a story line _ is the perception that ``I was in
this luxury apartment eating room service, sort of like Eloise.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his younger days in Washington were lonely, he sighed.
``Oh, no,'' he said. ``I mean I had good friends and I had my
sister. And it's not as if I didn't have my parents. They went out
frequently, and every six years they had a hard campaign, but they
were great and loving parents, and the times when they were pulled
away I had Nancy and my friends. I wasn't left alone with my
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   He got pretty creative about making his own fun, sometimes
upending all the furniture in the living room to construct an
elaborate fort. But activity was supposed to be purposeful. ``His
dad was a very, very proud man and believed that old Cordell Hull
thing of you're put on earth for a purpose and it's to improve the
condition of life,'' said Gore's cousin, Mark Gore, who lived down
the block.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin also remembers Senator Gore teaching him to swim by
throwing him into a pool when he was 4, while Al, who was 7, looked
on, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
Episcopal boys prep school on the grounds of the National
Cathedral, where he did well but was not, according to friends,
especially happy. Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee
girlfriend, Donna Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay
phone every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gore's closest Washington friends recall that while Al
Gore was the focus of his parents' fondest hopes, it was his
free-spirited, rebellious sister, Nancy, who took more of their
energy. ``The general topic of conversation over there was what
outrageous thing Nancy did this week,'' said one of these friends.
``She got a lot of attention, and Al was kind of an afterthought,
because he never misbehaved.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around
with his father at Grady Gore's estate in Potomac, Md. ``He had
some cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there,'' Gore said,
smirking as if he thought that sounded kind of crazy. ``And a lot
of times on weekends we'd go up there and he'd work with the cattle
and I'd help him and then we'd take a break.'' Sometimes, too, they
played catch in the Russell building, outside the senator's office,
though if someone walked by, ``he'd duck back into the office until
they passed'' because ``it wasn't very dignified,'' the son
recalled. When Al Gore had real ballgames, though, it was his
sister, not his father, who would come.
</P>
<P>
   More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat
through long stretches of discussion over the bill, co-sponsored by
his father, that created the Interstate system of highways. How
wide would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a
kid, Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the
miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the
Yankees' box scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't
supposed to,'' Gore remembered. And one day, when Gore was 5, he
was invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard
Nixon, who was presiding that day: ``He put me on his knee and was
very nice to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of
the more sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Gore's father let his son listen in on an extension while
he spoke to President Kennedy, who at the time was furious at a
certain steel executive for raising prices after the steel workers
had agreed not to seek a wage increase. ``The family anecdote that
my father always told after that _ like a lot of family anecdotes I
can't really vouch for _ but he said that I said, `Dad, I didn't
know presidents talked that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president does have strong memories of Kennedy, though.
``I was blown away by his inaugural address,'' he said. ``I
remember so vividly the thick snow on the seats, and listening to
each word bring out such poetic force. Really, it was a remarkable
time. My sister was one of the first volunteers for the Peace Corps
that month, and the whole family was filled with the excitement of
the New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted, each in their own way, to be part of that
excitement. And the entire family talked a lot about not just the
bills before Congress but the big issues of the day, especially
civil rights. In these discussions, was his mother more liberal
than his father, as some who knew the couple have suggested?
``Mmmmm, my dad was pretty liberal,'' Gore answered. ``She was,
like most moms, the conscience of the family, but they didn't
really disagree. And my sister was more liberal than both of them
put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore started to laugh, and kept on for a good long time.
``It was a family of many consciences,'' he said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: ``Son,
always do right. Always do right.'' His father, the senator, felt
he had himself done right a lot of the time, and he reliably kept
after his son to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two
nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had
tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in
part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books.
This time, nobody came right out and accused Gore himself of
tweaking the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rawest and most intimate moments in Gore's life are now
widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
</P>
<P>
   That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
vice president. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests
that Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every
remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently
said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered
if he could prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are about more than Gore's claims about the
Internet and ``Love Story.'' What in his life was scripted and what
was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing
out hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
</P>
<P>
   But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Gore's life,
perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
material that is the most widely doubted is also the most
demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in
Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm there _ so hard, in fact,
that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father
should ease up.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Gore's
life is not true: He did not, for example, live in luxury back in
Washington during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents were both famously frugal, and were not well off
until after their son was grown and after the senator's political
career had ended. Though they sent their children to exclusive
schools and provided social necessities like ballroom dancing
lessons for their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's
hand-me-downs and lived in a hotel because it was owned by a
relative who gave them a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the contours of Gore's unusual
upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
childhood _ the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him
the most good politically. The problem, for him, are the scenes
from the past that portray Gore sympathetically at the expense of
his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy
forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations, and Gore,
who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory
of his father, categorically balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews about his life, Gore was relaxed and
appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood
in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of
continuing political calculations _ maybe the same way writers
often end up milking their families for material. When he got in
trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore
farm when he was 12, for example, his father made him send letters
of apology to a number of trucking companies. ``That was also an
election year, I believe,'' Gore remarked wryly. But, he made
clear, it was also just a kid's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was conceived in Tennessee,'' Gore began, drawling for
effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
biographical exercise. Though his political opponents have
successfully portrayed him as a pure-bred Washington creature, with
only photo-op moments in the heartland, he did have a life there,
on the family farm, and by all accounts a more intense emotional
connection to that place than to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
time with adults _ important adults, in whose presence he was
expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where
the Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. ``There
were not a lot of kids around the Fairfax,'' the Embassy Row hotel
where the Gores lived while in Washington, ``so he could not wait
to get back home,'' said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest
childhood friend, and a good pal still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up there'' when Gore was in high school, ``and the
friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop,'' Armistead said.
``There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There
was a dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around
Washington much when he could have been in Carthage, and that's
where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around
Smith County people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee
_ and of the very fact of having grown up in two places, with two
groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was born
in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he
was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved between
the two places until college.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
world was a gift, at least in the end. ``Even though I spent more
time each year in Washington, Tennessee was home,'' he said
recently. ``Now I'm sure that part of that was me, as a kid,
absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of their
lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Tennessee as a place where ``the human
relationships were much warmer,'' and where he had his dearest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents thought that working on the farm would be good
for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be president
one day. ``It was expected from the time he was little,'' said
James Fleming, a Nashville, Tenn., doctor and friend of Nancy
Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family physician. It was
not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add
just the right touch of ``log cabin'' to his resume, family friends
said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him
a proper work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
the hired help. But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning
his son some of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly
acres with a hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drive him pretty hard,'' said Gordon Thompson, a friend
whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own
father worked for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as a
9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. ``He was the only camper
I ever had volunteer for K-P,'' said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was serious. ``He pretty much acted the same way when
he was 13 as he does now,'' said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
sister and Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific listener,'' recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
stretches several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   His friends feel sure Gore would move back to Carthage if, as
Thompson delicately put it, ``worse comes to worst.'' The vice
president laughed at that, but agreed. ``Well, I'll retire in
Carthage for sure,'' he said. ``You know, I hope that's many years
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to
wear any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for
him _ T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St.
Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like
he was better than the rest of us,'' guessed his old friend Edward
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
Episcopal boys prep school on the grounds of the National

especially happy. Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee
girlfriend, Ms. Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay

NICHOLSON GETS CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all its quirks and aberrations, Manhattan is
often thought of as America's Oz. But there lurks, right in the
heart of the city, a smaller, even weirder Oz _ a Mini-Me of
strangeness. It is Nicholson, and nearly everything about it seems
designed to neutralize all known standards of restaurant criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The place has a history. For nearly half a century, it was Cafe
Nicholson, named after its creator, Johnny Nicholson, a window
dresser, antiques dealer and bohemian with a taste for high
society. In 1949, almost on a whim, he decided to open a cafe,
enlisting Edna Lewis as his chef. Within a couple of years, the
restaurant moved into its present location, a former artist's
studio, and a legend was born. Cafe Nicholson became the haunt of
society folk, writers, artists, actors and theater people. In a New
York restaurant scene defined by cozy neighborhood joints and
imposing temples of haute cuisine, Cafe Nicholson stood alone and
apart, a theme restaurant whose only theme was its owner's
idiosyncratic style.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson sold the restaurant last year, and it would have
seemed a safe bet that, with his disappearance from the scene, the
air would rush out of the souffle. Not so. A meal at Nicholson (the
restaurant has dropped ``Cafe'' from its name) may still be the
oddest legal experience available in New York.

   To begin with, Nicholson occupies a peculiar spot, perched at
the edge of the entrance to the upper roadway of the Queensboro
Bridge. It looks like a guardhouse, and it's not much larger. You
enter through a narrow, open-air passageway, walk down five steps,
and enter what feels like a private home. Past a tiny bar and a
lounge, the dining room awaits.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very distinctive room. Nicholson's decor was once
described as Spanish-Portuguese belle epoque, and under the new
owner and chef, Patrick Woodside, working with the architect
Alexander Gorlin, things have become only more complex. The
cane-work settees with their silk throw pillows remain. So do the
brightly colored Spanish wall tiles with a satyr motif, the pastel
panels filled with cupids, and the stenciled ceiling border
depicting lily pads and lizards. The skylight, however, has been
replaced with a recessed panel covered in gold leaf, and the room
is now dominated by a large central table supporting multiple
exotic floral arrangements. Up front, the intimate lounge with a
small bar is also new.
</P>
<P>
   An erratic Modernist streak now runs through the design. Plates
look like heavyweight 1950s ashtrays. Water is poured from a white
ceramic cone, and bread is served in a cylindrical stone container
carved to resemble a curled strip of birch bark. Diners who reach
for the bread must then place it on a bread plate that looks like a
surfboard designed by Russel Wright. The sugar container is a Pyrex
custard cup.
</P>
<P>
   The streamlined dishes seem like antonyms, given the florid,
flamboyant style of cooking at Nicholson, which finds its natural
reflection in the dining room's Versailles-style gilt mirrors. One
evening, I ordered one of the house drinks, a Champagne cocktail
flavored with Cointreau, Chambord, gin, orange muscat and lavender.
It arrived in a shallow coupe, wide enough for a mouse to swim laps
in. A plump strawberry sat precariously on the rim. As a prelude to
the meal, the drink was the perfect symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, who also owns CamaJeBistro and Lounge in Greenwich
Village, has an opulent sensibility and a jeweler's sense of
design. Diners who might quail at the longer fixed-price menus need
have no fear. The leisurely pace of the service, and the
appetizer-size portions, make even the eight-course extravaganza an
ultra-fancy snack.
</P>
<P>
   Like the decor, the food at Nicholson swings wildly between
extremes. It can be romantic and elegant, or almost insanely
misjudged. The eight-course tasting menu, on one visit, began with
a wonderful amuse-bouche, a lump of sweetbread arranged in a
mille-feuille with cream and truffle essence.
</P>
<P>
   The road ahead was bumpy. A miniature assemblage of seared
scallops in a syrupy balsamic reduction was straightforward enough,
but the scallops lacked flavor. Three grape tomatoes, huddled
together in the center of a discus-size plate, made a bright second
act, tartly sweet in a vibrant basil vinaigrette. Lamb carpaccio,
glazed with mint and basil, had just enough thickness to support a
well-judged spicing of cumin and chili. It is hard to find a New
York menu without carpaccio. It has become a cliche. But
Nicholson's ranks among the best that I've come across.
</P>
<P>
   Truffle cream, truffles, caviar and mushrooms loom large in
Woodside's cooking vocabulary. They are the fins on his 1958
Cadillac. One evening, some combination of the four showed up on
every dish except the chocolate souffle. So it was no surprise, in
my eight-course excursion, to see truffle cream surrounding my
croustillant of shrimp and langoustine. What was surprising was the
espresso-chicory sabayon, looking unfortunately like beach foam,
that came with a lovely shell-pink pave of salmon. If the
combination sounds strange, I can testify that it tastes even
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside regained firmer ground with a pan-roasted pork
tenderloin in a red-wine reduction flavored with oxtail. It was one
of two entree choices. The alternative was a lobster treated
Souvaroff-style, a 19th-century overload preparation here involving
morels, chanterelles, spring onions and, surprise! _ truffle cream.
</P>
<P>
   After the grand tour, it's a short, sweet trip at dessert time.
Nicholson limits itself to a few classic souffles, led by a superb
but breathtakingly alcoholic apple-Calvados souffle, and
old-fashioned pleasers like a poached peach with Champagne sabayon.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Nicholson is almost indescribable. Stillness
reigns, interrupted only by the gentle creak of the parquet floor,
signaling the approach of a waiter, who, in truth, seems less like
an employee than a faithful family retainer, just as the restaurant
feels a bit like a room in the far west wing of Crotchet Castle.
The clientele seems to break down into two groups: neighborhood
residents of advanced years (it's been a long time since I've heard
an animated conversation about Perle Mesta) and young couples
seemingly on their way to a cotillion, if such things exist
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say, I left Nicholson on each visit with a look of
stupefied wonder on my face, and a feeling of regret. It is the one
restaurant guaranteed to make the world outside its doors, the mad,
mad circus of Manhattan, seem like an absolute bore.

SIMPLICITY VIA UNHEARD COMPLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of a music so sure of its power that it need not raise its
voice above mezzo piano. Think of graceful arcs of phrase
reminiscent of Bellini. The harmonic and rhythmic language is
received, not invented, yet its predictabilities are paradoxically
filled with surprise. Wonder as well at how such extremes of
civility emanate from a region seemingly condemned to political
turmoil and chronic violence. What Latin America struggles to
achieve in its civic life it produces effortlessly in its musical
art.
</P>
<P>
   That art is carried to its delicate conclusion in the music of
Joao Gilberto, the Brazilian composer, singer and guitarist, who
offered an uninterrupted hour and a half of songs and instrumentals
recently at Carnegie Hall. Facing a JVC Jazz Festival audience left
restless and unnerved by an hour's delay, Gilberto (whose hotel, by
the way, was only a few doors down 57th Street) finally arrived,
excused himself lamely and tamed his listeners in five minutes. The
precision of the music evidently does not extend to private life.
</P>
<P>
   Avuncular and almost frail in his late 60s, though with
astonishing mastery of complex guitar patterns, Gilberto croaked
tonelessly in his bottom notes and barely whispered in his middle
range but sent out little ribbons of treble notes so pure and so
loaded with emotion as to set the nerve ends to tingling. We know
the stepwise chord patterns from years of listening to them yet
await them eagerly. Gilberto toys with expectations by revoicing
his chords, the highest notes suddenly made prominent in parallel
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected, too, are the disparities between sung text and
musical line, where the words of phrases often speed to an end
before the music beneath them has run its course. The compression
extends to meter, Gilberto omitting beats at the end of an orderly
pattern and throwing completed phrases in our laps before the ear
is ready to receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Given the frequent crowding of words into single lines, the
equilibrium is extraordinary. Describe it as utter simplicity
achieved by means of unnoticed complication. One admires these
feats of music with a joy and serenity that the vast majority of
new music coming out of the concert hall and the opera stage is at
a loss to replicate.
</P>
<P>
   More forward and perhaps rougher at the edges are other Latin
American musical cultures. There is the Argentine tango, in the
hands of performers like Astor Piazzolla. Here, too, the patterns
of harmony and movement are predictable, but we never tire of them.
Cuban music has been much in the news with the film and recordings
of the Buena Vista Social Club. Again, straightforward messages
arrive by way of thoughtfully layered rhythmic elements. They keep
the ear busy and the heart full.
</P>
<P>
   Even at their loudest and most agitated, and even with the
ornately lugubrious poetry that often surrounds them, the tango and
the Cuban love song are unfettered efforts to communicate. The
message, whether pleasant or not, is offered in welcoming terms.
The music works to be understood.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Mozart composed, even though so much 20th-century
classical music of the highest quality evidently felt otherwise.
The horrors of the times needed accurate reportage, so music had no
responsibility to be beautiful. I sense a real public stirring for
the music of Messiaen. The average listener doesn't take the
theoretical bases seriously and is only mildly amused by the
attempts to replicate birdcalls. The ``Turangalila Symphony'' and
the ``Quartet for the End of Time'' radiate a communicable spirit
that new-music audiences have rarely found anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The songs of Gilberto and his compatriots Caetano Veloso and
Antonio Carlos Jobim represent the art of Bellini outfitted with
microphone and loudspeaker. Arias like ``Casta diva'' declaim
because they happen inside a theater and must reach back to its
farthest rows. At Carnegie Hall, Gilberto's intimate musical
conversations maintained the illusion of a small room even as they
were being projected to 2,800 people. I confess to little interest
in sound technology, but the admirable electronic devices at work
here managed to shrink the hall rather than inflate the music.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, one finds echoes of a trend familiar to Europe: the
tendency of cultures with negligible folk and popular music to
produce great classical composers. Germany (the village brass band
versus Beethoven) and Austria (Schubert versus Schrammelmusik) are
examples. Mexico has given us Revueltas, Chavez and some very
interesting formal composers. It has also given us the mariachi
band, whose charm quotient _ for me, at least _ runs to about four
minutes. (I have always suspected the existence of courses at
Mexican conservatories devoted to training mariachi trumpeters how
to play out of tune.)
</P>
<P>
   So many Eastern European cultures have made their folk music a
rallying point for political identity. Breaking free of such
loyalties is not easy. Russian and Italian composers have done
better jobs of assimilation, yet Spain's classical music, which I
adore, still seems in thrall to its flamenco and folk-music roots.
</P>
<P>
   When postwar jazz reached into free form and extended-chord
harmonies, it seemed to arrive at a limit and snap. In an instant,
there were Elvis Presley and his four-chord accompaniments. The art
of Gilberto is simple only in its effect, but a classical music
that finds itself at the outer boundaries of esoterica may find a
similar rescue somewhat to the south.

<P>
   DAMASCUS _ He sat mute before the cameras, long legs and tall
body, black-tied, head erect, flashlights playing like lightning
over the narrow face and pale blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bashar Assad _ or Lieutenant General Dr. Bashar al-Assad as
we are now enjoined by the Damascus press to call the new
commander-in-chief of the Syrian army _ was on his way to becoming
President Lieutenant General Dr. Bashar al-Assad. Courtesy of the
Syrian Arab Socialist Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   The 950 delegates, silent as sheep in the massive auditorium of
the Ebla Sham Hotel _ an institution that comes complete with grey
marble halls and spurting fountains _ could all see the back of Dr.
Bashar's head at the front of the hall as he watched the 11 members
of the Progressive Front (only one of them from Bashar's own
Alawite community) take turns to praise his father's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genius on all fronts...an architect...unique in the
world...a man of destiny...Our former secretary general is absent
today, but he is present in his values.'' And that was just the
contribution of Abdullah Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the
Baath.
</P>
<P>
   The new secretary general, of course, is going to be Lieutenant
General Dr. Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the identity of the new party leader that's
important _ it goes without saying that Hafez Assad has handed on
his rule, caliph-like, to his son _ but the party's new ``regional
command'' of 21 members who will decide the nature of the new
regime, its ruthlessness and its loyalty to Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight vacancies to fill. One was that of the late
President Assad. Another that of his disgraced brother Rifaat,
still shrieking from his Spanish villa that Bashar's succession is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the seat left by an ex-prime minister, Mahoud
Zoghbi, who shot himself while awaiting a corruption trial. And yet
another vacancy caused by the hurried exile abroad of General
Hikmat Shehabi, the Syrian army chief-of-staff from 1974 to 1998
who fled yet more corruption charges and now resides _ wait for it
_ with his son in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, Bashar's supporters and friends filled the eight
seats. Joining the regional command was Manaf Tlass _ son of
Assad's avuncular and poetic defense minister Mustafa (himself a
personal friend of Bashar), prime minister Mustafa Mero, foreign
minister Farouk el-Sharaa, minister of higher education Dr. Zuheir
Richa (a Christian from the largely Alawi city of Lattakia), Naji
Atari, the vice president for the economy, Adnan Omran, the former
ambassador to London and now information minister. And, of course,
Bashar himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strong team to take into a party leadership which _ in
theory _ governs Syria. There are other friends around Bashar, of
course. Take Assif Chawkat, his own brother-in-law who has assumed
Shehabi's importance as head of security. And even Taher Mikati,
the Lebanese brother of Lebanese minister Najib Mikati, a
techno-wizard who put Bashar online and just might _ we're talking
about Najib _ be Lebanon's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But these are mere loyalists compared to the comrades of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little question, however, that needs answering, a
question that was raised rather pointedly by the Lebanese ``As
Safir'' newspaper last week when it said of the Baath that ``the
party is a corpse.''
</P>
<P>
   If the president takes all the decisions of state _ which he
does in Syria _ what is the Baath Party other than an obedient
acolyte, 950 attendant lords and ladies whose formal role is to
raise their hands, spontaneously and unanimously together, as they
did Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   There are those even in Syria who uncharitably suspect that the
Baath Party _ both in its original Michel Aflaq-inspired form and
in the version that Assad handed down _ is a form of theatre, that
it has been dead for a long time, only to be disinterred when a
future president must be given formal legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there at the coffee break on Saturday was former
minister of information Mohamed Salman, now on corruption charges _
``at the gate of the prison'' as they say in Syria _ receiving,
frozen-faced with anxiety, the careful greetings of old party
comrades who dared to be seen approaching him.
</P>
<P>
   No one should doubt the harshness of Syrian politics. After
reporters were politely asked to leave the congress on Saturday,
there were, perhaps, some more caustic remarks, some real debate.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Lebanese journalist Selim el-Lowzi reported
disputes within the party in the seventies, he was found dead near
Beirut airport, his right arm _ his writing arm _ burned down to
the bone with acid.
</P>
<P>
   And it was President Assad _ whose words were splashed across a
black banner in the auditorium _ who said that ``all party
congresses are important because they discuss the mistakes of the
past and work on avoiding them in the future...''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that Rifaat was a mistake. And Zohbi. And Shehabi. And
we'll hear of others. But most of all we'll hear of the wisdom of
electing Lieutenant General Dr. Bashar al-Assad to be secretary
general of the Syrian Arab Socialist Baath Party. &QL;

   HAMA, SYRIA _ There are no black flags in old Hama. Except on
government buildings, of course. ``Oh Master of our nation, to
Paradise eternal gone!'' it claims on a black cloth draped from a
state school.
</P>
<P>
   But from the homes of Hama's survivors, there hang only washing
and tattered sun awnings. In the paper shop across the road from
the great, creaking ``Nuriah'' waterwheel, three piles of unsold
posters lie on the counter: Hafez el-Assad, Basil el-Assad, Bashar
el-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 18 years after the streets here ran with blood, fear
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, happened,'' an old Hama friend remarked sadly
as the sun cut through the broken glass of an old store and the
cats hissed at each other in the light. ``The past is gone. We are
children of the present _ '82 is over with. Let's say no more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the street outside his home, there are more powerful, silent
witnesses to the terrors that were visited upon this beautiful old
city.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet holes are splashed up the cut-stone facade of a
burned-out villa; rags are crudely stuffed into a shell hole that
smashed through the wall of a 17th-century house.
</P>
<P>
   The waterwheel outside the building creaks on, a screaming
complaint of ancient iron axles and soaked wood and weight as the
water of the Orontes River splashes on to the disused aqueducts.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the wheel on fire in 1982, its water buckets in flames as
four tanks beside me punched shells across the river into this very
street, the hiss and bang of each round sending back a shock wave
of sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Brotherhood defenders had fought underground with
guns and knives and grenades in the most ferocious uprising ever
staged against Hafez Assad's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian army _ led by Assad's now-disgraced brother Rifaat _
destroyed half the old city and up to 20,000 human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I suspect the figure may be closer to 12,000, but no
one doubts the scale of slaughter. The party men and the Special
Forces went around the smoking ruins afterwards, summarily
executing the wounded and the suspicious and those who could not
explain their presence. Earlier, on a smaller scale, the Muslim
Brotherhood had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the little painters' colony, a middle-aged artist has just
completed a portrait of Bashar el-Assad, the anointed heir of
Hafez, son of the man who ordered Hama's suppression, nephew of the
man who destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   He has copied Bashar's face from a magazine photograph and plans
to present it as ``a surprise'' to Hama's Baath Party city
governor. He should be pleased. It's a surprisingly lifelike
picture which ameliorates Bashar's hairline and shows his eyes to
be bluer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar the computer geek versus Hafez the repressor. It's not
hard to see how the people of Hama might prefer Bashar to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Though by a vicious irony, the regime now hates Assad's brother
Rifaat _ the pretender to the throne _ almost as much as some
people in Hama must hate Rifaat for other reasons. For like all
stories, Hama has two sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years which preceded the destruction, ``Islamists''
had attacked Baath Party workers in their homes, on one occasion
taking a whole family _ daughters and babies as well _ to cut their
throats beside the Orontes River, Algerian style.
</P>
<P>
   So when the mosques called for a holy war against Assad's regime
on Feb. 3, 1982 _ after an army unit had already been slaughtered
in a city-center ambush _ Assad struck back in a way that even the
Algerian government has since contrived to study.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Americans ``tut-tutted,'' then silently
approved the crushing of ``fundamentalist terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Death a thousand times to the hired Muslim Brothers,'' Assad
shouted in fury. ``Death a thousand times to the Muslim Brothers,
the criminal Brothers, the corrupt Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   And death came a thousand times. ``In a word, every home lost
one person,'' an old man told me by the river. ``Perhaps we will
never know the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Robert, why don't you give a break to all this about
Hama,'' a Syrian business friend pleaded with me in Damascus,
sounding more like a guidance councillor than an economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are in the past _ they're over and done with.
What happened in Hama and the events in Tadmor (a prison massacre
of 550 Muslim Brothers by Rifaat's lads on June 27, 1980) are
finished with. Things have changed. We must look to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the old, old question. Can a regime survive without
some form of acknowledgement of sins past, a truth-accountability
test for the inheritors of Baathism as well as the survivors of the
murderous Muslim Brotherhood?
</P>
<P>
   Will a time come when Bashar el-Assad can _ will _ do a
Khruschev and say that terrible things were done in the name of the
party? Would this not prove his legitimacy as well as his desire to
lead a new Syria? &QL;

ANALYSIS: VIVENDI NOW MEDIA GIANT, BUT INTERNET CONTENT PLANS STILL
DISTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related SEAGRAM-VIVENDI) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by the public pronouncements, one might think the
acquisition of Seagram by Vivendi will create a global
telecommunications powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``World's Largest Wireless Footprint,'' read one of the
bullet-points at the top of the news release announcing the
agreement. ``Vizzavi Will Be the Default Home Page for 80 million
Potential Mobile and Interactive TV Customers,'' read another,
referring to one of Vivendi's Internet initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some facts. The total of the telecommunications assets
to be owned by the new Vivendi Universal: 52 percent of Cegetel,
which is the No. 2 long-distance provider in France and also owns
80 percent of France's No. 2 cellular phone carrier. Vivendi
Universal would also own Canal Plus, a European pay television
company with 14 million subscribers, 25 percent of a British
satellite television operation, and 50 percent of the Vizzavi
European Internet portal, which began its first operation, in
France, Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vizzavi took center stage Tuesday. At their Paris news
conference, Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chairman, and Edgar
Bronfman Jr., Seagram's chief executive, repeatedly held out
Vizzavi as one of the cornerstones of their deal, as perhaps the
main engine for Vivendi Universal's growth. They heralded Vizzavi
as a tool for delivering music, and potentially video, to millions
of people using hand-held wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to get connected to your own personal music
library,'' Bronfman said at the news conference. ``I'm a great
believer in the future of wireless opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can supply Internet content way beyond Europe,'' Bronfman
added at the news conference. When someone suggested afterward that
it might take years for the technology to arrive to deliver mobile
wireless music, he said, ``Years? Months! We will be able to
distribute wireless music within months.'' Met with skepticism, he
said, ``I didn't say we'd be able to do it to 80 million people,
did I?''
</P>
<P>
   Vizzavi is meant to be an Internet portal with three legs:
wireless devices, personal computers and interactive televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some more facts: Vizzavi hardly exists. Vivendi, not to
mention Seagram, has essentially zero business providing Internet
access to computers in any country. Even Vivendi does not expect to
be able to deliver Internet access to televisions in Europe until
next year at the earliest. It will, in fact, be a year or two until
any company, in Europe or the United States, is able to deliver
digital music to mobile wireless devices on any meaningful scale.
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least two years after that until anyone is able
to deliver decent-quality video on the same scale. Vivendi
Universal has no realistic chance of becoming a player in the U.S.
wireless Internet market any time soon. And the upshot is that is
it not at all clear just how acquiring Seagram helps Vivendi with
all of the hard work it faces in building Vizzavi on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily look at this deal as one where the whole
is worth more than the sum of its parts,'' said one media analyst
in the United States Tuesday, requesting his name not be used. ``I
happen to think the Bronfmans are cashing out.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the general concept behind Vizzavi is clearly solid.
The buzz word that was electronic commerce two years ago and
business-to-business last year, is definitely mobile Internet
access this year. While many electronic commerce companies and
business-to-business electronic commerce companies have struggled
recently, no one can deny that they are serious industries. Mobile
Internet access will be serious as well, but Vivendi Universal does
not appear to be a company tailor-made to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Vivendi Universal has to work through another
company to gain access to mobile wireless users outside France.
That company is Vodafone AirTouch PLC of Britain, the world's No. 1
wireless telephone provider. (That is how Vivendi and Seagram came
up with that first bullet point.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Vodafone and Vivendi agreed to create Vizzavi
as a 50-50 joint venture. Vodafone has 58 million wireless
subscribers in Europe, but has only minority investments in some of
the carriers that serve those customers. (The 80 million figure in
the second bullet point came from adding those 58 million users to
Vivendi's pay television roster and the total number of Cegetel
customers.) Vodafone wants Vizzavi to be the preferred Internet
portal for all of its European networks, but cannot necessarily
deliver all of them (though it will probably deliver most).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vodafone is talking to other companies about their
wireless Internet portals. Though no deal appears imminent,
Vodafone has at least met with America Online Inc., for instance,
about carrying that service in Europe, according to people close to
those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the United States. Or, in reality, then there
is not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk Tuesday about Vizzavi expanding to the
United States, but that is not going to happen in a meaningful way
soon. First of all, most of the big U.S.-based wireless providers
are building portals of their own, sometimes in partnership with
U.S.-based Internet companies like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vodafone is a partner in the new Verizon wireless
carrier, which also includes Bell Atlantic's wireless operation and
will soon include GTE's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement with Vodafone, and as part of that we
have an agreement to be considered as a premier provider of content
in the U.S. as we have in Vizzavi,'' Philippe Germond, a senior
executive vice president of Vivendi, said in a telephone interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that that consideration is over, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verizon will launch it's own wireless Internet portal in the
next couple of weeks,'' Jim Gerace, a Verizon spokesman, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``It's separate and apart, though
compatible with what Vodafone is doing overseas. Our customers will
be able to go to it if they choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Verizon model, however, customers will be able to go
just about anywhere else on the Internet, as well, which means that
that compatibility is fairly close to meaningless. That is not a
word that applies to Vizzavi just now, but in Vizzavi's current
state, it might come close.

TV NOTES: `BLUES CLUES' CREATOR; `SPORTS NIGHTS'; `LATE LATE SHOW'
PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
   C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Blue's' Creator Wouldn't Stay
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if David E. Kelley were leaving ``Ally McBeal''; that
would surely make news.
</P>
<P>
   But the creator and producer of another television phenomenon
decided to leave his hit show a few months ago, and it happened
with no fanfare at all, no announcement from the network, no word
from anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the creator, Todd Kessler, is not quite as well known
as his show, and ``Blue's Clues'' may not make the cover of Vanity
Fair or even TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is just as important to its network, Nickelodeon,
as anything just about any program producer has supplied to any
other network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Clues'' has defined Nick Jr., the preschool component
of the children's cable network, and established itself in just
four years as a classic rivaling ``Sesame Street.'' ``Blue's
Clues'' is seen by 14 million children a week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, it has spawned a merchandising
empire, , from stuffed toys to lunchboxes to books.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Kessler's departure go unobserved?
</P>
<P>
   He said he simply had decided that ``it was time to move on.''
For him that meant creating a production company to develop and
produce movies and television shows for grown-ups. Kessler said he
was leaving with no hard feelings and was confident that his two
production partners, Angela Santomero and Traci Paige Johnson,
would maintain the show's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson (no relation to Traci Johnson), the Nickelodeon
executive in charge of Nick Jr., echoed Kessler's outlook on the
show's future. ``Angie and Traci really have a lot of great ideas
about what they want to do with the show,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether any conflict with Kessler had led to his
departure, Johnson said, ``I'm not comfortable talking about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to elaborate, and Kessler gave no indication that
any dispute with Nickelodeon influenced his decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler is certainly not leaving the show empty-handed. He said
he was guaranteed that he would be listed as executive producer on
the show as long as it lasts. ``I'll also have that credit on any
spinoffs they do as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has already committed itself to producing two more
years of new episodes of ``Blue's Clues,'' which runs twice each
weekday on Nickelodeon, in the morning and afternoon. Soon the show
will have additional exposure when it becomes the centerpiece of
CBS's children's programming on Saturday and Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule, which will start in September, is an early
example of the cooperation between the television holdings of
Viacom, which now owns both Nickelodeon and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler was the first creator involved with ``Blue's Clues.'' He
said he had hit on the idea of a show combining live action and
animation after being asked by Nickelodeon executives to come up
with a program concept for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler then met Santomero, who had expertise in child
development and education. They brought in Johnson, who was an
artistic designer, and formed their partnership. All three have
been listed as creators and executive producers of the show.
</P>
<P>
   One breakthrough concept that Johnson attributed to Kessler was
creating all of the animation on a conventional desktop Apple
computer. ``I've always believed in spending more on creative
people than high-priced equipment,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   The show's other novel idea was to give young children the exact
same show five days a week to make it easier for them to learn by
repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kessler is off buying short stories and novels to develop as
theatrical movies. ``This is something I always wanted to do _
start my own company and make movies,'' he said. The company is
called No Hands Productions. Kessler said he already had a deal
with Miramax Pictures to develop a film based on a short story he
had bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did 75 episodes of `Blue's Clues,''' he said. ``That's a
lot. I feel I've had so much impact with it, it's time to strike
out on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   Striking Out?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year ABC canceled ``Sports Night.'' Now Walt Disney
Co., the network's parent, is trying to sell it to another
television outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Aaron Sorkin for the Touchstone Television production
studio _ which, like ABC, is owned by Disney, the show centered on
a television sports news program much like ESPN's ``Sportscenter.''
TV Guide once called it ``the best show you're not watching.''
Despite critical praise, it did not draw very high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Although it looked as if ``Sports Night'' might live on on HBO,
negotiations between Disney and the cable company are said to be
nearly dead. And one executive said that efforts to sell it to the
TNT or Showtime cable channels did not seem to be working out.

<P>
   Though there is still hope at Disney that ``Sports Night'' will
find a home, an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity
expressed some doubt. The program is very expensive to produce, he
said, and thus very expensive to buy.
</P>
<P>
   This must come as a disappointment to Sorkin. But then, the
glass is still half-full for him. NBC has picked up his other show,
``West Wing,'' for another season.

   Late of `Late Late'
</P>
<P>
   When Craig Kilborn left Comedy Central's ``Daily Show'' for
CBS's ``Late Late Show'' in mid-1999, he was teamed with a new
producer, Billy Kimball, who was also a veteran of Comedy Central
as the producer of ``Indecision '92,'' a farcical take on that
year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Friday will be Kimball's last day on the show. He is leaving,
citing creative differences with the program's star, Kilborn. He
will be replaced by Mary Connelly, a onetime segment producer for
David Letterman, whose production company, World Wide Pants, owns
``Late Late Show.'' Most recently, she was a producer on ABC's
``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved with the show said that Kilborn and Kimball
had decided that they no longer had chemistry. A spokesman for
Worldwide Pants said they ``had different ideas about how to take
the show forward,'' but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Late Show,'' which featured Tom Snyder as the host before
Kilborn arrived, is doing better in the ratings than it did last
year. During the May sweeps, it was up 7 percent, with 1.45 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball said he was not sure what he would do next. ``My idea
had been to star as Macbeth on Broadway,'' he said, jokingly
referring to the ill-fated Broadway foray by the television actor
Kelsey Grammer. ``But a few people have called me to say that is
not a good idea.'' _ By JIM RUTENBERG

LAKERS HAVE A RING AND A LOT OF UPSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal stepped up to the dais Monday
night just as Jerry Buss, the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers,
finished telling the tale of how the supernova center, the new age
coaching sage and the young, bright shooting guard came together to
lead the franchise to its first championship in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Buss smiled at the sight of the 7-foot-1, 330-pound behemoth
pretending to clear his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extension,'' O'Neal said through a mock cough. ``Extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss finally gave in. ``Whatever you want, baby,'' he told
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   What do you give the center who has everything? Or maybe a
better question: at what price a dynasty?
</P>
<P>
   After the cigar smoke had finished wafting through the Staples
Center _ and the Indiana Pacers had been dispensed in six mostly
pulsating games _ the Lakers toasted one another with Champagne,
waited for the rowdy streets outside the building to clear, and
then went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is scheduled for Wednesday, at which point O'Neal
will reiterate what he said after the clinching 116-111 Game 6
victory over the Pacers on Monday night in the National Basketball
Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get one next year, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson. Some triangle, no? The
triumph of the Lakers' trinity makes you wonder about the
possibilities, whether the NBA has another dynasty on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan won six titles in the 1990s with the same coach
who guided Kobe and Shaq to their first this season. The way Bryant
broke down defenses and O'Neal unleashed indefensible weapons the
past few months brought back shades of Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, that Hall of Fame guard-center combination that led
the Lakers to five championships in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal averaged 38 points and 16.7 rebounds in the finals. He
became only the third player in league history to close out a
season with the scoring title, the most valuable player award and a
championship ring, and the third player to be named MVP of the
regular season, the All-Star Game and the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, O'Neal will only get better. Asked if the potential is
there for the Lakers to win multiple titles, Larry Bird, who won
three with the Boston Celtics and came close to another during his
three seasons as coach of the Pacers, replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is with Shaquille O'Neal. He's the most dominating
player in our league. He's powerful, strong, able to get the ball
in the hole. He's just so dominating that they have an opportunity
to do something great for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal is the most dominant player in the league, Bryant has
quickly become the most dangerous perimeter player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Named to the league's all-defensive team, he elevated his
stature in overtime of Game 4 by scoring 8 points after O'Neal
fouled out in the 120-118 victory at Conseco Fieldhouse. Bryant is
only 21.
</P>
<P>
   They both joined the Lakers in the summer of 1996, Bryant in a
draft-day trade with Charlotte and O'Neal, who had played with
Orlando, through free agency. They have never been the best of
friends, coexisting despite a feud that has turned ugly at times.
But on the court, they are undeniably the best inside-outside
combination in pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal can extend his seven-year, $120 million contract this
summer _ a given, Buss said. Bryant appears to be a Laker for life.
If neither petty jealousy nor growing tired of seeing each other
every day gets in the way, few things can undermine their
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have definitely made their mark as one of the best
combinations ever to play this game,'' the Lakers reserve guard
Derek Fisher said Monday night. ''They carried us, and the rest of
us stepped it up when we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling short for four seasons, they crossed the precipice in
Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against Portland, rallying
from 15 points down in the final 10 minutes to shock, and
eliminate, the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   By barely escaping losing a three-games-to-one lead in the
conference finals and by staving off Indiana, the Lakers avoided
the indignity of becoming only the second 67-victory team not to
win a title.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several signs revealing their vulnerability, signs
that should give 28 other teams a glimmer of hope _ including those
free-spending Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a Game 3 debacle against Sacramento in the first
round, the Lakers went 4-6 in elimination games. The game before
they claimed their first title of the post-Magic era, the Lakers
suffered their worst loss of the season, a 33-point rout in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   They did not wield the hammer until Monday night, needing the
final minutes to wear down the game-but-defensively challenged
Pacers. Through it all, Jackson looked on like a ski instructor who
expected his students to fall off the chair lift now and then.
</P>
<P>
   He molded the egos and talent together flawlessly, siphoning
every ounce of energy from O'Neal to make sure the often-injured
center kept himself in prime physical condition. He did not have
qualms about singling Bryant out in front of his teammates, telling
him often and bluntly, ``Trust the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally raised the Larry O'Brien trophy and the purple
and gold confetti rained down from the rafters, it was plain to
see: All three sides of the triangle fit perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference has been Phil Jackson,'' said Bill Walton, the
NBC analyst and Hall of Fame center. ``What he did in terms of
challenging Shaq and Kobe to refocus their priorities, to become
defensive players, to become rebounders, to become passers, to get
in good shape, to become so focused in on the team, well, that has
made them champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing that's going to keep these guys from staying at
the top _ unless they stop listening to the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   There are but a few questions. Glen Rice? He is not expected
back. Ron Harper may retire. A.C. Green won't start at power
forward much longer. But then, as long as Jerry West is in charge
of personnel, there are no worries.
</P>
<P>
   Only two-fifths of the starting lineup is guaranteed to return.
Those players just happen to be the only two the Lakers cannot
lose. Supporting casts don't collect banners as much as stars do.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq and Kobe have one _ and counting.

GORE IS PURSUING HIS CASE FOR RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Vice President Al Gore set his case Tuesday for
government-subsidized savings accounts, saying his plan would help
families build wealth for retirement and other uses without putting
their guaranteed Social Security benefits at risk in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to contrast his approach to Gov. George W. Bush's
proposal to create personal investment accounts within the Social
Security system, Gore said his plan would encourage lower- and
middle-income people to save by adding a program to supplement
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech, the tone of which could have been heard either as
robust populism or class warfare, Gore said his plan was intended
not just for people ``who think comfortably about their savings
over Scotch in the club looking out at the golf links, but also the
ones who carefully try to make it all add up to the dream over a
pressured half-hour break on the factory floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance before a group of Democrats here was the latest
in his effort to focus the presidential race on the strong economy
and how best to apportion the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, it gave Gore an opportunity to present a
positive alternative to Bush's proposal to allow workers to invest
a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock
market. And in economic terms it addressed one of the nation's
biggest weaknesses, the low rate of personal savings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore changed plans immediately after the speech, postponing
until Wednesday a trip to Des Moines and instead flying to
Washington in case his vote was needed in the Senate to break a tie
over hate crimes legislation backed by the Clinton administration.
In the end, Gore's vote was not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's savings plan is built around providing matching funds,
through tax credits, for people who put money away in a type of
savings account that would be modeled after an Individual
Retirement Account. The plan, which would become effective
gradually over 10 years, would give more substantial credits to
people at the low end of the income spectrum, and would phase out
for people at higher income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to the accounts would be tax deductible, and
investment earnings would build tax free. The money would be taxed
on withdrawal. While the accounts would be intended for retirement
savings, the money could also be used to pay for college tuition, a
first home or catastrophic medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said the plan would cost about $200 billion
over 10 years, making it one of the largest single initiatives
proposed by the vice president this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said Gore's proposal followed Bush's lead in
acknowledging the attractiveness of allowing workers to invest for
retirement, but was otherwise flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-income workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford
it, and it doesn't stop Social Security from going broke,'' said
Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued his attack on Bush's investment-based approach,
saying it could drive the budget back into deficit, undermine the
nation's prosperity and penalize ``the elderly people who happen to
be on the losing end of a roll of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the vice president's speech Tuesday sought to
portray his plan as a gateway to wealth, security and opportunity
for people who have historically had trouble putting aside any
substantial amounts of money in savings. He cast the issue in terms
of what happened to his childhood friends from two different
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones I went to school with in Washington, D.C., came
mostly from well-to-do families wth enough money to send them to
college and stake them to a good start,'' he said. ``And most of
them have done well in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones I spent my summers with in Carthage, Tenn., were at
least as smart, but their families weren't nearly as well off,'' he
said. ``And I saw the opportunity gap open, and widen, and there
were times when it broke my heart. They deserve more than they got.
And I'll be damned if I'm going to let that injustice continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing his proposal's appeal to lower- and middle-income
residents, Gore drew an implicit comparison to Bush's plan. Bush's
approach is built around a large tax cut whose benefits would go
largely to people who pay the most taxes, the wealthy, and his
Social Security plan, which seeks to appeal to what Republicans see
as a large new investor class that encompasses many middle-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan has its roots in a proposal first offered by
President Clinton two years ago. Under the Clinton plan, low- and
moderate-income savers would not only have received matching funds
from the government, but they would have received an upfront
payment to get their savings accounts going.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan, which would be voluntary, would not offer any
upfront payment, and it is unclear how much new savings the program
would stimulate, especially among low-income households.
</P>
<P>
   It would offer matching funds for deposits made into the
accounts, with amount of the match dependent on income. A couple
making as much as $30,000 a year, for example, could each receive a
$3 for $1 match of deposits up to $500 a year; for their $500, each
person would receive another $1,500 through a tax credit, giving
the account a total value at the end of the year of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   A couple making up to $60,000 would receive a $1 for $1 match of
their deposits up to $1,000 each. A couple earning as much as
$100,000 a year could contribute up to $1,500, and receive a match
of $1 for every $3 they deposit.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts would be administered by banks, brokerage firms and
other financial institutions, and would be limited to offering
mutual funds and other broad-based investments rather than
individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to announce on Wednesday his support for modest
reductions in the federal estate tax to help farmers and small
business owners.

LIVE ON MOSCOW TV: QUIZ A TYCOON ABOUT HIS ARREST
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The owner of Russia's largest independent media
conglomerate appeared on his NTV network today in a live call-in
show and charged that he was arrested and jailed last week at the
behest of President Vladimir V. Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that Putin knew,'' said the media owner, Vladimir
Gusinsky. ``Moreover, the decision was taken personally by Mr.
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was detained last week on charges of embezzling state
property and was thrown into a Moscow jail. Following complaints
from Russian tycoons, journalists and American officials that the
arrest was politically motivated, he was released after three days
and restricted to Moscow, pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has insisted he had no advance knowledge of the arrest, an
assertion few political experts seem to accept. And Tuesday night,
Gusinsky used his television program for two hours as a prime-time
forum on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Leading pundits and politicians, including those who support
Putin and the chief ideologist for the Communist Party, joined the
fray. Viewers called in with their questions, not all of them
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Some wanted to know how Gusinsky had made his fortune and
suggested that the media tycoon, a Jew who holds Israeli as well as
Russian citizenship, managed to get out of prison only because of
the clout of the Jewish lobby.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the nation's only independent television network
and several publications, Gusinsky has often been in the spotlight,
but never as starkly as he was Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A 47-year-old former theatrical director, he is one of a small
group of tycoons who have acquired enormous influence since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was held in preventative detention for several days
before he was charged, and sought to challenge the legality of his
arrest today in court. But a Moscow court threw out his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While his view of Putin's role is widely shared in the media,
the tycoon did not say how he had determined that the president was
behind his arrest. He also said he was convinced that Alexander
Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, did not have advance
knowledge of his detention.

IT'S HIGH, IT'S FAR, BUT THE BALL ISN'T LIVELIER
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Testing the baseballs being used this season, Major
League Baseball was unable to squeeze any more juice out of them
than they found in balls from the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That was the report issued Tuesday by Sandy Alderson, executive
vice president of baseball operations, following a meeting with the
people who tested the balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no difference between the balls this year and the
balls from 1999 and _ to the extent we could test balls from '98 _
'98 as well,'' Alderson said. ``We're satisfied that nothing has
taken place in the last two or three years to change the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   An increase in home runs and runs this season fueled speculation
that the ball was livelier. Some pitchers have said the cover of
the ball is slicker than in the past, making it more difficult to
throw certain pitches. Other observers have explained the increase
in the growing strength of the hitters, the shrinking talent of the
pitchers and the smaller sizes of the new parks.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, which manufactures major league baseballs in Haiti,
has long said the balls have not changed, neither in the materials
used nor in the manufacturing process. Baseball assigned its
testing to Jim Sherwood, a professor at the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell, and Larry Fallon, who has a laboratory in
Cambridge, Mass. Under baseball rules, the key to the acceptability
of the balls is whether they fall within a range of specifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within this range of specifications that are acceptable, we
can have balls at both ends of the spectrum and they will perform
differently,'' Alderson said. ``But based on what we've seen so
far, we don't see balls at either end of the spectrum. They are
tightly bunched at sort of the high end of coefficient of
restitution specifications, but they have been for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to take balls at the low end of the spectrum,'' he
added, ``you'd have a ball like the Cubans have, which is
essentially dead. We haven't had that for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said his study of the balls will continue. ``We want to
learn more about the process and see what continuity there has
been,'' he said. ``We want to see what the pattern has been over a
longer period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the problem presented by the testing of older
baseballs is that the aging process can affect them.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday night's games, home runs were up over last
season from 2.31 a game to 2.56 and runs were up from 10.29 a game
to 10.49 a game.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of high-scoring, lopsided games in the previous two
days prompted speculation that scoring was soaring out of control.
Research by Elias Sports Bureau, however, found a decline in the
number of games decided by 10 or more runs. Last season produced
exactly 100 such games. So far this season there have been 35 of
those games. That number projects to 84 for the entire season. &QL;

PUBLIC OPINION TRIAL OF GRAHAM 
TAKES ANOTHER TWIST 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SALATHEIA BRYANT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The public opinion trial of convicted killer Gary
Graham took another twist Tuesday as Harris County District
Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. released an affidavit from a bailiff
 &UR;  &LR; who reported hearing Graham say as he was condemned: ``Next time
I'm not going to leave any witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Graham's execution date, he received a death-row
visit from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is trying to persuade
officials to grant Graham a new trial in which new evidence would
be heard.
</P>
<P>
   An expected decision by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
on whether Graham will be killed Thursday will likely not come down
until that day.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Larry Pollinger, who is now
retired, spoke with prosecutors in Houston on Tuesday. He confirmed
the story and signed an affidavit. Assistant District Attorney Carl
Hobbs, who prosecuted the Graham case in 1981, signed another
affidavit Monday stating that Pollinger told him about the
statement minutes after a jury voted to sentence Graham to death
for capital murder
</P>
<P>
   ``At the conclusion of the trial, while preparing to return Mr.
Graham to the jail, he stated to me: `Next time I'm not going to
leave any witnesses,' '' Pollinger's affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he was inspired to release the affidavit, even
though it is inadmissible as evidence, in light of the tactics
being used by Graham supporters. Both supporters and those who
believe the execution is just have waged an escalating public
opinion war as Thursday's execution date draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who visited Graham in the morning at the Terrell Unit
in Livingston, and Bianca Jagger of Amnesty International USA came
to Houston to plead for a new trial for Graham. Noting other
witnesses who were available and questionable defense, Jackson said
Graham hadn't received a fair trial in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said if he cannot stop the execution he plans to witness
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirits are being buoyed by support around the world. He's
winning in that (public opinion) court,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only asking Texas for a fair trial for Mr. Graham. We
offer our prayers but we seek a fair trail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made a biblical reference to Gov. George W. Bush being
in the same position as Pontius Pilate, who was faced with freeing
either Jesus or a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pontius Pilate had the power to set an innocent man free. He
didn't have the courage. He went with the crowd,'' Jackson said.
``We're saying to Governor Bush, don't let this man die. In this
case silence is not golden, it is betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he released the dramatic affidavit from the bailiff
in response to such emotional appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just rhetoric, made after the verdict and not a basis
for discussion in appeal,'' said Holmes. ``But I have no objection
to using it now. I'd hate to see the emotion of the moment cause
something wrong to happen in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing this up now for obvious reasons,'' he said,
meaning to counteract the publicity generated by Graham's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn also mentioned the bailiff's
statement Monday on ABC's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for Graham questioned Holmes' decision to make it
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``No where in the litigation of this case has the district
attorney or attorney general's office ever alleged it,'' Richard
Burr, Graham's lead counsel, said. ``It's never been relied on in
opposing our pleadings in this case. You can't believe everything
that is said.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jack Zimmermann added: ``There has been repeated briefs
filed in this case and that has never been mentioned. There's no
proof that was ever said.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was convicted of the May 1981 robbery- murder of Bobby
Grant Lambert in a Houston supermarket parking lot. Bernadine
Skillern, who was sitting in her car at the time of the shooting,
was the only witness to positively identify Graham during his
trial. She still maintains her certitude.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Graham's new lawyers have petitioned state and
federal court to hear what they consider exculpatory evidence. Each
court, most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court, has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is guilty and it has been confirmed over and over again by
every court,'' said Roe Wilson, an appellate specialist in Holmes'
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to rule
Thursday _ hours before his execution time _ on a Graham petition
for a reprieve so that a hearing can be held, a conditional pardon
granted or his death-sentence commuted.
</P>
<P>
   Graham supporters have rallied around the question of mistaken
identity and incompetent legal representation in their call for a
new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Burr said Tuesday they are considering filing another appeal
with the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, we'll have no chance at all,'' Burr admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Burr and Zimmermann touted affidavits from three jurors in the
Graham case, who say if they had heard witnesses Sherian Etuk and
Ronald Hubbard testify at trial, they would not have voted to
convict. The affidavits were sent to board members.
</P>
<P>
   Although both witnesses were named in the original 1981 police
report, they were not called as witnesses by Graham's trial lawyer,
Ron Mock, to challenge Skillern's testimony. Neither witness saw
the actual shooting. Both say however, they saw a man wearing a
white jacket and dark pants (the same description Skillern gave
police) before the shooting and he was four to seven inches shorter
than Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Burr said the witnesses were not mentioned in Graham's appeal
filed in 1987. No defense lawyer tracked them down until after he
became involved with the case in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornyn says judges have deemed neither witness credible. &QL;

PLAYING HOOKY, WORKING HOOKY
</HEADLINE>
  By LISA BELKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm thinking of turning off my computer, silencing my cell phone
and going to the movies. I have no idea what film I'll see, but
that isn't the point. What matters is that the theater will be dark
and cool and virtually empty _ because it will be the middle of the
day, when I should really be at work.
</P>
<P>
   I never once played hooky as a child. I'm somewhat embarrassed
to admit that I never even thought of it. Maybe I am compensating
for that as an adult (or maybe this comes up on days when I don't
necessarily want to be an adult), but I get the periodic urge to
sneak out once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   I don't do it often. Maybe once or twice a year, if that _
usually when the weather turns warm. And I am very specific about
what I define as ``hooky.'' It does not include time off to visit
the accountant or take the car to the insurance adjuster or even to
attend the kindergarten year-end picnic. To count, it has to be a
minirebellion, a few delicious hours at a place where I know I
really am not supposed to be. The movies are a particular favorite.
When I emerge after the final credits, blinking in the afternoon
glare, I usually go home and concentrate more completely than I
could have done before.
</P>
<P>
   The restorative power of forbidden fruit has not been lost on
enlightened employers. Some companies go further still.
Morningstar, the financial services company in Chicago, gives
workers unlimited time off, no questions asked. (So far,
Morningstar says, no one has abused this privilege.) Strategy
Associates, a Silicon Valley consulting firm, has an employee-run
``Culture Club'' that schedules monthly hooky sessions for
activities like bowling, ice skating, ultimate Frisbee and, yes, an
afternoon at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Posner, the president and chief executive of COMM2 Inc., a
seven-person advertising agency in Chicago, never takes time off.
``The sun and the moon will not rise and set if I stop working,''
she says. Yet, she insists that her employees play occasional
hooky. Every so often she hands out coupons that can be traded for
rewards as free-form as a day off or as specific as an afternoon at
a ballgame. The most cherished coupon, she says, is the one that
reads, ``Today it is too cold to go to work and I can't face
getting out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about the only thing her staff may not do, she says, is lie
about why they are not at work. ``I warn them: `If you lie, you're
gonna get caught and I'm never going to trust you,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Fass, who runs a five-person public-relations firm in
Manhattan, agrees. ``I would be unhappy, and would even feel I was
an unsuccessful, insensitive boss, if people sneaked out,'' she
says. ``I would resent that a good deal. It's a terrific perk to
let them take a `mental health day.' Sneaking out _ I think you
have trouble on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Fass and Posner say they are trying to pre-empt employees like
Kerry Spreckman, who became so good at lying that she wrote and
published herself ``The Hooky Book,'' which lists 200 excuses to
tell a gullible boss. Among her favorites are ``My garage door
won't go up, so I can't get my car out,'' ``My key broke off in the
front door, and I have to wait for the locksmith'' and, she says,
``anything disgusting and medical because your boss just doesn't
want to hear about it.'' When all else fails, she suggests watching
the Weather Channel for natural disasters and then calling (from
home) and saying: ``I'm in Kansas; I came for the weekend to see my
cousin, and I'm sure you've heard about that tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   The grown-up part of me certainly understands why a boss values
trust, but the not- quite-grown-up part, the part that wants to
play hooky in the first place, thinks lying is such a harsh word.
Half the point of this, maybe even more than half, is that you
aren't supposed to be doing it. Having the boss' permission takes
that frisson of naughtiness away.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth McRae Smith understands all that. She is head of the
McRae Agency, which specializes in publicity for Internet
start-ups, and she has made it policy to play hooky with her office
staffs in San Diego and San Francisco. On a whim, she will close
business for the afternoon and take everyone antique shopping or
clothes shopping or on a drive along the coast for margaritas.
``It's probably a little less exciting because it's not
forbidden,'' she says, but to offset that she often ``contributes''
$100 or so to her employees' purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the boss is buying,'' she says, ``no one seems to mind that
the boss knows.''

   BUSH TOPS $90 MILLION MARK
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign continues to shatter
fund-raising records, topping the $90 million mark when receipts
for May are included. But most of the money has already been spent
and the Texas governor continues to beat the bushes for more.
Campaign officials announced Tuesday that Bush raised $6 million in
May and spent $4.9 million, leaving him with $7.1 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore reported that he had raised only $587,802
in May, and had spent $1.3 million. He was left with $8.2 million,
out of $37 million raised over all during the campaign. Gore
expects to qualify for $15 million in federal matching funds,
bringing his total pre-convention fund to the $40.5 million
spending cap placed on candidates who accept federal money. Bush,
who is not accepting federal money, expects to spend nearly twice
as much before the Republican National Convention, which starts on
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR ZEROS IN ON BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has issued a warning to Gov. George W. Bush: ``The
Texas Truth Squad is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth squad, composed of workers from Texas, will appear at
labor-sponsored meetings around the country and will try to sully
Bush's reputation by talking about problems in Texas that include
education, health care and the treatment of farm workers. The union
leaflet says the truth squad will note that Texas ranks the lowest
among all states in the percentage of people who have health
insurance and near the bottom in College Board scores.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, will be the master of
ceremonies at the first truth squad event, to be held in
Philadelphia on June 29. Union officials say similar events will be
held in Albuquerque, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Los Angeles,
Louisville, Ky., and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has endorsed Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   PHYSICIST CHALLENGES BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the quantum physicist who founded the Natural Law
Party, on Tuesday challenged Pat Buchanan for the Reform Party's
presidential nomination and the right to spend the party's $12.6
million in federal campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running as the nominee of the Natural Law Party,
whose platform emphasizes ``harnessing the managing intelligence of
nature'' Hagelin said he had qualified to have his name placed on
the mail ballot that Reform Party members will use to pick a
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that he would get more mail votes than Buchanan,
widely regarded as the favorite in the contest. If that happens, he
said, Buchanan's only hope to become the nominee would be to pull
off a coup at the party's national convention in Long Beach,
Calif., this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Buchanan left the Republican Party last year he has
been taking over the Reform Party, winning the biggest share of
convention delegates chosen at state party meetings. Party rules
say a two-thirds majority at the national convention can overturn
the result of mail-in balloting.
</P>
<P>
   AD CAMPAIGN AIMS AT MINORITIES
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials announced Tuesday the start of a
radio and television advertising campaign intended to appeal
specifically to African-American and Hispanic voters. Vice
President Al Gore's health care proposals, including a patients'
bill of rights plan, are the focus of advertisements intended for
African-Americans. The commercials for Hispanic voters, which are
in Spanish, touch on education and preserving Social Security. The
African-American advertisements will be broadcast in 17 states,
while the advertisements for Hispanics will shown only in Florida,
Illinois, New Mexico and Wisconsin.

NEGOTIATIONS STALL AS THE UMPIRES' NEW UNION FACES FAMILIAR
OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major league umpires have a new union, but their new
leaders have discovered, much to their dismay, that they are
involved in the same old negotiations. After months of silence and
hope for a quick labor agreement, John Hirschbeck, the president of
the new union, said Tuesday that he was ``very disappointed in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   So disappointed, discouraged and disenchanted, Hirschbeck said,
that umpires had discussed among themselves the possibility of a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   He did not discuss the possibility of taking a strike vote, but
he said: ``We started this new union with the hope of creating a
less confrontational relationship with management than had been in
the past with Richie Phillips and the old union. We weren't looking
for controversy. We were trying to show good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added: ``Their feeling of us is almost to take
advantage of a new union. Rather than work with us, it's like they
want to take advantage of us. Our cooperation shouldn't be taken
for weakness or lack of resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck talked by telephone from Boston, where he worked the
Red Sox-Yankees series. The interview was his first on the
negotiations since they began, and the disappointment he spoke of
was clear in his voice. Phillips, who has maintained a low profile
since his ouster, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under an interim agreement, neither side can take any action
against the other until July 15, and then only after it has given
two weeks' notice, which cannot be done before July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's executive vice president
for baseball operations, said the commissioner's office would be
prepared to deal with any action the umpires might take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get this thing negotiated,'' he said, ``but it has
to be done on reasonable terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said a lockout of the umpires ``is not something we've
contemplated or would contemplate any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In talks conducted out of the glare of public scrutiny, the two
sides had reached agreement in principle on other elements of the
contract, but then negotiations stalled over four issues, and they
have not met for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck identified the thorny issues as control and
discipline, free speech, salaries and jobs for the 22 umpires whose
resignations were accepted last year following Phillips' failed
mass resignation strategy. That strategy prompted Hirschbeck, Joe
Brinkman and other umpires, mostly from the American League, to
form a new union.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents won approval of a majority of the umpires in a
vote conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, but now, as
leaders, they have found a new collective bargaining agreement no
easier to attain than Phillips ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped it could have been done a long time ago,''
Hirschbeck said. ``The big changes they're trying to implement are
things we could never be satisfied with or tolerate in a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck also said that Ralph Nelson, the executive in the
commissioner's office who is in charge of the umpires, has become a
focal point of distrust among the umpires. He said the relationship
with Nelson has become ``very strained,'' saying, ``Many umpires
have told me one thing was said to them and another was done; they
are not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hirschbeck said, umpires have been fined for
reasons they previously did not face. He said six umpires have been
fined this season and believed that only one fine was ``somewhat
justified.'' Some of the fines, he said, were levied after umpires
allegedly did not run into the outfield to get closer to a fly
ball.
</P>
<P>
   He said one umpire was fined $250 on that basis, another $500.
``He had no idea that anything about his on-field performance was
wrong in what he was doing,'' Hirschbeck said of the latter umpire.
``It was about fly balls and coverage. All of a sudden he receives
a $500 fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson defended Nelson. He said Nelson did not do anything he
did not know about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy changing a management style when management to a
large extent has abdicated its role over a period of time,''
Alderson said. ``We've never hidden our intentions here. We
intended to exercise more control over the umpires. We are doing
that and we expect to do it going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said the control issues, such as the fines, provided
an example of why umpires want somebody like an arbitrator to hear
appeals of disciplinary action against them. Management has held
firm against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want total control over the umpires where they can walk
up to an umpire and say you're done,'' Hirschbeck said. ``I'm not
saying an umpire has to be like a Supreme Court judge and stay for
life, but it's only fair to have some type of system in place where
if an umpire does something wrong or needs to improve, he can go to
someone who is impartial.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have discussed the possibility of having five-man
umpiring crews, giving each umpire one week's vacation every fifth
week. That plan could lead to the rehiring of some of the 22
umpires who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said the two sides seemed to be moving toward a
resolution on the 22, but ``where we had gotten seemed to dissolve
at the last meeting.''  &QL;

LOTS TO PRAISE ABOUT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is no doubt that the 1999-2000 Los Angeles
Lakers will earn a special niche in the franchise's glorious
history.
</P>
<P>
   They will be remembered as the team on which Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant won their first title.
</P>
<P>
   They will be remembered as the team on which Phil Jackson won
his first title as a coach without Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   They will be remembered as a team that had two lengthy winning
streaks _ 19 and 16 games _ and finished with 67 regular-season
victories.
</P>
<P>
   They will be remembered as a team of two extraordinary
performers (O'Neal and Bryant), one faded luminary (Glen Rice) and
a roster of role players who refused to fold in the most dire of
circumstances on the way to ending a Los Angeles professional title
drought at 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   And they will be remembered as the first title team whose roster
was, to a man, totally molded, crafted and designed by Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, West has been working his personnel magic with the
Lakers since 1982, when he went from being a consultant with the
team to its general manager and decided to use the first pick of
the NBA draft on James Worthy instead of Dominque Wilkins or Terry
Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   This was to be West's first major move with the Lakers and it
turned out to be a correct one, which would become a recurring
development in subsequent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was West who was responsible for surrounding Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson with all the proper components
throughout the Showtime dynasty of the 1980s, bringing in people
like Robert McAdoo, Mychal Thompson and Mitch Kupchak and drafting
people such as Byron Scott, A.C. Green and Mike McGee.
</P>
<P>
   West had nothing to do with the acquisition of Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar in 1975 and was only peripherally involved in the
drafting of Magic Johnson in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But this Lakers team has West's handprints all over it, from his
recommendation to Jerry Buss to spend the millions that it would
take to hire Phil Jackson in the offseason to those pivotal
acquisitions of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the summer of
1996 to his other maneuverings that brought in Robert Horry, Brian
Shaw, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, et al.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, West was known as Mr. Clutch for his propensity for
making game-winning shots. As the Lakers' executive vice president
for basketball operations, he has become known as Mr. Shrewd for
his deft personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But none were more vital than the ones he consummated four years
ago when he traded Vlade Divac to the Charlotte Hornets for a high
school senior named Kobe Bryant and then a short time later
convinced Shaquille O'Neal his life would be enhanced dramatically
if he came to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Without these two, the Lakers wouldn't be savoring their seventh
NBA title since arriving in Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Without these two, the Lakers probably would be struggling like
their great rivals of the 1980s, the Boston Celtics, have been for
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Without these two, Los Angeles wouldn't be celebrating a
stirring Lakers playoff run that saw them repulse Sacramento,
Phoenix and Portland before settling matters in the championship
round against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for the Lakers _ they were pushed to the
five-game limit against the Kings and needed to come back from a
15-point, fourth-quarter, Game 7 deficit to overcome the Trail
Blazers _ and they certainly are a level or two below some of their
storied predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the third best Laker team I've seen,'' said
the team's long-time broadcaster, Chick Hearn, who's been observing
Lakers proceedings for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn rates those Johnson-Abdul-Jabbar Showtime teams that won
five world titles as the best _ and so do I.
</P>
<P>
   They had not only a Hall of Fame center in Abdul-Jabbar but also
perhaps the most productive point guard in the league's history in
the 6-foot-9 Johnson to go along with the explosive Worthy and a
slew of other stout performers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971-72 Lakers also would have to rank ahead of the current
team because of its vast accomplishments that included a record 33
consecutive victories and a then-record 69 regular-season wins.
</P>
<P>
   That was a formidable team with Wilt Chamberlain, no longer
offensive minded and an intimidating defensive presence; Jerry West
and Gail Goodrich scoring bushels of points from the backcourt,
Happy Hairston gobbling up every rebound that eluded Chamberlain,
and a rookie, Jim McMillian, hitting every open jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   But, with perhaps the exception of the 1984-85 Lakers that were
obsessed with exacting retribution from a Celtics team that had
upset them the previous season in the NBA Finals, I don't recall
any Lakers team that possessed a greater resolve than this one.
</P>
<P>
   This Lakers team gallantly rose up each time it was faced with
daunting obstacles, which happened several times during a season in
which few observers thought Jackson's troops were strong enough to
seriously contend for an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers and Trail Blazers met on Feb. 29 at the Rose
Garden, they were tied at the top of the Pacific Division standings
and both were on 11-game winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team that wins this game will go on to win the division
title,'' Jackson predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers weren't expected to win because, well, this was the
kind of showdown game the team routinely lost in recent years under
Del Harris. But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson, the Lakers showed they no longer were going to
panic and fold meekly under duress, as they had during past playoff
series against the Utah Jazz and San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   They beat the Blazers 90-87 and went on to win seven more games
before they finally had their lengthy winning streak snapped on
March 16 by, of all teams, the lowly Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Their next severe crisis came in Game 5 of the best-of-five
opening playoff series against the Sacramento Kings. If the Lakers
lost, they would face widespread ridicule and a bleak summer.
</P>
<P>
   But they crushed the Kings, and wouldn't face a similar
challenge until Game 3 of the Portland series at the Rose Garden
after they had lost their home-court edge in the Western Conference
championships by getting upended in Game 2 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers displayed their valor, winning
consecutive games on the Trail Blazers' home floor to take a
commanding 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Trail Blazers, also a resilient team, refused to
quit and took the Lakers into a seventh game and even enjoyed that
15-point lead with just over 10 minutes remaining in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   No team in the history of the NBA had come back from such a
margin in such playoff circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary Lakers team. It would force the Trail
Blazers into missing 13 consecutive shots and would emerge with a
rousing 85-80 victory that Hearn called the greatest comeback in
Lakers history.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also faced adversity in the NBA Finals against the
Pacers, when their most dynamic performer, Bryant, went down with a
sprained ankle late in the first quarter of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Lakers once again reached into the deepest recesses
of their strong hearts to hold off the Pacers to take a 2-0 lead
they never would relinquish, even though it took a dramatic 120-118
overtime win in Game 4 at the Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it had to win, this team was always at its best,'' West
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was this compelling trait that resulted in the Lakers,
after an agonizing drought, once again being the brightest star in
the basketball world.

 &HT;    Branch Davidian plantiffs focus on child victims
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The plaintiffs in the Branch Davidians'
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government started early Tuesday
during the first day of testimony trying to put a face on their
case _ a young face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about truth and responsibility,'' said Houston
attorney Mike Caddell, in his opening. ``Truth about what happened
at Mount Carmel and responsibility for the many people who died
there, including 25 children.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell showed video images of 15 children who died seven years
ago in the events following the fire that destroyed Mount Carmel.
As each image flashed on the screen, Caddell hung photographs of
children like Hollywood Sylvia on a board in front of the
seven-person advisory jury in U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith
Jr.'s Waco courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia was the child of David Koresh and Lorraine Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood Sylvia never owned a gun,'' Caddell said. ``Never
fired a gun. Never broke the law. Never hurt anyone. Hollywood died
on April 19, 1993. She was two years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs attorney James Brannon, representing the legal
children of Koresh, laid the blame for the children's deaths at the
government's feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the government do to protect these children, even
against their own parents?'' asked Brannon, in his opening
statement. ``That's a key question to a child: 'Who is going to
protect me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Government co-counsel Michael Bradford, however, put the blame
for the deaths elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, they were the ones
responsible for this tragedy,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford called Koresh ``a self-proclaimed messiah'' who thought
he was ``ordained by God to predict when the world would end.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors should consider the act of FBI agent James McGee, who
exposed himself to possible gunfire to keep Ruth Ottman Riddle from
going back inside a burning Mount Carmel, Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have to decide if that is the conduct of people out
there to do harm,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs began with the first of four issues the jury will
consider: whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
randomly fired shots on Feb. 28, 1993 while trying to arrest Koresh
for owning automatic weapons. Four ATF agents and five Davidians
died in a shoot-out that led to a 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell called two witnesses to give a child's perspective on
the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Jaunessa Wendel was 8 years old and Natalie Nobrega was 10 years
old in 1993. Wendel's mother, Jaydean, died in the raid. Nobrega's
mother, Theresa, died on the day of the fire. Both Wendel and
Nobrega were released before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first memory was the windows shattering,'' Wendel, 16, told
Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they shatter in or out?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not definitely certain,'' Wendel said. ``But there was
glass in my brother's crib.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendel said her mother hustled her four children into the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed low,'' Wendel said. ``I was terrified. I didn't know
what was going on. I was shocked and extremely scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked the last time Wendel saw her mother, whom Wendel
testified did not carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my mom went back into our room,'' Wendel said. ``I
never saw her again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford asked Wendel why she told a Texas Ranger in 1993 that
her mother was armed. Wendel said that the answer was probably
``suggested'' to her by other people who had talked to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason I can think of,'' Wendel said.
</P>
<P>
   She later told Caddell that she had been frightened during the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what he wanted from me, and I was trying to give
him what he wanted,'' Wendel said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford asked Wendel if her mother knew anything about guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had gone through police training,'' Wendel said. ``I think
that's what you're referring to. She never got her badge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobrega, 18, testified that she had just finished eating
breakfast when the raid occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a ticking sound,'' Nobrega said. ``Pop, pop. Like
that. I was taking notice of it, and the window smashed. My mother
grabbed and covered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her room was shot up, Nobrega said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my quilt coverings were full of holes,'' she said. ``If I
had been sleeping, I would not be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobrega recalled Mount Carmel as a fun place to live. She said
driving go-carts was her favorite pastime. Outside the courtroom,
Caddell told reporters that Mount Carmel was ``like a summer camp''
for the children.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Hagen, government co-counsel, presented a starker view of
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Rita Riddle, the plaintiffs' first witness, Hagen
read off a string of names of children at Mount Carmel. One child
was Serenity Sea Jones, the daughter of Michele Jones, Koresh's
sister-in-law. Michele Jones gave birth to Serenity Sea while she
was 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle confirmed that each child on Hagen's list was fathered by
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell later presented a series of statements from ATF agents
to support his argument they fired their weapons indiscriminately
during their raid.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agent Mark Handley, for example, told the Texas Rangers he
fired at a window because he was afraid someone could chunk a
fragmentary grenade out of it and wipe out those huddled near the
front of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow ATF agent Thomas Crowley remembered another agent saying,
``Don't just randomly shoot, we might need the ammunition later.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides gave a peek in their opening statements as to how
they view such key issues as the alleged dismantling of Mount
Carmel and the FBI's decision not to bring in firefighting
equipment in case of a fire _ issues to be addressed later in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said an apparent application for medals to be given to
FBI tank drivers reveals why the tanks pierced Mount Carmel's
gymnasium. The application said the tank drivers were given the
mission of ``slowly and methodically beginning the dismantling of
the building at the back of the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Caddell said. ``The men driving tanks were
following orders. The men responsible for this were Jamar and
Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jamar was the lead FBI agent at Mount Carmel. Richard
Rogers headed the Hostage Rescue Team.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, however, argued that the plan to dismantle Mount
Carmel _ to go into effect if the Davidians didn't leave after 48
hours _ involved using a tank with a blade to cut through the
building's framing. The tanks, though, collapsed the gym while
trying to get to a cement-block room in order to disperse tear gas,
according to Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence they prematurely instigated the plan,''
Bradford said. ``Their (plaintiffs) whole purpose is to confuse
you. It has nothing to do with the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said there is no evidence the Davidians started two of
the three simultaneous fires that combined to destroy Mount Carmel.
In the upstairs room where TV viewers of the siege first saw smoke,
there were no burn patterns indicating an accelerant being poured,
Caddell said. However, he acknowledged the Davidians may have
started a fire in the gym, ``in the mistaken belief fire would
protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell blamed the tanks ripping into Mount Carmel for helping
spread the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever started a fire, you know the first thing you do
is make kindling,'' Caddell said. ``Then you have to provide
ventilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, however, said logic doesn't support Caddell's
contention the Davidians only set one fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have fires starting simultaneously,'' Bradford said.

BUSH PROPOSES $2.3 BILLION MORE FOR EDUCATION, COLLEGE AID FOR
TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ Visiting the cradle of the digital
revolution, Gov. George W. Bush warned Tuesday that school children
were not being adequately prepared for jobs in technology, and
proposed spending an additional $2.3 billion over five years to
improve math and science education in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we can do better,'' Bush told educators at De Anza
College, here in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The Texas
governor frequently cited tests of children in 21 countries,
including the United States, as yardsticks of just how much room
for improvement there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America,'' Bush said. ``There's no reason for us to be
next to last in math. There's no reason for us to be last in
physics. We're the greatest country in the world. We ought to be
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those exhortations to greatness, however, Bush talked
little about the proposals he was making, which were spelled out
instead in documents distributed by his aides. These plans were the
latest in a series of education initiatives that Bush has proposed
during the last three months, and they reflected his focus on
education as an issue with which he can appeal to moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called
for the federal government to spend an additional $1 billion over
five years on the establishment of a math and science partnership
fund to encourage universities and colleges to interact with public
schools in ways that enhanced math and science instruction for
children in kindergarten through the 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed an additional $1 billion over five years to
increase the amount available in federal Pell grants that are given
to low-income students to help pay for college education. Under the
governor's plan, young people who have taken college-level math or
science courses in high school can qualify for a grant that would
be worth an additional $1,000. The average Pell grant, Bush's aides
said, is worth about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush called for an additional $345 million over five
years to encourage college graduates who majored in science or math
to spend at least five years teaching in public schools in
under-served areas. Under current federal programs, graduates who
do this can have $5,000 of their student loans forgiven or paid by
the federal government. Bush would expand this amount to $17,500.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor was not merely articulating new policy Tuesday;
Bush was spending time in a state _ an electoral heavyweight _ that
has tilted heavily Democratic in the last few years, but one he
does not want to cede to Vice President Al Gore in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   California has 54 electoral votes, more than any other state,
and Bush's trip here this week, which began on Monday and is
scheduled to end on Wednesday, was his fourth swing through the
state since the primary here on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll conducted by the Field organization and made
public Tuesday showed Bush trailing Gore by 11 points, 46 percent
to 35 percent, though several previous polls have portrayed a
tighter race. Several times this week, Bush insisted that he could
compete successfully in California by appealing to Hispanic voters,
promoting his education plans and convincing people in the Silicon
Valley that his economic and trade policies would benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has described himself as a fiscal conservative, he
has proposed spending billions of dollars in federal money for
education since the campaign began. Gore has proposed spending even
more, and one of the educators with whom Bush met here Tuesday
seemed to suggest that Bush could be more generous.
</P>
<P>
   In a decidedly unscripted moment, Barbara Illowsky, a math
professor at De Anza College, told Bush that it would be terrific
if he ``were able to raise as much money for education'' as he had
for his presidential campaign and the Republican Party.

LAKERS COULD BECOME A DYNASTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Long after Kobe Bryant's free throws sealed the
victory, long after Shaquille O'Neal's joyful tears splashed off
the golden ball, long after the Staples Center celebration ended
late Monday night, the Los Angeles Lakers' championship party raged
on, right into Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It might not end for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although changes are inevitable in the coming months, the
Lakers' greatness is at their core, and it is an awesome
foundation: Shaq and Kobe. The 28-year-old center, the best at his
position, and the 21-year-old guard, perhaps the best at his.
</P>
<P>
   Together, under contract for the foreseeable future, and
improving along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Better chill another few cases of champagne and reserve another
round of stogies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what,'' said teammate Glen Rice, ``that's the best
duo that I've seen in a long time. And they're going to be together
forever. . . . I've been able to sit back and watch those guys do
their thing and it's an unbelievable duo.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Lakers' offices, no one was projecting a dynasty yet.
Instead, they were just enjoying the first step in the wake of the
championship-clinching victory over the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West, who found it too painful to watch
the Game 6 finale on Monday, wore a satisfied look Tuesday in his
El Segundo office.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the organization gambled to acquire Bryant in
trade and O'Neal with then the NBA's most lucrative contract, the
Lakers brought the championship home.
</P>
<P>
   West said he was happy for owner Jerry Buss, for the fans, who
``have been wonderful''; for first-year coach Phil Jackson, who
exceeded short-range expectations; but mostly for O'Neal, whose
greatness can no longer be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other person I feel great for is Shaquille O'Neal,'' West
said. ``He's a very proud man who is the best player in basketball.
And no one knew until this year. And I'm so happy for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our coaching staff feels great. To go from Chicago to
here. . . . and there was always a question of, `Can you win
without Michael Jordan?' Well, he did. So I'm delighted for him and
his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Buss, you have to feel good for him,'' West said. ``He's
let us do some things around here that maybe some other people
wouldn't have, wouldn't be a big enough risk-taker. . . . We took
the ultimate risk and we came up with two players in one year that
I think anyone in the league would like to have these two guys on
their team. And they'd probably sacrifice their whole team for
those two guys. So that makes us feel real good. Jerry deserves
credit for allowing us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the transactions that brought Bryant and O'Neal to
L.A. also took a tremendous toll on West, leading to annual
speculation that he will retire. The latest report surfaced Monday,
in the column of a cable talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   West dismissed the report but at times sounded ready to hang it
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's had me retiring for the last four years, I think
that's what people want me to do,'' West quipped. ``A lot of it is
how you feel about yourself. You have to determine that. . . . This
has been an important part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he still as driven in his work? ``I don't know that. I
don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean he's contemplating retirement? ``I don't know
that. You guys will be the first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   There might not be changes at the top. But there will certainly
be changes in the locker room. Among the free agents are starters
Rice, A.C. Green and Ron Harper. The team holds an option on Green
while Harper holds his own option. Key reserve Brian Shaw also is a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't ready to say who'll be back and who won't.
Even Rice, unhappy with his role at times, has said he would
return, and the Lakers for now say they want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I'm hopeful that everyone comes back,'' West
said. ``It's hard to break up teams. I have a wonderful
relationship with Glen Rice. We'll see what happens. He's a free
agent, he can go wherever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rice joining O'Neal and Bryant, the Lakers had a potent
offensive lineup, and with players such as Harper, Rick Fox and
Robert Horry, they also became one of the best defensive teams in
the league under Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most in the organization hoped for a 60-win season, nothing
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to win 55 or 60 games regardless of who coached
this team,'' West said, ``but that's not enough here. It's just not
enough. And (Jackson) molded these people into believers. He molded
them into a team instead of a collection of individuals. He brought
a confidence to this team that I hadn't seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   And pushed them to 67 regular-season wins, then a title. So much
for taking time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're overachievers here,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak
said. ``People aren't going to believe that if you write it, but I
don't think anybody had expectations of us winning a championship
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all believed we'd have a good year and we could win
a championship, but I don't think anybody expected it. And
certainly no one expected us to have the regular-season record we
had. . . . But it's still a young, immature team to a degree. A
team that I think grew each series Sacramento, Phoenix, Portland in
particular and then Indiana. So maybe there's some character and
some maturity that's been able to last six or seven weeks and will
help us next year.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a superstar tandem that is young and under
contract for a few years will help, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Kupchak said, ``is nice to know.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

 &QL; 
COACH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PHIL JACKSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: This is the year he became more than just
Michael Jordan's coach. Jackson brought the best out of Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, instilled a discipline and a system that
maximized the Lakers' role players and produced the second-best
regular-season record (67-15) in franchise history. He shot for 60
wins; he got his seventh championship in nine years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Under contract for four more years, to the delight of
both management and players. When's the last time you could say
that? He'll have new challenges next season with a retooled
roster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STARTERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: This is the season everyone awaited, the year
Shaq grew up and led his team to the championship. He improved his
defense and rebounding, dominated the regular season, won the
scoring title (career-high 29.7 points per game) and the MVP award,
then gave the greatest postseason performance by a center in more
than a decade, adding the Finals MVP award to his collection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Signed through 2002-03, eligible for extension
through 2005-06. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A.C. GREEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Provided some gutty defense and rebounding but
at age 36 played limited minutes even while extending his ironman
streak to an NBA-record 1,110 games. His veteran leadership and
symbolic tie to past Lakers championships were just as
significant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Team holds one-year option for next season, but as
always, they need an upgrade at the position, and he's a candidate
to retire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GLEN RICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: He struggled with his role as the third option
and never adapted well to the triangle offense, finishing with a
career-low shooting percentage (.430) and modest 15.9 points per
game. But the sacrifice got him his first NBA championship at age
33. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: A free agent, Rice says he wants to return but seems
likely to find a better fit, and more money, elsewhere. Lakers
could use him in a sign-and-trade deal to acquire help at forward
and/or guard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KOBE BRYANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: This is the year Bryant lived up to the hype
and became perhaps the best shooting guard in the league. He became
a much better team player and an All-Defensive first-team selection
while posting career highs in points (22.5), rebounds (6.3) and
assists (4.9). His clutch play in the championship run only
certified Bryant as a bona fide superstar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Signed through 2004-05. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RON HARPER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Lured, gimpy knees and all, out of
semiretirement by Phil Jackson to help teach Bryant the triangle
offense and help the Lakers adapt to the new system. His
championship experience with the Bulls and calming presence were
major assets, and when the playoffs came, he actually became a
scorer again as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Holds option for one-year contract and says he'll
return if Jackson wants him but at age 35 is considering
retirement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KEY RESERVES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ROBERT HORRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Began season as trade bait and in Jackson's
doghouse but became a player Jackson called the ``key to the
team,'' providing active defense, rebounding and 3-point shooting.
Played behind A.C. Green but got majority of minutes, proving once
again he could be effective as an undersized power forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Signed through 2003-04 and could return in same role
next season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RICK FOX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Not his best season statistically (6.5 points,
2.5 rebounds), but his gritty defense was irreplaceable, especially
during key stretches of the Finals, when he was sent in to stop
Indiana's Jalen Rose. Fox is a needed on-court enforcer, a tough
guy willing to do anything to win. Jackson often played Fox in the
fourth quarter of tight games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Signed through 2005, could become starter again if
Rice leaves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEREK FISHER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Started first month of season while Bryant was
injured, then returned to bench and struggled with his shot (.346
from field). Finished with career-high 6.3 points per game and
provided scrappy defense, used as primary defender on opponents'
shorter guards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: Signed through 2006 but could be used as trade bait
since Jackson prefers taller guards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRIAN SHAW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
__Season in review: Only became a Laker because Bryant broke his
hand in October but quickly became valuable reserve and a fan
favorite, igniting crowds with his lobs to Shaq, his former Orlando
teammate. Provided clutch 3-point shooting in Game 7 victory over
Portland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __Outlook: A free agent and 36 years old, he could come back for
one more run if he doesn't retire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OTHERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRAVIS KNIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Has body to play forward and center but didn't impress Jackson
enough to warrant many minutes. He has no clear role here but is
young (25) and under contract through 2003-04. Lakers will trade
him if they can. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JOHN SALLEY &QL;
</P>

Lakers' other backup center also didn't play much after coming out
of a three-year retirement. But he was a good on-court tutor for
Shaq and a light-hearted presence in the locker room. He's a free
agent and Lakers might need his roster slot for a younger big man. &QL;

   &QL; 
Rookie swingman impressed coaching staff but didn't get much
opportunity to play. Signed through 2001-02 (team option in 2003)
and could join rotation next season, although Jackson favors
veterans. &QL;

JOHN CELESTAND &QL;

   &QL; 
Rookie point guard spent most of season on injured list, is a free
agent and will probably will sign elsewhere. &QL;

<P>
   &QL; 
Second-year point guard had some nice moments in November before
injuring his knee. He's also shorter (6-0) than Jackson prefers but
is under contract through 2000-01 (team option in 2002).

 &HT;    Researchers exploring high-tech solution to rail crossing
collisions

<P>
   BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ As the brown Honda approached the unguarded
railroad crossing Tuesday, the radar detector hanging from its
windshield erupted with a constant stream of beeps.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what you think. Otto Rausch's detector hadn't picked up
a trooper trying to write him a ticket. It had detected the big red
and white Georgia Northeastern Railroad Co. locomotive sitting 164
feet down the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how it's beeping now?'' asked Rausch, a senior research
scientist at Georgia Tech. ``We're getting good signal strength.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch, Gene Greneker, another Georgia Tech researcher, and
Danny Diaz, a Georgia Tech senior, were working on the railroad on
this hot steamy day, testing a technology that could someday soon
be saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, only about 30 miles from this spot just north of
Blue Ridge, a CSX train piled into a school bus, ripping it into
two pieces. Three children died and two others were critically
injured. The Tennessee Highway Patrol, which was called to the
crash just across the state line, later said an onboard video
camera indicated the Murray County school bus driver never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had this receiver been sitting there (on the bus) beeping _
it's pretty raucous _ it would have been a wake-up call,'' said
Greneker.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists from the Georgia Tech Research Institute have
been working on the safety warning system since 1996, getting a
grant the next year from the Federal Highway Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put one of these on every school bus in the
country,'' said Greneker, who said the system had performed
flawlessly during two days of tests. ``Next year, we'll probably go
to a rural county and put a receiver on every school bus and a
transmitter on every train going through the county.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of such tests, the safety warning system could be
ready for use anywhere. Greneker said he's confident enough in the
system that it could be used already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this system holds a lot of promise,'' said Dick
Hillman, safety manager for the Georgia Northeastern Railroad, who
volunteered a stretch of the railroad's popular Blue Ridge Scenic
Railway for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Greneker said the transmitter aboard locomotives would be about
the size of a brick and is capable of transmitting a nine-digit
alphanumeric code as well as a voice message to specially designed
radar detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locomotive approaching crossing,'' the transmitted voice would
say, alerting the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Greneker said it is conceivable the system might be cheaper than
installing electric signals and gates on all unguarded rural grade
crossings. Those can run up to $100,000 per crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The safety warning system would cost much less _ about $600 for
each receiver on each locomotive, less than $100 per radar detector
receiver and about $25 for reflectors at each grade crossing. The
reflectors, a one-square-foot metal plate, are used to reflect the
line of sight signal from the locomotive up either side of the
highway, alerting equipped motorists approaching the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The reflectors, which would sit on a pole, could be painted with
a small railroad crossbucks symbol and hopefully protected from
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed something that would degrade gracefully on a country
crossing where people might shoot it up,'' said Greneker. A
reflector might even be able to take a shot or two and still send
the radar warning up and down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitters could even be installed on crossing gates and be
programmed to beam the signals when the gates are closing. But
Hillman noted that about half of all train-vehicle collisions occur
after motorists see crossing gates _ but ignore them _ driving
around the gate in an attempt to beat the train.
</P>
<P>
   The signal can transmit up to a mile away, but the reflectors
reduce the range to the point that motorists won't be distracted by
too-frequent alarms of possible hazards too far away, said
Greneker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to warn people,'' he said, ``but not too long before
they see what they're looking for.''

ADVERTISING: $1.9 BILLION SAATCHI DEAL VAULTS PUBLICIS TO TOP
TIER 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years after Maurice Saatchi left Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, there's
a new Maurice in charge, only this time the name is pronounced the
French way rather than the British.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, the London agency company founded by Saatchi
and his brother, Charles, agreed Tuesday to be acquired by a
Paris-based rival, Publicis SA, for about $1.9 billion in stock.
Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, who is
proving to be almost as acquisitive as the Saatchis have been, will
head a merged entity, the Publicis Groupe, which will oversee the
agencies now under the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and Publicis banners.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi will continue as an autonomous unit of the
Publicis Groupe rather than operate independently. That is
emblematic of the dwindling ranks of agencies not owned by giant
holding companies amid a whirlwind of deals like the pending
takeovers of Young &AMP; Rubicamby the WPP Group and Snyder
Communications by Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WPP deal is a confirmation consolidation is happening, and
we had to make some decisions,'' Levy said in a telephone interview
Tuesday after a news conference in Paris. Discussions began in
December, he added, and turned serious in March, before he
unsuccessfully offered Publicis as an alternate buyer for Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   Word began leaking out Monday as Levy made plans for his news
conference to disclose the deal, the most recent in a spate that
has included familiar names like Fallon, Frankel and Hal Riney &AMP;
Partners. The deal, which is expected to be completed by
mid-September, would catapult the combination of Publicis and
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi into the top tier of mega-firms.
</P>
<P>
   The Publicis Groupe will rank fifth in billings, at $17.8
billion, and revenue, at $2.2 billion, behind Havas, Interpublic
Group of Cos., Omnicom Group and WPP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a powerful new force in worldwide advertising, vaulting
to No. 5 overnight,'' said Bob Seelert, the chairman of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, who joined Levy for the telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing business in a consolidating world,'' said Seelert,
who will retain his title when Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi becomes a unit of
the Publicis Groupe. ``And this puts us up in the premier league.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was worried about Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi losing its
identity with its independence, Seelert replied: ``Quite the
contrary. Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi is a brand name to be cultivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Seelert, all of the top advertising executives at
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi have agreed to stay, he and Levy said, including
Kevin Roberts, its chief executive. Seelert will join the
supervisory board of the new Publicis Groupe and Roberts will join
the management board.
</P>
<P>
   By maintaining Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi as an autonomous agency
separate from those Publicis now owns, Levy and Seelert said, they
had assuaged the fears of clients concerned about potential
conflicts that could have scuttled the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin has talked to Procter &AMP; Gamble and Toyota,'' Levy said,
naming two principal clients of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi that compete
against Publicis clients like L'Oreal and Renault, which controls a
Toyota rival, Nissan Motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have spoken personally to the CEOs of L'Oreal and
Renault,'' Levy said, adding that they were ``very supportive and
very enthusiastic and have no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Less enthusiastic were investors in Paris, who pummeled Publicis
shares almost 12 percent, to 418 euros, or $401. Some advertising
industry analysts said they considered the deal overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would have preferred to pay a lower price, but I
will never overpay,'' Levy said. ``The price is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is approximately three times Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
revenue for 2000, which is in line with what Havas paid for Snyder
and what WPP is paying for Y&AMP; R,'' he added. ``And the deal will be
accretive to earnings in the first full year.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicis will pay the equivalent of 500 pence, or $7.56, for
each share of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a premium of 51 percent to the
closing price on Friday on the London Stock Exchange. After rising
27 percent on Monday as word of the deal circulated among investors
and the advertising industry, shares of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi fell 1.5
pence Tuesday, to 419.5 pence, or $6.30.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the American
depository receipts of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi fell $1.5625, to $31.50,
after increasing 30 percent on Monday in anticipation of the deal.
In the negotiations, Publicis was advised by Lazard LLC, and
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi was advised by UBS Warburg Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The fine print of the deal is almost as long as that found at
the bottom of an ad promoting a bargain lease on a Renault or
Toyota. Approvals must be obtained from shareholders of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi and Publicis at two special meetings in August and from a
British court to change corporate rules. Shareholders of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi are to own 30 percent of the Publicis Groupe, with
shareholders of Publicis getting the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Shares and American depository receipts of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
will cease trading in London and New York and will be replaced by
shares and A.D.R.'s of the Publicis Groupe traded in Paris and New
York. And there will be changes in the direct and indirect
ownership rights to Publicis, controlled by the family of Marcel
Bleustein-Blanchet, the mentor of Levy who founded the agency in
1926, with the creation of 3.4 million to 4.5 million shares of
what will be the Publicis Groupe.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist worthy of an episode of ``Bewitched,'' in which
Samantha's mother plays tricks on her son-in-law's advertising
agency, Levy's relationship with Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi will come in
addition to his relationship with M &AMP; C Saatchi, the London agency
founded by the Saatchi brothers after they stormed out of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi in 1994 in the wake of a bitter dispute with American
investors and the board there.
</P>
<P>
   When M &AMP; C Saatchi wrested the plum British Airways account from
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, Levy volunteered to handle the assignment in
countries outside of Europe and North America where the Saatchis'
shop had no offices. That alliance will continue between the
Publicis unit of the new Publicis Groupe and M &AMP; C Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him this morning to share the news,'' Levy said of
Maurice Saatchi, ``and he told me he is very happy to see the
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi name is in a safe home.'' There has been
speculation that Maurice Saatchi has toyed from time to time with
making a bid for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met Maurice Saatchi,'' said Seelert, who joined
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi after the brothers departed, ``but I think we've
got radically different people, a Maurice,'' which he pronounced
the French way, MORE-reese, ``as opposed to a Maurice,'' which he
pronounced the British way, MORR-iss.

JUDGE SENDS MICROSOFT CASE TO SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a victory for Microsoft, the federal judge who
ordered Microsoft split apart and subjected to stringent controls
Tuesday halted all sanctions against the company pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also handed a
win to the Justice Department, asking the Supreme Court to hear
Microsoft's antitrust appeal as the government had requested.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said immediate consideration by the Supreme Court is
warranted because two-year-old case's quick resolution ``is of
general public importance in the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, nine days from the end of its term, on
Tuesday afternoon had not decided whether to accept the case or
remand it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which
has eagerly agreed to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   While attorneys said Tuesday's actions increase the odds the
high court will hear the case _ an outcome Microsoft vigorously
opposes _ they also agreed the case has now entered unknown
territory.
</P>
<P>
   No case like this _ where one party is resisting Supreme Court
review, and ``the case'' up for review is actually a combination of
federal and state cases _ has ever arisen before under the
Expediting Act, the obscure law invoked by the government to
justify hastened Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   So no one knows, for example, whether the parties will get a
chance to urge the Supreme Court to take or reject the case,
whether those arguments will be written or oral, when they may take
place, or how many justices must vote to accept the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no established rules on what will happen next.
People are writing on a blank slate,'' said an attorney familiar
with the case who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Jackson's stay order Tuesday, which halts pending
appeal the judge's June 7 order in the trial, Microsoft legal
consultant Paul Rothstein said the company is ``cautiously
gleeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Slated to go into effect in about 11 weeks unless stayed, ``the
remedies were very onerous,'' Rothstein said. ``They would have
required Microsoft to start drawing up plans for its own
dissolution even while arguing against it.''
</P>
<P>
   They would also have required the disclosure of source code to
competitors and the alteration of contractual relationships with
computer makers and other partners.
</P>
<P>
   The dissolution itself is stayed pending appeal by the order's
own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big win for Microsoft,'' said Rich Gray, an
intellectual property attorney with Outside General Counsel Silicon
Valley of Menlo Park, Calif. ``Jackson stayed the final order
completely. There was always the chance that whatever court heard
the stay motion could have left some or all of the remedies in
place. You can never predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust expert Bill Kovacic said Tuesday's stay order ``wins
Microsoft a measure of business freedom I'm sure they're glad to
have, to implement whatever business plans they have in the
pipeline'' pending the stay's expiration.
</P>
<P>
   By its terms, the stay will end when all appeals have been
exhausted, which could be years away, or when it is vacated by an
appellate court. If Microsoft wins, the provisions will never take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft asked Jackson to stay his order on June 8, the day
after he issued it. But the government urged him not to do so, and
he complied with that urging until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson desperately wants this case in the Supreme Court, and
staying his order now is his way of putting his thumb on the
scale,'' Gray said. ``This removes an irritant to the Supreme Court
and increases the odds it will keep the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has pushed to have the case heard in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, which ruled for the software
maker in an earlier case. The government has steadfastly resisted
that venue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jackson's action will let the government argue
the high court's immediate review is essential so Microsoft doesn't
escape sanctions first during appellate court proceedings and then
again during Supreme Court review, Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government portrays itself standing on the sidelines
with empty pockets and no remedy after having won a two-year court
battle, it will make the Supreme Court think twice'' about refusing
the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's certification of the case to the Supreme Court, done
at the behest of the government, raises numerous questions about
how it should be conducted from this point on.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the two cases certified to the Supreme Court during
the Expediting Act's 26 years, no party opposed the certification,
Rule said. So it's not known how many of the Court's nine justices
must vote to hear a case arising under that law.
</P>
<P>
   The votes of four justices are required to obtain Supreme Court
jurisdiction under an alternative method called certiorari. A
majority vote is required to decide most cases, including those
that arrive ``as of right'' at the Supreme Court _ yet another type
of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But ``where the court is skipping a whole level of procedure, it
might require five justices'' to accept a case, suggested Microsoft
consultant Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   Though uncertainties abound, some attorneys said the court will
probably permit briefs by both sides, but not oral arguments. A
source close to Microsoft said the first brief will probably be
filed within 60 days and the response to that within 30 more days.
But, the source asked, ``Who will go first? Traditionally,
appellants lead, but here, the appellant is the one resisting
Supreme Court jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic speculated the court could ask for briefs by this fall _
or by as soon as June 30, when it leaves for its three-month summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be highly unconventional, but there have been a lot
of surprises in this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Tuesday, without attribution, that
unless the justices expedite their handling of the case _ an action
government lawyers may seek _ Microsoft will have until Aug. 14 to
file an appeal from Jackson's ruling. That appeal would ask the
justices to decline hearing the case. The government then would
have 30 days to respond and explain why they think the case should
be decided directly by the Supreme Court.

QUIET TOWN EXPECTS ITS SENATE NOMINEES TO RUN WITH DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMIT, N.J. _ The Rev. Charles Rush had his flock gathered
around the communion table recently when he noticed them: Bob
Franks, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, standing only a
few shoulder-widths away from Jon Corzine, the Democratic nominee,
both of them waiting patiently for the bread and wine to be passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just struck me how appropriate that this should happen in a
church,'' said Rush, the pastor of Christ Church here. ``We are all
different, but we are brought together in God's grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether by grace or by happenstance, the two contenders for the
seat being vacated by Sen. Frank Lautenberg are practically
neighbors here on the crest of the Watchung Mountains in central
New Jersey, and both are regarded as local boys. Corzine, the
multimillionaire bond trader and liberal Democrat, lives in the
rich North Side, while Franks, the journeyman moderate who founded
the Summit High School Young Republicans while he was in school,
grew up here and now has a home in a kind of suburb of a suburb at
Berkeley Heights, the next town over.
</P>
<P>
   Their proximity is both a source of local pride and a lesson in
the evolving politics of New Jersey, a state that grows more
suburban by the year and whose politics seem to be following the
people out of old urban traditions into something new.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was the two suburbanites, Corzine and Franks, who
beat the Camden political brawler and former governor, Jim Florio,
and the iron-jawed former Marine, William Gormley, whose campaign
was backed by Atlantic City casinos. And they did it, in part, by
maintaining the kind of amiability that is prized in places like
this, where you don't raise your voice too often.
</P>
<P>
   Summit is a hilltop city of about 20,000 with a high average
family income and level of education. (For every resident with only
a high school diploma, there are three with college or graduate
degrees.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a relatively new place, founded around the turn of the
century as a summer colony for sweltering New Yorkers, and it grew
into a year-round community after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For all their suburban diffidence and taste, the residents are
too pleased to be neighbors of both candidates to hide their pride.
The Christ Church Web site announces the two contenders' membership
in the church (and describes the congregation as
interdenominational), while neighborliness triumphed over party
loyalty when several local Republicans, including the mayor, Walter
Long, were in the audience when Corzine announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local Republicans went completely nuts when they saw I was
there,'' Long said. ``But he's my friend, and I wanted to hear what
he had to say.'' These days, the worst that a Democrat running for
town council says of the Republicans who run the town is that they
lack business sense.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are equally polite. ``I've lived here for 12 years,
and I call it the Disneyland of New Jersey,'' said Dr. Eric Munoz,
a physician and Republican member of the town council. ``It has a
lot of diversity, a lot of different characteristics, urban and
suburban, but it all works together very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The regard for dignified moderation that money and comfortable
living encourage is assumed to be shared by the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, we don't hear a lot about people we can look up
to,'' Rush said. ``We live in the age of the antihero, where
everybody is compromised. And yet here we have Jon and Bob, who
have real integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   As do others here, Rush believes that the boys of Summit are
going to teach the rest of the state some lessons in manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to take the high road in this campaign,'' he
said. ``They just aren't negative people. Bob's usual disposition
is to have this huge smile on his face, and Jon's natural
disposition is to reach out and hug someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Corzine played some hardball in his primary battle
with Florio, and political campaigners may not be as fond of
gentlemanly conduct as Rush is.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the harshest Franks has been with his opponent has
been to say that Corzine, who spent approximately $35 million of
his own money in the primary, will also be open-handed with the
taxpayers' money. Corzine is on vacation and has said little in
reply, which may account for Long's easy summer confidence that the
race will be a boon to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two men from Summit, N.J., step up to the plate and run
for the U.S. Senate, that can only be good for this town,'' Long
said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's decision to take on the role of politician after a
successful career on Wall Street has also been good for the
Democrats here. As anyone will tell you, Summit is a
business-oriented town, full of bankers and brokers who hop the New
Jersey Transit Midtown Direct to Manhattan on weekday mornings, so
it is a place that respects Corzine's business success. To have one
of its richest and most successful citizens turn out to be a New
Deal Democrat has done wonders for his party here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is blossoming with lots of new people and
new meetings, and it's all because of Jon,'' said Michel Bitritto,
a chemist in private industry. ``We've had meet-and-greets with
Jon, we've made telephone calls. My husband and my daughter and I
stood on the corner to get people to sign his ballot petitions.
He's had a wonderful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Bitritto will take a step no Democrat has done in
Summit since the mid-1980s: She will run for town council on the
Democratic line, with Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz is the chairman of the local Republican committee, and he
was politely noncommittal in his assessment of Bitritto's chances
of election. But he conceded that Corzine has helped revive
Democratic fortunes here, and pointed to the results of the June 6
party primary, in which Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas were on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the Republicans outvote the Democrats by 3 or 4 to
1,'' said Munoz, an assistant dean at the University for Medicine
and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. ``But in this primary, it
was Bush 1,255 votes, Gore 1,235. For a city like Summit, with far
more Republicans than Democrats, to have basically as many voters
going for Gore as for Bush really says a lot about Corzine's local
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in the hazy summer, with some schools already closed and
doctors and dentists closing early on Fridays, people like Rush and
Long may believe that the good feelings they have for each
candidate will continue into a quiet, uplifting, issues-oriented
race.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz is not so sure. He said that there is going to be too much
money flying around for tempers to stay calm for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a tradition of very polite politics here,'' Munoz
said, ``but when real contests start, we're not sure how polite we
are anymore. So I'll bet you a dollar that when push comes to shove
and November is getting closer, there are going to be some things
said that are not going to be so nice, not as nice as everything is
now.''

NEW FEDERAL SALMON PROTECTION RULES DRAW FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT McCLURE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal fisheries managers Tuesday issued a sweeping
yet simple set of rules for the Pacific Northwest that boil down to
this: Thou shalt not harm endangered salmon or the streams where
they live.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists immediately criticized the rules as vague and
unmanageable, and filed papers to initiate a lawsuit. Business
interests say the plan will drive up costs, and vowed to maintain
their legal barrage against salmon-recovery requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules simply prohibit killing or harming of some
populations of salmon and a similar fish, the steelhead. The rules
require no positive efforts to return the fish to their former
abundance.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed recent criticism from a scientific
panel appointed by Gov. Gary Locke of Washington's own
salmon-recovery strategy, a separate plan adopted by the 1999
Legislature in anticipation of Tuesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists called the state plan an ``unscientific ...
disjointed collection of partial measures.'' Yet a key part of that
strategy was singled out for praise Tuesday by the federal official
who announced the new salmon rules, Will Stelle, regional director
of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rules put into place another essential building block
for recovering salmon. ... They're needed by the fish,'' Stelle
said. ``It says to everybody: Change what you are doing to avoid
injuring or killing these fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules cover huge swaths of Idaho, Oregon, California and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Typical homeowners probably will not feel immediate impacts when
the rules go into effect in December. Builders, fishers, local
government officials, hatchery managers and others, however, will
have to figure out whether what they are doing is likely to
endanger fish protected under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they have to change their actions or seek special
dispensation from the Fisheries Service. The rules provide ``a
hugely powerful incentive to change the way we do development and
re-development to make it salmon-friendly,'' Stelle said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Fisheries Service's strategy is a hope that
local governments will come up with their own plans for saving
salmon. Towns, cities and counties are allowed to do nothing. But
that leaves developers, road maintenance crews and others who can
potentially mess up streams inside their boundaries liable to
prosecution under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Fisheries Service hopes, local governments will
seek exemptions to the rules. That way, local governments can
protect their citizens against Endangered Species Act lawsuits in
exchange for promising to do good things to help salmon, such as
re-creating wetlands that shelter young salmon on their journey to
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Fisheries Service is left to enforce the rules on
its own across a California-sized piece of ground _ a task the
agency has nowhere near enough workers to perform.
</P>
<P>
   To save the salmon, Stelle said, the Fisheries Service must
harness local governments' aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exemptions provide better, more comprehensive benefits
for the fish that make it more likely we'll reach recovery,'' he
said. ``The benefits of those local programs are much more
effective than episodic application of the `take' prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking'' is the legal definition for killing or harming
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Praise for the new rules came from King County Executive Ron
Sims, who is working with counterparts in Snohomish and Pierce
counties and a slew of other local interests to win an exemption
for this region .
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to meet their standards. It is not an option,''
Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``We worked really hard to kill as many fish as we
could, quite frankly and bluntly. We have not been good stewards,''
Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the new rules ensure a major change, said Michael
Rossotto of the the Washington Environmental Foundation, which
along with four other environmental and fishing groups took the
first formal step Tuesday to legally challenge the new rules in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotto said the rules lack ``rigorous and well-defined
criteria,'' leaving all future enforcement efforts subject to
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that (the Fisheries Service) is going to play
let's make a deal and cave in, and the fish are going to be the
losers,'' Rossotto said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the rules call for ``adequate'' buffers beside the
streams to help keep pollution out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is two feet adequate or is 200 feet adequate?'' Rossotto
asked. ``They are setting up a process where every municipal parks
department and every county road maintenance department is going to
go out and try to develop a plan that tries to meet this ... but
because there aren't any clear guidelines or criteria about what
`adequate' means, it's going to be very hard to evaluate whether
those are going to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, the Fisheries Service included a provision
telling farmers they can be exempted from enforcement if they
design irrigation intakes so they don't suck in young salmon and
kill them. Why not simply require farmers to install the
fish-friendly irrigation systems, Rossotto asked.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism also came from those fighting salmon protection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Brooks, a Bellevue-based attorney working for the
conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, said he may broaden an
existing lawsuit to also challenge the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on behalf of bait shops, hotels, landowners,
fishermen and others in southwest Oregon who lost income when the
Fisheries Service protected coastal coho salmon there. It
challenges the Fisheries Service's ability to list the fish as
``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Developers also attacked the new rules. Neil Gaffney, a
spokesman for the National Home Builders Association, predicted
they would restrict the supply of new homes, leading to higher
housing costs in an area already dealing with staggering home
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we've every seen anything like this in terms of
federal government intrusion into local government's land use
regulation,'' Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if more regulation in terms of land-use
activities is going to solve the problem. How effective is it going
to be? Is it truly going to solve the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the new rules, Stelle praised Washington's Forests
and Fish Report, a state plan approved by the Legislature, because
it demonstrates how state and local governments can take actions on
their own. The plan, a 50-year deal between state and the timber
industry, allows logging to continue with some restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have suggested a decade ago that I would have
been here today (praising Washington's timber rules), I would have
said you were dreaming,'' Stelle said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal came under sharp criticism last month by a group of
scientists appointed by Locke to critique the state's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (state plan) is comparable to making a visit to the
drugstore when you are ill and purchasing as much of everything in
stock as you can afford, taking it in as great a dose as you can
get, and hoping for the best,'' said the scientists' report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the state's strategy is not based on scientific
principles; lacks clear goals; is unlikely to revive dwindling
salmon populations; and ``leaves an impression that tinkering with
failures of the past will restore glories of the past.''

IN VAIL, PROPOSING A CHANGE OF VIEW IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The view from The Lodge at Lionshead is to die
for.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Creek babbles along noisily, just beyond soaring pine trees
that seem to reach halfway up the mountains in the distance. ``You
can even see the ski slopes,'' said Marilyn Dyer, owner of Unit 1
and president of the Lodge homeowners association, who splits the
year between here and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But not all is as peaceful and serene as it appears outside the
back windows of Dyer's stylish three-bedroom condominium. The
Lodge, which was built in 1978, is smack in the middle of a
proposed major development project that town officials argue is
critical for Vail's continued economic stability. To complete the
most ambitious of several options, town officials want to tear down
the four-level building and move its 12 residents to a nearby site,
where the town would construct a new building for them.
</P>
<P>
   For Vail and many other mountain resort towns in the West, these
are challenging times because of a booming national economy that
keeps them busy year round, with skiers in winter and hikers in
summer. To attract the growing number of families with vacation
money to burn, they are now engaged in a mighty competition, in
which amenities often mean the difference between winning and
losing billions in leisure dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the ``Vail Renaissance,'' an ambitious master plan from
town officials to re-energize the resort, part of which includes
building a second indoor skating rink, a cultural center, a
conference center, office and retail space _ all of it wrapped
around a small lake and open European-style plaza that would serve
as a community gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   And so a band of architects set out to fulfill the town's
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The most lavish option meant tearing down the Lodge at Lionshead
and moving its residents, at no cost to them, elsewhere, a proposal
that has not set well with them.
</P>
<P>
   The residents could force town planners to embrace a less
dramatic vision of the future, with fewer amenities and a more
modest-sized plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ludwig Kurtz and other officials involved with the
redevelopment plans say that whatever the homeowners decide is fine
and that the town will plan accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a small level of disappointment that we might
not be able to do as well as we could,'' Kurtz said, contemplating
the possibility that the homeowners would refuse to move. If so, he
promised, they would not be stigmatized as obstructionists.

WITNESSES AT TRIAL IN '75 MURDER TELL OF SUSPECT'S STATEMENT AT
SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Conn., Maine)  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ On the first day of public testimony about the
1975 killing of 15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich, two
witnesses told a judge here Tuesday that Michael C. Skakel, a
nephew of Ethel Kennedy, confessed to the killing in the late 1970s
while he was attending a school for troubled youths in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses were both former classmates of Skakel's at the
Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine. One of them, John D. Higgins,
described a confused and tearful admission in which Skakel said he
had only fragmented memories of the crime. The other witness,
Gregory Coleman, said Skakel brazenly told him: ``I am going to get
away with murder. I am a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, now 39, is charged with murder as a juvenile because he
was 15 at the time Moxley, his next-door neighbor, was found
bludgeoned to death under a pine tree in her family's yard.
Tuesday's testimony came on the first day of a ``reasonable cause''
hearing in which Judge Maureen Dennis will decide whether Skakel
should face a jury trial as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a crucial determination. If convicted in state
Superior Court as an adult, Skakel would face a sentence of 25
years to life in prison. If convicted as a juvenile, he could spend
little or no time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The stress of the day showed. As Skakel left the courtroom for
the lunch recess, he broke down in sobs, his eyes streaked red as a
bodyguard led him to his car waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
   The tears were surprising, considering that just before the
recess, Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, had skillfully set about
undermining the credibility of Higgins, the first witness to say he
had heard Skakel confess. Under cross-examination, Higgins admitted
that he had repeatedly lied to investigators and that his interest
in the Moxley case had been renewed only after he learned of a
large reward for information in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a trial, Tuesday's proceeding lacked the dramatic opening
statements from opposing lawyers eager to persuade a jury. Instead,
the prosecutor, Jonathan C. Benedict, simply called his first
witness, Sheila Maguire, a neighbor and friend of Moxley's who
discovered her body on Oct. 31, 1975. Then he introduced a
Greenwich map as the first exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was the sense of a momentous event. After a
quarter-century, the details of this sensational case, chronicled
in numerous best-selling books of varied credibility, were finally
being disclosed under oath in a court. Dorthy Moxley, Martha's
mother, sat in the front row of the packed, tiny courtroom. Dozens
of television crews lined the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict's second witness was Thomas G. Keegan, the former chief
of the Greenwich Police Department, who described how investigators
found three pieces of a golf club on the Moxley property that they
determined to be the murder weapon. The club, a 6-iron, was later
found to belong to a set owned by Rushton Skakel, the father of the
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, the former chief was quickly asked by
Sherman about criticism of his department for ``botching'' the
Moxley case. Keegan testified that golf clubs, according to reports
of witnesses, were routinely left in the Skakel yard, but he
immediately rejected the implication that someone had come along,
picked up a club and killed the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory was that some transient came through the yard and
bludgeoned the girl,'' he said. ``That doesn't hold water.'' The
former chief testified that the handle portion of the golf club,
which had the name Skakel on it, was never found. ``My conclusion
is that the person who killed Martha was aware that name was on the
club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherman seemed to win a final point. ``In the course of your
investigation, did you find any evidence that Michael Skakel killed
Martha Moxley?'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the former chief replied.
</P>
<P>
   And though the prosecution introduced into evidence the
eight-page autopsy report and called another former Greenwich
detective to the stand, the bulk of the day's testimony focused on
the two former classmates from the Elan School who told the judge
that they had heard the defendant confess.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said that he and Skakel had been working as ``night
owls,'' making sure other students did not run away, and were
sitting on the porch of a dormitory building when Skakel described
his role in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He related to me that he had been involved in the murder of
someone or thought that he had been,'' Higgins testified.

5 MEN INDICTED FOR CENTRAL PARK ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan grand jury Tuesday indicted five young
men on charges of rioting and sexually assaulting women in the June
11 melee in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day
Parade.
</P>
<P>
   None have posted bail, and remain in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   But a sixth man who was arrested last week, John Taylor, 24, was
not indicted, and the judge waived his $30,000 bail. Taylor was
released, pending further investigation by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The men appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court in wrinkled
T-shirts and baggy jeans, and all but one seemed largely subdued
after a week spent in the eye of a public storm. They had been
arrested after police offered rewards and released their
photographs, taken from amateur videotapes of the incident. So far,
53 women have reported being attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Vargas, 18, who the police have said was an instigator
and was identified by at least five of the victims as having
participated in the attacks, grinned as he entered the courtroom of
Judge Cynthia Kern and thrust his fist in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant district attorney, Maxine Rosenthal, announced
that the grand jury had indicted Vargas, Stephen Burt, 31, Emanuel
Nunez, 18, Roberto Camacho, 16, and Jensen Soto, 16. Soto did not
appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said another man arrested in the attack and still in
custody, Isaias Lozano, 20, of Queens, was not indicted Tuesday but
would remain in jail pending further investigation by the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, who runs a barber shop near Rockaway Beach in
Queens, was released.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has said he was involved in a water fight after the
parade but not in any of the attacks on women, told reporters that
one of the worst moments for him was when his picture was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about all the kids who saw it on TV and all the kids
in the community,'' he said. ``I want to clear my name, that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday morning, another suspect, Dellon Evans, 17, was
arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court. The police, who said Evans
corralled women into the hands of their attackers, charged him with
rioting and sexual abuse. Judge Carol Edmead admonished him for
``encouraging an outrageous act against women,'' and set bail at
$50,000. His case will now go before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Evans' lawyer, Mitchell Schuman,
denounced the amount of the bail, saying it was ``a human sacrifice
at the altar of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the police also announced two more arrests bringing
the total to 20. Prosecutors said they expected the others in
custody to be indicted within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had 22 other suspects _ based on witness
accounts and the videotapes _ who had not yet been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, Alexander Eraide, 23, of 123-48 135th Street
in Queens, surrendered at the 13th Precinct in Manhattan and was
charged with sexual abuse and rioting, police said, after he was
identified from a photograph. The police said that Eraide, along
with four men who have not yet been identified, touched a victim on
the buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old boy, whose name and address have been withheld
because he is a juvenile, surrendered with his lawyer and was
charged with sexual abuse and rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no picture or video of him,'' said detective George
Nagy, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the
police were searching for 22 other men.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the suspects generally did not know each other. ``It
is a very diverse group. They are from every borough, from other
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman, said the police
had obtained a new videotape of the assaults, were extracting
photographs from it and expected to release four more pictures
Wednesday, hoping the public will help to identify the men.  &QL;

DALLAS BURN PLAYER FINDS A NEW LIFE IN MLS 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 14-year-old Ukrainian boy sat in New York's Kennedy
International Airport, waiting for his new life to begin, his
dreams seemed like a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksey Korol sat alone in the bustling airport, the
incomprehensible buzz of English all around him, about to board a
plane to live with strangers in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   His head was filled with thoughts of the family he left
thousands of miles behind _ his father, who works odd jobs to help
make ends meet, and his mother who earns the equivalent of $250 a
month working as a secretary for a sports organization. Both suffer
from cancer and other effects that linger from the nuclear reactor
accident at Chernobyl, about 120 miles from Korol's hometown of
Belaya Tserkov in Ukraine. He couldn't escape those thoughts, of
his mother taking pills to keep leukemia in check, of his father's
treatments for stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His mind also wandered to his friends, with whom he once played
soccer, some of whom have abandoned their hopes of playing
professionally and now live on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Korol would board a plane in New York to live with virtual
strangers in a strange land, leaving behind the unrest of life in
the former Soviet Union for the chance of a brighter future in the
United States. For Korol, soccer was his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Korol's dream is reality. He graduated from
high school in the United States and attended Indiana University,
where he was a three-time All-Big Ten selection. Korol was the
fifth pick in the MLS Draft last year. The Burn wanted him enough
to trade popular forward Dante Washington to get him. Korol, also a
forward, has scored two goals and added two assists in his only two
starts with the Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly halfway through his first season in MLS, Korol fits right
into the friendly banter of the Burn's locker room. He chats
effortlessly with reporters, signs autographs with a smile and
looks every part a professional soccer player at 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Not many of his teammates are aware of what it took for him to
get there.
Life left behind As a rookie, Korol's professional career is
waiting to unfold, with goals to be scored, assists to be recorded,
playoffs to be reached. But in life, he is an established veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Korol can't remember his life without soccer. His father, Yuri,
played professionally before a knee injury cut short his career.
But Yuri had visions of his son following in his footsteps, said
Aleksey's mother, Tatiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aleksey was born ... to carry the torch for his father,''
Tatiana said through a translator. ``Before he was born, \RYuri\S
was very excited about that because then there was somebody to
continue his path.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri got his wish. His son began training at age 6 and later
attended the prestigious Dynamo Kiev soccer institution, which
prepares athletes for the Olympics and professional careers, when
he was 12. He lived at the institution, which was about 70 miles
from his hometown on the outskirts of Kiev. Belaya Tserkov means
``white church,'' for the only building left standing after a fire
swept through the town, destroying everything but the church.
</P>
<P>
   As was the norm for amateur athletes in the Soviet Union,
Korol's chances of a solid financial future rested on goals, not
grades, at Dynamo's institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just didn't concentrate on being a student,'' Korol said.
``You were a soccer player first. At times, you had to go to
training and miss two or three weeks of school. And then you'd go
back and talk to the teacher, and they would just take care of it
for you. As long as you were doing OK as a soccer player, that was
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Korol lived at the academy and traveled home about every other
weekend, playing with Dynamo in tournaments around the world. In
1991, Korol visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The trip itself _ Dynamo Kiev played several exhibition and
friendly matches in Rochester, N.Y. _ was nothing out of the
ordinary. It was the return home that marked an overhaul of Korol's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Korol and his teammates returned to find their native country in
upheaval. During their stay in America, the political foundation of
the Soviet Union had begun to crumble, leaving the country in
widespread chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back, everything had changed,'' Korol said.
``There was so much corruption, and violence and destruction. My
American family wanted me to come and stay with them and experience
this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family thought it would be the best thing for me to come
here and get an education, and experience a normal life. There, it
was only soccer. Here I have a chance to play soccer and have an
education.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Korol returned to Rochester, after an invitation from his
American host family, the Chiricos. Korol's stay with the Chiricos
during a tournament was short, only three weeks. But it was enough
time for him to taste a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RWe\S thought it would change for the better, but we realized
it would take a long time, and it would maybe take a whole
generation \Rfor things to change in the Ukraine\S, and the safest
thing was for me to take this opportunity and make a new life for
myself,'' Korol said.
Time to adjust The new life Korol envisioned didn't come right
away. He points to that long layover in Kennedy International as
one of the bleakest moments since his return to America in 1993.
The devastating homesickness lingered for several months, broken up
by occasional phone calls back home that flooded Korol with
reflection and, sometimes, regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I talked to my parents, I was thinking that I
wanted to go back,'' he said. ``But for some reason, I knew in the
long run that it was going to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Korol first had to adjust to the American lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, clothes shopping meant buying one or two new shirts
every two or three years. Food for meals came from the market and
from the Korols' land, which yielded plenty of potatoes, apples and
strawberries to freeze for the winter. He traveled to and from the
soccer institution alone, and rarely played in front of his family.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chiricos, Korol lived in a four-bedroom house with
three soccer-playing boys near his age. Back home Korol lived in a
two-bedroom apartment with six others, and a worn-down car was
shared between four adults. The Chiricos had four cars, meaning
there was always an available ride _ not on a train or a bus _ to
and from soccer practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiricos' day-to-day routine _ going to soccer practice,
picking up groceries, shopping _ was in stark contrast to the life
Korol knew back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grocery store was a big thing for him just because they
don't have the selection,'' Nancy Chirico said.
</P>
<P>
   High school was also a big adjustment. Korol was expected to
graduate with his classmates in four years at Livonia High School _
even though he didn't know how to form a sentence in English when
he arrived as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Individual lessons with an English teacher began to pay off.
Korol said he rediscovered himself through the language. Instead of
smiling and laughing in response to words he didn't understand, he
could reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I started learning English, my life changed,''
Korol said. ``I could communicate and be my own person. For the
first few months, nobody knew who I was. I was just a face and a
smile, but nobody knew who I was until I opened my mouth. And now
it's hard to shut it sometimes.''
Bridging gaps As Korol was forging bonds with the new people in his
life, the Chiricos and Korols were beginning to form a powerful
bond through him.
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering her son to a family she had never met, thousands of
miles away, to live indefinitely was the hardest decision, Tatiana
said, she has ever made. Her first trip to the United States in the
summer of 1995 helped allay some of her fears.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Tatiana was overwhelmed by the American middle-class
lifestyle, which is lavish by Ukrainian standards. She cried upon
seeing the rows and rows of food in the supermarket. She was also
overwhelmed with relief upon meeting the Chiricos and seeing how
her son was welcomed into their household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I came to the United States, all my worries
disappeared,'' said Tatiana, whose husband hasn't visited the
United States. ``Once I saw the attitude of Nancy and the boys, and
how they treated him, all my worries were gone. When I came back
over the second time, I was going with the feeling that I was
visiting relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy said she felt the same way. On Tatiana's second trip, in
1998, Nancy arranged for her to see a doctor on a volunteer visit,
to make sure the initial diagnosis of her leukemia by doctors in
Ukraine was correct. Since then, Tatiana has made another trip to
the United States for treatment _ something that wouldn't have
happened if not for her son. Tatiana and Nancy correspond on a
regular basis, conversing through one of Nancy's friends who is
from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling of family goes back to the first time Aleksey walked
through the Chiricos' door, Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the kids are concerned, there are four children in
this family,'' she said. ``Each of them will say they have three
brothers. When we made the decision to bring Aleksey here, we said
he can't come as a guest. He can't just stay. He has to be a part
of this family, and he has to be a son to us as much as we have to
be parents to him. I don't think anybody in this family has ever
regretted it, and I don't think Aleksey has either.''
</P>
<P>
   Korol has returned home to Ukraine twice. The most recent trip
was last summer, when he and his girlfriend, Erin Heimann, visited
for three weeks. Now that he's making his own money, Korol talks to
his family on the phone every several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Korol doesn't know when, or if, he'll apply for American
citizenship. For now, he's satisfied with a work visa through MLS,
where he has begun what appears to be a bright career. He has
scored two goals in his two starts with the Burn, who play tonight
at first-place Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   His responsibilities as a professional player take up plenty of
time, but Korol continues to reflect often about his family. He
dreams of saving enough money to bring his mother and father to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Korol still has soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams I had no idea he would ever be living in
the United States,'' Tatiana said. ``I wish him the most out of it.
I'm very eased that he is living the dream we can only dream
about.''

MRS. CLINTON CALLS FOR MEASURES TO GUARD PRIVACY OF PERSONAL
RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton asserted Tuesday that
businesses and medical institutions were threatening personal
privacy by routinely collecting financial and medical records, and
she urged Congress to give consumers control over how such
information is used.
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech on privacy to broadcast executives, Clinton, the
Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, scolded some New York City
television stations for broadcasting videotapes of groups of men
sexually assaulting women in Central Park nine days ago without
obscuring the women's faces. Some television stations, as well as
most newspapers that reproduced still photographs from the videos,
obscured the faces of the victims, as is customary in most sexual
crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could not be a more dramatic example of the importance
of privacy than those images,'' the first lady told the New York
State Broadcasters Association. ``I believe it was wrong to show
the faces of the women being assaulted without getting their
permission. You can report the news without adding to the trauma of
those already victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting First Amendment restrictions on regulating the
press, said she was not proposing legal measures to prevent the
media from showing the faces of victims in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   She did call on Congress, however, to enact legislation that
would give consumers and patients control over health care and
financial records, which she argued are becoming increasingly
available because of computer databases and transmission of
information through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals should have the right to choose whether and to
whom their personal financial and medical information is
disclosed,'' Clinton said. ``They should have the right to know
how, when and how much of that information is being used. And they
should have the right to see it for themselves to know if it is
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   With her remarks Tuesday, Clinton introduced in her race against
Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican from Long Island, an issue that has
gained increasing notice in campaigns across the nation this year.
Clinton's assistants asserted Tuesday that personal privacy had
long been a concern of the first lady, and Clinton said she would
make ``the protection of citizen privacy in the information age a
top priority'' if she were elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Clinton offered her support for a variety of
measures proposed in Congress, which has shown increasing interest
in this issue.
</P>
<P>
   On medical records, Clinton urged Congress to adopt legislation
that would require the consent of patients before records could be
released by employers, health care institutions or insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to restore trust in the health care system, all
Americans need to have confidence that their medical tests will be
used to heal them, not deny them privacy, jobs or health
coverage,'' Clinton said. ``What good are the best genetic tests
and treatments in the world if people are too scared to use them?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said businesses should be barred from distributing
or selling information about the credit history, payment schedule,
account balances and personal spending habits of consumers without
obtaining their specific permission in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In making her argument, Clinton made fleeting reference to her
own adjustment to public life. ``Now I know when you enter public
life you give up a lot of your privacy. Believe me, I know that all
too well,'' she said. ``But you shouldn't give up your privacy when
you visit your doctor, take a trip to the video store, or buy a
book on the Internet.''

RICHARD DUFALLO, 67, CONDUCTOR OF NEW MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Dufallo, a conductor best known for his energetic,
probing performances of contemporary music, died last Friday at his
home in Denton, Texas. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the pianist Pamela Mia Paul, said the cause was
stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dufallo had a broad repertory that included many standard works,
from Mozart and Mahler symphonies to Puccini operas. But his
uncanny ability to learn difficult scores quickly and thoroughly
and to convey their essence _ dramatic and emotional as well as
structural _ made him an important figure in the contemporary music
world. He gave the American, European or world premieres of dozens
of important works, among them scores by Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz
Stockhausen, Jacob Druckman, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Krzysztof
Penderecki, George Crumb and Aribert Reimann.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970's, when he directed contemporary music series at
both the Juilliard School and the Aspen Music Festival, he
exercised a powerful influence over the tastes of young performers
and, consequently, on the programming of new music in New York and
around the country. He also worked hard to gain acceptance for
American works in Europe, and gave the first European performances
of works by Ives, Ruggles, Druckman and Elliott Carter as well as
younger composers like Robert Beaser.
</P>
<P>
   Dufallo was born in Whiting, Ind., on Jan. 30, 1933, and studied
the clarinet at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago. He
later studied with the composer and conductor Lukas Foss at the
University of California, Los Angeles. Foss soon became an
important mentor and colleague: he invited Dufallo to become the
clarinetist in his Improvisation Chamber Ensemble. Dufallo was an
associate conductor at the Buffalo Philharmonic in the mid-1960's
during Foss' tenure as music director there.
</P>
<P>
   During his years in Buffalo, Dufallo joined the faculty of the
Center of Creative and Performing Arts at the State University of
New York. He also studied with the conductor William Steinberg at a
New York Philharmonic seminar for conductors. In 1965 Leonard
Bernstein appointed him to a two-year position as an assistant
conductor of the New York Philharmonic, which he conducted on an
Asian tour in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   After 1967, when both his New York and Buffalo posts came to an
end, Dufallo made guest conducting appearances with several major
American orchestras, among them the Philadelphia Orchestra, the
Chicago Symphony and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. In 1969 he
pursued further studies with Pierre Boulez and was also appointed
to succeed the composer Darius Milhaud as artistic director of the
Conference on Contemporary Music at the Aspen Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he made his European debut with the Orchestre
Telephonique Francais of Paris. Other European orchestras he
conducted include the Berlin Philharmonic, the London Symphony and
the National Orchestra of Spain, and he maintained particularly
strong ties with the orchestras of the Netherlands. He made his
debut with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1975, toured
with the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and the Dutch Radio Philharmonic
and made recordings with the Rotterdam Philharmonic. In 1980 he was
appointed music director of the Gelders Orchestra of Arnhem.
Dufallo's last project was a contribution to a 26-part series for
Dutch television called ``Of Beauty and Consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dufallo's recordings include works by Gershwin, Bernstein,
Copland, Stravinsky, Takemitsu, Luigi Nono and David Del Tredici.
He also published a book, ``Trackings: Composers Speak With Richard
Dufallo,'' which included his interviews with 26 composers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Basil, of
Seattle, and Cornelius, of New York; a daughter, Rene Kirby of Los
Angeles; and a sister, Kathryn Traczyk of East Chicago, Ind.

BLUE CROSS DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC, APPEALS COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is
a public benefit corporation and cannot engage in activities that
jeopardize that status, the Missouri Court of Appeals in Kansas
City ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After examining the purpose for which Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Kansas City was originally organized, we determined that
it has a public purpose,'' the court said in its opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the latest development in a years-long series of
court and legislative battles over the nature of Blue Cross plans
in a rapidly changing health insurance landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 lawsuit against Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon,
Blue Cross asked the Cole County Circuit Court in Jefferson City to
declare Blue Cross a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation that was
formed to serve the interests of its members, not the public at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, the largest health insurer in the Kansas City area,
filed its lawsuit after Missouri questioned the legality of a
failed attempt to merge with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas,
which is based in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, Cole County Circuit Judge Thomas Brown ruled
that Blue Cross was a public benefit corporation and must act
accordingly. In essence, the judge ruled that Blue Cross could not
do anything _ a merger or whatever _ that would prevent it from
fulfilling its mission to serve the public good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the court's decision,'' Blue Cross
spokeswoman Jean Peat said Tuesday. ``However, we have not yet had
the chance to review the decision in detail. We will want to
carefully assess our options as we move forward, and this issue is
only one of a number of factors Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Kansas City considers in its overall strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peat said it was ``important to note that this decision in no
way affects Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City's ability to
serve our current and future members.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said in a release that the appeals court ruling ``affirms
the law that prevents nonprofit assets that belong to the public
from being converted to for-profit uses not benefiting the general
public. The courts again have clearly stated that charitable
nonprofits must fulfill their obligation to use their assets to
benefit the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Farr Fitch, chairwoman of the St. Louis-based Missouri
Consumer Health Care Watch Coalition, said she was pleased with
Tuesday's ruling. ``These types of decisions benefit all
consumers,'' Fitch said.

FOUR FIRMS, 11 INDIVIDUALS INDICTED IN HEALTH-CARE FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Continuing its crackdown on fraud in Medicare
and Medicaid programs, the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas City
reported Tuesday that a federal grand jury in Springfield had
indicted four southern Missouri health-care companies and 11
individuals on kickback and false-claims charges.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals include Robert C. LaHue, 59, who was convicted
by a federal jury in April 1999 of soliciting and receiving
kickbacks in exchange for referring patients to Baptist Medical
Center and other hospitals. LaHue, an osteopathic physician who
owned the now-defunct Blue Valley Medical Group, was sentenced to
70 months in prison but is free while he appeals his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   LaHue declined to comment Tuesday, as did his attorney, Bruce
Houdek.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, which represents a formal accusation by the
government, comes amid a years-long government crusade against
health-care fraud. The General Accounting Office estimates that
dollars lost to such fraud amount to 3 percent to 10 percent of
total health care expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that estimate, between $6.2 billion and $20.8 billion
was lost to Medicare fraud in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quantifying how much money is lost to fraud is difficult
because of the very nature of fraud itself,'' said Alwyn Cassil, a
spokeswoman with the inspector general's office of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. ``You don't know about it
unless you detect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital and physician groups counter that honest mistakes,
resulting from the maze of Medicare and Medicaid regulations, are
often criminalized by prosecutors. Medicare is the federal health
program for the elderly and disabled; Medicaid is the federal-state
health program for the indigent.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-count indictment was returned under seal on June 15 and
unsealed Tuesday at the initial court appearance of one of the
defendants. Except for LaHue, who lives in Stilwell in Johnson
County, Kan., none of the individual defendants lives in the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that the owners and operators of
residential care facilities in Lamar and Joplin directed patients
from the facilities to LaHue and three other doctors. The doctors
then allegedly falsely certified that the patients were homebound
and in need of home health services.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the arrangement enabled the doctors to bill
Medicare and Medicaid for patient visits and enabled the
residential facilities to bill Medicare and Medicaid for home
health services. Altogether, the allegedly false claims resulted in
overpayments of more than $1 million, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges that the owners and managers of the
facilities offered discounts and other incentives to local
residential care homes in return for access to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation is that the residential care operators steered
patients to the doctors so they would make fraudulent
certifications that they were homebound, which made them eligible
for Medicare and Medicaid,'' said Chris Whitley, a spokesman for
the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the indictment are Sterling Home Health Care Inc. in
Lamar, doing business as Regal Home Health Care, which is charged
with four counts of conspiracy to defraud the government and two
counts of paying illegal kickbacks; La-Du's Home Health Care Inc.
in Joplin, which is charged with two counts of conspiracy to
defraud the government and two counts of paying illegal kickbacks;
Sandhill Inc. in Lamar, which is charged with four counts of
conspiracy to defraud the government; and A to Z Billing Services
Inc. in Joplin, which is charged with one count of conspiracy to
defraud the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, La-Du's, Sandhill and A to Z were variously owned or
controlled by Robert Joseph Dupont Jr. of Oronogo and Karl Otis
Householder of Milo, according to the indictment. Dupont, 55, and
Householder, 62, are charged with conspiracy, making false
applications for Medicaid benefits, filing false Medicare cost
reports, failing to file Medicare cost reports and paying illegal
kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides LaHue, the indictment names physicians Jan Dierks
Garwood, 51, of Nixa; David Ray Trobaugh, 52, of Carthage; and
Rafael Augusto Calabria, 60, of Mooresboro, N.C. Other defendants
include two registered nurses, one licensed practical nurse and
Dupont's daughter, Kelley Anne Liveoak, 37, of Webb City.
</P>
<P>
   Through health-care anti-fraud actions, the federal government
collected $490 million last year in civil, criminal and
administrative penalties, according to Cassil of the Department of
Health and Human Services. That contrasts with 1997, when about
$1.1 billion was collected, and 1998, when about $300 million was
collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ebbs and flows,'' Cassil said. ``A lot of it depends on
when the case is actually settled.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest health-care fraud settlement ever was reached in
January, when a Boston-based kidney dialysis provider paid $486
million to settle civil and criminal allegations of health-care
fraud, Cassil said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, HCA, formerly known as Columbia//HCA Healthcare
Corp., reached a $745 million tentative settlement with the U.S.
Justice Department over fraud allegations.

MANY HOSPITALS REPORTEDLY FAIL TO PROVIDE STROKE PATIENTS PROPER
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On Memorial Day morning three years ago, Earl
Munger was jogging through his Gladstone neighborhood when he was
felled by a stroke. He lay by the road, paralyzed on his right side
and unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   But Munger, 65, counts himself as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor found him and immediately called an ambulance. Munger
was taken to North Kansas City Hospital, where doctors gave him the
clot-busting drug tPA.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of hours, Munger could speak and his paralysis
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was virtually back to normal,'' Munger said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of state-of-the-art care all stroke patients
should receive, but many patients don't, a national group of
medical organizations called the Brain Attack Coalition said
Tuesday at a news teleconference in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The failure by hospitals to provide that care leaves thousands
of stroke patients needlessly disabled and costs millions of
dollars for their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which includes the American Heart Association,
the American Academy of Neurology and other health and professional
groups, called for specially staffed and equipped stroke centers at
hospitals across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The stroke centers would operate the way trauma centers do now
to provide rapid, expert attention for a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke centers should be open 24 hours, be able to begin
evaluating stroke patients within five minutes of their arrival,
conduct brain scans to determine the type of stroke and provide tPA
if appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   One study found that stroke centers reduced the odds of death or
serious disability by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the coalition's proposal were published today
(Wednesday) in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a long way from the ideal,'' said Marc Mayberg of the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation and a co-author of the article.
``Patients aren't getting to the emergency room in time. When they
do...they're not getting optimal care.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons range from limited hospital staffing that makes it
difficult to assess patients to physician concerns about
complications from tPA, which stands for tissue-type plasminogen
activator.
</P>
<P>
   About 600,000 people in the United States suffer strokes every
year. Stroke is the third-greatest killer in the United States and
one of the leading causes of disability.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent survey of hospitals found that 66 percent lacked
standard treatment plans for stroke and 82 percent did not rapidly
identify patients who were experiencing strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Another study found that only 2 to 3 percent of stroke patients
received tPA.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors now call strokes ``brain attacks'' to highlight their
similarity to heart attacks. In both cases, the blood supply is
disrupted, causing tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some strokes are caused by burst blood vessels in the brain. But
most are due to blood clots that block vessels.
</P>
<P>
   If given intravenously within three hours of a stroke caused by
a blood clot, tPA can in many cases dissolve the clot and minimize
injury to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of stroke care the Brain Attack Coalition envisions is
available at a relatively small number of hospitals nationwide,
mostly those associated with medical schools, said Mark Alberts, a
Duke University physician and lead author of the journal article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to move to the next step to include community,
urban and rural hospitals. The number could be increased to at
least several hundred and maybe even a thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area has a number of hospitals that are
well-equipped to handle stroke, doctors say. But good stroke care
remains ``very spotty'' from hospital to hospital, said Marilyn
Rymer, a neurologist and director of the stroke center at St.
Luke's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you land can determine the whole outcome, whether or not
you end up disabled,'' she said. ``That's the case locally and
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Rymer is co-chairwoman of a stroke task force of the Greater
Kansas City Division of the American Heart Association that is
working to educate hospitals, health care professionals and the
public about the need to recognize stroke symptoms and seek prompt
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Local ambulance services are doing a good job getting stroke
patients to hospitals quickly, Rymer said, and patients appear to
be more knowledgeable about stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is certainly as sophisticated as any place in the
country as far as the early recognition and treatment of stroke
victims,'' said Joseph Waeckerle, co-chairman of the Heart
Association task force and director of emergency medicine for three
Health Midwest hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer recommended that people concerned about getting good
stroke care ask their doctors which hospitals they would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your homework. Know your hospitals,'' she said. ``Find out
ahead of time who is going to be able to treat you.''

<P>
   I grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. I started my own company, Cut
and Bag Lawn Service, during junior high school. I made $6 to $8 a
lawn, and on a good day, I could mow two to three lawns an hour. I
paid friends $5 an hour to help me, way above minimum wage. We
built up to about 50 lawns a week. My mother was upset when she
figured out I made more per hour than she did. She had a master's
degree and ran the county's reading program.
</P>
<P>
   During high school, I was president of the National Honor
Society, the scuba club and the science club, and I became an Eagle
Scout. I also ran track and cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   For two years in high school, I was in Junior Achievement, a
national, nonprofit organization that helps kids understand free
enterprise by having them set up a company. A group of us set up a
mutual fund company, and a regional brokerage firm sponsored us.
We'd meet at their offices once a week and they'd teach us how to
research stocks. Then we'd vote on which ones to buy. The year I
was president of the J.A. company, I went to Indiana to compete for
National President of the Year. I could have won a $10,000
scholarship. Unfortunately, I missed a trick question that defined
GNP as gross national profit rather than gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   I sold my lawn business prior to starting engineering school at
the University of Florida, and I wanted to invest the money. After
reading a book titled ``How I Turned $1,000 Into $3,000,000 in Real
Estate in My Spare Time,'' I bought this big, old rambling house
that had been converted into seven apartments. My tenants were
surprised to have an 18-year-old landlord. I also bought another
apartment building and three rental houses.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I managed and maintained about 50 rental units. I
was pretty busy. I paid for much of my undergraduate degree and my
Harvard M.B.A. with my real estate profits.
</P>
<P>
   My wife-to-be and I started dating at age 14. We were both voted
Teens of the Month, and our pictures appeared together in The St.
Petersburg Times. We got married in college, and our first baby was
born the night before my first final at Harvard Business School.
When I walked into the exam, everyone clapped because no one
expected me to show up.
</P>
<P>
   I have a 21-foot boat named Discover (for Discover Card) that I
use for water skiing in the lakes around Chicago. I also keep a
fishing boat on a small, private island I own near the Florida
Panhandle. There's an Indian burial ground on the island, and I've
been working to stave off the erosion from the storms of the last
10 years. I've also been working with a couple of Florida colleges
to research and preserve Indian artifacts. A Florida newspaper once
ran an article saying that a pirate had buried treasure on the
island, and included a map. Shortly afterward we found holes all
over the island, dug by people looking for the treasure. We've used
a metal detector, though, and have never found any treasure.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been interested in technology. In junior high I took
some courses at a local science center that had a donated mainframe
computer. I'd write programs to calculate how high my model rockets
could fly. I've automated my current house with four networked
PC's, and our lights are all computer-controlled. Dealing with
networking problems at home has made me appreciate our LAN problems
at work.

CHILDHOOD FRIENDSHIP DISAPPEARED IN CASE OF MISSING WOMEN

<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ Between her thumb and fingers Suzanne
Lawrence absent-mindedly rubs a tear-drop-shaped crystal _ Debbie
Faith's good luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne has kept it wrapped in a black velvet bag for the last
seven years, except for once when her little sister, Sarah, took it
to show-and-tell. Sarah dropped it, and now a corner is chipped.
But it still shimmers in the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie gave this to me so she'd have a reason to come back,''
said Suzanne. She sighed and pushed back a wisp of blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith and her mother, Sheila, disappeared six years ago. Last
week, authorities linked the Faiths with John E. Robinson Sr., an
Olathe, Kan., man who is charged in five deaths and being
questioned in the disappearance of six other persons.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie's story, it might seem, is a tragic one, because her life
could be viewed as one long list of misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she needed a motorized-wheelchair
to move her body. Her dad died before she reached her teens. The
family needed food stamps. Her mom became lonely and began using
personal ads to meet men, usually the wrong men, friends
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But Debbie shunned victimhood. She owned a free-wheeling giggle
that would make others laugh. She made deep friendships. She had
hopes for the future, even dreamed of walking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, her mother began moving, drawn first from Orange County
in Southern California to Northern California, then to Colorado by
her own hopes _ of romance. The next year, Debbie called to alert
Suzanne of another move, this time to Kansas. Sheila had connected
with a nice man named ``John,'' who even promised to help Debbie
ride one of his horses, Suzanne said.
</P>
<P>
   And for six years, Suzanne has prayed and cried and wondered,
hoping she'd see Debbie again.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, she saw her friend's smiling face once more _
when it flashed across the TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne's family, gathered in their living room, told stories
about Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   ``So funny...She was always so polite to adults...You forgot she
was in a wheelchair because she was so outgoing...Do you remember
when she started those water fights at the park?...''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne chimed in with her own ``remember when'' stories,
spilling them out like disconnected dots on a bingo board. She
grinned as she talked; she likes remembering Debbie. She's glad
that other people care to know, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was more like my sister, than just a girl friend,'' she
said, then her face fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``...We talked all the time. Something terrible, horrible has
happened to her. I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne first met Debbie Faith in choir practice at the Nicolas
Junior High School choir in Fullerton in 1991. That summer, Debbie
and Sheila buried John Faith's ashes under a pier on Huntington
Beach. Debbie cried then. She used to love the beach, she told her
mom. No more. Now the beach would forever make her sad.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie had spent most of her life in a wheelchair. On both her
arms were braces. She could move one hand just enough to push the
buttons on her wheelchair. She needed a catheter. She was too heavy
for Sheila, who used a hoist to move Debbie into bed at night.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie, then 12, also sang. She loved Neil Diamond songs. She
was a soprano. Not a very good one, according to her choir teacher,
but she loved trying.
</P>
<P>
   On that autumn day that they met in choir practice, Suzanne,
then 11, was assigned to be Debbie's singing helper. By the end of
the hour, the seventh-grade girls became best buddies.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years they were inseparable: walking and
wheeling the few blocks from their homes to the mall after school;
eating strawberry ice cream in root beer floats; telling stories
during sleep-overs in Debbie's apartment, or just picking up bread
at the grocery. Sometimes the bread was squished, said Suzanne,
smiling again. ``We'd eat it before Sheila found out, to destroy
the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie liked to be silly, to make Suzanne _ or ``Sissy'' as she
called her _ laugh. If Debbie saw an elderly man at the mall or
someone else in a wheelchair, she raced them, giggling and zipping
away with her electric motor whining at top speed.
</P>
<P>
   As teens, Suzanne and Debbie talked about crushes on their choir
teacher, wrote fan letters to soap opera stars, called psychic hot
lines to foretell their futures. One psychic told Debbie she would
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie wanted to go on to become a counselor to the deaf and
blind. Suzanne wanted to be a physical education teacher for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1993,... MORE
</P>
<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ ...teacher for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1993, two weeks after graduation from junior high,
Debbie and her mother, Sheila, moved away to Santa Cruz in Northern
California. Two boyfriends were in her mother's life, but both were
married. Debbie didn't like that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we really didn't like the one man named Jim Fox,''
recalled Suzanne. ``He came over once a week to their apartment,
sometimes twice a week.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sheila knew Fox was going to visit, she'd give the girls
money and hurry them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a nice man to young girls,'' she told Suzanne when
she asked why. Once, Jim Fox arrived unannounced. He took a look at
Suzanne and told her she had nice legs and a nice rear end, using
adult words. That night she told her mother, Debbie Lawrence, about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried because I knew that Sheila was watching out
for both girls,'' said Debbie Lawrence. ``Sheila seemed like an
excellent mother to me. I trusted her.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Suzanne's parents read a story in the newspaper
about an investigation on Fox, a foster parent accused of molesting
teen-age girls. He died before police completed their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheila Faith's new boyfriend in Santa Cruz turned out to be
a loser, too, says Suzanne. ``Debbie told me he was crazy and that
they were going to move to Colorado because they had some friends
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends were the Guerreros, whom they met in California.
Melissa Guerrero, who also uses a wheelchair, had known Debbie
since the second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Guerrero drove the Faiths from Santa Cruz to Colorado in
their 1978 Chevrolet white van. The van quit three times before it
made it to Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of living was better in Colorado, but there was one
more reason for the move. Sheila had answered another ad for a
boyfriend prospect in Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the distance, Debbie and Suzanne were determined
to stay friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my sister, and I was hers,'' said Suzanne.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrence family tightened their budget to allow for
Suzanne's large phone bills. The Faiths, who lived on Debbie's
disability checks, couldn't afford them.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' favorite time to talk was during ``American
Gladiator.'' They could watch it together, teasing each other about
the body of each others' favorite sports warrior. Suzanne liked
``Turbo.'' Debbie liked ``Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   And once, after writing a zillion fan letters, said Suzanne, a
star from ``All My Children'' called her friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie was almost hysterical. I had to hold the phone away
from my ear she was so loud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another time Debbie called to say that doctors in Colorado told
her she didn't have cerebral palsy after all, but spina bifida. And
they told her that maybe, just maybe, she'd walk again, with lots
of physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls continued. They spent New Year's Eve talking to
each other and counting down the seconds despite the time zone
difference. She remembers even more clearly the talk they had a few
days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving to Kansas,'' Debbie announced to Suzanne. ``Mom
met a guy named John from the newspaper. He has a farm in Kansas
and horses and he said he was going to help me get on one and he
said you could come and visit us whenever you wanted too. Isn't
that great?''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne was silent.
</P>
<P>
   Her stomach had flopped, thinking about her friend moving even
farther away. And the news of yet another boyfriend for Debbie's
mother just didn't feel right, she said now. It wasn't fair that
Debbie would have to move again and start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to go?'' Suzanne finally asked Debbie. ``I mean,
you're so happy in Colorado, why move?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Sissy, Mom's so lonely. If this will make her happy,
we're gonna go for it,'' Suzanne recalled her friend saying.
``Besides, Mom talked with John a long time. He's really nice. I'll
call you when we get there. Don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie never made that call. She and her mother dropped out of
sight immediately after leaving Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a commercial mail center in Olathe reported that a
man matching the description of Robinson and using one of his
aliases was picking up the Faith checks, forwarded from Pueblo for
years. Robinson has not been charged in connection with the Faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Best friends know things in their heart of hearts about each
other. Suzanne keeps a ray of optimism. Just like light through a
chipped crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne will be 21 next month. She only has one wish for her
birthday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what happened to my friend. My wish is to find
Sheila and Debbie alive.''
</P>
<P>
   And she wrapped the black velvet around the teardrop of glass
and put it away.

A LESSON IN GOVERNMENT INEFFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSION, Kan. _ If you want to observe a good working argument
for why many government activities should be turned over to the
private sector, visit the Johnson County motor vehicle office in
Mission.
</P>
<P>
   My nightmare occurred last week because the usual easy-as-pie,
do-everything-by-mail routine was superseded by the need to get a
lien removed from the family flivver's title. This is usually a
happy time, because it signals the beginning of a wonderful life
without car-loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the price paid in aggravation to get to this
state of bliss was high. The task of renewing tags, paying property
taxes and clearing titles took more than an hour. It was the sort
of ordeal that gives government inefficiency a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that my frightful experience wasn't nearly as
awful as that of many others gathered there trying to register new
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The first challenge was finding the right line, because of the
dearth of instruction signs. After five minutes in the first line
encountered, a nearby fellow sufferer noticed my paperwork and
tipped me to the fact that I was in the wrong line. Go over there
to the renewal line, and consider yourself lucky, she said. She had
been there for nearly three hours and was the next number to be
called for whatever it was she needed done.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing part of the experience was how well all those
horribly abused taxpayers were handling their plight. There was a
lot of grousing, of course, but it was mostly good-natured stuff
peppered with jokes about government and tax dollars in action.
</P>
<P>
   Another enlightening moment came Monday afternoon listening to
Jerry Fogel's show on ``compelling KPHN'' during drive time. Fogel,
it seems, had a simple question, called the motor vehicle office
but was never able to make contact with a live human. The miffed
talkmeister was then inspired to ask his listeners whether his was
an isolated incident or whether Johnson Countians did indeed have a
problem worthy of serious attention by their elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Fogel's response was a litany of ghastly tales of endless waits
both at the facility and on telephones trying to get answers to
simple questions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the shortage of employees available to help customers, is
the area's tight labor market the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely, said Johnson County Treasurer Bill O'Brien. It's
more a matter of not enough money being budgeted to sustain
adequate staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to hire some people,'' O'Brien said, ``and we've got
to allow some room in the budget to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Demands on the operation have intensified as the strong economy
has fueled more new car sales. Although demand has mounted for
new-car registrations, which take longer than renewals, there
hasn't been enough money to match staffing levels with the growing
workload.
</P>
<P>
   This operation's deteriorating situation would seem to be
sending a message to the powers that be: Either fund it adequately
or contract it out to a private company.
</P>
<P>
   Given that this fiasco involves such an awesome revenue machine,
it seems penny wise and pound foolish to be overly close with its
budget. Moreover, beyond financial considerations, the damage being
done to county government's credibility among its taxpaying voters
is incalculable.

MOVES TO RESTRICT CELL PHONES REFLECT REACTION AGAINST VOCAL
MINORITY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Business Travel appears each Wednesday. Joe Sharkey's e-mail
address is jsharkey(AT)nytimes.com.) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to a lucky One-Pass upgrade, I was sitting in first class
on a Continental Airlines flight to Florida one sunny morning last
week waiting for takeoff. The flight attendant was passing out
those steaming face towels and taking drink orders. What a swell
flight so far, I thought. But then that dreaded telltale chirp
sounded from the row behind me.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a cell phone idiot began braying into the morning's
serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the plane,'' he declared in a voice as loud as a cattle
auctioneer's. ``We're going to take off in a couple of minutes.
Listen, did you put on the air conditioner? What? What? Nah, you
got to hit the reset button. What? Hit the reset! It's on the left!
What? Listen .''
</P>
<P>
   It went on like this for several long minutes. Then he barked
goodbye and snapped the phone lid shut. But before a sigh of relief
had time to form, he made another call. In the seat beside me, a
woman who looked like a very nice person muttered a single word,
softly, but with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way in the cell phone culture since last
summer. Then, after years of resistance, several airlines decided
to relax strict prohibitions against using cell phones. Motivated
both by public demand and by a realization that passengers ducking
away to make last-minute phone calls at the gate were delaying
boarding and affecting on-time performance, most airlines began
allowing passengers to use cell phones until the pilot started
taxiing. The development was generally applauded by passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since this change, however, there has been a
remarkable shift in general attitude toward cell phone use in
public, thanks to a minority of users who make the rest of us
cringe whenever we see them cracking that cell phone. And while the
airlines and federal regulators still insist that in-flight cell
phone use is a safety hazard that can interfere with complex
cockpit communications and navigation technology, some experts and
cell phone industry officials have been publicly arguing that the
science supporting the ban is questionable. After all, they say,
cell phone use is routine on board private corporate aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the obvious market potential causes the safety
problems to be adequately addressed, will we be arriving at a point
where passengers gabbing incessantly into cell phones might be a
steady part of the airline experience, just as they are on other
public conveyances such as trains and buses?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be any discernible rush to
forge ahead into that particular segment of the brave new
technological world. Many experts point to rapid technological
innovations and believe that live Internet and e-mail service will
be available on some airplanes within a year. But no one is
predicting a cell phone breakout in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in the foreseeable future you'll be able to use
them, because the testing has just not been done to prove that they
are not harmful,'' said Kathryn Creedy, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at this point, the syllogism still exists,'' Creedy said.
``We require that testing be done by the airlines or the industry
in order to prove that it is not harmful. And since that testing
has not been done, therefore they are banned.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Creedy declined to speculate on whether, given the
general level of annoyance that many people now show toward being
subjected to someone else's cell phone conversation, the airline
industry might now be willing to maintain the status quo. After
all, airlines make money when passengers place expensive calls on
existing on-board phones.
</P>
<P>
   But several academic authorities in telephone communications
agree that perhaps the public is now ready to weigh the cultural,
rather than just the scientific, argument against encouraging cell
phones in the skies _ especially on long, crowded flights where
people are already tense and often uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Growing moves across the country to restrict annoying cell
phones on other forms of pubic transportation reflect a swelling
reaction against a vocal minority of cell phone users, said Thomas
I. White, a professor of business ethics at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.

   ``The people who get on everyone's nerves, they're coming from a
sense that no one else matters. They're totally self-absorbed, and
they seem to think that the impact of their actions on other people
are absolutely inconsequential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plays itself out in two ways. One, it is seen as an
eroding of civility or a disruption of civil discourse. This is
what we are seeing in San Francisco where cell phones are being
banned from many restaurants. And two, the self-absorption can also
be seen as a safety issue, such as in Los Angeles, where there are
moves to restrict cell phone use in cars.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he wouldn't be surprised to see the move to restrict
public use of cell phones grow, especially if it became apparent
that they might be allowed on airplane flights.
</P>
<P>
   Creedy conceded that passengers might well welcome the
``respite'' from cell phone annoyances that is provided by the
continuing ban, but stressed that safety is the FAA's only concern
in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   White, meanwhile, said: ``I'm assuming the only way the airlines
can get away with continuing to ban cell hones is because they say,
that's going to mess up the radar or the communications. And the
only reason people respect the ban is we're all scared to pull out
our cell phones and make a call because it might make the plane go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, whatever works.

JULES ROY, ALGERIAN-BORN FRENCH WRITER, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Jules Roy, a prolific and polemical French writer who
sought inspiration for much of his work in the Algeria of his
childhood and in his subsequent career as a French air force
officer, died on June 15 at his home in the Burgundy town of
Vezelay. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Roy was first recognized as a writer in 1946 for ``La Vallee
Heureuse,'' or ``The Happy Valley,'' his prize-winning account of
participating in Britain's Royal Air Force bombing raids of the
Ruhr Valley. Decades later he was again acclaimed for six novels
published in the 1970s under the title ``Les Chevaux du Soleil,''
or ``Horses in the Sun,'' which recounted the history of Algeria
from 1830 to its independence from France in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his other novels, essays and ``recits,'' or
semiautobiographical books, also grew out of his direct experiences
in life, not only ``La Mort de Mao'' (``The Death of Mao''), which
followed his travels in China, but also ``La Bataille de Dien Bien
Phu,'' (``The Battle of Dien Bien Phu''), about France's defeat in
the Indochinese war.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the pilot and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who
died in 1944, and of his fellow Algerian-born Frenchman Albert
Camus, who died in 1960, Roy was _ like both men _ stubbornly
nonconformist. In World War II, he showed early sympathy for the
collaborationist Vichy regime before joining the Royal Air Force.
Then, after 26 years in the French air force, he resigned his
commission in 1953 to protest French involvement in the war in
Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, it was Algeria that dominated his life.
In the late 1950s he expressed his fierce opposition to French
efforts to smother Algeria's fight for independence in an essay
called ``The Algerian War.'' And after completing ``Les Chevaux du
Soleil'' in 1989 he published ``Memoires Barbares,'' about his
upbringing in Algeria. Only five years ago he returned to an
Algeria convulsed by civil war to visit his mother's grave at Sidi
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Oct. 22, 1907, in Rovigo, now Bougara, in Algeria, he
was reared by his mother and grandmother. Le Monde recounted that
his mother's husband, Louis Roy, a policeman, evicted her from his
home when he discovered that the baby's father was a local teacher,
Leon Henri Dematons. Although his mother later married Dematons,
Jules kept his surname.
</P>
<P>
   The young boy's first calling was religious, and in 1918 he
entered a Roman Catholic seminary, which, he later wrote, ``made me
the man I am.'' But in 1927, after being called up for military
service, he changed directions and became a career air force
officer.
</P>
<P>
   He married Mirande Grimal, from whom he later divorced. His
survivors include their two children, Jean-Louis and Genevieve as
well as his second wife, Tatiana Soukoroukoff, whom he married in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting out the early part of World War II in Algeria, he
read Camus' novel set in Algeria, ``L'Etranger'' (``The
Stranger''), and discovered a vocation as a writer. In 1946 ``La
Vallee Heureuse'' brought him the prestigious Renaudot Prize, but
he remained in the air force, rising to the rank of colonel (the
French air force uses army ranks) before resigning over the war in
Indochina. From then on he dedicated his life to writing.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Catholic, he moved in his later years to Vezelay,
where he lived near the town's exquisite Romanesque basilica of
Sainte-Madeleine and became a devotee of Mary Magdalene. He liked
to explain his devotion in a typically subversive way. ``She was,''
he often said, ``one of the most beautiful whores in history.''
