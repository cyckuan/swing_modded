<HEADLINE> Russia-NATO Accord Could Be Signed on May 27: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov said here today that Russia could sign a treaty on
bilateral relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) on May 27 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"President Chirac has suggested that this document be signed on
May 27 in Paris. I am entitled by President Boris Yeltsin to say
that if the document was ready, he could come to Paris to sign
this document on the level of the leaders of Russia and the 16
member countries of NATO," said Primakov after holding talks with
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia are now negotiating a joint document with both
of them having the intention of signing it before the NATO Madrid
summit to be held on July 8-9, which will decide on which
countries will join the Western military alliance in the first
wave of its expansion.
</P>
<P>
The document is aimed at reducing Russian hostility toward
NATO's eastward expansion plan, which Moscow regards as a threat
to its national security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today
that Russia and NATO could find a "reasonable compromise" to reach
an agreement before the NATO Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that a reasonable compromise, the kind which
will take into account the worries of Russia, can be found before
the Madrid summit," said de Charette during a dinner given in
honor of Primakov in the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
De Charette also announced during the toast that French
President Jacques Chirac will visit Russia again on September
25-27, which he said will make up an "essential rod" of
Franco-Russian dialogue.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Primakov said during a toast at the dinner that
Russia considers NATO's eastward expansion plan "a grave error."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who is on a two-day visit here, said Tuesday that
many questions remain to be solved between Russia and NATO before
a bilateral agreement can be signed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is opposed to the permanent deployment of
NATO military infrastructure and troops in the countries to be
newly absorbed by NATO: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Says Traditional Operas Should Be Videotaped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, Li Ruihuan, said here today that traditional Chinese
operas should be videotaped to preserve the country's excellent
traditional plays.
</P>
<P>
Li was speaking at a symposium on the major performances of Luo
Yusheng, a famous North China drum artist, in the People's Great
Hall.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has developed various types of operas in its
long history, but that the outstanding artistic achievements of
many famous traditional Chinese opera artists are not known to
society because of lack of access.
</P>
<P>
The videotaping of traditional operas could be an effective way
of preserving and popularizing the rare traditional Chinese operas.
</P>
<P>
A source says that videotaping of major performances of Luo
Yusheng was proposed by Li.
</P>
<P>
North China drum music is very popular in the north, and Luo,
who is 84, has devoted nearly 70 years to the drum and has had
some remarkable achievements.

KATHMANDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has been entrusted with
the overall responsibility to coordinate the proposed four-nation
sub-regional cooperation in South Asia, the official news agency
RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Bangladesh, India and Nepal and the
Bhutanese ambassador to India met in New Delhi Tuesday to move

<HEADLINE> Finnish PM: Helsinki Has No Plans to Seek NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen stressed here today that Finland has no plans to seek
membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"The starting point of our security policy solution is that
Finland is not a member of a military alliance but is responsible
for its own defense," Lipponen said in a speech at Germany's
Friedrich Ebert Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, who is on a one-day visit to Bonn, met earlier with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. During the talks, he expressed
first of all his support for the bids for European Union (EU)
membership by the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, a German government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Lipponen stressed that the
three Baltic states had made impressive reform progress within the
past few years and should be treated as equal candidates for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Helsinki did not believe certain Eastern European
countries should be given a privileged position with regard to
joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
A stumbling block for Estonia and Latvia to join the EU is
their unresolved border disputes with Russia. The EU has said it
does not want to import any unresolved border problems with
admission of new members.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen said that while the border disputes remained primarily
bilateral issues, the EU could also play a role by encouraging a
solution.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Want To Give Salvaged Warship Original Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The salvaged cruiser "Chungshan,"
which was sent to the bottom of the Yangtze River by Japanese
planes nearly 60 years ago, should be restored to its 1920s
appearance, some Chinese archaeologists, historians and shipping
people said today.
</P>
<P>
The warship, which was named for the forerunner of China's
democratic revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Sun Chungshan), should
keep its battle scars earned in the Battle of Jinmen in the War of
Resistance Against Japan and should remain floating as an
exhibition, the group of experts said after doing a feasibility
study of various restoration plans.
</P>
<P>
The ship was built by Japan in 1910, and took part in battles
in the 1920s against feudal warlords, under the command of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen.
</P>
<P>
Other restoration plans considered were for it to be restored
to its appearance when it sank in 1938, or that when it was hauled
out of the water on January 28.
</P>
<P>
But experts rejected the latter right away, in view of serious
damage done to the ship. "Keeping the vessel as it is now does
little for the ship's long-term protection, and makes it
impossible to carry it from the dockyard to the exhibition site,"
they explained.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was recovered after a 98-day salvage operation, and
is receiving an overhaul at a shipyard in central China's Hubei
province.

<HEADLINE> British Artist Arrested in Body Parts Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A British artist has been arrested
for questioning after around 30 human body parts were found in his
studio, police said today.
</P>
<P>
Anthony-Noel Kelly, 41, was released on bail and will appear in
court next week, police said.
</P>
<P>
He is a cousin of the Duke of Norfolk and part-time teacher at
heir to the throne Prince Charles's Institute of Architecture.
</P>
<P>
He was detained last week after police raided his London studio
and country house with discovery of the human body parts.
</P>
<P>
Kelly refused to comment on the case but his lawyer, Mark
Stephens, said Kelly was cooperating with police.
</P>
<P>
"Police are investigating allegations of theft and burying
bodies without consent," a police spokeswoman told the press.
</P>
<P>
Police began the probe after the government's Inspector of
Anatomy, Laurence Martin, made a request for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Martin is a civil servant in charge of anatomical
investigations, and was looking into possible violations of the
Anatomy Act, which forbids the illegal use of human body parts.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Health said he had also
written to medical schools in Britain alerting them to the
possible sale of human remains.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were revolted by what they found during the
raids.
</P>
<P>
"There were some 20 to 30 pieces of human remains. It was
frankly unbelievable. Even for officers used to dealing with some
horrific case, it was sickening," a police officer told The Mirror
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Kelly won recognition for his moulds of heads, feet and torsos
which he claimed was his way of immortalizing the dead. Some of
his works, gilded in silver and gold, were sold for thousands of
pounds.

IFC's financing consists of a loan of 20 million dollars for
its own account and an equity investment of 5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost over 100 million dollars. Part
of IFC's long-term loan will be utilized to restructure the
existing short-term debt of the Egyptian company, Orascom Project
and Touristic Development.

<HEADLINE> UN Agencies Call For End to Female Genital Mutilation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Three United Nations agencies today
called for international support for efforts aimed at eliminating
female genital mutilation, that is widely practised in
Africa and parts of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) appealed to the international community and world leaders
to achieve a short-term goal of a major decline in the practice in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
A WHO press release said that more than 130 million girls and
women around the world had been subjected to such mutilation and a
further two million were at risk each year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the girls and women live in 28 African countries, and
some in Asia and the Middle East. They are also found in Europe,
Australia, Canada and the United States among immigrant
communities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The operation, sometimes called female circumcision, involves
usually very painful partial or total removal of external female
genital organs, or their mutilation.
</P>
<P>
It is carried out, sociologists say, largely to encourage the
woman to remain a virgin until marriage and so be more attractive
to a potential husband.
</P>
<P>
The age of girls and women mutilated differs from region to
region, but in general most girls undergo it between the age of
four to 12, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the practice often leads to death through
infection, or at least life-long health problems as well as
infertility and childbirth complications.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to end the practice, WHO Director-General Hiroshi
Nakajima, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy and UNFPA
Executive Director Nafis Sadik unveiled their joint plan to bring
about a major decline in 10 years and completely eliminate this
practice within three generations.
</P>
<P>
They said that the elimination of this unsafe and unjustifiable
practice based on misconceptions and myths will not only improve
the health of millions of women and children but also make a major
contribution to the promotion of human rights and gender equity.
</P>
<P>
The three agencies said that governments, international
organizations, political, religious and non-governmental
organizations as well as funding agencies should make concerted
efforts to eliminate the harmful practice. Inter-agency teams will
be formed at country level supported by international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The teams will try to change public opinion in the countries
concerned through education and to raise awareness about the harm
of the practice.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Output Grows 0.2 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's manufacturing output rose
by a weaker-than-expected 0.2 percent in February, giving a 1.8
percent year-on-year rise, according to figures released today by
the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total industrial production, which includes
utilities output, was 0.6 percent lower in February than the month
before, the largest fall since June 1996, but 1.5 percent higher
on the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists had forecast the country's factory output and
industrial production in the month to increase by 0.3 percent and
0.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that, although manufacturing output grew slightly
in February, it has been lagging behind the booming service sector
for a long time, and this posed a dilemma for the new government
no matter which party wins the general election on May 1.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the new government raised interest rates to
kill inflationary pressures, it would on the one hand run the risk
of further strengthening the pound, which has rallied steadily over
the last eight months and is hitting exports, and on the other
hand it would further weaken the manufacturing sector.

PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the new
violent incidents which broke out in the Palestinian territories,
which killed three Palestinians Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As we have feared, the situation continues to deteriorate and
we are worried to see that the public opinions of Israel and
Palestinians are more and more skeptical about the chance of
peace," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were killed and 80 wounded by Israeli troops
in the West Bank Tuesday during confrontations which also wounded
five Israelis.

"It is more urgent than ever to resume the initiative and to
propose the ideas to come out of the crisis and relaunch
dialogue," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that France "hopes strongly that our American friends
will respond favorably" to the European initiative for a joint
action to help resume the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot let the situation turn worse," he added.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist Party today also expressed its "strongest
worry" over the situation in the Palestinian territories and
called for the return of the peace "dynamic" founded on the
principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
"Intransigence of (Israeli Prime Minister) Netanyahu, the
multiplication of the initiatives and declarations directly
contrary to the engagements taken and to the agreements
concluded... gravely worry all those who remain attached to the
success of the peace process," said the party in a communique.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denounces Hebron Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today denounced the lastest
shooting incidents in Hebron, warning that the suspension of the
peace march would be beneficial for no one but the extremist
elements inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Osama Baz, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's political
advisor, urged world's awareness to the Israeli use of force to
build settlements in Jerusalem and confiscate Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
"We must show to the world the extent of the acts of violence
and human abuses carried out by Israel," he told reporters a day
after Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers shot dead three
Palestinians and wounded 103 in fierce West Bank clashes, the
bloodiest since Israel launched construction on a new Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the use of force by any party would delay the
peace march and destroy confidence between the peace negotiating
parties.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians want peace," Baz said, "Even Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) is not against the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He quoted leaders of the militant group as approving the right
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to seek a balanced
peace that serves the required limit of Palestinian interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baz said there is no confirmed information up till
now about the establishment of a military alliance involving
Jordan, Turkey and Israel.
</P>

"The Jordanian brothers are quite aware of the danger that lies
in such a step, especially as the problem in the Middle East is
not over yet and nothing has been finally settled regarding the
Palestinian cause and the Lebanese and Syrian peace tracks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, an alliance is a step that is taken by
those whose interests are completely harmonious," said the
Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
Military cooperation has been going on between Israel and
Turkey, he said, adding "but Ankara has told us clearly that it
has not entered into a military alliance with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has announced that the military cooperation between the
two countries is only limited to modernizing the Turkish fleet of
Phantoms in return for offering Israel the right of using Turkish
air space for training purposes, according to Baz.
</P>
<P>
Shifted to the Arab League's recommendation to freeze
normalization steps with the Jewish state on the 107th Arab League
council meeting here on March 30, Baz said that the Arab stance
toward the building of settlements in Jerusalem is adequate for
serving the Palestinian cause and easy to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have ceased and violence has
erupted since Israel launched construction for a 6,500-home new
Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, in 1978, at a three-way summit at Camp David of the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Malaysia to Expand Economic Relations: Leghari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari emphasized here today the need for expansion of economic
relations between Pakistan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Leghari was speaking to visiting Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad who arrived earlier in the day on a one-day visit
and called on the president at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting the two leaders reviewed a wide range of
subjects including expansion in trade and economic cooperation.

Leghari expressed his hope that Mahathir's visit would
encourage entrepreneurs from Malaysia to explore diverse areas for
mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan offered immense potential to foreign
investors through its investment policies which were among the
most attractive in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir appreciated the steps taken by the Pakistani
government to make investment climate favorable for foreign
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysian businessmen were inclined to invest in
Pakistan in collaboration with their Pakistani counterparts.

would help further cement the close relations which exist between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Global Tourism Industry Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The global tourism industry has
generally performed well over the past six years and is forecast
to continue growing to the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
According to Euromonitor, a leading international market
analyst, the number of tourists was up 27 percent over the 1991-96
period to reach 592 million while receipts grew by 49 percent to
404 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Europe dominates the world in terms of both international
arrivals and departures. France recorded the world's highest
number of arrivals in 1996 with almost 62 million. Germany is the
biggest individual outbound market with 79 million departures. But
the highest growth in outbound tourism was found in Eastern
Europe, with both Bulgaria and the Czech Republic in particular
recording a dramatic increase in departures over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
Growth destinations within the Americas, the second popular
tourism region in terms of arrivals, are South America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing tourism regions are North and Southeast
Asia, Australia and the Middle East. However, South Africa was the
best performing individual market over the 1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists will grow at an annual rate of 4 to 5
percent in the next few years, Euromonitor forecasts. The biggest
growth regions will be Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and South
America.
</P>
<P>
Asia is expected to provide the greatest potential for outbound
tourism over 1996-2000 as disposable incomes increase in many
regions, although much of the movement will be inter-regional,
Euromonitor says.
</P>
<P>
The cutting of the working week in China from 48 hours to 40
hours and the return of Hong Kong to China will encourage growth
of outbound and domestic tourism in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Criticizes PNA of Not Doing Enough Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today that the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) was not doing enough against terrorist activity,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"While the Palestinian police were making some efforts to
stop street violence," said Mordechai. "The PNA was not yet
making real effort to halt terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks after a meeting with top Israeli
security officials, including head of the General Security
Service Ami Ayalon and army chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, for a review of the situation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister said that it was up to the
PNA leaders to decide to do their best to fight against
terrorist activity, before the two sides could start political
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told Israel Radio that the Palestinian violence was
on the increase in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, adding
the Israeli army would take what ever measures necessary to
protect and maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted that there were not enough security
cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians, specially there
were not enough cooperation in fighting against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been increasing in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, after two Jewish settlers Tuesday shot and killed one
Palestinian resident of Hebron, wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting incident, there have been serious
clashes Tuesday and Wednesday between Palestinian protesters and
Israeli soldiers in Hebron, during which two more Palestinians
were reportedly killed over 100 injured.

<HEADLINE> Maintaining Existing Trade Concession Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries should lobby both the European Union (EU) and the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) to maintain existing trade concessions,
Zimbabwean minister of agriculture Denis Norman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day workshop on post-Lome IV opportunities for
agriculture in the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Norman said negotiations for current preferences to be retained
should be coupled with exploring ways to strengthen the bloc's
economies to face the new economic order.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the future of the Lome Convention rests with
our ability to identify our specific needs and to unite in the
negotiation of those needs," said Norman.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of SADC's mutual cooperation
with the EU through the Lome Convention, particularly in the
agricultural sector, which the minister said was the engine for
economic growth for most of the SADC economies.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was jointly organised by the Friedrich Ebert
Stiftung and the Food Security Technical and Administrative Unit.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls to Prepare for End of Lome Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) should prepare itself now to work out a mechnism
which will succeed Lome IV Convention when it expires in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Head of the European delegation in Zimbabwe Michael Laidler
warned here today that there was very little time left for
negotiations on the successor to the convention, and talks had to
start in September 1998, 18 months before it expired.
</P>
<P>
He urged SADC member states to gear themselves to fully
consult stakeholders across the spectrum during the run-up to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Laidler was addressing delegates at a two-day workshop on post
Lome IV opportunities for SADC agriculture in Harare. His topic
was "national dialogue on the future of ACP-EU relations post
Lome IV."
</P>
<P>
He said the EU had among other proposals suggested that the
status quo in terms of development aid be maintained when the
convention expires, while a global agreement supplemented by
bilateral agreements and the break up of Lome into regional
agreements were worked out.
</P>
<P>
The EU was also proposing a global agreement with the Least
Developed Countries (LDCS) and other types of agreements with
more developed countries like Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Laidler said since becoming members of the Lome Convention in
1980, SADC member countries' trade had grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He added while standards of living had markedly improved, many
ACP states remained very poor with 41 of the 70 ACP countries
among the LDCS.

ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here today that he was likely to meet his Indian
counterpart during the forthcoming summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation to be held next month in
Male.
</P>
<P>
Sharif disclosed the message when he held talks with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who arrived earlier in the day on
a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered a wide range of bilateral relations with a
special emphasis on the need to enhance economic and commercial
co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his keenness to begin joint ventures and
improve existing trade imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The current trade balance is heavily tilted in favor of
Malaysia. The volume of trade between the two countries in 1995-96
was 850 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also expressed great interest in Malaysia's
participation in joint venture collaboration with Pakistan and
also in the possibility of re-locating labor intensive industries
from Malaysia to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two leaders exchanged views on global and
regional issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Sharif briefed Mahathir about Pakistan's principled position on
Afghanistan and on his recent initiative for resumption of
dialogue with India on all outstanding issues including the core
issue of Jammu and Kashmir.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's newly appointed prime
minister Etienne Tshisekedi today was replaced with an army
general by President Mobutu Sese Seko, after he was briefly
detained by soldiers in the capital Kinshasa late this morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zairian rebels today entered the country's "economic
lung" and the second largest city Lubumbashi in the mineral-rich
province of Shaba in the southeast, after a fierce battle with the
elite units of the Zairian army.
</P>
<P>
Zairian National Radio reported in a flash this afternoon that
General Likulia Bolongo has been appointed prime minister by
President Mobutu to replace Tshisekedi.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Tshisekedi was
brutally detained by a dozen soldiers this morning as he was
walking toward his office under the company of more than several
hundred supporters.
</P>
<P>
An advisor of General Likulia later told AFP that Tshisekedi
was immediately released and personally accompanied home by one of
the sons of President Mobutu, Commander Kongolo Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
No motivation was given for the arrest of Tshisekedi, an
opposition leader and chronic rival of Mobutu. His supporters
staged several protests in the streets and before the parliament
in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
President Mobutu Tuesday declared a state of emergency all over
the country, while the rebels have captured all the major cities
of Zaire except Kinshasa, as well as most of the mineral rich
areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Albanian Defense Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today discussed with Albanian Defense Minister
Shaqir Vukaj Athens' participation in the multinational security
force in Albania and in assisting the reconstruction of the
Albanian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Greek defense minister said after the meeting that the
Greek corps would be made up of 700-900 troops, depending on
requirements and the final decision would be made Thursday in
cooperation with the Albanian government regarding the deployment
of the first troops on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Vukaj, who arrived here Tuesday, said that the future dangers
to be faced by the Italian-led multinational force were limited to
criminal gangs, as the Albanian people in both the north and south
of the country would welcome the multinational troops.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations approved recently the formation of a
5,000-strong peacekeeping force, half of which will be deployed
and half held in reserve, to protect the humanitarian relief
operations in the strife-ridden Albania.
</P>
<P>
Most Greek troops will be stationed in the Albanian capital of
Tirana, with another company based at the southern port of Vlore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek minister revealed that during the meeting,
details of bilateral cooperation were worked out with regard to
Albania's reorganization of its armed forces, and discussions
would be continued at military level.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian minister stressed that the reconstruction would be
based on the history of the Albanian army, the traditions of the
people, the experience of the modern infrastructure of NATO member
states and that of other countries similar to Albania.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government for Peace Agreement With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir
has asserted here today that the government is willing to sign a
peace agreement with rebels to solve the problems in the south.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's meeting of the Sudanese Supreme Peace
Council at the Friendship Hall, the Sudanese President said that
the government is to sign the final peace agreement with the
rebels immediately after Qurban Bairam (a festival for Muslims on
April 17).
</P>
<P>
The agreement has recently been initialed by the Sudanese
government and the rebel parties which have broken away from John
Garang, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The president said the signing of the peace agreement will constitute
a real beginning of a comprehensive solution of the Sudanese
problem, while stressing that bilateral negotiations, without any
external party, will be far more positive.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said the serious approach of the Sudanese government has
encouraged large numbers of southern Sudanese citizens, in and out
of the Sudan, to take part in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of confidence-building between
rebel factions and the government as well as the provision of
sufficient guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The supreme peace council announced Sunday that the final
signing of the peace agreement would take place on April 10. It
also revealed the articles of the agreement including the
establishment of a coordination council, the appointment of 13
ministers and 10 governors for the southern Sudanese states,
specification of a four-year transition period culminating in a
public plebiscite, and distribution of power between the federal
government and governments of the various states.

<HEADLINE> Survey Indicates Bosnia, Beef Crisis Tarnish EU Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the members of the
European parliament feel that the European Union's (EU) handling
of the Bosnia conflict and the "mad cow" crisis over British beef
tarnished its public image, according to a poll due to be
published today.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by MORI for the London-based newspaper
European, revealed that the beef crisis inflicted the most serious
damage with 57 percent polled saying it had diminished public
perceptions of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports last March
after the British government admitted possible links between mad
cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The non-cooperation policy adopted by the British government
effectively paralyzed the strongest economic bloc for some months.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that a narrow majority of 51 percent of
those surveyed felt that the EU's failure to resolve the Balkan
crisis highlighted its inability in handling major international
crisis.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) - Guerrillas of the Lebanese
Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched a bombing attack on a patrol
of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in the south this
afternoon, wounding three.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong surrogate militia of Israel confirmed that its
three militiamen were wounded in the attack in the so called
"security zone" set up by Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said that its fighters detonated a bomb targeting the
SLA patrol on a road between the towns of Gantara and Beni Hyan in
the north sector of the buffer zone at 2:30 p.m. local time (11:30
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the Israeli forces and the SLA militia
bombarded the vicinity of some south Lebanese villages near the
Israeli-occupied border strip without causing casualties, security
sources in the area reported.
</P>
<P>
This was the second bloody attack by Hezbollah guerrillas at
the SLA militia since this month. In the previous attack on April
1, one militiaman was killed and five others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Trades of fire between Muslim guerrillas on the one hand and
the Israeli forces and the SLA militia on the other constitute a
daily scene in the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> German "Wise Men" Cast Doubt on Punctual Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Doubts that Germany will make the
grade for the single European currency, the euro, gained new force
today when two top German government economic advisers said they
expected a delay in the planned January 1, 1999 start date of the
euro.
</P>
<P>
"Given the persistent economic slack in Germany, the
fulfillment of the participation criteria (for the euro) is not in
sight," said Herbert Hax, head of the so-called "five wise men,"
a politically independent economic advisory panel for the German
government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Koelnischen/Bonner Rundschau
newspaper, Hax also said that other EU states had the same
problems as Germany and a European Monetary Union (EMU) with only
a few participants "makes no sense."
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht treaty of the European Union has set five
criteria for member states to qualify for the euro. Among them are
that the budget deficit and national debt of a member country must
not exceed 3 and 60 percent respectively of its gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Also a flexible interpretation of these criteria was seen by
Hax as not helpful. "It is better to adhere to the strict
interpretation of the criteria, and if necessary, to postpone the
euro," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the "five wise men," Rolf Peffekoven, today
also expressed doubt about EU members' ability to meet the 1999
start date of the euro with strict adherence to the qualifying
criteria.
</P>
<P>
"Because a watering down of the criteria is out of
consideration for the Bonn government, the euro would probably
come one or two years behind schedule," the Express newspaper
quoted Peffekoven as saying.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Palestinian Confidence In Peace Is Waning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The level of trust in the
peace process has decreased ever since the construction of the
Jewish settlement by Israel in Mt. Abu Ghneim (Har Homa),
according to a latest poll conducted by JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll released today, a comparison of the
results between an unpublished JMCC poll on March 7 and the
current one, shows a remarkable shift in the mood of the
Palestinian public opinion toward various aspects of the ailing
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Whereas in previous polls the levels of support, strong and
somewhat, for the peace process remained stable, the support
level declined from 78 percent to 73 percent in the period
between the latest two polls. Meanwhile, opposition, strong and
somewhat, to the peace process increased from 18.8 percent to
23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the period, there was a clear drop in support for the
various Palestinian factions. Those, who said they do not trust
any political or religious factions increased from 21.3 percent
to 25.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trust in President Yasser Arafat decreased from 47.4 percent
to 43.4 percent and the number of Palestinians who said they do
not trust any Palestinian leader also increased from 15 percent
to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of Palestinians oppose military and
suicide operations against Israeli targets, a large minority
believe that these operations are an adequate response to the
current political developments: 39.8 percent of the respondents
said they support military operations against Israeli targets
compared to 47.7 percent who oppose them. The difference between
support and opposition to military operations in the West Bank
is very low, 41.6 percent and 42.7 percent respectively. In
contrast, the figures in Gaza are 37 percent and 55.7 percent
respectively. Similar differences are also found between the West
Bank and Gaza in regard to suicide attacks, although the level of
opposition to suicide operations is higher in both the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
An increase in Palestinian frustration with the current
Israeli measures can be inferred from the level of support to
popular protests against Israel: 62.7 percent of Palestinians
support the intensification of demonstrations and popular
protests. Moreover, 31.3 percent of Palestinians believe that
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) should encourage these
protests, and 37.5 percent say that the PNA should not
interfere. Only 23.1 percent of the respondents say that the PNA
should prevent these popular protests.
</P>
<P>
The mojority of the Palestinians reject Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's proposal to stop the
implementation of the interim agreement and to begin with the
final status negotiations; 67.6 percent of Palestinians believe
that the Palestinian leadership should not accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
A random sample of 1,200 people over the age of 18 were
interviewed face-to-face throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
on April 3 and 4. The interviews were conducted in randomly
selected homes, and the subjects inside each home were also
selected randomly according to Kish tables. The interviews were
conducted in 60 sampling points chosen randomly according to
population.

<P>
The margin of error if 3 percent, with a confidence level of
95 percent.

TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Fifty Iranians involved in

<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) led by
Laurent Kabila marched into Lubumbashi in triumph today, a report
from Zaire's second city said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels entered from the southern suburbs in the direction
of the Zambian border but did not reach the Post Office Square --
the city center -- at 3:30 p.m. (13:30 gmt), residents contacted
by telephone said.
</P>
<P>
Firing died down after four p.m.
</P>
<P>
"It's calm, people are leaning on their balconies waiting for
the rebels to come," said one women contacted by phone at
the city center.
</P>
<P>
Rebels said they had met fierce resistance some 15 kilometers
out of town, after which they had marched in.
</P>
<P>
"We had a serious encounter at Lion's Hill, about 15 km from
here. But Once we broke the resistance there, we just moved
ahead," said one rebel of the ADFL.
</P>
<P>
One commander said he had two wounded men. There had been
heavy mortar and gunfire through the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Government soldiers seemed to have fled in stolen cars toward
the airport some six km northeast of the city.
</P>
<P>
People in a crowd said many government soldiers had stripped
off their uniforms and dumped them before fleeing the rebel
advance.
</P>
<P>
Electricity and the city's main cellular telephone network
are still working in Lubumbashi even after the rebels came.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Appeals for International Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today met with 16 foreign envoys and representatives of U.N.
Agencies in Dar es Salaam, informing them on the food deficit
that is facing the country and what assistance is needed.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the President's
Office, his briefing to the envoys was in line with his speech to
the nation on the food situation that he delivered through the
electronic media on Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa informed them of the government's efforts so
far in the endeavor to send emergency food aid to those who
mostly need it immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said 10,000 tons have been allocated to the affected
regions from the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) which is being
transported on government expense close to the affected areas to
minimize the costs to the distributors.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa however said the available food stocks in SGR would be
insufficient to meet the food requirements to 3.6 million people,
670,800 of whom need free allocations.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on the envoys to tell their governments
and agencies that Tanzania would need some 1.3 million U.S.
Dollars to replenish SGR stocks used as food aid.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mkapa said the NGOs that have been appointed to
distribute the food aid to the affected localities would need
more funds to meet operational costs.
</P>
<P>
He also said some 1.2 million US Dollars would be required for
the purchase of seeds for farmers, especially for short-term
maize and sorghum seeds.
</P>
<P>
According to Mkapa, immediate food aid requires 14,000 tons to
add to the 10,000 tons already released from the SGR and the
11,000 pledged by the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 tons of food relief is immediately required to the
most adversely affected people by drought and the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said the government would need to be
assisted in paying for the distribution of food inside the
country at least to the regional and district centers before NGOs
take it over.
</P>
<P>
During the brief meeting at the State House here, a number of
envoys expressed readiness to assist.
</P>
<P>
The invited envoys were from Canada, The United Kingdom,
Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Ireland, Finland, South
Africa, Switzerland, China, South Korea, Egypt, resident
representatives of the UNDP and the World Food Program.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes the Netherlands' Unwarranted Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation today refuted a Dutch representative's
unwarranted accusations against China in a statement Tuesday on
behalf of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The Dutch turned a blind eye to the substantial progress made
by the Chinese government in the field of human rights, claiming
that `it is not sufficient' and making unwarranted accusations
against China of violating human rights," Li said in a reply to
the EU statement.
</P>
<P>
"These accusations are nothing more than cliches without
factual basis," he told the 53rd session of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Whether China has made sufficient progress or not in the field
of human rights should be judged by the Chinese people themselves
but not by the Western countries," Li said. "In the view of the
EU, only when China has accepted their political and value system,
will they say that `it is sufficient.' This is only a wishful
thinking."
</P>
<P>
Refuting the same Dutch's accusations against China on the
question of Hong Kong, Li stressed the following points:
</P>
<P>
1. An important component of the Chinese government's basic
policy on HK is to safeguard the human rights fo the residents in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). In accordance
with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of the
HKSAR, the Chinese government, upon the resumption of its
sovereignty over HK, will implement the policy of "one country,
two systems," "rule of HK by HK people" and "a high degree of
autonomy for HK." This will provide a sound basis for the
promotion and protection of the human rights, democracy and
freedom of the HK people. Accordingly, the previous social and
economic system and way of life in HK shall remain unchanged for
fifty years; the laws previously in force in HK remain basically
unchanged. The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law
have also fully and comprehensively guaranteed the rights and
freedom of the HK residents. They have also included clear-cut
stipulations on the development of a democratic political system
in HK.
</P>
<P>
2. It is none other than the HK British Authorities which have
created obstacles to the enjoyment of human rights, democracy and
freedom by the HK people. In running HK for more than a century,
the HK British Authorities have never drafted any Bill of Rights,
nor have they granted HK residents the right to elect public
officials. Yet on the very eve of HK's return to China, the HK
British Authorities hurriedly adopted the Hong Kong Bill of Rights
Ordinance and dished out its Proposals for Political Reforms. This
is a gross violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the
principle of convergence with the Basic Law as well as the
relevant agreements and understanding reached between the Chinese
and British sides. Their purpose is to create chaos and obstacles
to the rule of law and the government administration in HK after
its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure HK's smooth transition and handover of
government and preserve its long-term prosperity and stability,
the Chinese government cannot but take the necessary measures. The
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has come to a
decision on the handling of the question of HK's existing laws.
With respect to the HK Bill of Rights Ordinance, it was decided
that only those articles which were given overriding effect would
not be adopted, while the rest of the ordinance will be applicable
upon the return of HK to China. The manner in which the Chinese
side has dealt with the legal issue is fair and reasonable, and
has won the wide support of the HK community.
</P>
<P>
"The return of HK to China will have positive and long-standing
effects on world peace and development," Li noted. "Certainly,
there will always be some people who are still nostalgic about
colonialism and could not help but resort to vicious calumny and
make troubles for the Chinese government. They may even attempt to
internationalize the question of HK in order to disrupt its
prosperity and stability. But their attempts will only turn out to
be futile."

<HEADLINE> Zairian Rebel Radio Announces Capture of Lubumbashi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zairian rebel radio announced
this evening the capture of the country's "economic lung" and
second largest city Lubumbashi, which is also the capital of the
fabulously mineral rich province of Shaba in the southeast of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that the inhabitants of
Lubumbashi welcomed the rebel soldiers "with cries of joy," as the
latter entered the city after a fierce battle with the elite
Special Presidential Division (DSP), the presidential guard of
President Mobutu Sese Seko, over the control of a residence of
Mobutu which was used as the headquarters of the DSP.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that with the capture of Lubumbashi, the rebels of
Laurent-Desire Kabila have made a big step forward in its conquest
of all the territory of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The rebel radio, "Voice of the People," said that the rebel
soldiers took control of the city by 14:00 (1200 GMT) "despite the
apparent resistance of the DSP supported by Belgian mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
"As things are going with such a speed, we wonder why the FAZ
(Zairian Armed Forces) continues to fight. What is the FAZ waiting
for -- for surrendering?" said the radio.
</P>
<P>
It said that the objective of the rebels, which is to "liberate
all the country," "is on the way to be won."
</P>
<P>
AFP said that it is impossible now to estimate the number of
people killed in the fighting for Lubumbashi today, although some
rebel soldiers said that the DSP inflicted heavy losses on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Few civilians were killed in the fighting, and a Belgian
expatriate was seriously wounded in mortar shellings and has been
sent to Kinshasa by plane by his friends, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
About 550 Belgian soldiers are preparing to evacuate to
neighboring Zambia or the Congo the hundreds of Belgians living in
Shaba province, where Zaire's state mineral company Gecamine is
located.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted unconfirmed reports as saying that the DSP had blown
up installations of Gecamine before fleeing Mount Simba, 15
kilometers southwest of Lubumbashi.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
conduct a public hearing in late summer on the TWA Flight 800
tragedy last July that killed 230 people, National Transportation
Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall told a Senate committee today.
</P>
<P>
The TWA explosion has been the most investigated event of 1996,
Hall told the Senate Transportation Committee. It has kept
investigators on the scene for nine months so far, compared with
the one to three weeks in most airline accidents.
</P>
<P>
Mechanical failure, a bomb or a missile all remain under
investigation as possible causes of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Hall and officials of the Federal Aviation Administration and
the FBI were questioned by the committee about efforts to prevent
crashes and ensure aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
Hall told the committee that while it is apparent that an
explosion occurred in the center fuel tank of the Boeing 747, "the
origin of the explosion is not yet known."
</P>
<P>
"To date, with over 90 percent of the airplane recovered, there
is no physical evidence of a bomb or missile strike," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Dale Watson of the FBI's National Security Division said
his agency was still investigating the possibility of a criminal
act.

LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A man from the Catholic Irish
sector was seriously wounded in a shooting attack near Belfast,
Northern Ireland, early this morning, according to British

</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted by the BBC television as saying

</P>

<P>
BAGHDAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi airliner returned here
this evening after transporting Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi Arabia to
perform hajj, according to the Iraqi news agency.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft with 104 pilgrims on board, which belongs to the
Iraqi Airways, landed at the airport of Jeddah, a western city of
Saudi Arabia, at noon today, breaking a U.N. ban on international
flights from and out of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two Saudi Arabian warplanes intercepted and escorted the Iraqi
aircraft to Jeddah and allowed the passengers to complete
necessary entry formalities for performing hajj.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Minister of Endowments and Religious Affairs
Abdul-Monim Ahmed Saleh told reporters at the Baghdad Airport that
the flight was aimed at transporting aged and ailing Iraqis who
would not be able to make the journey by land to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, this flight has been the very first one by Iraqi
Airlines since the air ban was imposed on Iraq in 1990 following

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Credits for Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
today the approval of credits for a number of Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
A credit of 48 million U.S. dollars equivalent is provided for
the Third Highway Improvement Project in Laos. The project will
finance labor, equipment and consultant services to upgrade road
surfaces, and will provide road maintenance and technical
assistance to the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and
Construction for implementing the project.
</P>
<P>
Two credits totaling 35 million dollars equivalent are
earmarked for projects in the West Bank and Gaza, of which 25
million dollars will be for the West Bank and Gaza housing
project. It will finance a four-year program of policy and
institution building activities. Another 10 million dollar credit
is offered to finance an investment guarantee fund which will
lessen political risks for investors. Additional financing for the
fund will come from other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
A credit of some 1.4 million dollars equivalent will be used
for the Oil Institution Building in Georgia. The project will
finance a feasibility study of a major oil export pipeline from
Baku, Azerbaijan, to Supsa, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Later last week, the World Bank also okayed a 10 million dollar
credit for Kazakstan's real estate registration pilot project. The
project will help finance a real estate registration pilot program
that will design and test models for establishing a unified real
estate registration system. The project will help enhance the
development of land and real estate markets in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the concessionary lending arm of the
World Bank for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Program to Promote Road Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
adopted a program to reduce the risk of road accidents, which have
become one of the main causes of death in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The program, adopted on the initiative of Neil Kinnock, the EU
commissioner for transport, is aimed at addressing the issue of
road accidents between now and the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Some of the measures recommended by the European Commission,
the EU's executive body, are giving drivers correct information on
the safety provided by their vehicles, developing computer tools
to manage traffic better and reducing the risk of accidents due to
consumption of alcohol, drugs or medicines.
</P>
<P>
Some 45,000 people in the EU are killed each year on the roads,
said Kinnock, adding that the "dramatic human and social
consequences of this scourge" are compounded by a heavy economic
burden for society, estimated at around 1 million ECUs (about 1.3
million U.S. dollars) for each person killed.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the EU member states and other related
decision makers to take a "systematic" look at the cost when
deciding whether or not to invest in or take regulatory measures
in favor of road safety.

ADDIS ABABA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian police said
today the first half of this Ethiopian year, from September 11,
1996 to March 9, 1997, had seen an unprecedented increase in rape
in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The police were quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying
that "922 women and under-aged children in various regions and 68
others in Addis Ababa were raped over the last six months alone."

<P>
The police disclosed that the majority of the victims are aged
between 16 and 18, some from 19 to 30 and others are below the
age of 15.
</P>
<P>
The crime is committed either individually by persons often
between the age of 19 and 30 or in a group, the police noted.
</P>
<P>
During the last Ethiopian year, 1,067 women and under-aged
children throughout the country were raped, according to the

<HEADLINE> Private Investment, Decisive for Environment: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The private sector is now a
decisive factor in environmental protection and its scale will
increase rapidly in coming years, according to a paper released at
a United Nations Development Program press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 300-600 billion dollars will be spent
globally by the year 2000 on pollution-control goods and services,
rivaling investment in the pharmaceutical industry, said the
paper, prepared by Bradford S. Gentry, director of the research on
private finance and the environment at the Yale Center for
Environmental Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
A substantial part of the 1 trillion dollars needed for new
power-generation capacity in developing countries and economies in
transition between 1993 and 2000 will be directed to renewable
energy projects. An additional 250 billion is expected to be
absorbed by energy efficiency projects over the next 20 years, the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the bulk of environmental investment remains within
the industrialized countries, it is in the developing countries
and the economies in transition that the highest up-side potential
exists, the paper read.
</P>
<P>
The paper suggested that a framework for encouraging
environmental investment be established in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Given the scale of their environmental needs and the distinct
improbability of any substantial increase in public-sector aid
flows, governments in developing and transition countries are
looking to private capital as the primary instrument for financing
environmentally sustainable development, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Overall flows of private capital to developing and transition
countries between 1989 and 1994 quadrupled, reaching a level three
times greater than official development assistance, the paper
noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper also showed that the environmental sound projects are
commercially attractive. "These studies demonstrate the simple
equation: investment plus environment equals profit," said James
Gustave Speth, administrator of the UNDP.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Decide Fate of UNIDO Membership in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany plans to decide whether to
stay in or quit the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) during the course of this year, the German
Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Development said
today.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by the ministry's state secretary Wighard
Haerdtl during talks with visiting UNIDO general director Mauricio
de Maria y Campos.
</P>
<P>
Campos meanwhile warned that the existence of the UNIDO would
be threatened if Germany did withdraw.
</P>
<P>
With an annual contribution of 17 million German marks, or
about 10 million U.S. dollars, Germany is currently the second
largest contributor to the UNIDO after Japan.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada have both left the UNIDO. Britain
and Australia have said they will follow suit at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the UNIDO of failing to carry out needed reforms,
German Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger last year also
urged Bonn to quit the organization. But that call met opposition
from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, thus delaying a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1967, the Vienna-based UNIDO has a mandate to foster
industrial development in developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere today underscored the sustenance of
public institutions, saying that they still have a big role in
contributing to economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his home at Butiama, Mara Region in
northwestern Tanzania, the former president said the institutions
stand a chance to promoting the economy if they are given a fair
ground to operate on.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who granted an interview to reporters as part of the
festivities to commemorate his 75th birthday next Sunday, said
some institutions and parastatals had failed because most of them
were directed to implement some projects which were unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the free market economic policy in the country,
saying it is bound to strengthen the economy but cautioned that
the system should not be wrongly implemented to create rifts in
the society.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who stepped down from presidency in 1985, was
committed to a centralized economy during his tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
His successor, Ali Hassan Mwinyi and present President
Benjamin Mkapa, embarked on a liberalized economy, encouraging
private enterprises and privatization of ailing public
corporations which are a burden to the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Urges British Voters Not to Vote Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
said in Dublin today that a vote for Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), in Britain's coming general
election, would be a vote of political support for IRA "killings
and murder."
</P>
<P>
Bruton told a press conference after a meeting with Northern
Ireland peace broker John Hume that he had "lost patience" with
Sinn Fein for its failure to force the IRA to secure a new
cease-fire in their fight against British rule in Northern
Ireland, reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
"A vote for Sinn Fein is a vote of political support for the
IRA and the IRA's campaign of killings and murder," he said. "All
that killing does is make the problems worse."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, a political party in Northern Ireland, is contesting
several Northern Irish seats in the British election due to be
held on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein sources reportedly indicated that it may finally
secure three parliamentary seats but will not occupy places in the
British parliament because that would entail allegiance to
London's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Irish and British governments have refused talks with Sinn
Fein since the IRA ended a 17-month cease-fire with a major bomb
attack in central London last February.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Minister
Phillemon Malima has accused the South African company Executive
Outcomes of recruiting Namibians to undergo training in Sierra
Leone in order to destabilize Namibia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the South African Press Association
today, Malima told the National Assembly on Tuesday that former
leader of the South African police counter-insurgency unit
Koevoet General Hans Dreyer, persona non grata in Namibia, was
conducting the training activities from Angola.
</P>
<P>
Malima claimed that he had documentary proof that members of
South Africa's former South West Africa Territory Force (SWATF)
and Koevoet, presently in Angola, were preparing to destabilize
Namibia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to sound a stern warning that should such an attempt
by these elements to destabilize the country prove to be true,
the country's security institutions, defense force included, will
act to protect and defend the prevailing peace, stability and
democracy," he warned.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Namibian President Sam Nujoma on April 3, a
group of former SWATF and Koevoet members threatened "suicide
attacks" or "bombs" within 10 days if their pensions were not
paid.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government rejected the threats and ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
"We reject this ultimatum, and we do not accept threats,"
Prime Minister Hage geingob told the National Assembly on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Confiscate Crayfish After Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- About five tons of rock
lobsters taken from the beach at Elands Bay in Western Cape
Province have been confiscated by the police who set up road
blocks in the area, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 tons of crayfish "walked out" of the sea onto
the Cape West Coast beaches at the weekend to escape the toxic
red tide which depletes oxygen levels in the waters.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people descended on the beaches to collect the
crayfish, using refuse bags, empty milk carton containers and
laundry baskets, despite not having permits to do so.
</P>
<P>
They seemed oblivious to the fact that only four crayfish per
person may be taken from the sea.
</P>
<P>
The crayfish confiscated in the road blocks would be taken to
fish factories under the control of the Sea Fisheries
Directorate, but those alive would be relocated to the ocean,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
The weekend walk-out was the second time in the past two weeks
that huge numbers of crayfish crawled in from the sea. About 60
tons of crayfish crawled onto the beaches in the areas shortly
before Easter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn warned on Tuesday
that people collecting crayfish without a permit or those caught
in possession of more than four crayfish would be prosecuted,
irrespective of whether the crayfish were dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
However, the Environmental Affairs and Tourism Ministry said
earlier that it would consider allowing people without permits to
collect the delicacy which had washed up on the beach.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the current legislation prohibited people
without permits from catching crayfish from the ocean, not from
collecting washed-up crayfish.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the region have reportedly requested permission
to sell the crayfish, said the source.
</P>
<P>
A police source said they just confiscated the crayfish, but
did not arrest those who were caught in the road blocks. But a
number of people selling the crayfish in surrounding towns had
been arrested and would be prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: What Will Strong Pound Bring About to UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy is continuing to
grow at a steady pace, with 0.8% expansion in the first quarter of
this year, leaving GDP 2.6 % higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But the contradiction between consumers and industry remains
wide and could widen further this year under the influence of the
strong pound.
</P>
<P>
The pound gained almost 4 pfennigs against the German deutsche
mark early this week. It closed at D-mark 2.7884 in London market
on Monday, above its old European exchange rate mechanism(ERM)
floor of D-mark 2.7780, a rise of 3.94 pfennigs on the day.
</P>
<P>
That is pound's highest level since its membership of the ERM
was suspended on September 16, 1992, when Britain was unable to
defend the pound against currency speculation in foreign currency
exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
Since pound's rapid rise began in August last year, it has
gained more than 15 % against the currencies of its main trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
While the appreciation of pound will have an adverse impact on
economic activity this year, the beneficial effects on inflation
are already clear.
</P>
<P>
Raw material costs from abroad are dropping sharply, while core
factory gate inflation is at a thirty-year low, according to the
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that these favorable development will
allow goods inflation to fall sharply, even if stronger consumer
activity enables retailers to widen margins aggressively.
</P>
<P>
They expect that this should easily outweigh any further rise
in services inflation and allow underlying inflation to fall to
2.25% by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, a worsening trade deficit with non-European countries
in the first two months provided the warning sign that pound's
strength might start to have a negative impact on trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures by the Office for National
Statistics, the non-EU deficit rose to 554 million pounds (886
million US dollars) in February from 339 million pounds (542
million US dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
One among the hardest hit is Britain's manufacturing export. It
is now at the lowest level since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly trends survey, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) says that pound's continued strength has
led to export demand for UK manufactured goods reaching its lowest
level since November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,000 firms in 50 industries, consider
their export books below normal. Only 17% say their export books
are above normal.
</P>
<P>
The growing impact of the strong pound on Britain's export was
also highlighted by the poor performance of the engineering
sector.
</P>
<P>
Graham Mackenzie, chairman of the Engineering Employer's
Federation (EEF), recently said: "The strength of the pound has
caused a marked deterioration over the last quarter."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the pound-dollar relationship is about right at the
moment, but there is cause for concern in sterling's value against
the deutsche mark," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brian Clayton, chairman of the UK Steel Association agrees: "We
are less competitive with the mark at current levels."
</P>
<P>
He said: "In the steel industry we are concerned that if
interest rates go up after an election, the pound will strengthen
still further and the situation will get worse."
</P>
<P>
It is understood that over 70% of the sales revenue of
Britain's steel industry is linked to the deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact on Britain's economic activities of the
continuing strength of the pound reflects the hardening
consensus that exchange rates will need to rise steeply after the
election, no matter who wins the election.

ATHENS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The striking construction workers in
Greece clashed with police here today, leaving one policeman
slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The construction workers today staged a 24-hour strike,

for industrial development.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Tells Member States to Reduce Tariffs by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) today
urged its members to immediately reduce their tariffs by 80
percent in accordance with the agreed time-table.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers said in a report adopted here that
all member countries except Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia should
have reduced their tariffs by 80 percent by October last year.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho and Swaziland have been exempted because they have a
derogation until September this year while Namibia has until
January next year to publish the COMESA tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has also requested to be exempted from publishing
COMESA tariffs for five years on the ground that war and economic
sanctions imposed against it have seriously affected its economy.
</P>
<P>
So far Comoros, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe have reduced their
tariffs by 80 percent while Kenya, Malawi and Mauritius are
currently going to realize the 80 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the member countries have reduced their tariffs by
60 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA aims to eliminate non-tariff barriers and achieve
zero tariff in COMESA by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Settlements Bank is Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An International Bank for
Environmental Settlements, a new global institution for pollution
control and sustainable development, will help redress
environmental imbalances of the past 50 years, according to a
paper released at a UNDP press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to develop innovative financial institutions and
instruments to obtain market value from environmental resources
without destroying them, reads the paper prepared by Graciela
Chichilnisky, Chairperson of Mathematics and Economics of UNESCO
and Director of Program on Information and Resources at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that a system of national accounts introduced
since World War II has supported the activities of the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund and the GATT, which have led the
world economy into an unprecedented period of industrialization,
material expansion and global commerce.
</P>
<P>
But as the century turns, industrial society's voracious use of
the earth's resources has reached its logical limits and the
massive infrastructure that supports the survival of human species
is under threat, the paper warns.
</P>
<P>
The new global financial institution is designed to be
sensitive where the World Bank, the IMF and WTO fall short, the
paper notes.
</P>
<P>
The International Bank of Environmental Settlements proposed in
the paper is fundamentally different from a standard financial
market and will have a much larger role than a stock market.
</P>
<P>
The principles discussed in the paper will apply to the use of
all environmental assets, such as biodiversity, soil and forests.
</P>
<P>
Emissions trading, the global reinsurance of environmental
risks, and the securitization of the earth's biodiversity
resources are natural financial instruments that merge the
interest of private financial markets with international
development policy, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher Boosts Conservatives by Attacking Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
Margaret Thatcher today openly attacked opposition Labor leader
Tony Blair for trying to take over her policies.
</P>
<P>
To boost Prime Minister John Major's election campaign,
Thatcher for the first time appeared on the road in the campaign
for a May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
When asked if people were wrong to believe that Blair rather
than Conservative Prime Minister John Major was her ideological
heir apparent, Thatcher gave a negative answer.
</P>
<P>
"They have got the sex wrong. I think they have got the
willpower wrong. I think they have got the reasoning wrong. I
think they have got the strength wrong," Thatcher told reporters
on the stump at a football ground in Aldershot southwest of
London.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, Britain's famous "Iron Lady", stepped down in 1990
after 11 years in Downing Street to be succeeded by Major. She has
become Britain's longest-serving prime minister of this century
and had high reputation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that local media has often suggested Thatcher
admires Blair's leadership style, the former prime minister said
Blair would hand back powers to the trade unions and to
bureaucrats of the European Union if he were to win.
</P>
<P>
"He is trying to take over my policies in part. It's a kind of
conversion of convenience. I had to make the revolution happen by
changing everything I found in Britain," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party is lagging behind the Labor by more than
20 percentage points in national opinion polls, and Major is
tipped to lose the election.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's intervention to support Major in the campaign was
immediately welcomed by the Conservatives which definitly needs
her support.
</P>
<P>
"She is an incredibly good campaigner. She was a superb prime
minister and she's doing her bit, which is incredibly valuable," a
Conservative spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Thatcher has often damned Major with faint praise
although he was her hand-picked successor.
</P>
<P>
But an aide of Thatcher said she planned about nine trips on
the trail this month to show her full support for the Conservative
party.

future for cooperation is good.
</P>
<P>
China and Syria have similar views on major international
issues and support each other in international affairs, he said,
and that with the new situation of multipolarization, friendly
Sino-Syrian relations will increase, based on mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said that China, as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, always support the rights and interests of
developing countries, which is significant for increasing
multipolarization in the world.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Premier Li on the Mideast situation, and Li said
that the Chinese government and people are concerned about the
Mideast situation and firmly support the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said that Syria and China have a long history of
friendly relations and that Syria hopes to increase ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed cordial greetings from Syria's Prime Minister
Mahmoud Zouebi to Premier Li, who asked Khaddam to extend his

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Liberal Party still
enjoys a strong popularity as the clock ticks down to an election
call, a new poll has found.
</P>
<P>
On a national basis, the ruling Liberal Party has the support
of 47 percent of decided voters, according to a new
Globe-Environics poll.
</P>
<P>
The Liberals are followed by the Progressive Conservative Party
at 16 percent; the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Bloc Quebecois
and the Reform Party at 12 percent each; and others at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The support levels reflect a recalculation of results after the
removal of the 27 percent who said they were undecided, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party appears likely to be re-elected with a
majority, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to computer-assisted predictions prepared for the
paper, the Liberals could take a high of 222 seats to a low of 178
in the 301-seat House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Bloc Quebecois would get 50 to 62 seats,
the Reform five to 50, the Progressive Conservative seven to 14
and the NDP nine or 10.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,961 eligible voters, conducted between March 11
and 31, has a margin error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points,
19 times out of 20.

OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's leading exchange in
Toronto is set to officially close its trading floor on April 23
to move to an entirely computerized system.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Security Exchange (TSE) will move the remaining 236
stocks of the 1,452 total onto its computer system, known as the
Computer Assisted Trading System (CATS) on April 14.
</P>

A floor-closing ceremony is planned for April 23, when the
transfer will be complete, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The TSE originally planned to close the trading floor on April
16.
</P>
<P>
It held off moving the final stocks to give it more time to
check the computer system last week, when the system was brought
to a halt by heavy trading of Bre-X stocks.
</P>
<P>
The exchange said it is now confident the CATS is ready to take

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of the Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said today that all
countries, whether developed or developing, should break regional
boundaries and participate in global economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the closing session of the Thirty-Second World
Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce, Wu said that it
is only this that can help countries from different regions make
better use of advanced scientific and technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
The minister praised the efforts of many countries in regional
economic cooperation in the form of open markets and free trade
because they have promoted the development of regional economy and
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the efforts have also resulted in some new
barriers, because regional groups have tried to adopt favorable
policies for member countries and to protect regional interests,
and new confrontations have appeared between member countries and
non-member countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it is important that these regional
groups open up and adopt an opening regionalism. APEC is different
from traditional regional economic groups and has a characteristic
of opening regionalism, she pointed out, emphasizing that all
achievements in free trade and investment of APEC have been shared
by other non-member countries.

<HEADLINE> Reima Tutta Looking at China's Children's Clothing Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Reima Tutta, the
largest producer of children's clothing in northern Europe, will
begin to market its collection in China this year.
</P>
<P>
The company has 50 years of experience in the children's
clothing business and has more than 20 outlets worldwide. It
mostly produces knitwear and outdoor clothing for children,
accounting for 75 percent of its business.
</P>
<P>
Although its sales inside China have not begun, it spent 4.5
million US dollars setting up two clothing factories, in Deqing
County in east China's Zhejiang Province and Beijing. They account
for as much as 35 percent of its sales worldwide, by exporting to
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Deqing factory, which is a joint venture, can produce four
million pieces of knitwear for children annually, and the Beijing
factory, which is wholly-owned by Reima Tutta, produces 300,000
pieces of outdoor wear a year.
</P>
<P>
With their growing production capacity, the factories are
expected to provide children's collection for China's market in
addition to meeting American and European market demand.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase sales in China, Reima Tutta plans to set
up 30 small shops in shopping malls in the country's 10 biggest
cities in the first year, and open boutiques in big and
medium-sized cities in the second year, bringing the number of
outlets in the country eventually to more than 50.
</P>
<P>
China's great potential in the clothing market, its abundant
but cheap raw materials and labor, and its good relations with
Finland have encouraged Reima Tutta to increase its business
here.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China Aerospace Corporation
(CASC) and the U.S.-based Digital Equipment Corporation have
planned to build a joint venture in China to develop, manufacture
and distribute network computers.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding, Digital will
provide engineering and design resources for the venture while
CASC rendering manufacturing expertise, distribution capabilities,
 and application development for the market.
</P>
<P>
The total investment, to be shared equally by the two
companies, may reach 40 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
They expected to make first shipments by the end of 1997, with
plans to produce some 150,000 units by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Digital brings to the venture not only its industry-leading
StrongARM microprocessor, but the ability to help leverage the
output of the venture through its broad product and service
capabilities, including high-performance servers and systems
integration expertise, said Bobby Choonavala, president of Digital
 Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Hailing CASC as "an ideal partner for us in China," he
said: "CASC brings to the venture a wealth of manufacturing
expertise in personal computers, electronics and communication
devices as well as established distribution channels."
</P>

CASC, which exclusively deals with satellites and other space
products in China, have joined hands with Digital since 1994 in
distributing Digital workstations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Looking for New Overseas Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A breakthrough is needed to put
more overseas funds into cash-strapped state-owned enterprises, Yi
Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade Commission, said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseas listings, introducing international
investment fund into China's stock market is another way worth
considering, he told an international symposium on overseas
fund-raising today.
</P>
<P>
"As a center of China's financial institutions and home to more
than 200 foreign representative offices and 11 overseas bank
branches, Beijing will prove to be an ideal site for overseas
investors," Yi noted.
</P>
<P>
The capital city had approved 12,789 overseas-funded ventures
by the end of March, involving 10.6 billion US dollars in foreign
capital.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Production Down in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's output of
manufactured products declined by 5.5 percent in February this
year, compared to a year ago as the majority of industries
produced less, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, cumulative output of the first two months of 1997
was 6.3 percent below what was achieved in the same period of
1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that some major segments of the key electronics
industry remained depressed, with overall output falling by 7.8
percent as the output from the semiconductors and consumer
electronics segments decreased.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that output of disk drives and
telecommunication equipment continued to grow, cumulative output
of the electronics industry for the first two months of this year
was 9.6 percent lower than that in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the electronics industry affected the output in
the fabricated metal products and plastic products industries, the
EDB said. Declines of 8.3 percent and 12.2 percent were recorded
respectively in the two industries and the total output for the
first two months shrank by 7.4 percent and 18.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The output of petroleum products fell by 11.9 percent as
refiners were hit by poor margins caused by slackened demand after
winter. Cumulative output for the first two months was reduced by
7.2 percent compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The transport equipment industry declined by 11.2 percent as
output from the marine segment remained depressed with shipyards
engaged in small value repair jobs, while the output of machinery
dropped by 12.4 percent with a decrease in the output of
refrigerating equipment, dies and moulds and specialized
machinery, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Threatens to Reoccupy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today said Israel will have no problem in
reoccupying Hebron and other Palestinian cities in the West Bank,
reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks when he was speaking to reporters.
But he added that this is not desirable.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Israel wants to know whether the
Palestinians would stand by the agreements they signed. Under
the agreements, he noted, there is security cooperation in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is the second government minister who has made
belligerent statements against the Palestinians in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi warned that should the
September bloody incident reoccur, that would mean an all-round
war between Israel and Palestine and (Palestinian leader Yasser)
Arafat will have to go in exile again.
</P>
<P>
Israel opened a tunnel last September near the holy site of the
Al Aqsa Mosque of the Old City in Jerusalem, which resulted in
great anger from the Palestinians and the later
Israeli-Palestinian violence killing seven people and wounding
more than 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in Gaza, reacted cooly to Mordechai's threats, saying
that the Israeli minister's statement is unnecessary and it only
added tension between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan said that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and police
could easily enter Palestinian cities, but there was no
guarantee that they could easily get out.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan declared that the security coordination between the
two sides will not resume until all agreements are implemented
in spite of the meeting between chief of Israel General Security
Service Ami Ayalon, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials
and Arafat in Gaza Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians will wait for the outcome of the
meetings between senior Palestinian and U.S. officials in
Washington in order to determine future security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, member of the Executive Committee of the PLO, and
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, flew to Washington
Wednesday night for talks with U.S. officials following the
summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu there.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has reportedly expressed willingness to meet with
Palestinian representatives. Abu Mazen and Saeb Erekat will be
joined by Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian minister of Higher
Education and former spokeswoman for the Palestinian peace
delegation who arrived in Washington last week.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Mayor Says Shanghai, Hong Kong Economies Complementary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Qizheng, the Vice-mayor of
Shanghai told delegates to the 32nd World Congress of the
International Chamber of Commerce here today that "the two
economies are complementary, not replaceable."
</P>
<P>
"Even though Shanghai intends to turn itself into a financial
center, the functions of the two cities are different," he said,
explaining that Shanghai is more like a retailer while Hong Kong
functions more like a wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five of the world's leading banks have branches in Hong
Kong, while only 47 overseas banks now have branches in Shanghai,
according to Zhao. Geographically, the two cities are "two road
lamps along the Asian economic corridor," and "with a distance of
1,500 kilometers, have different target regions and inland areas
to woo."
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that Shanghai, which is China's major industrial
processing base, can take full advantage of Hong Kong's status as
a free trade port. The two cities already have good economic
relations, he said, and trade between the two last year topped 3.5
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Banker Calls for More Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China will further open its
financial market and increase reforms to use more domestic and
overseas funds to support its economy, Wang Xuebing, president of
the Bank of China, told the 32nd World Congress of the
International Chamber of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
China will work hard to make the renminbi fully convertible by
gradually loosening controls on buying and selling of foreign
exchange in the capital account and opening up its capital market
in a planned way.
</P>
<P>
State commercial banks will also be encouraged to expand
overseas business, as the nation's management of the foreign
exchange market improves and a capital market grows, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Direct fund-raising, or pooling of funds in the capital
market, has massive potential in China, given the fact that market
capitalization of stocks and bonds accounts for only 12 percent
and 11 percent respectively of the nation's GDP," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has great fund potential with a high saving rate, which
have stayed at around 35 percent since the nation adopted its
reform and opening-up policy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the rate has already exceeded 40 percent and the
nation's total savings reached 826.5 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas investment of various kinds will continue to be an
indispensable choice for healthy and rapid growth in China's
economy," Wang noted, citing listing of state-owned enterprises
overseas as an important means of raising foreign capital, while
China is issuing more bonds overseas.
</P>
<P>
There are 26 Chinese state enterprises listed overseas, that
have raised nearly five billion US dollars in foreign capital. By
issuing overseas bonds, China got 4.89 billion US dollars last
year alone, with the total amount since 1991 hitting 27.26 billion
US dollars.

TIRANA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- All the problems resulting from

said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came three days after tough White House talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had achieved no
immediate breakthrough in restarting stalled Mideast peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. role is important and we are still expecting the
American move," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the situation in the region, Moussa said that he does
not see anything optimistic as regards the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am not optimistic about this issue but there is still some
hope and there is a chance for rescuing the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to take "a clear and
correct move" which would lead to salvaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
There was little sign of progress on the diplomatic front to
revive peace moves that came to a halt last month over Netanyahu's
green light for bulldozers to begin work on a Jewish settlement on
the edge of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu has asked the Europeans not to harbor any
unrealistic illusions about their role in the Mideast peace
process on the eve of his visit to the Netherlands, current
European Union (EU) rotating president.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit came at a time when EU officials stepped up
pressure for a greater role of the 15-nation bloc in the Mideast
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
They said the escalating violence in the region would be on the
agenda during Netanyahu's four-day visit to the Netherlands and
Italy.

will try to strengthen cooperation with all countries,

</P>
<P>
Fino made the promise during an interview, carried today, by

</P>
<P>
The prime minister, appointed in mid-March, said economic
cooperation would be the core of its cooperation with any other
country.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Macedonia for allowing the multinational protection
force to traverse its land to reach Albania, and for providing the
troops with logistic supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said Macedonia's proposal for sending medical teams to the
multinational force reflected the country's strong desire for
peace in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of shaky investment schemes, into which thousands
of people put their life savings, sparked widespread unrest in the
Balkan country in January and protests mushroomed across the
country. They quickly erupted into armed conflict across the
country in March.
</P>
<P>
Protesters demanded repayment of their money and the opposition
party called for the resignation of President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Fino, an economist from the opposition Socialist Party, was
invited by the president to form a new government on March 12.
</P>
<P>
This government adopted effective measures to placate the
unrest, and order is being restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
The all-party interim government, transitional in nature, will
come to the end of its mandate by June. A fresh parliamentary
election will produce a new government to run the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa today expressed his country's strong opposition
against an unbalanced peace in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Kuwait for a short visit, Moussa told
reporters that there would be "no unbalanced peace in the Middle
East benefiting one single party." He said that the Middle East
peace process was a comprehensive peace march grouping all Arab
parties.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu to start "final status" talks with the
Palestinians similar to the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Camp David
talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Arab's active diplomacy was aimed at
countering the Israeli-triggered setback in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said "preserving the Middle East peace process was the
responsibility of all."
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts spring from our keenness on solving the crisis
the peace process has come to due to Israel's actions," the
Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hosted a foreign ministerial meeting of the 22-member
Arab League on March 30 when the ministers decided to reactivate
the Arab economic boycott of Israel and stop the normalization
process with the Jewish state in response to the start of
construction of 6,500 new Jewish homes in Israeli-annexed Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also said his Kuwait tour was aimed at discussing ways
to promote bilateral relations and coordination with regard to
vital issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give details as to what specific matters he
would discuss with the Kuwaiti leaders.
</P>

Later today, he is expected to hold talks with Kuwaiti acting

<HEADLINE> Philippine House to Hammer Out Final Stand on Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Jose de
Venecia will preside over a closed-door caucus of congressmen
tonight to hammer out a final stand on individual and corporate
income tax measures.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine News Agency, the caucus will be
multi-party and will be composed of senior House leaders and some
junior congressmen.
</P>
<P>
"After the meeting tonight, we shall have arrived at a
consensus on the ranges of tax exemptions," the speaker stressed.
</P>
<P>
The House has not been able to approve the said last phase of
the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package due to differences on how
much is the best tax relief both for the Filipino laborers and for
the government.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, which was satisfied with the
fast economic growth of the Philippines, has said it would allow
the country to graduate from the organization if it could finish
the last phase of its tax reform by June.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said that despite the fact that the congressmen tend
to give the highest tax exemptions they could give, they would
also consider revenues for the government.
</P>
<P>
The House is battling for a 184,000-peso (7,000 U.S. dollars)
tax relief from the current 56,000 pesos (2,100 U.S. dollars) for
a family of six. However, the Presidential Palace said this is
sacrificing revenues for the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaker De Venecia expressed confidence that before the lower
House resumes regular sessions on April 21, they will have come up
with a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Defends Flight of Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official argued today that
the flight carrying 104 Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi port city of
Jedda Wednesday was a "purely humanitarian and religious one."
</P>
<P>
Nazar Hamdoun, Iraqi permanent representative to the U.N., was
quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that the U.N. Security
Council resolutions make no reference at all of forbidding Iraq to
run overseas flights, so there was no violation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the U.N. Security Council will have regard for the
feelings of Iraqis and Muslims all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun pointed out that Iraq has attempted over the past years
to get the U.N. consent to running flights to carry Iraqi pilgrims
to Saudi Arabia. But the U.N. Sanctions Committee has failed to
approve such flights, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Saudi authorities admitted the Iraqi pilgrims
without any objection to the flight that carried them to Jedda,
adding that the plane already returned to Baghdad, the capital of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi flight carrying pilgrims from Baghdad to Jedda
provoked Wednesday a storm of legal debate at the U.N. Security
council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee will hold today a formal meeting
to discuss the Iraqi flight to Jedda. The meeting will be followed
by a U.N. Security council consultation session on the same
topic.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed trade and air embargo on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today urged Israel to
stop its construction of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem
which was regarded as a provocative action.
</P>
<P>
"We concerned about recent developments in Palestine as a
rising tide of violence there could bring more bloodshed," Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
Alatas called on all parties concerned to pressure Israel into
backing to negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia hoped that Israel could obey by all agreements which
have been signed and not to seek other basis for new agreements,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, who just returned from the ministerial meeting of
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) held in New Delhi, said the NAM
meeting, among others, has called on its members to temporarily
freeze all ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government approved in February the building of
6,500 homes of Jews and more than 3,000 houses for Arabs in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The settlement plan has met with strong protests from many
countries including Indonesia.
</P>

Alatas said the plan will even threat the results of peace
process in the Middle East.

SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second

800 cases concerning foreign nations being reviewed yearly by
China's main commercial arbitration institutions, an arbitration
official said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Dejun, vice-chairman of both the China

<HEADLINE> Social Security System Benefiting Poor Urban Residents (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More than one million needy
residents in Chinese cities have benefited from a new social
security system, a spokesman of the Civil Affairs Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, some 156 cities, or about one-fourth of
the country's total, have introduced the "lowest income level
social security system," which was launched to supplement the
traditional social relief system, step up reforms of state-run
enterprises and improve social stability, said Yang Jianchang,
spokesman of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said those cities provide 200 million yuan (about 24 million
US dollars) each year to help the poor, and more than one million
people had been helped by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Before the implementation of the new system, the country's
social relief was limited to people who did not have a stable
income, were incapable of working or had no legal financial
providers.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, a new poverty-stricken group came to be
formed by the unemployed people and laid-off workers from the
bankrupt enterprises, enterprises with suspended production or
that had reduced operations as well as retirees and the jobless,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are about 13 million needy urban residents
around the country.
</P>
<P>
"The new system is a major reform of the original social
relief system of the poor urban residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the government should provide basic living
expenses for those poor urban residents whose income is below the
lowest set level.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue to
provide technical and other assistance within its means for the
reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Deputy Foreign Minister Leo
Michael Toyad said today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been providing assistance such as training in the
field of finance to Bosnian government officials under the
Malaysian Technical Cooperation Program, he told Parliament,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Local universities and the private sector have also been asked

</P>
<P>
Toyad said last year, the government gave out 12 million U.S.
dollars in assistance for reconstruction projects in Bosnia and of
the amount, 6.2 million dollars was placed under a revolving fund
to promote small and medium industries while the balance was for
education development, housing, communication and transport
projects.
</P>
<P>
"Private companies were interested in the Bosnian
reconstruction program and are currently negotiating with various
parties in that country for cooperation in various fields," he was

weaker today following the release of much weaker-than-expected
jobs figures.
</P>
<P>
The jobs number from the Australian Bureau of Statistics were
interpreted by financial market participants as pushing out the

opportunity for an easing in monetary policy this year.

The Australian dollar ended at 77.88 US cents down from 78.12

China's largest compact vehicle maker last year produced and
sold 72,600 vehicles, claiming 17.7 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The company last year registered a net profit of 218 million
yuan, down 11 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The board of the company attributed the profit decrease to the
auto price cuts spread among Chinese automakers last year.
</P>
<P>
To hone its long-term competitive edge, the company this year
initiated a two-year expansion project which can generate a
capacity of 150,000 Alto-brand compact cars upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the company issued 250 million B shares traded by
overseas investors on the Shenzhen bourse. Half of the shares were
offered for overseas investors at a per-share price of 2.03
yuan. The rest were purchased by three Japanese investors,
including Suzuki Motor Corporation, at the per-share price of 2.96
yuan. The stock issuance raised 585 million yuan for the company.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 300 million yuan has been used
for the construction of an assembly plant and company
operations. The remaining 250 million yuan has been poured in the
Alto project.
</P>
<P>
The board also suggested to divert 7.564 million yuan from its
net profit as dividends for share-holders. The per-share interest
is 0.03 yuan, said the report.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Issues Whip to Defeat UF Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party today
issued a whip to its MPs to defeat the motion of confidence to be
moved by Prime Minister Deve Gowda in the Lower House of
parliament tomorrow, the Congress sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The whip directed all party members to support the stand of the
Congress leadership to withdraw support to the United Front (UF)
government on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The Congress's whip was issued following the failure of two
rounds of talks between the UF and the Congress since last
evening. The congress demand for a Congress-led coalition to be
headed by its president, Sitaram Kesri, to the change of the
United Front leadership in the talks was rejected by UF leaders.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the conclusion of the second round of talks, the
Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body
of the party, and the UF Standing Committee were meeting here to
review the latest situation.
</P>
<P>
The government sources said that some proposals have been given
to the Congress negotiators for consideration by the party and the
UF is expecting a reply from the Congress by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
To a query, Congress negotiator S. Pawar did not rule out the
possibility of a third round of talks between the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary party of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
the biggest opposition party in the country, which met here today,
left it to its leader, A.B. Vajpayee to decide the party's
strategy on the motion of confidence tomorrow since the situation
was fluid.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month old UF government needs the support of 77 members
in the parliament to ensure its survival during the confidence
vote tomorrow.

Khaddam noted that the relevant UN resolutions are the basis
for the realization of peace in the Middle East, and Syria and
Israel should resume their peace talks on the basis of the
progress already achieved through negotiations.

Western countries as an excuse to impose pressure on the
developing countries. He called on the developing countries to
unite in their struggle against such practices.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction at the development of friendly
cooperation between China and Syria, Jiang said that they are both

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua met today
with foreign railways officials who are in Beijing for the 10th
Railway General Directors Council of the Railway Cooperation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Organization was established in 1956 for scientific and
technical cooperation on the Eurasia railway. A council was set up
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, Zou said that developing railway
transportation is an important way to advance the nation's
economy, and that Chinese transportation is developing rapidly,
but that "transporting by rail still constitutes an important part
of China's transportation service."
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation and exchanges between China and the rest
of the world have been increasing since the country initiated its
reform and opening-up policy, Zou said, meaning a greater need for
increased transport capacity. He expressed the hope that friendly
cooperation between Chinese and foreign transport industries can
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Zou also briefed the guests on reforms and construction work in
China's railway transport.

<P>
The system has a wider coverage and is more efficient than
before, said Yang, who added that the financial aid provided to
poor residents, ranging from 70 yuan to 230 yuan a month, is set
by city governments in accordance with the local economic
development and per capital living standard.
</P>
<P>
The program was first launched in the country's largest city of
Shanghai in 1993, and spread to 12 cities by 1995. The 156 cities
where the system was implemented are in 24 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities. Small towns in 56 counties have also
introduced the system.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid establishment of the system shows the great concern
of the local governments," said an official with the Social Relief
Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Tianjin Municipality, Shanxi, Sichuan and
Guizhou provinces, Tibet, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous regions are planning to use the new plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry will work diligently to spread the
system to more cities across China, while trying to further
improve the system during the drafting of the Social Relief Law.
</P>
<P>
China has made great progress in its poverty-relief work in
rural areas during the past two decades, with the number of needy
people in these regions declining by 10 million a year. There are
still 58 million poor rural residents in China.
</P>
<P>
The lowest income social security system for poor rural
residents, launched by the ministry in 1995, has already been
adopted in more than 130 counties.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Won't Be Used to Destabilize W. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The West African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG has vowed not to allow anyone to use the
territory of Liberia as a staging post to destabilize any
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Daily Times today, ECOMOG Force Commander
Major-General Victor Malu was dispelling rumours about
disgruntled Guineans using Liberia as a base for rebel
activities.
</P>
<P>
"No armed group would be allowed to come together with the aim
of attacking another country from Liberia," he said at a meeting
with a delegation of the German Government Technical Cooperation
in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The German organization is to open an office in Liberia soon
to help in the resettlement of the returning Liberian refugees
and reintegration of the former fighters.
</P>
<P>
According to the general, the current deployment of ECOMOG
troops in all the 13 counties in Liberia, which has greatly
enhanced the force's ability to dominate the security situation
in the country, is being done with special attention to most of
the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Malu also appealed to the international community to show more
pity for the misfortune of the teeming ex-combatants in Liberia
by accelerating efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into
the mainstream of the Liberia society.
</P>
<P>
The integration of the more than 30,000 former factional
fighters disarmed would enhance the efforts to achieve a return
of total normalcy to Liberia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The present situation where a substantial number of disarmed
fighters mill around was unhealthy for the country, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general also assured full ECOMOG support to any
organization willing to help Liberians in this regard.

Foreign Secretaries will meet before the SAARC summit in Male next
month but no date has yet been fixed for the meeting, a Foreign

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Ease Fuel Scarcity With Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
ordered the release of federal reserve as part of the interim
measures to alleviate the lingering fuel scarcity that has been
bitting the country harder in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government has also mandated the Military Task Force on
Petroleum Distribution to dispatch soldiers to ensure prompt
distribution of the fuel, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were made at a meeting between the chief of
defense, the petroleum resources minister, top officials of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and managing
directors of refineries, held at the Defense Headquarters here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The need for soldiers to monitor the distribution is to ensure
that the fuel is diverted from depots to filling stations instead
of unknown destinations, the reports said, quoting Director of
Defense Information Colonel Godwin Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
With the meeting, which was convened at the instance of Head
of State General Sani Abacha, the even supply of fuel would be
normalized from today, he added.
</P>
<P>
The current fuel crisis, triggered by the failure in domestic
production, started in Lagos, the nation's economic center, and
neighboring states in the southwest three weeks ago. It spread up
to the north and affected the federal capital of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Lagos have been much limited in their movement
these days and the metropolis has become quite quiet as the
number of vehicles seen in the streets has been reduced greatly.
</P>
<P>
The fuel scarcity has also driven bus fares and food prices
high in cities.
</P>
<P>
Worried by spreading fuel crisis, Abacha called state
administrators and oil industry officials to the capital on Monday
to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the importation of more fuel to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to Petroleum Minister Dan Etete, all vacations and
overseas tours by top officials of the ministry have been
cancelled so that they can come together to fashion a solution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Lagos State Administrator Colonel Mohammed
Marwa said the government would also move to repair the country's
ailing refineries, which are the fundamental reason behind the
outbreak of fuel crisis from time to time in this largest oil
producing country in Africa.

Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone admitted the fall in
employment was regrettable but pointed to a positive outlook for
economic growth and improved prospects for jobs growth.
</P>
<P>
"The economic signs point to a very positive outlook, the
government is confident that as we have also got the lowest
interest rates and home mortgage rates we have had since 1973,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Opposition employment spokesman Martin Ferguson said,
"It was the prime minister who said that 12 months was the point
to measure his performance, now the first year of Howard's prime
ministership had been a disaster for Australians wanting a job."

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Allowed to Collect Crayfish in Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africans have been
allowed today by the Environmental Affairs and Tourism Ministry
to collect crayfish on the beaches of the Cape West Coast in
Western Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
The permit followed a tour to Elands Bay on Wednesday by
Deputy Environment Affairs Minister Peter Mokaba and an African
National Congress Member of Parliament Tony Yengeni, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Mokaba said the public had been allowed to collect crayfish in
bays, not in trucks or vans, for their own consumption, but not
for selling.
</P>
<P>
More than 1200 tons of crayfish "walked out" of the sea onto
the beaches at Elands Bay over the weekend to escape the toxic
red tide which depletes oxygen levels in the waters.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in the past two weeks that a huge number
of crayfish crawled from the sea. About 60 tons of crayfish
"walked" out of the sea onto the beaches in the region shortly
before Easter.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people descended on the beaches to collect the
unexpected delicacy, despite the legal permit that only four
crayfish per person could be taken away.
</P>
<P>
However, the police set the roadblocks in the past few days to
check the traffic coming from the area, confiscating crayfish
caught in the roadblocks, and arrest those who transport and
sell the crayfish illegally.
</P>
<P>
People traveling to the Elands Bay were also warned by the
police that if they aimed to collect crayfish, their vehicles
would be searched when they left the area.

<HEADLINE> Uganda on Alert Against Rinderpest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is to vaccinate its cattle
nationwide to prevent the spread of rinderpest which kills cows and
buffaloes in Kenya and Tanzania now, ''the New Vision'' today quoted
a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kezimbira Muyingo, the State Minister for Agriculture in charge of
Animal Husbandary, told a press conference Tuesday that the disease
could spread into the country if measures were not taken now.
</P>
<P>
He said the vaccination will start from border areas.
Vaccinated animals will be marked to ensure none is missed.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for ristricted movement of cattles from one area
to another to minimise the possibility of the desease-spreading.
</P>
<P>
But he assured there is no clue of the desease in north-eastern
Karamoja region.
</P>
<P>
There were rumours that rinderpest hit the north-east following
the Kenyan border residents pastured their cattles in the north-east
last dry season beginning from last November.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary surveys show there is no clinical signs of the disease,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The disease hit Uganda in 1945, 1906 and 1890. enditem

<HEADLINE> China to Further Reform and Opening-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that China will expand its reform and opening up
and take a still more active part in broadening and deepening
international labor specialization and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the plenary meeting of the 32nd World Congress
of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Li said that
infrastructure construction will still be the focus of China's
reform and opening up as well as the country's use of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had attracted a total of 175 billion
US dollars in foreign funds, with half invested in infrastructure
construction. This field had drawn about 10 percent of the 177
billion US dollar direct investment.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, Li said, China will spend on
infrastructure buildup even more than the 280 billion US dollar
amount mentioned in the World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
Li noted the Chinese government will continue improving its
environment for foreign investment, and that China has achieved
the convertibility of Renminbi yuan under the current account so
as to guarantee the repatriation of the foreign investors' profits.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt measures that are in line with the
international norms to accelerate the building of a legal system
so as to maintain the order of competition in its internal market,
bring the government's actions into full view and upgrade its
decision-making efficiency, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will do more to strengthen its service,
administration and supervision of the foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While making proper use of credit to speed up infrastructure
construction, the vice-premier said, China will increase the
proportion of direct overseas investment, and continue the
experiments in such investment modes as BOT (building, operation
and transfer).
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government will provide foreign investors
with easy access to market information and offer preferential
treatment to foreign-funded enterprises gradually. Moreover, he
added, it will encourage competition, oppose monopoly, and combine
foreign investment, new technology introduction and acceleration
of readjusting China's industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage foreign investment in the comprehensive
agricultural development and resource use, and also high-tech
industries, according to Li. China will also actively attract
foreign investment in the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that China needs the world and the world needs
China, Li said cooperation on the basis of equality results in
mutual profits, whereas friction and confrontation bring losses to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Li pledged China's firm opposition to any conduct which is
unfair, discriminatory to China and has a protectionist nature,
such as anti-dumping and unilateral limitations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he reiterated that China, as always, holds a positive
attitude in the accession to the World Trade Organization, but not
at the cost of making a commitment that is beyond its capability.
</P>
<P>
China is now a developing country, and still will be one by the
year 2010, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi delivered a speech on the globalization
of trade.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the meeting discussed, among others,
China's commercial and investment environment, the solution to
Asia's business disputes and the economic growth of Shanghai and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 32nd World Congress of ICC ended here this
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Resumption of Ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A candidate for Iranian
presidential election has said that resumptions of relations
between Iran and the United States was possible if he won the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, Secretary General of the Islamic
Students Coalition, made the statement in a front-page story
carried today by the official English daily Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by Tabarzadi reflects
the view and desire of the majority of the people, especially the
young people.
</P>
<P>
Iran's presidential election, the 7th one since the founding of
the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, is scheduled to be held on
May 23.
</P>
<P>
Tabarzadi said that Iran can have relations with all
countries that have not declared war against it, even the United
States, in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If we set up a powerful government, we will be able to have
appropriate relations with the United States in line with our
national interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the United States and the Western media
should not be allowed to launch disinformation campaign against
Iran at international arena.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, Iran's relations with certain countries
are not cordial at present and "we should not provide our
enemies with excuses, turning our friends into enemies."
</P>
<P>
In February, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani announced
Iran's policy toward the United States, saying that Iran seeks
no dialogue, no confrontation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties shortly after
Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the two countries have since
then been hostile to each other over almost all issues.
</P>
<P>
The United States pursues a dual-containment policy toward
Iran and Iraq. It has imposed sanction on Iran and even
threatened to launch military strike against Iranian 19 targets,
including "terrorist" training camps and nuclear reactors.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today described the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New Delhi as a success.
</P>
<P>
He said several resolutions were adopted including the ones
calling NAM member countries to freeze diplomatic ties with
Israel, restructuring and reformation in the United Nations (UN)
and South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution calling for freezing ties with Israel is
something which has never been done before by NAM and is an
important step," he said on his return from New Delhi where he
among more than 70 counterparts attended the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
On whether NAM member countries having ties with Tel Aviv would
enforce the resolution as agreed to, he said "they will not
enhance existing ties."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the UN reformation, the minister said many NAM member
countries expressed their interest in the proposal of the UN
General Assembly President Razali Ismail on expanding the
membership of the Security Council and on other related
reformation.
</P>
<P>
Razali, who is a Malaysian, tabled the proposal to increase the
number of permanent and non permanent members at a UN General
Assembly session on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that since NAM member countries wanted the matter
to be discussed first, the decision was made to hold follow-up
discussions during the UN General Assembly in September which will
be attended by NAM foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The NAM meeting has agreed that any decision relating to the
restructuring of the Security Council should not be made at
present. On the other hand, there should be a general agreement
first," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the stalled West Asia peace process following
Israel's move to expand Jewish settlement, Abdullah regretted the
U.S. action in exercising its veto power twice against the
resolution condemning Israel on the matter.

CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait's money supply in its broad term rose
by 81.9 million Kuwaiti Dinars (270 million U.S. dollars) in
January from December of 1996 to reach 7.4127 billion dinars
(24.46 billion dollars), a monthly bulletin by the Central Bank
of Kuwait (CBK) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the increase in money supply was mainly due to the
increase of deposits in local commercial banks which stood at
64.1 million dinars (211.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It said the total deposits at the CBK decreased by 33.7
million dinars (111.2 million dollars) during January to 1.0833
billion dianrs (3.575 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency deposits of local banks also rose by 39
million dinars (128.7 million dollars) in January to 1.4465
billion dinars (4.773 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Finance Ministry is ready to make
sweeping cuts in health care and education spending, in addition
to a 7.2 billion shekels (2.1 billion U.S. dollars) cut in the
country's 1997 budget, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing State Budget Director Ran Kroll indicated before
leaving his post that there is waste in education. The Treasury
said reductions can be made in teachers' non-teaching hours.
</P>
<P>
In the field of health care, the Treasury wants to rethink
the calculations for beds and patients, and is also unhappy with
the extent of various religious subsidies.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Cisco System, the international leader in
Internet networking solutions, will assign its newly opened
research and development center in Netanya, north of Tel Aviv,
with the task of developing the next generation of Internet
technology, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the U.S. San Jose-based company, which
has an annual turnover of more than 4 billion U.S. dollars,
said that Israel has "an excellent pool of people that you can't
find in Silicon Valley" of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of the chip design industry in Israel in
the last few years has proven the commitment of this country to
be a leader rather than a follower in the (information
technologies) market," he said.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Hassan Khalilian, advisor to Iranian Interior
Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati, said here today that taxi fares
will increase by 10 percent from April 21 after a fuel price rise
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that taxi drivers who violate the decision by
charging above 10 percent of the present fares would face fines.
</P>
<P>
Buses, both operating inside and outside cities, would have to
stick to the present fares until the decision goes into effect on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3 million cars and 100,000 taxi cars in the
Iranian capital city of Tehran with a population of about 10
million.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the government has to set the ceiling of
price rise because prices of many products and services have
already increased shortly after the rise of fuel price by a
quarter last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian complains that the taxi fare has actually risen by
20 to 25 percent in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Iran raised the fuel prices by 50 percent last year and 100
percent the previous year. The move triggered some protests and
demonstrations from people who complain a lot about the runaway
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Iran's central bank said the inflation rate stood at 26.1
percent during the first 11 months of the last Iranian calendar
year ending on March 20, 1997. But observers here say that the
inflation is about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's second five-year development plan (1995-1999),
prices of oil products will be increased slightly every year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in oil-rich Iran are still among the lowest in the
world. It costs about four U.S. dollars to fill a car with super
petrol.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou's Changle International Airport to Be Put Into Regular Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Changle International Airport of
Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province, is scheduled to
start regular operations on June 23, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou, which looks to Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, is an
important place for exchange of mail and shipping services across
the straits and has been chosen to pilot direct air and shipping
service between Taiwan and interior areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The city's air service volume has been growing at an annual
rate of 31 percent over past years as the city has seen a rapid
expansion of its export-oriented economy. The existing Yixu
airport, which is used for both military and civilian purposes,
can not meet the new development demands.
</P>
<P>
The building of the Changle airport is not only a strategic
step taken to expand economic development of the southeastern
coastal areas, but also conducive to an accelerated availability
of the exchange of mail service, trade, air and shipping services
across the straits, said Wang Yingquan, general manager of Changle
International Airport Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built airport cost 3.23 billion yuan and began
construction in June of 1994. The airport, with a terminal floor
space of 137,000 sq m, is designed to accommodate large-capacity
passengers planes such as Boeing 747-400s, and handle 6.5 million
passengers and 200,000 tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
Before starting regular service in June, the airport will
conduct trial operations on May 10, according to the general
manager.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, India, Sri Lanka to Form Growth Triangle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, India and Sri Lanka
have agreed in principle to form a new growth triangle of
cooperation to strengthen tripartite links in political, economic
and cultural activities, Thai Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The idea was raised by Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasan
at a meeting with Indian officials in New Delhi where he attended
the non-aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was in line with Thailand's new "looking west"
policy aimed at strengthening ties with countries located to its
west, said Kobsak Chutikul, director general of the Economic
Department.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will seek stronger ties with the other countries
through the proposed triangle, currently known as the IST (India,
Sri Lanka and Thailand), after it is formed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that senior officials from the three
countries will meet within the next three months to discuss
details of a pact to form the growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank is also conducting a study on the
tripartite forum to determine the cooperation areas of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab said that India's "looking east" policy fits perfectly
with Thailand's "looking west" policy.
</P>
<P>
Trade between India and Thailand has grown at an impressive
rate, from 400 million US dollars in 1992 to 915 million US
dollars in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has become the eighth largest investor in India, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka has been limited and
complementary, Kobsak said, adding that about 80 percent of the
bilateral trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka has been related to
gem processing.
</P>
<P>
After the triangle is formed, the three countries would be able
to enhance cooperation in various fields, like fishery,
technology, agriculture, transport, culture and investment, the
official said.

JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Palestinian

against the Israeli troops in Hebron this morning.
</P>
<P>

has erupted since Israel launched construction for the new Jewish
housing project of 6,500 homes in East Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were killed, and more than 100 Palestinians
were wounded in Hebron Tuesday. The clashes, the fiercest since

violence broke out when one of two Israeli religious students
opened fire with his M-16 automatic rifle, killing one
Palestinian and wounding another.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's confrontations followed a funeral of one of the
three Palestinians killed by Israeli troops Tuesday. A total of

Hamas military wing. Others shouted "Revenge." Palestinian
policemen also attended the funeral and fired in the air as
Saed's body covered in a Palestinian national flag, was buried.

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's pioneer in
reform and opening up to the outside world, saw its economy grow
16.4 percent in 1996 than in 1995, with its GDP reaching 95
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city's statistics bureau said that the growth rate was 6.7
percentage points higher than the national average in the year.
</P>
<P>
The high economic speed was achieved despite a deceleration of
its foreign trade business. The city's foreign trade volume grew
only 0.7 percent, while the rate was 20.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The city economy had been galloping at a yearly average of 34
percent since it was granted the status of a special economic zone
in 1980. Booming foreign trade had been an important part of the
city's economic takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the city's quick economic growth has not
been accompanied with a high inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Its retail price index rose 3.9 percent over 1995, 2.2
percentage points lower than the national average.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Small Firms to Produce High-value Added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urges the country's small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to
transform from the typically low-end, low-value intermediate
processors of raw materials to producers of high-value added
products.
</P>
<P>
"This challenge is not beyond our capacity to meet," Ramos said
during the presentation of Bank Excellence Awards of the Guarantee
Fund for SMEs this morning in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said many of the world's leading multinational companies,
including Sony of Japan, Microsoft of the United States and
Samsung of South Korea, started out as SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stressed that 90 percent of the country's enterprises, 40
percent of the manufacturing sector's labor force is employed by
SMEs and 24 percent of the value-added products produced in the
sector is attributable to SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The rising strength of the SME sector validates the economic
gains that his administration has strived for these past few
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The President also called on the Guarantee Fund for SMEs to
pursue a new and larger role -- as advocates of local SMEs and
entrepreneurs, who are potential world-class winners.
</P>
<P>
The Guarantee Fund is a government credit guarantee program
designed to resources cash resources of lending institutions in
support for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Under the fund, stronger entities in the economy, such as banks
in particular, have shared their strength and resources with the
smaller players, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, bank loans to the SMEs with the
support of the fund have increased from 1.5 billion pesos (57
million US dollars) in 1992 to more than 5 billion pesos (190
million US dollars) by the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Asks Europe to Take "Even-Handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has asked the Europeans not to harbor any
unrealistic illusions about their role in the Middle East peace
process on the eve of his visit to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu left Israel late Wednesday night for the Hague of
the Netherlands, current European Union (EU) rotating president,
according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The premier is scheduled to meet today with Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo to
exchange views on the crisis-ridden Middle East peace
process. He will also visit Italy before returning home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit came at a time when EU officials stepped up
pressure for a greater role of the 15-nation bloc in the Mideast
peace-making. They said the escalating violence in the region
would be on the agenda during Netanyahu's visit to the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel appears in no way to be inclined to make such
an offer. In his address to an international mayoral conference
in Jerusalem Wednesday evening, Netanyahu charged that one of
the obstacles in the peace process has been an European bias
toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the EU that it is the United States who should be
the center of facilitating negotiations. He added that any
agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians can only be
signed with the assistance of the U.S. as "a facilitator."
</P>
<P>
"I think (the U.S.) contribution is absolutely crucial," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There are some who think that Europe can play it, (and) some
who think Russia can play it, (but) too many cooks spoil the
broth. The one cook that we need at this stage, and I think
there's an agreement on the Palestinian and Arab side in general
on this, is the United States. So it's necessary, and I think it
might be needed very soon," added Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He has all along strongly criticized the European-brokered Oslo
Accords, saying it was a bad agreement and he would do his best to
offset the bad effects of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians say Netanyahu's proposal to embark on
"express way" in the peace talks is aimed at bypassing the Oslo
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the mayors, including some from Europe, that
although Europe can not play a leading, but can still play an
important role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Europe should do two things. one is, as it
economically committed, to participate in many projects,
especially to help the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On the other, Netanyahu explained that Europe has excellent
relations with Israel and Arab countries and traditionally it
has better relations in some cases with Arab countries than with
the Jewish state. Just because of that, he said, if Europe
introduces what he called "a more balanced approach" to the
question of how to treat the various issues in the peace
process, this will create a more balanced approach in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that "a more even-handed policy" will create
"a more realistic expectations," and thus the gap between the
Israelis and Palestinians will be bridged into a final
settlement.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
expected to dispatch a two-man veterinary delegation in the
middle of next month to inspect all fish processing factories in
Tanzania to evaluate their capacity and hygiene.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Meets Syrian Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen stressed here today that the key to the
resolution of the Middle East issue lies in the Israeli retreat
from the occupied Arab lands and the resumption of the Palestinian
people's national rights, including the right to set up an
independent Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks during his talks with the First
Vice-President of Syria Abdel Halim Khaddam in the Diaoyutai State
Guest House here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's move to expand the Jewish settlement in
eastern Jerusalem violates relevant resolutions of the United
Nations and is one of the causes of the downturn in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is greatly concerned about this
situation. China believes that the principle of "land for peace"
is a common view reached by all parties of the Middle East and
should be maintained in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The realization of comprehensive and fair peace in the Middle
East conforms with the fundamental interests of the people in the
territory and is beneficial to world peace and development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China supports Syria in its efforts to recover the
Golan Height through political discussion. China believes that
Syria's request to resume peace talks on the basis of the progress
that has been made during Syrian-Israeli talks is reasonable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China wishes that all parties involved in the Middle East issue
will adopt a practical and flexible attitude to resume talks on
the basis of the principle of "land for peace" and relevant UN
resolutions, in order to revitalize the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is ready to join the international community
to contribute to a comprehensive and fair resolution of the Middle
East issue.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam briefed Qian about the current situation in the Middle
East. He said that at present, the peace process has come to a
standstill, posing a threat to peace and stability in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria wishes to continue the peace process in
light of relevant UN resolutions and the principle of "land for
peace." He wishes that China, a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, will play a greater role in promoting peace and
stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The two sides changed views on the friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries.

LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
New Nigerian
</P>
<P>
-- As part of the interim measures to alleviate the fuel
crisis in Nigeria, the government on Wednesday ordered the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to distribute the fuel
from the federal reserve.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times
</P>
<P>
-- Details of a new decree which governed the conduct of the
just-concluded local government elections in Nigeria were
released on Wednesday, giving power to Head of State General Sani
Abacha to sack an elected chairman or dissolve a local government
council.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Taxi Fares in Iran to Increase by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Hassan Khalilian, advisor to
Iranian Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati, said here today
that taxi fares will increase by 10 percent from April 21 after a
fuel price rise last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that taxi drivers who violate the decision by
charging above 10 percent of the present fares would face fines.
</P>
<P>
Buses, both operating inside and outside cities, would have to
stick to the present fares until the decision goes into effect on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3 million cars and 100,000 taxi cars in the
Iranian capital city of Tehran with a population of about 10
million.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the government has to set the ceiling of
price rise because prices of many products and services have
already increased shortly after the rise of fuel price by a
quarter last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian complains that the taxi fare has actually risen by
20 to 25 percent in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Iran raised the fuel prices by 50 percent last year and 100
percent the previous year. The move triggered some protests and
demonstrations from people who complain a lot about the runaway
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Iran's central bank said the inflation rate stood at 26.1
percent during the first 11 months of the last Iranian calendar
year ending on March 20, 1997. But observers here say that the
inflation is about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's second five-year development plan (1995-1999),
prices of oil products will be increased slightly every year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in oil-rich Iran are still among the lowest in the
world. It costs about four U.S. dollars to fill a car with super
petrol.

<HEADLINE> Serial Quakes in Northwest China to Be Deciphered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Seismological Bureau of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region decided to set
up a provisional seismological observatory in Jiashi county, to
better monitor, predict, and study the earthquakes there.
</P>
<P>
Successive earthquakes estimated at over 6.0 on the Richter
scale hit the same county twice over the past 36 years and this
has drawn great attention.
</P>
<P>
This January 21, two quakes at 6.4 and 6.3 took place in Jiashi
county, on March 1, a quake at 6.0, and another two at 6.3 and 6.4
on April 6, struck the county, resulting in heavy losses and
casualties. More than 2,400 after-shocks have occurred since then,
including nine at over 5.0 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Same thing occurred in 1961. A quake at 6.8 hit the county on
April 1, and another two at 6.4 and 6.8 took place in the county
on April 4 and April 14, respectively. After-shocks continued for
20 months.
</P>
<P>
It is rare in seismological history to have so many strong
quakes hitting the same place in such short intervals, said Su
Naiqin, associate research fellow with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The major difference lies in that the quake magnitude of the
1961 series weakened rapidly, while this time there are no obvious
signs for the quakes to decline in terms of magnitude and
after-shocks, Su noted. the epicenter shifted 80 to 90 km westward
this time, and the quake activities have no definite moving
direction.
</P>
<P>
"Most quakes in Xinjiang took place in surface fault zones, but
this time we didn't find evident geological faults," Su Said.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists at home and abroad showed serious concern for the
natural phenomenon of serial quakes, and voiced different
views. But it is still a long way to go before the secret can be
decoded through joint efforts of scientists worldwide, Su said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Syrian Vice-Presidents Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
said here today that it is in the interests of the Chinese and
Syrian people to develop the friendly cooperation between the two
countries in various fields on the basis of equality, mutual
benefit and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Rong made the remark during a meeting with Syrian
Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam, who arrived here Wednesday on
a working visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese
Government.
</P>
<P>
Rong said the exchange of visits between leaders of the two
countries is conducive to their mutual understanding and the
growth of friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Rong described Khaddam, who has been to China a number of
times, as an old friend of the Chinese people. He said Syria is
one of the earliest arab countries to forge diplomatic ties with
China, and in the past four decades and more, their friendly
cooperation has been steadily developing.
</P>
<P>
China cherishes its friendship with Syria and pays great
attention to the development of the bilateral relations, the
Chinese vice-president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Rong thanked Syria for backing China in human rights matters
and holding the "one China" position on the Taiwan issue. The
Chinese people support the Syrian people in their struggle to
maintain national sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said China, a friend of Syria, is playing an important
role in the world. It is important to strengthen the cooperation
and coordination between Syria and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The human rights issue is now used by some western countries as
an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,
Khaddam pointed out, and his country supports China in fighting
against such interference in the name of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Syria stands with China in its efforts for peaceful
reunification of its motherland, Khaddam added.
</P>
<P>
The two vice-presidents also exchanged views on the Middle East
situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The income gap between urban
and rural residents in south China's Guangdong Province has
continued to narrow, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
But urban dwellers' per capita annual income remained 2.35
times that of farmers last year.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that famers scored a 7.6
percent increase in per capita income to hit 3,183.64 yuan last
year, with that of urban residents increasing by two percent to
7,488 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that the income gap between city and
country dwellers was even bigger in 1995, and decreased marginally
a year later.
</P>
<P>
The southern Guangdong Province is the country's economic
powerhouse, and has seen a sustained economic growth in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that farmers have benefitted greatly from a
good harvest and price cuts of fertilizers and other agricultural
materials last year, which directly led to rapid rise in income.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the poor economic performance of some
state-owned enterprises also slowed the growth of income of city
residents.

<HEADLINE> PNA Refuses to Restore Security Cooperation with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has rejected a request to restore security
cooperation with Israel to prevent further Israeli-Palestinian
violence, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The request was raised during a secret meeting Tuesday in
Gaza, which was attended by PNA President Yasser Arafat, Ami
Ayalon, head of the Israeli General Security Service,
representatives of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and
top Palestinian security officials.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security chiefs in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip refused to restore security cooperation with Israel until
political contacts at all levels, including peace talks, were
resumed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following last month's suicide bombing attack in Tel Aviv,
which left three women dead and more than 40 others wounded, Israel
demanded a Palestinian crackdown on terrorism as a condition for
advancing the political process.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli diplomatic source said that there was a
Palestinian effort to calm the situation on the ground, but
security cooperation still remained unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
said that the PNA was not doing enough to fight against terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
"While the Palestinian police were making some efforts to
stop street violence," said Mordechai. "The PNA was not yet
making real effort to halt terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks after a meeting with top Israeli
security officials, including Ayalon and army chief of staff
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, for a review of the situation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister said that it was up to the PNA
leaders to do their best to fight against terrorist activity
before the two sides could start political contacts.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told Israel Radio that the Palestinian violence was
on the increase in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying that the
Israeli army would take whatever measures necessary to protect
and maintain order.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that there was not enough security
cooperation between the Israelis and Palestinians, especially the
cooperation in fighting against terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been increasing in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip after two Jewish settlers Tuesday shot and killed one
Palestinian resident of Hebron and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting incident, there have been serious
clashes Tuesday and Wednesday between Palestinian protesters and
Israeli soldiers in Hebron, during which two more Palestinians
were reportedly killed and more than 100 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Import Cargo Pilferage Rampant at Port Mombasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Importers using the port of
Mombasa are losing goods in an organized import cargo pilferage
racket, according to an East African Standard report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper which staged a six-hour stakeout at the
port last Saturday said that import cargo smugglers can steal any
type of goods from the port sheds.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the most hit are importers of grains,
second-hand clothes, electronic goods among other things which
are stolen openly in the presence of Kenya Ports Authority
security personnel and port police.
</P>
<P>
Reporters of the paper witnessed import cargo stolen, saying
that the smugglers offered money to trailer drivers who allowed
them to load the stolen maize on top of other goods.
</P>
<P>
The trailers were then escorted by armed port police officers
to drive away and discharged the stolen goods outside the port.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mombasa Port Police boss Philip Ndwiga as
confirming that the practice had been rampant at the port.
</P>
<P>
The police boss pointed out that the Port Authority had
mounted a major crackdown on the cargo pilfers since the massive
grain imports as relief food for the victims of the just ended
drought in the country started arriving at the port.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's planned fixed asset
spending for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) totals
1.5 trillion US dollars, China Daily today quotes a senior Chinese
banking official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar at the ongoing 32nd Congress of the
International Chamber of Commerce, held in Shanghai, Wang Xuebing,
chairman and president of the Bank of China, said that most of the
needed funds will be raised in capital markets at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Enormous capital demand mainly comes from the need to sustain
a high rate of economic growth, improve infrastructure, and
rejuvenate the stagnant State sector, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimated that China will need 800 billion US
dollars during the next decade for its infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
If additional 80 billion US dollars is put into China's 1,000
largest State-owned enterprises, their current asset-liability
ratio of 60 percent will drop to the international standard of 45
percent, Wang predicted.
</P>
<P>
China will mainly explore its tremendous home-grown capital
resources derived from personal and public savings, which account
for 50 percent of China's national GDP.
</P>
<P>
The country has already applied 175 billion US dollars in a
wide array of projects over the past 18 years.

<HEADLINE> China Needs More, Better Teachers for Primary, Middle Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, China will need
nearly 10 million teachers with better educational backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) set this goal to be
attained by the end of this century. In a just-issued document, the
SEC said that China is lacking qualified teachers and the
distribution of teachers is not balanced among different areas, as
most teachers prefer cities to villages due to very different
teaching and living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The overall quality of teachers needs further improvement, said
the SEC in the document. According to the SEC, by the year
2000, over 95 percent of primary school teachers should have
received at least secondary school education.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of junior middle school teachers who have received
two-year college education should reach 80 percent, and about 70
percent of senior middle school teachers should receive four-year
college education.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also asked that teachers under age of 45 obtain the
required education diploma. By doing so, younger teachers will be
able to take greater responsibility in teaching.
</P>
<P>
The document further stipulates that the ratio of teachers
below the age of 45 who have senior professional titles should not
be less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official from the SEC said that primary and junior middle
school teachers, rural school teachers, and backbone teachers will
be the focus of China's efforts to build a contingent of qualified
teachers.

information related to infrastructure finance.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Noe Ravalo, chairman of the APEC Financiers' Group, said
in an interview that the information center is vital in locating
investment opportunities elsewhere, particularly in APEC-member
nations.
</P>
<P>
"If you try to set up an internet workbase where all their
information are already available, the answer is just a click
away," Ravalo explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Ravalo, who is also director of the Bankers
Association of the Philippines, there are actually four major
areas tackled during the APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting last
weekend in Cebu City.
</P>
<P>
These include the private sector participation in
infrastructure finance, the freer flow of capital, financial
system in capital market development, and data dissemination.
</P>
<P>
Ravalo pointed out that infrastructure finance, information
center setup, access to equity and the development of bond market
fall under the private sector infrastructure finance which is
currently being given support by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the APEC Financiers' Group was decided
during the 1994 APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in Honolulu which
led to its formation later, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the group serves as an admission advisory body
created to address the needs of the market within the APEC region.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Fans Arrested to Be Released in Dortmund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- All 198 soccer fans arrested in
Dortmund on Wednesday night for minor incidents before and during
the European Cup semi-final match between Manchester United of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Changing Traditional Interment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- These days in Shandong Province,
rural folk are more likely to keep the memories, but not the
ashes, of their recently dead.
</P>
<P>
In Wendeng of the coastal city Weihai, relatives declined to
preserve the ashes of the dead in more than 1,000 cases last year,
28 percent of the total dead, according to officials with the
city's Civil Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
Sun Defan, a farmer in Shaliu Village of Wendeng city, said
that it's better to take good care of the old and make them happy
when they are alive rather than to preserve their ashes after they
pass away.
</P>
<P>
When his parents died years ago, he had their remains cremated
but didn't take the ashes back.
</P>
<P>
More neighbors began to follow his example. Cremation started
in the village in the early 1960s and graves were smoothed into
farmland. Farmers gradually discarded traditional burials of the
dead. Instead they buried the ashes in mountain valleys, under
pine trees or kept them in the village's ashes hall, said Zhang
Baozhen, the elderly civil affairs director of the village.
</P>
<P>
Giving dinners or sending gifts on funeral and death
anniversary occasions became a heavy burden. Most farmers have
willingly abandoned the practice of keeping the ashes of the dead,
Zhang continued.

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The second round of formal

The first round of talks between the UF and the Congress began
here last night in a bid to solve their differences over various

have demanded for transfer of power to a coalition government led

<HEADLINE> TV Program on Hong Kong Basic Law Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A TV series on the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is being shown
on cable television stations nationwide to welcome the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The program was co-produced by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch, the city government of Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong
province, and the Shenzhen Cable Television Station.
</P>
<P>
The 50-part documentary explains the Basic Law in pictures and
simple language.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law was drafted in accordance with the concept of
"one country two systems," set forth by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping. Promulgated in 1990 after four-years of drafting, it
makes clear a series of fundamental principles and policies the
Chinese government will implement in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The producers said that every Chinese should be acquainted
with the Basic Law, which will serve as the constitution of HK
after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law maps out a blueprint of Hong Kong in various
aspects, ranging from politics to society, economy, legal system,
and way of life.
</P>
<P>
The producers added that video tapes and VCDs of the program
will be issued nationwide shortly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bride Waiting 60 years for Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five-year-old Chen Ximei felt
heartbroken while standing on the warship that sank together with
her husband in the Yangtze River during a Japanese bombing attack
in 1938.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, named "Chungshan" after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
forerunner of China's democratic revolution, was lifted out of
water in this January.
</P>
<P>
Chen sent her husband, Lin Yizi, to the cruiser, where he
served, in 1938. It was only 36 days after they got married. The
bride waited for 60 years, cleaning every day a suitcase and a
cabinet the bridegroom left behind, hoping that he would return
one day and see his beloved.
</P>
<P>
But she never knew for sure until this March that her husband
died in the sunken warship on October 24, 1938, in the battle to
guard the city of Wuhan. "I want to see the warship," the old
woman demanded when she was told of the truth.
</P>
<P>
On the Qingming festival, which fell on April 5, a tearful Chen
was brought on the cruiser, holding a grave-marker, a garland, and
offerings. She burned incense to and poured a glass of liquor for
the dead, murmuring long-constrained longings.
</P>
<P>
The faithful bride preserved three of her dresses. "Yizi (the
dead husband) said they suited me best, and I would not put them
on again until he was back."
</P>
<P>
But now she is determined to wear those dresses and go to see
her bridegroom in them.
</P>
<P>
"The martyrs on the cruiser will long live in our memory and we
will never forget the tragic history," said a Hong Kong
compatriot, who accompanied Chen to the warship.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils Rules on Convertible Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has unveiled a set of
provisional rules on the management of convertible bonds, paving
the way for more enterprises to raise funds through floating such
bonds.
</P>
<P>
The rules, approved by the State Council and issued by the
Securities Committee under the State Council, are applicable to
the qualified listed companies and the designated key state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a qualification for issuing convertible bonds, a listed
company must have made a profit in the latest three years and have
an average net asset-profit ratio of above 10 percent during that
period. For those listed firms in the sectors of energy, raw
materials, and infrastructure, the net asset-profit ratio can be
lowered, but to no less than seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The rules also said that the firms' assets-liabilities ratio
must not be higher than 70 percent following a convertible bond
issue and the accumulated outstanding bond volume must not exceed
40 percent of their net asset value.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised through a bond issue must be used in line with
State industrial policies and the bond interest rate must not be
higher than that of the bank deposits of the same maturity, the
rules stipulate.
</P>
<P>
The value of each bond issue can not be less than 100 million
yuan and the bond terms should be no less than three years but no
more than five years, according to the rules.
</P>
<P>
The unlisted key state-owned enterprises must have their
financial books in the last three years audited and must have
clear and practical plans for restructuring and listing before
they are allowed to issue convertible bonds, the rules said,
adding that they must also be guaranteed by solvent guarantors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of China Securities Regulatory Commission said that
at the current stage only a certain number of key state-owned
enterprises will be selected to issue convertible bonds on a trial
basis and no listed companies will be selected.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises will be selected from the 500 designated key
state-owned enterprises that have not been listed and the total
bond issue is planned at four billion yuan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations for a convertible bond issue are accepted
between today and May 10, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Headway in UF-Congress Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The first round of formal talks
between the Congress Party and the United Front (UF) to resolve
the 11-day-old political crisis due to the Congress' withdrawal of
support to the UF on March 30 made no headway here on Wednesday as
both sides stuck to their own stand.
</P>
<P>
While the Congress delegation remained adamant that the Deve
Gowda should give way to a Congress President Sitaram Kesri-led
coalition government, the UF delegation remained resolute that the
issue of the leadership of Mr. Gowda was "not negotiable".
</P>
<P>
The Congress delegation was of the view that it had given 10
months to the UF to rule the country and now it was for the UF to
reciprocate. The UF delegation reportedly told the Congress that
if there was any communication gap, the Front was prepared to
bridge it. The Congress did not favor the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock is likely to continue unless either of the two
sides soften their stands when they meet here today to continue
their formal talks.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after two and a half hour talks Wednesday
evening, one of the Congress negotiator J.Prasada said that "We
will come to an agreement." UF negotiator N. Chandrababu Naidu
also said that "We are hopeful of coming to an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evening's formal talks were preceded by a great deal
of drama. In the morning, the core committee of the UF met at
Prime Minister Deve Gowda's residence on 7, Race Course Road here
and decided to send a formal letter to the Congress to invite its
representatives for a "formal discussion". After the Congress
accepted the invitation, both sides chose their team for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
After addressing a rally at his residence on Wednesday, Gowda
told newsmen that the UF steering committee had agreed to set up a
coordination committee with the Congress and hoped that the
leaders from the two sides would find an amicable solution to end
the impasse. He attributed "lack of communication",
"misunderstanding" and "misgivings" between the UF and the
Congress for the strained relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sitaram Kesri reportedly directed his team
to carry out negotiations with the UF team on the following five
issues: The question of UF leadership, sharing of power, budget
for 1997-98, pending court cases against politicians and others
and the general law and order and communal situation. In the
talks, the UF was reported to have offered the following four
proposals: Gowda be allowed to continue at least till the
Parliament session is over on May 9, the budget be passed in the
interest of the country on April 21, a monitoring committee be
formed to oversee government's functioning and Congress-UF
relations and the Congress will be formally invited to join the
government after the session.
</P>
<P>
No political party got a simple majority in the general
election held on April-May last year and therefore no political
party was capable to form a government at the Center. Among the
543 elected seats in the Lower House of Parliament, the 14-party
UF secured 188 including 11 supporters, while the Congress got 141
seats and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the biggest opposition
in the country, won 193 with its alliance. In order to prevent the
so-called "communal force" of BJP from coming to power, the
Congress, which could not come to power itself, decided to support
the UF and to rule the country from outside. After its withdrawal
of support, President S.D. Sharma asked the UF to show its
majority in the Parliament by April 11.

laboratories with 400,000 researchers, which will turn the hilly
region into a high-technology valley in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are engaged in 20 industries including electronics,
meters, telecommunications, metallurgy, machinery and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The city, with a population of 30 million, was approved last
month as the fourth municipality directly under the central
government after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The central government hopes that the city will solve
resettlement problem caused by the Three Gorges Reservoir on the
Yangtze River, help develop the poorest western regions, and
improve state enterprises and and expand the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the city is planning to improve its
image as a regional industrial center, and develop into an
inland scientific powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chongqing has 27 universities and colleges, and
has been carrying out a program to revive the city by using
science since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's military plants are converting their
technology for civilian purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the Second World War, Chongqing was appointed as the
"interim capital" of China, when a great number of major
enterprises and research institutes were evacuated to the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing to import more foreign expertise before the
year 2000," the spokesman said. The city now has scientific
cooperations with 16 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Rating Downgrade May Cost Thailand More Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will have to
do more in raising investors' confidence after the U.S.-based
Moody's investors service recently downgraded its foreign currency
rating for all bonds and bank deposits of Thailand from A2 to A3.
</P>
<P>
The downgrade by the U.S. credit rating agency apparently will
affect the Thai government's planned issuance of 500 million U.S.
dollar Yankee bonds, which is aimed at testing investors'
confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the timing of Moody's downgrade
could not have been so worse, as it was announced just before Thai
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan was to
sit down with investors to price the Yankee bond issue in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said that the downgrade reflected an incremental
deterioration in Thailand's creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
The rate agency cited four factors contributing to its
downgrade, a buildup of short-term debt, a structural problem in
Thailand's labor-intensive export industries, limitations on the
Thai government macro-economic policies, and the current crisis in
Thailand's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Despite the downgrade, however, Moody's indicated that
Thailand's fundamentals remained strong and foreign direct
investment remained steady due to its favorable geological
location and liberal trade and investment policies.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves (more
than 39 billion dollars) are strong enough to handle external debt
shocks.
</P>
<P>
Moody's downgrade this time seemed having less impact on the
Thai financial sector than that it made last year. The stock
exchange of Thailand (SET) index Wednesday dropped slightly 2.73
points to close at 712.63.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank officials noted that Moody's downgrade
ignored the Thai government's measures and ongoing efforts to
address economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Moody's chose to analyze the economic from a static
perspective, not a dynamic one, they added.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Hails Annan's Call on Halting Cut in U.N. Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia has welcomed United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal to suspend a
planned reduction of the U.N. forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman highly praised Annan's proposal on
Wednesday, noting that the U.N. Protective Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) is needed in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The risks of potential crises and their escalation were still
there in the Balkan region, as demonstrated by the Bosnian war,
the Kosovo issue and the recent unrest in Albania, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to keep the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Macedonia before regional disputes are resolved, the spokesman was
quoted as saying by reports from the country's capital of Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended suspending UNPREDEP's downsizing in a letter
to the president of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments in Albania and the resulting situation of
lawlessness and banditry in certain parts of that country have
demonstrated that stability in the Balkan region remains extremely
fragile," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Although there was "no imminent danger of the problems in
Albania spilling over to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, the current crisis is a source of great anxiety in that
country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Grouping together 500 Nordic troops, 500 U.S. soldiers, 50
Indonesian army engineers, 35 military observers and 26 police
monitors, the UNPREDEP was sent to Macedonia in late 1992 to deter
spread of violence from other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last November renewed the UNPREDEP
mandate for six months until May 31, 1997, but with a phased
reduction of 300 troops to be completed by April 30.
</P>
<P>
The dismantling of the UNPREDEP observation posts along the
borders with Yugoslavia at the end of March had brought criticism
from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, in a letter
then, asked the United Nations to suspend the reduction of the
force after underlining the seriousness of the regional
situation.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party Chief Calls Coalition Unnatural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's major ruling party
chief has described the present ruling coalition as "unnatural"
and predicted it would not last long.
</P>
<P>
The unnatural coalition between the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand's National Democratic Party (RPP) is soon coming to
its end, CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari said Wednesday at a
talk program here.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari, whose party formed a government with the RPP last
month after a former coalition government between the Nepali
Congress (NC) party and the RPP lost a vote of confidence in
parliament, said that the present coalition would fall due to the
RPP's treachery.
</P>
<P>
RPP leader Chand is leading the present government after he
successfully brought down the NC-led government by withdrawing one
RPP faction's support.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party, formed in 1990 after the country abolished the
partyless Panchayat legislature and introduced the multi-party
parliamentary system, mainly comprise former Panchayat
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari also said Wednesday that the CPN-UML and the NC, the
two biggest parties which jointly ushered in the parliamentary
democracy through the 1990 Popular Movement, need urgently to
reach some kind of understanding on the political situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party, with its 19 MPs in the lower house of
parliament, has become a key player on Nepal's political arena as
none the CPN-UML and the NC has majority in the 205-seat house.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Doctors on Strike for Salary Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- About 1,700 doctors attached to
Sri Lanka's government hospitals went on a 24 hour token strike
from 8 a.m. today in protest against the failure of the government
to resolve their salary anomalies problem with the given one month
period.
</P>
<P>
However, the Government Medical Officers Union (GMOA) said they
would maintain emergency services in every hospital and doctors in
hospitals in the North and East where the ethnic war is on will
work as usual, according to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA which struck on March 5 for the same reason called it
off after the government appointed a Cabinet Sub Committee of
three ministers to find a solution to their grievances within a
month.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA had made submissions to the committee which had
presented an agreeable report in time to President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, but the government had neither published the report
nor acted on it as another report had been submitted by a Treasury
official, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the token strike is being staged
because five months of negotiations had been fruitless.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand wants to
ensure its methods of supervising financial institutions pinpoint
problems before they require drastic corrective action.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has formed a special working group to work
out ways to improve its system of checking the business procedures
and transactions of financial institutions, according to Permanent
Secretary M.R. Chatumongol Sonakul.
</P>
<P>
This method is accepted abroad as the best solution, but in
Thailand's case the central bank has never scrutinized financial
institutions' business processes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's financial master plan for 1995-2000 calls for
an improvement in the capital adequacy ratio of financial
institutions, greater provision for doubtful debt, and a more
accurate way of calculating the risk from foreign exchange dealing

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Top Legislator on Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The coming visit by Qiao Shi,
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, to Mongolia is
vitally important in developing friendly relations and cooperation
between the two countries, a Mongolian parliament leader said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first ever by a Chinese NPC leader, is
especially important in expanding ties between the parliaments of
the two countries, Chairman of the Great Hural (parliament)
Radnasumberlyn Gonchigdorzh told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will hold talks on bilateral relations, the
activities of the two legislatures as well as other issues of
common concern during Qiao's visit between April 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorzh said that in recent years, relations between
Mongolia and China have developed smoothly in politics, the
economy, trade, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders of the two countries have exchanged visits
regularly, with mutual understanding and trust deepened and the
legal foundation for bilateral ties strengthened, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the treaty on friendship and cooperation
between Mongolia and China, signed during Chinese Premier Li
Peng's visit in 1994, is of great significance in pushing forward
bilateral ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is Mongolia's firm and unshakable policy to develop with
China good-neighborly relations and cooperation based on equality
and mutual benefit, in the spirit of the treaty and on the basis
of generally-recognized norms governing international relations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that expanding ties with China is one of Mongolia's
priorities, as the two countries share common ground in developing
21st century-oriented bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The eight-volume diary of German
John Rabe, cataloguing Japanese atrocities during the massacre in
Nanjing in World War Two, will be available in Chinese by October.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing People's Printing House has signed a copyright deal
with Germany's Stuttgart Printing House to publish the diaries in
Chinese, Cai Yuhua, director of the Chinese publisher said today.
</P>
<P>
He said his company would have the Chinese version out in six
months, either by commissioning the translation itself, or
reselling the copyright, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
John Rabe's 2400-page diary and photos describe in detail the
horrors committed by Japanese soldiers during their massacre of an
estimated 300,000 Chinese people in Nanjing in 1937.
</P>
<P>
He kept the diaries and took photographs while working in
Nanjing in the 1930s as the chief representative of German
engineering giant Siemens. But they were only made public by his
grand-daughter Ursula Reinhardt in December last year on the 59th
anniversary of the siege of Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Cai and a delegation from the Nanjing People's Printing House
also visited Ursula Reinhardt. She is due to visit Nanjing at the
invitation of Nanjing City Government later this year on the 60th
anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Austria's Federal Chancellor Viktor
Klima was officially elected chairman of the ruling Social
Democratic Party (SPO) at the party's congress today.
</P>
<P>
Klima has been prime minister and acting party chairman since
Franz Vranitzky stepped down in January, after 10 years in the
job, over growing disagreements between his party and its
coalition partner, the Austrian People's Party (OVP).
</P>
<P>
Eight vice chairmen, the presidium and an executive committee
of the party were also elected at the one-day congress, held in
the western city of Linz.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who was finance minister before gaining the top job,
told the congress that full employment was the SPO's top
objective, and said the right to work was every citizen's human
right.
</P>
<P>
On security, the new chairman ruled out the possibility of
Austria joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as the OVP
has demanded. He said that membership of the military alliance
would go against the country's policy of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Klima also assured the meeting his government would not raise
interest rates in the near future, saying they were high enough.
</P>
<P>
The congress, with the slogan "March to the New Century,"
hailed Vranitzky's 10-year contribution to the party with a
standing ovation after he finished his farewell speech.

<HEADLINE> World Forum Discusses Folklore Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A three-day world forum on the
protection of folklore is being held in Phuket, southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
About 120 participants from dozens of countries or regions are
attending the forum, which began on Wednesday and is organized by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO).
</P>
<P>
Forum organizers hope to sort out how governments can agree on
a definition of folklore and folk art and the scope of their
protection.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for countries to reopen negotiations on a
folklore protection agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mihaly Ficsor, assistant director general of the Geneva-based
WIPO, admitted that "it is possible but not easy" to include the
protection of folklore in the existing multilateral agreements of
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world today do not have protection rights
for folklore and folk art, and experts cannot even agree on a
definition of folklore. They have difficulty identifying which
heritage belongs exclusively to which country. This is
particularly the case when it comes to countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mihaly Ficsor agreed that folklore and folk art should be
legally governed by international regulation, in a fashion similar
to other types of intellectual property rights. Otherwise, it
might be distorted by modern technology and commercial use.
</P>
<P>
Prof Kamal Puri of Australia said at the meeting that the
widespread use of aboriginal art for commercial purposes was
exploitation of the native people's heritage. In the case of some
contemporary designs, the exploitation takes place without even
the permission of the original artists.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, aboriginal designs on items such as towels,
T-shirts, shorts, sarongs, table cloths and carpets are easily
available to tourists.
</P>
<P>
Some participants said they hoped that the true purpose should
not be to put a price on the cultural heritage of the world,
rather it should be to ensure that heritage is preserved in its
original form, maintained and passed on to succeeding generations.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Debt Rises Sharply in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Sluggish economic growth pushed up
the foreign debt of the Czech Republic to a total of 20.7 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, up 20 percent against the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, according to latest statistics released by the
Czech State Bank, the central European nation's per capita foreign
debt rose to 2,000 dollars in 1996 from 822 dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Once one of the least indebted nations in the region and entire
Europe, the Czech Republic saw the foreign debt edging dangerously
toward 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It registered a total of 8.5 billion dollars in foreign debt in
1993, and 16.5 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of last year's external debt, considered alarming by
international standards, 11 billion dollars, or a hike by one
third over 1995, were owed to foreign commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Besides slow economic growth, analysts here also blamed a
fiscal deficit, lower foreign reserves and a foreign trade deficit
of about 5.725 billion dollars for the year's debt increase.

<P>
MANAGUA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua will spend 7 million
U.S. dollars provided by Denmark, Germany, Sweden, United States
and the European Union to clear land mines in its border areas, a
Nicaraguan officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Ugarte, chief of the section of military engineers of
the Army Operations and Programs Division, said there are about
90,000 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in Nicaragua, 55,000 of
which on the northern border zone.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad returned here this morning after visits to two
Gulf states and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said at the airport upon his arrival back that he was
happy with the outcome of the visits which succeeded in further
strengthening ties between Malaysia and these countries.
</P>
<P>
"Many matters were discussed and there will be follow-up," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
One of the main purposes of Mahahtir's visits to Kuwait for
three days and to Bahrain for another three days was to enhance
bilateral trade and promote cooperation between Malaysian
entrepreneurs and their counterparts in the two Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
On his one-day working visit to Pakistan, Mahathir said he went
to Pakistan since he was unable to attend the recent meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
He said his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, whom he met
during the visit, was interested in enhancing ties between
Pakistan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said they discussed the possibility of Pakistan
sending officers and politicians to study development in Malaysia.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the Thaicom 3
satellite, originally set for Saturday, has been postponed by a
week, according to Nongluck Pinainitisart, vice-president of
Shinawatra Satellite Plc today.
</P>
<P>
Arianespace of France, the satellite's launcher, has informed
Shinawatra of a week's delay while the adaptor connecting the
satellite and the launcher was being adjusted.
</P>
<P>
The satellite arrived at the launching pad in French Guiana in
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
After the launch, the satellite will go into a controlled orbit
for tests, a process likely to take two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The delay will not have any impact on customers as services
will start in June as scheduled, Nongluck said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talks would continue on avoiding interference with
the footprint of a Russian satellite, said Nongluck.
</P>
<P>
Shinawatra is trying to relocate the transponders of Thaicom 3
which has overlapping footprint as the Russian craft.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Willing to Help Pakistan Increase Exports: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10, (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said his country can help Pakistan increase its
exports and reduce its imports.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Wednesday evening before his
departure to Kuala Lumpur, Mahathir said his country could help
Pakistan boost its exports by processing its food products, which
would earn Pakistan more foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Both sides can also discuss ways as to how Malaysia could be of
help to Pakistan to slash the latter's imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was looking into areas like oil and gas exploration,
building pipelines and power generation, where it could have close
cooperation with Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his hour-long talks with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz
Sharif, Mahathir said their discussion revolved around matters of
development, privatization, downsizing of the Government,
reduction of trade deficit and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
On the trade imbalance which is tilted heavily in favor of
Malaysia, he said his country could identify what it could buy
from Pakistan to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's efforts to become a member of ASEAN, he said, did
figure during his talks with Sharif and his country would support
Pakistan in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: EMU, Single Currency Course Won't Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The timetable for launching
European Monetary Union (EMU) and the single currency remains on
schedule for January 1, 1999, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said today during a 24-hour visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said Germany is working hard to meet the EMU criteria
set out in the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, but he admitted
some problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the postwar record high unemployment of 4.67
million, or 12.2 percent, in February and doubts over the speed at
which the German economy will expand in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty sets out a list of convergence criteria
on budget deficits, debt, inflation, interest rates and exchange
rates, which EU member states must meet before they can join the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
But Germany, one of the main players in the currency, is having
trouble meeting some of the criteria, notably the budget deficit
conditions.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after talks with his Portuguese
counterpart Jaime Gama, Kinkel said EMU will not exist without the
participation of Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that small EU economies like Portugal would be
among the first wave of countries joining the single currency, the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, EU finance ministers and central bankers held an
informal meeting in the Netherlands, agreeing that the decision on
which countries join the single currency would be made in late
April or early May.
</P>
<P>
They also endorsed plans to penalize countries running budget
deficit above the regulated three percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Before March 1, 1998, each EU member state is required to
provide the European Commission with final information on the
country's 1997 budget performance.
</P>
<P>
The Commission and the European Monetary Institute, the
forerunner of the future European Central Bank, will then have
about two weeks to come up with their convergence reports.
</P>
<P>
After the evaluation, there will be a six-week consultation
period with the European Parliament, before a summit of EU leaders
meets to adopt the list of countries due to join the Euro on
January 1, 1999.

JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia believes that there was
no need to worry about the relationship between Indonesia and Hong
Kong after the latter's return to China later this year, an
Indonesian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Deputy Consul General in Hong Kong, Suhadi
Salam, said on Tuesday in Hong Kong that the relations between the
two sides would remain stable after the Hong Kong's handover to
China, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
China and Indonesia have agreed that the Indonesian consulate
general in Hong Kong would remain after the handover on July 1, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Hong Kong and Indonesia has been
increasing, marked by continued visits by Hong Kong businessmen to
the country.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1996, over 260 Hong Kong businessmen visited
Indonesia. Hong Kong has made investment worth 18.567 billion U.S.
dollars in 356 projects in the country since 1967, making it the
third biggest investor in Indonesia after Japan and Britain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, Indonesia will seek new areas of
cooperation with Hong Kong, he said.

SAN JOSE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The governments of five Central
American countries have put forward an initial agenda for the
coming summit between the five countries' presidents and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Costa Rican Foreign Ministry said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was submitted to the U.S. State Department on
Tuesday by the ambassadors of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua in Washington. The details of the proposal
were not made public.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here believed that the agenda would include
a free trade agreement between Central America and the United
States, migration, anti-narcotic cooperation and initiatives for
improving democracy and the environment in the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
Central American foreign ministers met last week with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington for an initial
exchange of points of view about the summit agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Central American countries want to finalize in an agreement
the preferential tariff treatments which would guarantee the

</P>
<P>
They believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement,
signed by the United States, Canada and Mexico in August 1992,
made Mexico attractive to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has enabled Mexico to absorb foreign capitals
which would have otherwise been invested in Central America, they

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Call for Legalizing Drug Use Sparks off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A call made by New Zealand
Associate Treasurer Tuariki Delemere for decriminalizing the use
of cannabis has sparked off a debate between politicians and a
pro-cannabis lobby.
</P>
<P>
Delemere, a member of parliament from the NZ First party, said
it is unfair to stigmatize people for life by convicting them for
cannabis possession.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported that, 6,000 people were convicted for
cannabis-related offenses in NZ last year.
</P>
<P>
The cannabis use is also considered to be a serious problem
among school children, and Delemere's son was convicted recently
for possessing the drug.
</P>
<P>
More seriously, a total of 11 MPs have admitted that they had
smoked Marijuana earlier.
</P>
<P>
The 11 MPs are from all the parties represented in the
120-member parliament except the National Party. Some of them also
favor decriminalizing the drug.
</P>
<P>
Mike Appleby, leader of the Aotearoa Legalize Cannabis Party,
praised Delemere for his "courage, honesty and realism in his
approach to cannabis use."
</P>
<P>
But Labor Party police spokesman George Hawkins said proposals
to legalize cannabis will be greeted with delight by criminals,
and with horror by health groups.
</P>
<P>
Cannabis has already created enough problems for schools and
the health system, and more money should be given to police to
fight the drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Doug Graham has indicated that cannabis users
might be better dealt with by instant fines than convictions,
despite opposition from his colleagues in the Coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
He said he is prepared to look at the issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Delemere's call, Deputy Prime Minister Winston
Peters, who is leader of the NZ First party, said decriminalizing
cannabis is not a priority for his party because it has more
important things to deal with. But he said MPs are welcome to
express their views because debate on the issue was healthy.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger has made it clear that the government
has no intentions of pursuing the problem.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Italian Firm Making Ozone-Safe Compressors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zanussi Elettromeccanic Tianjin
Compressor Co. Ltd, the first firm in China to manufacture
CFC-free refrigerator compressors, will expand its production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The sino-Italian joint venture plans to expand its annual
production capacity to three million compressors including
CFC-free R134a compressors by 2000 from present one million units,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The number of R134a compressors is expected to meet part of the
growing demand in the domestic refrigerator industry, which is
working to phase out CFCs as cooling agents in accordance with
international environment protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
CFC - chlorofluorocarbon - is an ozone-depleting chemical
compound containing freon that is used as a cooling agent.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have banned the use of CFC because freon is
suspected of playing a role in the destruction of the atmosphere's
ozone layer, which protects the environment from direct exposure
to ultraviolet sun rays.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has promised to phase out CFCs by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Domestic refrigerator manufacturers used more than 12 million
compressors in 1996, including more than two million CFC-free
compressors. Now, almost all of the CFC-free compressors are
imported.

<HEADLINE> Reinforced Poverty Relief Drive in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
is trying every means possible this year to solve the food and
clothing problem for another one million poverty-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, 1.22 million people in the
province rose out of poverty last year, and the relief drive has
been reinforced this year by ten major efforts in farmland
construction, pillar industries, local scientific, educational and
health development, and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government appropriated 369 million yuan this
year for the purpose, an increase of 100 million yuan over the
1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Provincial Agricultural Development Bank
provided 480 million in loans, an increase of nearly 200 million
yuan over last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year, there were still
over three million people living below the poverty line in the
province, mainly in arid mountainous areas and in ethnic minority
areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these means of helping the local people, other
effective measures such as providing labor services to other parts
of the country and resettling poverty-stricken people are being
taken. Local officials expect that 1.5 million laborers will be
offered job opportunities outside the province this year.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Consul-General Optimistic About HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Consul-General in
Hong Kong, Hideaki Ueda, said he firmly believes that it is up to
the people of Hong Kong to use their accumulated experience to
achieve the successful implementation of the Basic Law into
meaningful everyday administration.
</P>
<P>
He told the press recently that 1997 marks the end of the 19th
century European colonization of Asia and it is a massively
historic event.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Since Japan has such a big stake in Hong Kong's
future, we are ready to support a Hong Kong governed by Hong Kong
people, an autonomous Hong Kong backed up by the principle of "One
Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
He said Japan was the second biggest exporter to Hong Kong, the
fourth largest recipient of Hong Kong's domestic exports, and the
third largest recipient of its re-exports.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Japanese businesses now operate in Hong Kong, and
787 Japanese firms are currently listed as members of the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight Japanese banks now have offices here, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Japanese relations, Hideaki Ueda said 1997 marks the
25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
He said, "On the whole, we have seen a positive trend of
enhancement of relations between our two nations."
</P>
<P>
He said that since the post-1997 status of the
Consulate-General of Japan in Hong Kong was secured, it will
continue to function after Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that Hong Kong can also play an
important role in furthering Sino-Japanese relations.

<HEADLINE> Amended Criminal Law to Punish Polluters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The newly amended criminal law,
which is scheduled to take effect on October 1, will hold
environmental polluters and those who damage natural environment
and resources responsible for their actions, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Bie Tao, an official with the National Environmental Protection
Agency (Nepa), said implementation of the Criminal Law would help
control the discharge and import of hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
The new Criminal Law, which was amended and passed by the
session of National People's Congress last month, includes a
special article on punishing -- with years of imprisonment and
fines -- those work units and people who import waste for dumping,
storage or disposal.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, nearly 20 cases of importing
hazardous solid wastes from abroad have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries are using developing countries,
including China, as dumping sites for solid waste that is harmful
to the environment and human health, Bie said.
</P>
<P>
With the new Criminal Law, importers of harmful wastes would be
punished for jeopardizing the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
William Ping Chen, who was found guilty of importing 238 tons
of household waste from the US, was sentenced to ten years in
prison and fined 500,000 yuan (60,240 US dollars) for smuggling in
December of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Criminal Law, he would be punished for seriously
jeopardizing the country's environment, according to Bie.
</P>
<P>
The 338th article of the Criminal Law stipulates that the
discharge, dumping and disposal of harmful wastes that are
radioactive or contain infectious elements, pathogens or toxic
substances, and other dangerous wastes that result in serious
damage to public and private property or human health, should be
sentenced to years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Personnel in environmental protection departments who, through
dereliction of duty, allow serious pollution accidents to occur,
can also be put into prison, according to the law.

<HEADLINE> People In Shanghai Buying More Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Branch of PICC Life
has written 500 million yuan worth of policies locally in the
first two months of this year, as the people of Shanghai flock to
insurance companies to look after their social well-being.
</P>
<P>
The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) is the country's
largest insurer and had a monopoly on China's insurance market
before it was split up last year.
</P>
<P>
"More Chinese people are turning to insurance companies, as the
social welfare system under the planned economy disappears and a
new one hasn't yet taken shaped," insurance experts say.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises and government offices in China used to
cover medical bills of their staff, provide them with
housing, and pensions when they retired.
</P>
<P>
"But such privileges are gone, and I have to buy commercial
pension insurance for the years when I cannot work, and it gives
me a sense of safety," explained one middle-aged worker.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, on average about 60,000 to 70,000
people bought life insurance policies from PICC Life's Shanghai
branch in each of the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The figure is about double that of last year, said Zhao
Qinfang, sales manager of the Shanghai Branch. Shanghai people are
riding the crest of a life insurance wave in China's largest
financial and trade city, she said.
</P>
<P>
The company's premium earnings for the first two months of the
year equal about half last year's total, she noted. "Some families
even bought a dozen different policies on their first visit to my
company," she added.
</P>
<P>
China is seen as having a burgeoning insurance market, which is
expected to see sales of from 200 to 250 billion yuan a year by
the year 2000.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences

</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said that CAS, meanwhile, is set to start

"All the institutes should have their fixed position on science
research and technology development," said Lu Yongxiang,
vice-president of CAS, at its annual meeting which closed
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, we will begin to identify 10 to 15 institutes'
research fields. Once their research direction was clarified and
approved, they would have more financial support."
</P>
<P>
Lu said that CAS will deepen its reform to help the academy
become a science research base of world level, an education base
for young scientists and a base of high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
"But some of the institutes dispersed their research force on
research projects out of their essential field and lose the
advantage of the institute," Lu said, "We need to gather our
research force on the research to benefit the nation's social and
economic development."
</P>
<P>
As one way, CAS will try to combine its 120 institutes into 80
institutes.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission has
approved a massive national-level pesticide-free food program on
Chongming Island, China's third largest.
</P>
<P>
A 32,000-hectare production center will be built on the island
in north Shanghai, to produce organic food, which is supposed to
be insecticide-free and good for health, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
The Chongming County government and an agro-business group from
Shanghai will work together to build the island into the nation's
top supplier of eels and crabs, and the biggest organic food
production center in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The production center is a substantial move in the island's
development strategy, and also a prelude to future massive
development," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Chongming island's focus is on economic development for the next
century, after the Pudong New Area in east Shanghai. Its clean
environment and rich farming resources make it an ideal site to

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (13-14) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (13-14)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Do the various departments of the central government
hold any direct authority over related departments of the Hong
Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Since Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy
after 1997 in accordance with the policy of "one country, two
systems," there will be no subordinate relationship between the
various departments of the central authorities and their
counterparts in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Ministry of Public Security will not exercise
any leadership over the police department of the Hong Kong SAR,
nor will the General Administration of Customs have any authority
over the customs of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
No central and local government departments may interfere in
affairs administered by the Hong Kong SAR on its own in accordance
with provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Public servants of the Hong Kong SAR at various levels are
accountable only to the government of the SAR, while the chief
executive is accountable to the central government and the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Nongovernmental organizations in the fields of education,
science and technology, culture and sports and religious
organizations in the Hong Kong SAR and their counterparts in the
mainland will follow the principle of no subordination,
non-interference and mutual respect in the handling of their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Question: Who will give the approval if central government
departments and provinces, autonomous regions and
centrally-administered municipalities want to set up offices in
Hong Kong after 1997? Should such offices abide by laws of the
Hong Kong SAR?
</P>

Answer: The Basic Law stipulates that, if there is a need for
departments of the central government, or for provinces,
autonomous regions and centrally-administered municipalities to
set up offices in the Hong Kong SAR, they must obtain the prior
consent of the government of the Hong Kong SAR and approval of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
That is to say, no departments in the mainland may set up
offices in Hong Kong and send personnel there without the consent
of the Hong Kong SAR government and the approval of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Strict approval procedures are required to send people to Hong
Kong, and the number of such people is limited. All such offices
in Hong Kong and their staff must abide by laws of the Hong Kong
SAR.

<HEADLINE> Dortmund Defeats United 1-0 in Euro Champions Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Borussia Dortmund of Germany
overwhelmed Manchester United of England 1-0 in the first leg
semi-finals of the European Champions Cup soccer tournament in
Dortmunt, Germany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rene Tretschok, Dortmund's second-choice forward, struck a
deflected winner in the 75th minute of the match after teammate
Nicky Butt hit a post.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, which started without goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel, suffered another blow when midfielder Roy Keane picked
up his second booking of the tournament, ruling him out of the
return.
</P>
<P>
The English side, bidding to become the first English club to
reach the European Champions Cup final since Liverpool in 1985,
were forced to call up Dutchman Raimond van der Gouw as a
last-minute replacement for back injury victim Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund commanded the midfield for the first 20 minutes with
Portugal's Paulo Sousa and Andreas Moller orchestrating their
forays into the rivals' territory.
</P>
<P>
The home side, playing in front of more than 48,000
spectators, were mostly kept at bay by an organized Manchester
United defence.
</P>
<P>
Keane earned a booking for a foul on Sousa and things got worse
for Manchester United as Tretschok, almost anonymous until then,
fired in a shot from distance that skewed off Gary Pallister past
Van der Gouw. It was only Tretschok's second goal in 21 European
matches.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund Police reported 73 arrests before the match, of which
38 were English soccer fans.

<HEADLINE> Federal Agencies to Hire Welfare Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Welfare recipients in the
United States will be offered work in federal offices, including
the Office of the President, under plans being drafted by
President Bill Clinton's Cabinet secretaries.
</P>
<P>
The president was expected to summon his Cabinet to the White
House on Thursday to review those plans.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Ann Lewis said Wednesday that the
president's executive office, one of the government's smallest
sectors, with 1,500 employees, would recruit and hire its share
from the welfare rolls as part of Clinton's drive to find jobs for
2 million welfare recipients over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore is overseeing the effort.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease the blow of welfare legislation he signed into
law last year, which imposed a lifetime benefits' limit of five
years for families on welfare, Clinton has pushed the private
sector, nonprofit groups and churches to find room on their
payrolls for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
With 1.9 million people on its payroll and 58,000 hired last
year alone, the federal government is the nation's largest
employer.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio broadcast last month, Clinton gave agencies
30 days to develop recruitment and hiring plans.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Province Vows to Eradicate Poverty in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The underdeveloped province of
Qinghai on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has vowed to eliminate
poverty for 676,600 farmers before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
A local senior official of the provincial government says that
the province plans to launch three major poverty-relief projects
in "a historic leap" of poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai plans to help poor farmers migrate from regions with
harsh natural conditions to the Qaidam Basin, where they can
create an oasis and make a better living.
</P>
<P>
It will spend two billion yuan over the next five years
supporting resettlement of 100,000 farmers, allowing them to
reclaim about 66,000 hectares of land and build seven reservoirs
and other supporting water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
In the southern part of the province, an area frequently hit by
natural disasters, the province will spend 720 million yuan on
building barns and cultivating grassland. Each household is to
have about 20 to 25 hectares of fenced grassland and barns of 60
square meters.
</P>
<P>
For poor people in the arid mountainous areas in the eastern
part of the province, the local government will concentrate
resources on capital construction and infrastructure to allow
residents to earn more from farming. The region's targets are
per-capita grain consumption of 400 kg and a net income of 500
yuan a year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that efforts to eradicate poverty in the past
several years have already paid off, with the number of poor in
the province dropping from 1.19 million in 1993 to 676,000 in
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien today criticized the United States for
failing to pay the debt of more than one billion U.S. dollars to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Press Club, Chretien said, "It's
inappropriate and it's wrong for the one who has the biggest debt
to use it to get its way."
</P>
<P>
He would like the U.N. headquarters, which are in New York, to
move to Montreal if it is agreed to.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big business, the city gets a good return and I would
be happy to take the United Nations in Montreal tomorrow," he told
reporters in laughter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has promised to pay the due to the
U.N. but Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee wants the organization to make reforms in accordance
with "benchmarks" he set for it before the due is paid.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that the U.S. debt to the U.N. has seriously
undermined the organization's peacekeeping capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, who arrived here Monday on his first state visit to
the U.S., is expected to leave tonight.

foreign takeover, but will not be allowed to merge with each

<HEADLINE> Efforts Planned to Promote Race Relation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
expected to make efforts to improve race relations, the White
House said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas being considered are a White House conference
on bigotry and discrimination and a commission to promote national
dialogue on racial concerns.
</P>
<P>
"He is analyzing different options, different scenarios. He's
working on getting it exactly right," said Rahm Emanuel, senior
adviser to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being pushed by civil rights activists who
have urged Clinton to act to stem an increase in hate crimes and
hateful rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
A White House task force is reportedly examining how previous
presidents have dealt with race matters.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton plans to make
"a fairly major address" on race relations as soon as he "has a
more structured sense of how he wants to pursue it."
</P>
<P>
"It's very much on his mind," McCurry said. "He continues to
see evidence of unfinished business when it comes to creating a
society in which Americans appreciate the diversity that is one of
the remarkable features of this country."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Clinton plans to "acknowledge the pain that
has existed in the past because of evidence of prejudice and
hostility towards the races," McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> UN Plans to Evacuate Staff From Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations decided
on Wednesday to begin evacuating U.N. staff from Kinshasa, capital
of Zairea within the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the deterioration of the security situation
there, the U.N. has taken the decision to reduce the size of its
presence there in the city," spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"There is talk that some (private) donor agencies and some
people in the humanitarian community are planning for an
evacuation of the city," he added, but gave no figures on the
size of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after fierce clashes erupted in the
Zairian capital between soldiers and thousands of supporters of
ousted Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers then seized Tshisekedi, who was appointed a week ago,
and drove him off in a vehicle. At the same time, rebels were
reported to have broken past Zairian troops and entered the
country's second-largest city, Lubumbashi.

<HEADLINE> US Republicans Warn of Military Readiness Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (xinhua) -- The Republicans today warned
that the U.S. military is plagued by overworked and undertrained
personnel and would be difficult to carry out another operation
like the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the U.S. military readiness, Republican Floyd
Spence, head of the House National Security Committee, said the
policy of cutting more personnel while committing to more
peacekeeping missions has undermined the military's fighting
abilities.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the U.S. couldn't today do another Gulf War-type
operation with the same efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that years of declining defense budgets, a
smaller force structure...are stretching U.S. military forces to
the breaking point," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The report was concluded after Spence's committee members'
visits to more than 24 U.S. military installations over the past
seven months.

NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street turned
lower today amid mounting concerns about an inflation report to be
out Friday.
</P>
<P>
Like Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average again traded
within a very narrow range until the final hour, but this time
sank to a drop of 45.32 points to 6,563.84, wiping out most of the
prior day's late advance.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 451.49 million shares as
against 448.92 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Other major indexes also turned lower as technology shares,
faltered after having recouped some losses over the past sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 5.52 to 760.60, and
the NYSE composite index fell 2.02 to 400.29.

<P>
The markets have fallen amid fears the economy's vigorous
growth will aggravate inflationary pressures, prompting the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively to slow the
economic pace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Hits New Highs Against yen, mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a new high
against the yen for more than four years and a three-year high
against the mark in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the dollar's fourth straight day of solid gains
propelled by the potentials of rising U.S. interest rates and lack
of central-bank concern over the dollar's strength.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit an intraday high of 126.93 yen, the strongest
since August 1992, before settling at 126.77 yen, up from 126.52
yen Tuesday and up 3.4 percent since last Friday when the rally
began.
</P>
<P>
Against the mark the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7272
marks, the strongest since March 1994, before settling at 1.7245
marks, up from 1.7143 Tuesday and up 2.3 percent since last
Friday. The pound cost 1.6194 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6260 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Without official warnings from Japan over the yen's decline,
traders dollar buying spree started early in Asian dealings.
Comments from senior Japanese monetary aides have suggested they
aren't overly concerned.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday:
1.4780 Swiss francs, up from 1.4735; 5.8020 French francs, up from
5.7660; 1,700.00 Italian lira, up from 1,688.50; 1.3898 Canadian

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves First Guarantee for Private Sector Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of its first guarantee for
private sector project in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
A 31.25 million U.S. dollar guarantee is provided to senior
debt note-holders investing in Bogotana de Aguas y Saneamiento
S.C.A., E.S.P. for a wastewater treatment plant serving the Bogota
area of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee provides a component in the project financing
package that is expected to help make a private placement of debt
securities a success.
</P>
<P>
The plant, whose total cost is some 125 million dollars, is the
first phase of three projects designed to help clean up the Bogota
River which will be owned and operated by Bogotana de Aguas y
Saneamiento (BAS). After completion, it will be able to process
four cubic meters per second of wastewater and remove
sedimentation. Its phase II of the project will further purify the
water through secondary or biological treatment.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's partial political risk guarantee ensures compensation
to certain senior debt note-holders in case of an early termination
of the concession or in case of restrictions on foreign exchange
convertibility.

<HEADLINE> Countries Pledge Better Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for
Nature called here today for greater efforts throughout the world
for a better protection of forests.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the headquarters of the United
Nations, WWF gave out the names of 16 countries who have responded
to WWF's call to halt forest destruction and made a pledge to
conserve their forests. It also called on government
representatives attending the fifth meeting of the Commission on
Sustainable Development (CSD) to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
WWF set a protected areas target -- the establishment of an
ecologically representative network of protected areas covering a
minimum of 10 percent of each forest type. By the year 2000, a
range of socially and ecologically appropriate models should be
demonstrated, said Francis Sullivan, director of WWF Forests for
Life Campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, a minimum of 10 percent of each forest
type should be permanently and properly protected from clearance
and degradation.
</P>
<P>
The 16 countries who have pledged to support WWF's target
include: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Romania
and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Recent research shows that over half of the world's forests
have already disappeared, and that 94 percent of the remaining
forests are unprotected. Forests are now under more acute pressure
than at any other time in history and continue to decline at an
alarming rate. Since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,
the annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon alone has
increased by 34 percent, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, the United National Secretary General, said in a
special message to WWF that a target of placing 10 percent of the
world's forests under some form of legal protection needs to be
seen in a larger context.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses Mobutu to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Reports about U.S. trying to
press Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko to resign and go into
exile was confirmed on Wednesday when the White House believed he
"is not sufficient to lead Zaire into the next chapter of its
history."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post on Wednesday quoted anonymous officials as
saying that the U.S. message of pressing Mobutu to go down has
been conveyed to the Zairian President in recent weeks by various
African leaders including King Hassan of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
At a White House briefing, White House spokesman Mike McCurry
told reporters: "Mobutuism is about to become a creature of
history, because the support for President Mobutu is not
sufficient to lead Zaire into the next chapter of its history."
</P>
<P>
A civil war erupted last October in eastern Zaire which soon
spread westward and rebel forces, led by Laurent Kabila, have now
controlled nearly half of the country. And on Wednesday, they
captured the second largest city of Lubumbashi, the capital of
Shaba Province. Now they are marching towards the capital of
Kinshasa after ceasefire talks between the Zairian government and
the rebels broke down this week.
</P>
<P>
McCurry declined to say whether the United States was actively
involved in finding an exile home for Mobutu, saying: "There has
to be... some arrangements made for a transitional process that
leads to a newly elected government."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said the United States has already made
clear it does not want him here. And the attitudes of France,
Belgium and Switzerland, where Mobutu has many properties and his
bank accounts, remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. analysts suggested a parallel between Mobutu's
quandary and that of the Shah of Iran, who had considerable
difficulty finding a country willing to take him in after he was
toppled in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"It's the story of the Shah all over again," said a source
close to the Mobutu family.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said: "After more than two decades of
counting on Mobutu for the execution of U.S. covert and other
policies in Africa,... the United States began ... to move away
from him. By 1994, all U.S. military and economic assistance was
cut off, and restrictions were placed on visas for him to come
here because of his refusal to cooperate with American efforts to
establish a multiparty democracy in Zaire."

<HEADLINE> Rodionov Favors Russian-Chinese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The increase of cooperation,
including the military, between Russia and China is not directed
against a third country, Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov
stated on Wednesday in an interview with Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Before his visit to China scheduled for 13, April, Rodionov
said that the cooperation between Russia and China should be the
most favorable to the Asia and the Pacific region, and "can serve
as an example and beacon for other countries."
</P>
<P>
He believed that his visit to China must result in strong
impulse to deepen the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the question on military cooperation with China,
Rodionov cited a Russian diplomat as saying that "here flares up
an old love".
</P>
<P>
He said that for recent years Russia and China have signed a
number of important agreements, while military contacts between
the two countries have extended in the fields such as logistic
ensuring, connecxion, civil defense, topograph, military education
and science, medicine, building and billeting armed forces, as
well as space.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov meanwhile noted that the reform of national defense is
one of the urgent tasks in the cooperation between Russia and
China though the two countries are occupied by the serious reform
in other fields.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects of the military cooperation with China the
minister said "I am optimistic enough for it. We have a great
potential of cooperation -- it is the most important -- the desire
to develop and strengthen the contacts in the interests of the two
peoples and two great countries, and for the mutual security.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the problems concerning the Russian military
reform, Rodionov said there should be no doubt of the reform, that
was required by the international and domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
The conception of the military reform has been worked out by
the Defense Ministry, the Headquarters of General Staff and the
Defense Council, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the definitive aim of the Russian military
reform is to enable the defense to have the proper reaction to all
the dangers threatening to Russia's safety, on conditions of
minimum expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The military reform should be conducted together with the
entier reform of the society, including the reform of all
strengthing departments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov told Xinhua that the Russian army is going to be
reduced by 200 thousands this year, but will increase its quality
and equipments.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA Strives for Regional Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Facing fierce competition in the
global economy and global trend of establishment of regional
economic blocs, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) has been promoting inter-regional trade and economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA secretariat in a communique last week disclosed
that internal trade among its members jumped from 834 million
U.S. Dollars in 1985 to 1,700 million Dollars in 1994, and
predicted that the volume of its annual trade will soon reach
4,000 million.
</P>
<P>
The organization was founded in 1994 on the basis of the
Preferential Trade Area for the Eastern and Southern Africa
(PTA),
</P>
<P>
To facilitate intra-COMESA trade, the COMESA has among other
things adopted a program to gradually reduce and eventually
eliminate tariffs and other charges for eligible products traded
among the member countries by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
So far the implementation of the program has been successful
with most of the 20 member countries having reduced their
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Comoros, Uganda and Madagascar have reduced tariffs by 80
percent, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Eritrean and
Tanzania by 70 percent and Zambia, Burundi and Rwanda by 60
percent, while three other countries have been exempted till
1998.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA will also eliminate non-tariff barriers to the
inter-regional trade, simplify and harmonize trade documents and
procedures as well as liberalize and streamline the rules of
origin.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the growth of trade among
COMESA member countries is lack of information about exports and
imports of each country.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the regional organization identifies
and lists products available in each member state for export to
others and disseminates the information to the business
community.
</P>
<P>
After undertaking demand and supply surveys, the COMESA
secretariat, in collaboration with the national chambers of
commerce and industry and national export promotion agencies of
the member countries, organizes meetings between buyers and
sellers for each specific product, and meetings among producers,
exporters and importers of a particular product, thus providing
information about this product and enabling them to make deals.
</P>
<P>
All the buyers and sellers meetings have resulted in doing
business. For example, the meeting held in Harare, Zimbabwe in
1989 generated 70 million U.S. Dollars worth of business.
</P>
<P>
A trade information network has been established since 1987.
It involves the establishment of trade information units, which
are provided with computers free of charge in which trade
information is coordinated at the COMESA secretariat in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the COMESA regularly organizes two kinds of trade
fairs -- general trade fairs and specialized trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
So far five general trade fairs and two specialized trade
fairs have been organized with a total of about 800 million
Dollars worth of business negotiated and contracted.
</P>
<P>
To speed up movement of transit traffic in the region, the
COMESA has introduced a regional road customs transit declaration
document to replace the 13 documents used in the past.
</P>
<P>
The simplified document has reduced costs, delays, pilferages
and breakages which previously added to the cost of intra-COMESA
trade.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the COMESA is striving to create a regional single
market and have a single currency by the year 2020. If the
timetable is not derailed, there could be free movement of goods,
services, labor and capital within the region.

<HEADLINE> European Shares up on Stronger Dollar, Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
continued their recent recovery and all closed sharply higher
Wednesday, supported by Wall Street's advances and a stronger
dollar.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market closed comfortably firmer
on the back of the Dow's advances for the past three sessions
although the FTSE 100 index failed to regain the 4,300 level,
ending 23.0 points higher at 4,292.3.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that stronger international bond markets boosted
market sentiment, while latest US industrial production data gave
hopes for a subdued inflationary outlook.
</P>
<P>
However, it was believed that uncertainty over Britain's May 1
general election and worries about higher interest rates to curb
inflationary pressures would limit the market's near-term upside
potential.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market, which had suffered heavy losses last
week, also closed higher on the back of firmer bonds and dollar
strength, which is favorable for exports, with the DAX-30 index
29.7 points up at 3,359.46.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected the upward trend to continue in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Shares on the Paris bourse made the strongest gains among the
three major European markets, underpinned by French bonds,
although the CAC-40 index drifted off the day's high, ending up
38.55 points at 2,617.55, a rise of 1.49 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 23.0
points at 4,292.3. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed 29.7 points
higher at 3,359.46. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 38.55
points firmer at 2,617.55.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Suspends Reduction of Macedonia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED Nations, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided on Wednesday to suspend a reduction of the military
component of the U.N. Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council also welcomed
the redeployment of UNPREDEP already achieved in the light of the
situation in Albania, and encouraged the U.N. secretary-general to
continue further redeployment of UNPREDEP taking into
consideration the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last December, under the suggestion of former Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the council decided to reduce the
1050-member force to 750 by April 1. The reduction process began
in March.
</P>
<P>
But recent developments in Albania and the resulting situation
of lawlessness and banditry in certain parts of that country have
demonstrated that stability in the Balkan region remains extremely
fragile.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said that proceeding with the planned reduction during a
period when further regional instability continues to be a
possibility could put at risk the credibility of the international
community's first serious effort at preventive deployment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Kill Civilians Despite Non-violent </HEADLINE>

<P>
KAMPALA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA)
rebels killed an unspecified number of civilians Tuesday despite
their non-violence commitment three days ago, local English
newspaper "The Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The atrocities occurred about 48 kilometers north of Northern
Gulu town, a witness told the paper. "By the time I left, the
number of dead civilians were not yet established," he said.
</P>
<P>
A local teacher said he heard heavy shellings yesterday from
the direction of the scene. But there was no official
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels are Christian fundamentalists who have vowed to
topple President Y. Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred just three days after James Obitas, the
LRA secretary for external relations and mass mobilization,
announced they would stop abducting civilians and other violences
against civilians.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Peter Odok Ochen, the new resident
district commissioner of Gulu, asked the government to absorb the
captured LRA members into the Ugandan army, according to local
English weekly "People" today.
</P>
<P>
The surrendered ones will join the government troops in
fighting against rebels and this would create an atmosphere of
confidence and belonging to the government side, the official
told Specicza Wandira Kazibwe, the inspecting vice-president.
